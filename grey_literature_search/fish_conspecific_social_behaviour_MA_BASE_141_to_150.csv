"RCVY9ECK","thesis","2015","Scarlet, Maria Perpétua Janeiro","Biomarkers for assessing benthic pollution impacts in a subtropical estuary, Mozambique","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/2077/38657","This thesis focuses on the marine environment in a subtropical estuary and particularly on exploring a suite of easy-to-use, cost effective and environmentally valid biological response tools (biomarkers). The main driving force of the thesis is the knowledge of the numerous anthropogenic impacts. Today, only scarce information is available in the Espírito Santo Estuary (ESE) in southern Mozambique on the effects of pollutants. Links between behavioural disruption and neurological dysfunction, such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition has been shown to be the most responsive biochemical biomarker at sites influenced by agricultural, urban and industrial activities. In Paper I, the enzymatic inhibition of AChE and butyrylcholineesterase (BChE) was measured in tissues (brain, liver and hepatopancreas) from barred mudskipper fish (Periophthalmus argentilineatus), Jarbua fish (Terapon jarbua), Indian white prawn (Penaeus indicus) and the clam Meretrix meretrix. In general, all species showed a significant decrease in the enzymatic activities. For M. meretrix the inhibition of BChE was most evident. In water of the Infulene River, tributary of ESE, 12 pesticides were found. Besides the contaminants having a direct effect on burrowing behaviour, they also cause a sublethal physiological stress, reducing metabolic activity, growth rate and reproduction. In Paper II, integrated physiological assays were applied by using the scope for growth (SFG) method and condition index (CI) as tools for assessing the metabolic state in M. meretrix from the ESE and Incomati estuary (which is used as a comparison site). Low values of SFG (<5 J h−1 g−1), as well as the low CI (that ranged from 0.80 ± 0.02 to 1.62 ± 0.10) in both investigated areas show symptoms of stress and impact of pollution as reflected in the clam M. meretrix. These results also show that SFG can be used as a tool to compare bioenergetic responses of clams to impacts of various environmental pollutants. Locomotion is the most studied behaviour because it ...","2015","2024-03-01 05:51:39","2024-03-01 05:51:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","","","acethylcholinesterase; benthic fauna; biological hierarcial biomarkers; burrowing response; contaminants; scope for growth; southern Mozambique; subtrophical estuary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"3C65V7Y8","thesis","2008","Zhou, Ningsun","COMPARISON OF MICRODIALYSIS WITH SOLID-PHASE MICROEXTRACTION FOR IN VIVO STUDY","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/10012/3648","Although microdialysis (MD) and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) are widely used sampling techniques, a comparison study has not been performed to date. The goal of the research presented was not only to address this issue but also to develop new analytical methods that were more suitable for in vivo study using MD and SPME. A new calibration method called kinetic microdialysis was developed for in vivo sampling. Two MD probes with different flow rates were simultaneously inserted into the symmetric parts of sampling system. A simple empirical equation was proposed to calculate the analyte concentrations in the sample matrix using two different dialysate concentrations. Several factors that influenced the correction factor in this equation were discussed. An excellent correlation was observed between the calculated and theoretical value. This method was subsequently applied for in vivo sampling, for the measurement of pesticide allocation in the different leaves of a jade plant (Crassula ovata). Compared to the other reported MD calibration methods, this novel approach offers several advantages including simplicity, speed, robustness, and increased accuracy. The on-fiber standardization technique for solid-coated SPME was studied and a theoretical model is proposed for the isotropic behavior of adsorption and desorption, based on Fick’s law of diffusion and the Langmuir model. The isotropy of the adsorption and desorption of analytes onto and from the surface of porous solid SPME fiber was validated with the use of a commercially available fiber, a 50 um carbowax/templated resin (CW/TPR) for carbamate pesticide analysis in various in vitro sample matrices. Time constants were comparable for the adsorption and desorption processes. Equilibrium constants and fiber capacities were calculated with the Langmuir Isotherm Model. A kinetic method was developed to calibrate adsorption using desorption. This calibration corrected for the sample matrix effects and minimized displacement effects as a pre-equilibrium extraction. The technique was successfully applied to the analysis of pesticides in river water and white wine. This developed method could be potentially applied for in vivo study. A new kinetic calibration was developed using dominant pre-equilibrium desorption by SPME. The calibration was based on isotropism between absorption and desorption, which was proved theoretically and experimentally in an aqueous solution and semi-solid matrix. This approach allows for the calibration of absorption using desorption to compensate for matrix effects. Moreover, concentration profiles are initially proposed to verify isotropism between the absorption and desorption, while providing a linear approach to obtain time constants for the purpose of quantitative analysis. This linear approach is more convenient, robust and accurate than the non-linear version with the previously used time profiles. Furthermore, the target analytes are used as the internal standards, thus radioactive or deuterated internal standards are not necessary. In addition, dominant pre-equilibrium desorption utilizes the pre-equilibrium approach and offers a shorter sample preparation time, which is typically suitable for in vivo sampling. This kinetic calibration method was successfully applied to prepare samples of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a flow-through system and in vivo pesticide sampling in a jade plant (Crassula ovata). Previous field studies utilizing SPME predominantly focused on volatile compounds in air or water. Earlier in vivo sampling studies utilizing SPME were limited to liquid matrices, namely blood. In this study, SPME was developed for in vivo laboratory and field sampling of pharmaceuticals in fish muscle. Pre-equilibrium extraction was used to shorten in vivo sampling time. The use of pre-equilibrium desorption rates are proposed as a means to calibrate pre-equilibrium extractions. Excellent linearity was found between the free concentrations determined by SPME from the muscle of living fish and the waterborne concentrations of several pharmaceuticals. It is also firstly proposed a simple SPME method to determine free and total concentrations simultaneously in a living tissue using the known protein binding value. The utility of in vivo SPME sampling under field conditions was evaluated in wild fish collected from a number of different river locations under varying degrees of influence from municipal wastewater effluents. Diphenhydramine and diltiazem were detected in the muscle of fish downstream of a local wastewater treatment plant. Based on this study, SPME technique has demonstrated several important advantages for laboratory and field in vivo sampling. The development of a rapid, robust, easy to deploy technique which combines sampling, extraction and concentration into one step is a potentially important tool for use in vivo field-based sampling. MD and SPME methods have been developed and compared through in vitro and in vivo study. For in vitro study (juice, milk and orange jelly), both methods offered accurate and precise results (recovery: 88-105% with RSD < 15%) for complex sample matrices by standard addition method. The limits of quantification (LOQs) of the two methods developed were below the tolerance levels in milk set by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Compared to MD, the fully automated SPME procedure offered several advantages including high-throughput and more efficient sampling, less labor intensity, and capability for batch analysis. For in vivo study, kinetic calibrations were performed using retrodialysis and in-fiber standardization techniques for MD and SPME, respectively. Quantitative analysis was performed to measure pesticide concentrations in living tissue, i.e., the leaves of a living jade plant (Crassula ovata). Although both techniques provided sampling with minimal perturbation to the system under study, SPME was more sensitive, precise and accurate, suitable for field sampling and had a wider application than MD. It demonstrated that SPME has the potential to replace MD for in vivo study.","2008","2024-03-01 05:51:39","2024-03-01 05:51:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Chemistry; IN VIVO STUDY; MICRODIALYSIS; SOLID-PHASE MICROEXTRACTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"CPDQZVY2","thesis","1989","THES","Conservation on farms: Conflicting attitudes, social pressures and behaviour","","","","","https://oro.open.ac.uk/57040/","In the late 1970s and early 1980s, conservationists' concern about the loss of wildlife habitat on farmland escalated into open conflict with farmers, the conflict being heightened by controversy surrounding the passing of the Wildlife and Countryside Act in 1981. An improved understanding of the attitudes of farmers and conservationists would help ensure the most appropriate measures are adopted to resolve or avoid such conflict. This research therefore compared the attitudes of farmers and conservationists in Bedfordshire in two pairs of surveys. In the first, free-ranging interviews were used to establish the range of opinions on farming and conservation held by the two groups. In the second, Fishbein and Ajzen's theory of reasoned action was used as the framework for a more detailed comparison of the differences in attitudes between the two communities. The correlation of attitudes and social pressures with farmers' behaviour was also explored for three conservation-related activities about which there was conflict: hedge management, pesticide use and straw disposal. The first survey revealed a complex matrix of shared, complementary and conflicting beliefs and values between and within the two communities. Examples of conflicting values included those concerning land ownership and freedom of individual action versus stewardship, and pride in an efficient, productive and tidy farm versus a wilder countryside. The second survey showed that while farmers agreed with conservationists about the advantages of conservation expressed in general terms, once decisions about specific farm practices were involved, attitudes to conservation and wildlife were far outweighed by attitudes to farming and business considerations. Social pressures on farmers from conservationists were minimal; the strongest social pressures came from within the farming community itself and these generally served to perpetuate the dominant farming values. Although the theory of reasoned action provided a valuable means of exploring the role of ...","1989","2024-03-01 05:51:40","2024-03-01 05:51:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies evaluating the effects of sublethal concentrations of pesticide mixtures are limited, especially in coastal systems [1]. The purpose of this dissertation research was to investigate both lethal and sublethal effects of realistic pesticide exposure scenarios on two life-stages (juvenile and adult) of an important invertebrate estuarine predator, prey, and fishery species, the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). Importantly, blue crab populations are declining throughout the U.S., but the potential role of pesticides in declines remains largely unexplored. In a series of laboratory experiments, I investigated: (1) lethal and sublethal effects of a single exposure to carbaryl (carbamate), malathion (organophosphate) and resmethrin (pyrethroid) + PBO (synergist), individually and in mixtures, on juvenile and adult blue crab survival and neuromuscular functioning by measuring changes in mortality, righting time (RT), and eyestalk reflexes. These responses serve as a proxy for the direct effects of exposure on survival and indirect effects on coordinated behaviors critical to blue crab survival (e.g., predator escape or foraging). Pesticides were selected because they are three of the mostly commonly used throughout the U.S. and have different modes of action. Effects observed at the organismal level were subsequently evaluated and linked with changes in (2) predator-prey interactions (mesocosms), and (3) physiological responses (enzyme assays). Lastly, (4) differences in susceptibility between juvenile (post-planktonic) and adult life-stages were also evaluated in behavioral and predator-prey ...","2017","2024-03-01 05:51:40","2024-03-01 05:51:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","","","","","","","","","","","Carbaryl; Estuarine; Invertebrate; malathion; PBO; Resmethrin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diuron, a chlorinated phenylurea herbicide and its primary metabolite, 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) exert toxic effects on non-target organisms. Growth, survival, and reproduction are the primary factors determining an organism's population structure in its habitat. Javanese medaka (Oryzias javanicus) is an emerging euryhaline model fish distributed around the coastal and estuarine regions of Peninsular Malaysia and other parts of Southeast Asia. The fish is a sentinel species that bioindicates ecosystem health. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acute toxicity of diuron and 3,4-DCA on different life stages of Javanese medaka, to determine the effect of diuron and 3,4-DCA on the fecundity and reproductive biomarkers of Javanese medaka, and to evaluate the embryotoxicity of diuron and 3,4-DCA on Javanese medaka. Larvae, juveniles, and adults of Javanese medaka were exposed to diuron and 3,4-DCA for 96 hours to determine mortality (96 hour-LC50; 50% lethal concentration to exposed organisms) and behavioural toxicity symptoms. Fish embryo toxicity (FET) test; mortality (LC50) at 10-days and 96-hour for diuron and 3,4-DCA, and subchronic embryonic toxicity (20 days) for both diuron and 3,4-DCA were also evaluated. Reproductively active adults were used for a 21-day diuron and 3,4-DCA fish short-term reproductive assay (FSTRA). All the bioassays were conducted in a semi-static method. The LC50 of diuron and 3,4-DCA for embryo were; 632.5 mg/L (95% CI = 622.6 645, R2 = 0.98, 10 days) and 32.87 mg/L (95% CI = 27.90 - 38.74, R2 = 0.95, 96-hours), respectively. No behavioural toxicity symptoms were observed in both diuron and 3,4- DCA exposed individuals. The curve fit models (concentration-mortality) indicate a low concentration-dependent increase in the mortality rate for diuron and 3,4-DCA exposed adults. The LC50 trend was; larvae > juveniles > adults for both diuron and 3,4-DCA.

We observed increased toxicity of the (+) enantiomer in larval fathead minnows exposed to the fipronil racemate and each enantiomer seven days. Juvenile fathead minnows were exposed to fipronil-contaminated sediment. We found that fish rapidly bioaccumulated fipronil and transformed it to fipronil sulfone. Fish preferentially transformed the (-) enantiomer, resulting in an increased proportion of the (+) enantiomer in fish tissues.

Global climate change, urbanization, habitat fragmentation, and pollutants are all contributing to rapid and extensive environmental change and posing significant challenges to many species. An anthropogenic impact of growing concern is exposure to a class of contaminants known as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). EDCs are natural or synthetic compounds that interfere in some way with endogenous hormones responsible for maintaining and regulating myriad phenotypic traits. These contaminants enter aquatic environments through agricultural runoff, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and sewage overflow. They have been shown to alter morphology, physiology, and behavior in exposed organisms. Mangrove ecosystems are often retrofitted with WWTPs due to their natural ability to cycle nutrients; however, little is known of how EDC exposure impacts the organisms that inhabit mangroves. The mangrove rivulus fish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, is a mangrove specialist and a suitable organism in which to study the effects of EDC exposure. Here, I use environmentally relevant concentrations of two prevalent EDCs - ethinyl estradiol, the main synthetic estrogen in contraceptive, and nonylphenol, a widespread compound used in plastics and pesticides - to assess how exposure can alter morphology, physiology, and behavior in juvenile and adult mangrove rivulus, in compound-, dose-, and route-specific ways. I also measure the extent to which exposure alters phenotypic variance-covariance structure, which can inform us about how EDCs trigger coordinated changes in many phenotypic traits, and allows us to better assess how anthropogenic activities might induce opportunities for natural selection to act and drive evolutionary change.","2018","2024-03-01 05:51:40","2024-03-01 05:51:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Alabama Libraries","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Biology; Ecology; Toxicology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TM has been detected in surface waters at levels above aquatic life benchmarks and has raised concerns about its potential toxicity to fish. To address these concerns, the effects of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TM were determined in two fish species. Acute and chronic exposures to 0.02-163 μg TM/L were conducted in embryonic- and larval-stage fathead minnows and in embryonic-stage zebrafish. Endpoints to assess health and neurotoxicity were monitored throughout the duration of the exposure, including survival, hatching, foraging efficiency, embryonic motor activity, and predator escape behavior. TM-exposed fathead minnows experienced reductions in survival, changes to embryonic motor activity, and altered predator escape behavior while TM-exposed zebrafish embryos experienced reduced hatching rates and changes to the predator escape behavior. Lastly, molecular modeling was used to gain preliminary insight on the interactions of TM with the nAChR between organisms. While TM does not target fish, they still experience effects as a result of TM exposure. Taken together, this research indicates that further investigation of the effects of TM on fish is necessary to determine the impacts of this prevalent pesticide on the health of aquatic ecosystems.","2021","2024-03-01 05:51:40","2024-03-01 05:51:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","","","","","","","","","","","Biology; Pesticides; Toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
