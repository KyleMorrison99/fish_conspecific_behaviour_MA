Comúnmente el NP termina descargándose en aguas residuales, que mediante estudios se ha logrado demostrar la poca efectividad en su eliminación por medio de tratamientos hídricos convencionales y, además, genera bioacumulación y biomagnificación en organismos acuáticos. A nivel global el nonilfenol ha sido restringido y prohibido debido a que se ha catalogado como un disruptor endocrino de la hormona natural 17β-estradiol. En Colombia no se cuenta con políticas reguladoras para el uso de nonilfenol, es por esto que se hace importante buscar alternativas para mitigar la contaminación por el uso indiscriminado de esta sustancia. En este proyecto de tipo experimental se pretende evaluar la capacidad degradativa de la cepa de Pseudomonas aeruginosa frente a varias concentraciones de nonilfenol a través de bioensayos de biodegradación y uso de técnicas como Espectrofotometría Uv-Vis y cromatografía de gases acoplado a espectrometría de masas (GC MS) ; Among the most widely used surfactants in the industry we find nonylphenol (NP), which due to its nature has the ability to be between an apolar phase and a polar phase, thanks to this it stands out in highly foaming products such as soaps, detergents, among others. everyday items. Commonly, NP ends up being discharged into wastewater, which studies show little effectiveness in its elimination through conventional water treatments and, in addition, it generates bioaccumulation and biomagnification in aquatic organisms. At a global level, nonylphenol has been restricted and banned because it has been classified as an endocrine disruptor of the natural hormone 17β-estradiol. In Colombia there are no regulatory policies for the use of nonylphenol, which is why ...","2023","2024-03-01 05:57:27","2024-03-01 05:57:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad de San Buenaventura ; Cartagena ; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud ; Bacteriología","","spa","","","","","","","","","","","610 - Medicina y salud::615 - Farmacología y terapéutica; Bioaccumulation; Bioacumulación; Bioassays; Biodegradación; Biodegradation; Bioensayos; Biomagnificación; Biomagnification; Disruptor endocrino; Endocrine disruptor; Nonilfenol; Nonylphenol; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Tesis - bacteriología","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cyfluthrin effects were not observed on mesocosm bluegill; a slight decrease in growth was observed in the microcosm bluegill. Otolith weight to length relationships between bluegill size-classes from microcosms, local streams, and a fish hatchery revealed no differences. Our results indicated bluegill predation impacts were slight on benthic invertebrates. Extensive predation on emerging insects was observed. Microcosm bluegill impacts on zooplankton populations followed expected predation effects, resulting in larger populations of smaller taxa. Bluegill functioned as ""keystone"" predators for microcosm taxa and improved taxa richness for benthic colonizing invertebrates and zooplankton.","1991","2024-03-01 05:57:27","2024-03-01 05:57:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of North Texas","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Bluegill -- Behavior; Bluegill -- Effect of insecticides on; bluegill sunfish; cyfluthrin; ecology; pesticide effects; Pyrethroids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is needed to have a simple and accurate method for its determination. This study coupled with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for analysis of nonylphenol in water. The headspace extraction with 50/30 µm divinylbenzene-carboxen-polydimethylsiloxane fiber of SPME first and followed by analysis of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was conducted. After salting and pH adjustment, the effects due to the parameters of concentration of nonylphenol, temperature, stirring rate, equilibrium time and extraction time were observed upon the experimental design of Taguchi approach. Thus, the optimum conditions were suggested. The results show that the amount of nonylphenol collected on the selected fiber was correlated with the concentration of nonylphenol, temperature, stirring rate, equilibrium time and extraction time. The two predominant contributors to variation were the concentration of nonylphenol (37.52%) and temperature (24.24%). The proposed optimum conditions were 5 minutes for equilibrium , 30 minutes for extraction at 65℃ and stirring at 600 rpm. Upon this optimum conditions, the method detection limit was 6.75 µg/L when it was applied on a field sample from Danshui River. ; 摘要 I ...","2006","2024-03-01 05:57:27","2024-03-01 05:57:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","zh-TW ; en_US","","","","","","","","","","","Divinylbenzene-Carboxen-Polydimethylsiloxane; nonylphenol; solid-phase microextraction; 固相微萃取; 壬基苯酚","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using sequential sampling plans can help agriculturist to judge the damage of target pest and to decide whether control is needed.
