T1  - Anthropogenic Impacts on Freshwater Organisms: Bioassessments from the Molecular to Community Levels
AN  - 2637143507
AB  - This dissertation explores subcellular, organismal and community level effects induced by pesticides of concern in agricultural surface water, and evaluates the use of molecular methods; i.e., environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, in watershed-wide, multitrophic assessments of freshwater biodiversity. I sought to characterize the impacts of chemical disturbance events occurring at multiple levels of biological organization in anthropogenically impacted freshwater ecosystems.I first evaluated the lethality and sublethal effects of two pesticides: imidacloprid (IMI) and chlorantraniliprole (CHL), as single compounds and binary mixtures, on invertebrates (Daphnia magna) and fish (Pimephales promelas). To explore the effects of complex mixtures, I also conducted exposures as described above on contaminated surface water samples collected near agricultural fields associated with the Salinas River Watershed CA (USA). Analytical chemistry data from surface water samples showed chemicals of emerging concern as common analytes at levels expected to cause detrimental effects on aquatic life. I measured acute toxicity in invertebrates exposed to field-collected surface water, and fish exposed to these water samples had significant changes in expression of genes (RT-qPCR) involved with detoxification and neuromuscular function. Exposure of fish to single compounds or binary mixtures of IMI and CHL led to increased relative gene expression of ryanodine receptors (RyR) in fish. Furthermore, IMI targeted the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in aquatic invertebrates and CHL caused overactivation of RyR in invertebrates and fish. Overall, high levels of invertebrate toxicity and impacts to neuromuscular health in fish are occurring, and pesticides of emerging concern result in detrimental effects in both invertebrates and fish.Based on these findings, I examined behavioral endpoints in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) after the surface water exposures outlined above. I detected differences in both light-induced startle responses and average total distance moved (mm/s), as well as the duration and/or frequency of cruising, bursting and freezing endpoints. These behaviors directly relate to factors influencing survival, feeding and growth, as well as potential for predator avoidance, and thus changes induced by chemical exposure contribute to ecological risk. I detected sublethal and environmentally relevant effects from exposure to contaminated surface waters, which would likely be missed in standard toxicology assessments based on mortality, illustrating the importance of incorporating sublethal endpoints in risk assessments. I then examined behavioral effects of exposure to contaminated surface water before and after a disturbance event (a “first flush” rainstorm at the end of a dry period). I postulated that the swimming behavior of D. magna would be a sensitive bioindicator of exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides of concern (IMI and CHL) under laboratory conditions as well as within complex mixtures in contaminated surface waters. I determined that average total distance moved is a sensitive endpoint for pesticide exposure. Daphnia magna response to light stimulus was the most sensitive endpoint measured. In exposures conducted before the first flush event, I detected strong dose-response patterns, with exposed organisms showing a significantly reduced response compared to controls. After first flush, I measured hypoactivity for all sites. I detected different response patterns to light stimulus for each site tested: negative dose-response, non-monotonic, and positive dose-response patterns, with significantly different responses from controls at all concentrations tested.Having determined sublethal and toxic effects from organismal exposure to water samples collected from the Salinas River Watershed, I sought to evaluate how aquatic biodiversity may be distributed across a chemically impacted watershed, and how diversity estimates obtained from both eDNA metabarcoding and morphological identification would correlate with biotic index scores. I collected eDNA from sediment at sites throughout the Salinas River Watershed, across a range of habitat qualities, and compared the resulting taxonomy with morphological data from a subset of high-diversity sites. I detected sensitive invertebrate taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera; EPT) from morphology and eDNA, with significant overlap (> 76.67%) between methods, but some taxa were missing from the sequence database, highlighting the importance of taxonomic database development. Sequencing detected more benthic macroinvertebrate taxa than morphology when compared at the genus and species levels of taxonomic resolution. Metabarcoding of sampled eDNA detected rare species of concern and invasive species. Impacted sites contained greater numbers of species known to be tolerant to poor water quality, whereas I only detected several sensitive EPT taxa from least impacted reference sites. Hydrologic distance (waterbody) and biotic index score both accounted for > 27% of the dissimilarity in taxa measured between sites. These findings suggest that biotic indices obtained from eDNA metabarcoding data can be effectively incorporated into watershed-wide, multitrophic assessments of freshwater biodiversity.Freshwater ecosystems in urban and agriculturally developed watersheds are simultaneously exposed to chemical mixtures often include new and emerging contaminants of concern, for which toxicological data may be limited. As the complexity of mixtures increases, non-targeted, effect-based evaluations become necessary for determining potential detrimental outcomes. Through my dissertation work I demonstrate that subcellular, organismal and community level effects are induced by pesticides of concern present in surface water.

T1  - The Evolutionary and Ecological Effects of Road Deicing Salt
AN  - 2501299068
AB  - Organisms around the world are exposed to a variety of anthropogenic stressors. One stressor is the salinization of fresh water from road deicing salt. Huge increases in road salt application over the decades have increased the salinity of typically low-salt ecosystems. Studies have investigated the effects of road salt at the organismal and community level, however many focus on single organism lethality or single stressors. Many questions remain including those about evolved tolerance and subsequent trade-offs, road salt alternatives, invasive species, and the interaction of multiple stressors. The goal of my dissertation was to investigate the evolutionary and ecological effects of road salt.First, I investigated whether organisms can adapt to road salt. Zooplankton species in the genus Daphnia can adapt to other chemicals including pesticides, heavy metals, and brackish water (from seawater intrusion). Therefore, I hypothesized that Daphnia pulex populations exposed to road salt evolve increased salt tolerance. To test this, D. pulex were exposed to a no-salt control (15 mg Cl-/L). and sodium chloride (NaCl) road salt (100 - 1000 mg Cl-/L) for 2.5 months in outdoor mesocosms. After this exposure and a period of indoor husbandry, I exposed D. pulex to a no-salt control (30 mg Cl-/L) and high salinities (1300 - 1900 mg Cl-/L) in a time-to-death assay. I found that D. pulex populations evolve increased salt tolerance. Since Daphnia consume phytoplankton and are a food resource for many fish species, evolved tolerance might be vital for road salt contaminated communities.Second, I investigated the consequences of evolved salt tolerance. Contaminant exposure, including salt, results in a variety of genetic and physiological consequences. Some contaminants can even disrupt the circadian rhythm. Therefore, I hypothesized that the evolution of road salt tolerance alters the circadian rhythm, as well as other important genes. Using salt-tolerant D. pulex produced in the previous experiment, I completed qRT-PCR on samples from a 24- and 48- hr time course. I found that the control population exhibited a ~20-hr rhythm in period, a core clock gene. D. pulex populations previously exposed to moderate concentrations of NaCl were similar to the control, while high salt populations exhibited an ablated rhythm. Additionally, moderate and high salt populations also exhibited increases in clock (a core clock gene), actin, and a subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump (involved in salt tolerance). Therefore, the evolution of salt tolerance comes with diverse genetic consequences. These trade-offs could affect a variety of bodily functions, as well as Daphnia’s ability to perform important daily activities.Third, I investigated the salt tolerance of an invasive mollusk, the Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea), which is found in a variety of habitats that vary in salinity. Since most freshwater organisms are more tolerant to NaCl than to other chloride-based alternatives, I hypothesized that Asian clams are more tolerant to NaCl road salt than to calcium chloride (CaCl2) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2). I also predicted Asian clams would be relatively tolerant to all salts given their tolerance to other stressors. I performed a 4-day and 8-day LC50 experiment using the three different road salts. I found that Asian clams were extremely tolerant to NaCl road salt with an estimated LC504-day > 22,581 mg Cl-/L. The estimated LC504-day for MgCl2 and CaCl2 were significantly lower, but still high at 2162 and 3554 mg Cl-/L, respectively. After 8 days, the estimated LC50’s for NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 were 10,069, 2235, and 1769 mg Cl-/L, respectively. The high salt tolerance of Asian clams allows them to be easily transported in ballast water and to invade a variety of saline habitats. Additionally, they will be more resistant to road salt contamination, which might allow them to outcompete native species.Lastly, I investigated the interactive effects of invasive bivalves and CaCl2 road salt on native freshwater communities. CaCl2 road salt can enter fresh water where it might serve as a source of calcium. The calcium concentrations of a water body can determine the success of invasive bivalves and their impacts on freshwater communities. I hypothesized that invasive bivalves, in the absence of increased CaCl2, remove phytoplankton via filtration and reduce zooplankton and native clams via competition; but they increase benthic algae via excretion. I also hypothesized low to moderate concentrations of CaCl2 benefit native mollusks and result in few negative consequences to the community. Lastly, I hypothesized that CaCl2 increases invasive bivalve biomass and density, which results in a greater negative impact on native communities from invasive bivalves. To investigate these hypotheses, I conducted an outdoor mesocosm study with invasive Asian clams and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), as well as native organisms, all exposed to CaCl2 (35 - 187 mg Ca2+/L). I found that invasive bivalves decreased phytoplankton, periphyton, zooplankton, and native clams, but increased filamentous algae and isopods. Zebra mussel survived poorly across all CaCl2 concentrations, but 91 and 187 mg Ca2+/L substantially reduced Asian clam survival. The reduction in survival, in turn, reduced impacts of Asian clams on other species in the community. The highest CaCl2 treatment also reduced zooplankton densities. Therefore, CaCl2 did not promote invasive species and more research is needed to understand the substantial differences in tolerance of Asian clams in lab versus mesocosm experiments.Overall, this thesis goes beyond the traditional single-organism, naïve-tolerance toxicity tests to enhance the road salt literature about what might be occurring in our freshwater ecosystems. The evolution of salt tolerance might mitigate some of the effects of salinization, however it may come with unfavorable consequences to important genes that influence a variety of daily functions and behaviors. It remains unknown whether organisms can evolve tolerance to NaCl alternatives and, if so, if there are any associated consequences. It is always the hope that alternatives to common chemicals will improve not only the lives of humans, but also the health of the environment. Thus far, however, chloride-based NaCl road salt alternatives have not shown to be safer for the environment. While some of these alternatives come with vital nutrients, their toxicities exceed the toxicity of NaCl. For invasive species, it is reassuring that road salt alternatives with vital ions might not facilitate their invasions. However, for native species, it means that chloride-based alternatives will not diminish the threat of freshwater salinization but rather, alternatives might increase the consequences. While much more research is needed on freshwater salinization from road salt, these studies open up new avenues of research that will ultimately help preserve fresh water.

T1  - The Effects of Temperature, Salinity, and Bifenthrin on the Behavior and Neuroendocrinology of Juvenile Salmon and Trout
AN  - 2309795222
AB  - The San Francisco Bay-Delta in California has been experiencing increasing surface water temperatures, salt water intrusion, and intense runoff events that wash pyrethroids into waterways. Salmonid populations in the Bay-Delta have been declining, including the endangered Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Previous studies suggest that estrogenic compounds can inhibit smoltification, and the pyrethroid pesticide bifenthrin has been shown to have estrogenic effects. Thus, the objective of my research was to investigate the effects of bifenthrin and climate change stressors on the neuroendocrine response of juvenile salmonids. Trout alevin and fry were exposed to 11°C, 16.4°C and 19°C temperatures and then immediately challenged to sea water (SW) for 24 hours. Trout parr were slowly acclimated to SW and simultaneously exposed to the same temperature regime. Estradiol-17β, cortisol, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine hormone levels were measured in blood serum or whole animal homogenates using ELISAs. Brain growth hormone 1, brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2, and gill Na+/K+ ATPase mRNA levels were measured using qPCR. Alevin were more sensitive to salinity than temperature, and fry were more susceptible to increasing temperatures, thus demonstrating stage-dependent responses to climate change stressors. To evaluate the combined effects of bifenthrin and temperature, Chinook alevin, fry, and parr were exposed to the same temperature stressors for 10 days (alevin) or 14 days (fry and parr) and, in the final 96 hours of rearing, fish were exposed to 0, 0.15, or 1.5µg/L bifenthrin. The same endpoints were measured as in the trout, with the addition of quantifying testosterone levels, the expression of brain dopamine receptor 2α, and measuring brain dopamine levels. In addition, a predator avoidance Y-Maze behavioral assay was conducted on parr. Bifenthrin significantly impacted olfactory-mediated predator avoidance behaviors in parr. These results suggest that temperature may be impacting endocrine pathways differently at each juvenile stage because of the developmental timing of neuroendocrine signaling pathways. Together, these studies provide insight to how multiple stressors and sublethal pesticide exposure may have population-level impacts on Bay-Delta salmonid populations.

T1  - Modulation of Mitochondrial Function as an Indicator for Sublethal Effects of Contaminants of Emerging Concern
AN  - 1939091599
AB  - Effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are a primary source of a wide range of structurally-diverse compounds into Puget Sound, WA. These contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) include personal care products and pharmaceuticals (PPCPs), perfluorinated compounds, natural and synthetic hormones, alkylphenol and alkylphenol ethoxylate surfactants, current-use pesticides, and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants. Currently, the types and concentrations of these emerging contaminants entering Puget Sound, and their effects on aquatic receptors, are poorly understood. Recent reports in numerous species of fish indicate exposure to CECs can cause sublethal, detrimental effects on growth, reproduction, and behavior, warranting development of biomarkers of exposure and effect of CECs in relevant biomonitoring species. There is evidence to suggest that numerous CECs negatively affect mitochondrial function in humans and laboratory animal models. Hence, the overarching hypothesis of my doctoral research was that mitochondrial dysfunction can serve as an indicator of sublethal effect, and exposure to, emerging contaminants.    Both human health- and aquatic health-related effects of CECs on mitochondrial function were addressed in my dissertation project. Aim 1 of my project was an oceans and human health study concerning the safety of salmon consumption by humans. The tested hypothesis was that the antioxidant effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in salmon chemoprotect against mitochondrial and oxidative injury from a common “emerged” contaminant detected in Pacific salmon, the PBDE flame retardant 2,2’,4,4’-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 47). HepG2 cells were treated for 12 h with a mixture of omega-3s relevant to salmon consumption (oxEPA/oxDHA), followed by exposure to BDE 47 (100 μM) for 24 h. Pretreatment with oxEPA/oxDHA prevented BDE 47-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of GSH, significantly increased expression of protective cellular antioxidant response genes, and protected against BDE 47-induced loss of viability and mitochondrial membrane potential. Analysis of mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) revealed extensive inhibition of state 3 respiration and maximum respiratory capacity by BDE 47 were partially reversed by treatment with oxEPA/oxDHA. These findings indicated that the antioxidant effects of salmon omega-3s protected against short exposures to BDE 47, including a protective role of these compounds on maintaining cellular and mitochondrial function.    The subsequent goal of my research was to examine the potential impacts of CECs in Puget Sound aquatic organisms. Thus, studies in Aim 2 involved an analytical field study to determine the specific types of CECs present in Puget Sound, and their potential to bioaccumulate in representative biomonitoring species. Samples of estuary water, WWTP effluent, and whole-bodies of Chinook salmon and staghorn sculpin were collected from three sites: two estuaries that receive effluent from WWTPs and a minimally-polluted estuarine reference site. Samples were analyzed for 150 chemical analytes by HPLC/MS/MS. In total, 81 analytes were detected in effluent samples in the ng/L to low µg/L range, 25 analytes were detected in estuary water samples at ng/L concentrations, and 42 analytes were detected in fish whole-bodies at ng/g concentrations. Noteworthy findings included high concentrations of CECs measured in WWTP effluent relative to other major U.S. WWTPs, greater-than-expected contamination of the reference site, and preferential bioaccumulation of CECs in Chinook salmon relative to sculpin. These results can inform environmental risk assessment or ecological studies at other sites in Puget Sound.    The analytical field study provided crucial data that was required to conduct subsequent experiments in Aim 3 that investigated the association between exposure to CECs and liver mitochondrial dysfunction in fish. Mitochondrial function was assessed in feral juvenile Chinook from the analytical field study, and in hatchery-reared juvenile Chinook exposed in the laboratory to a dietary mixture of CECs representative of the predominant contaminants detected in the field. Liver mitochondrial content was reduced in fish exposed to CECs in the laboratory, which occurred concomitantly with a reduction in expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ coactivator-1a (pgc-1α), a positive transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. The laboratory exposures also caused elevation of state 4 respiration per unit mitochondria, which drove a reduction of efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation relative to controls. The mixture-induced elevation of respiration was associated with increased oxidative injury as evidenced by increased mitochondrial protein carbonyls, elevated expression of glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 ( gpx4), a mitochondrial-associated GSH peroxidase that protects against lipid peroxidation, and reduction of mitochondrial GSH. Juvenile Chinook sampled in from a WWTP effluent-impacted estuary with demonstrated releases of CECs showed similar trends toward reduced liver mitochondrial content and elevated respiratory activity per mitochondria (including state 3 and uncoupled respiration).

T1  - The Role of Dopaminergic Systems in the Neurobehavioral Teratology of Organophosphates in Zebrafish
AN  - 1827752252
AB  - Background: Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are well-known developmental neurotoxicants that have been linked to abnormal cognitive and behavioral endpoints through both epidemiological studies and animal models of behavioral teratology, and are implicated in the dysfunction of multiple neurotransmitters, including dopamine. Chemical similarities between OP pesticides and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), a class of compounds growing in use and environmental relevance, have produced concern regarding whether developmental exposures to OPFRs and OP pesticides may share behavioral outcomes, impacts on dopaminergic systems, or both. Methods: Using the zebrafish animal model, we exposed developing fish to two OPFRs, TDCIPP and TPHP, as well as the OP pesticide chlorpyrifos, during the first 5 days following fertilization. From there, the exposed fish were assayed for behavioral abnormalities and effects on monoamine neurochemistry as both larvae and adults. An experiment conducted in parallel examined how antagonism of the dopamine system during an identical window of development could alter later life behavior in the same assays. Finally, we investigated the interaction between developmental exposure to an OPFR and acute dopamine antagonism in larval behavior. Results: Developmental exposure to all three OP compounds altered zebrafish behavior, with effects persisting into adulthood. Additionally, exposure to an OPFR decreased the behavioral response to acute D2 receptor antagonism in larvae. However, the pattern of behavioral effects diverged substantially from those seen following developmental dopamine antagonism, and the investigations into dopamine neurochemistry were too variable to be conclusive. Thus, although the results support the hypothesis that OPFRs, as with OP pesticides such as chlorpyrifos, may present a risk to normal behavioral development, we were unable to directly link these effects to any dopaminergic dysfunction.

T1  - Utilisation d'un poisson modèle, Fundulus heteroclitus , pour évaluer le potentiel embryotoxique des polluants organiques persistants accumulés par l'anguille d'Amérique (Anguilla rostrata) du lac Ontario de 1988 à 2008
TT  - Use of a Model Fish, <em>Fundulus heteroclitus</em>, to Assess the Embryotoxic Potential of Persistent Organic Pollutants Accumulated by American Eel (<em>Anguilla rostrata</em>) From Lake Ontario From 1988 to 2008
AN  - 1826357830
AB  - Recruitment of American eel (Anguilla rostrata) juveniles to Lake Ontario (LO), Canada, declined significantly since the 1980s. To investigate the possible contribution of maternally transferred persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to this decline, this study measured temporal variations in the toxicity of complex organic mixtures extracted from LO eels captured in 1988, 1998 and 2008 to Fundulus heteroclitus embryos exposed by intravitelline (IVi) injection. To identify the most toxic compounds accumulated by eels and to characterize their embryotoxic effects, F. heteroclitus embryos were exposed by IVi injection to sublethal doses of various POPs historically measured in LO fish tissues, including dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) (TCDD, PCB126, PCB77 and 2,3 ,4,7,8-PnCDF), non-dioxin-like (NDL) PCBs (PCB52 and PCB 110) and also to a complex mixture of PCBs, Aroclor 1254.All DLCs as weil as Aroelor 1254 caused craniofacial deformities, a dose-responsive reduction of larval growth and prey capture ability without alteration of basal locomotor activity, and induction of ethoxyresorutin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in F. heteroclitus larvae. None of these responses was induced by the two NDL PCBs. The dose-response relationships for EROD activity for PCB 126, 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF and TCDD had similar slopes and the relative potencies (RePs) of PCB126 and 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF to TCDD for EROD activity were estimated at 0.71 and 2.40, respectively. They were approximately and respectively 140- and 5-fold higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) TCDD equivalency factors (TEFs) of PCB126 and 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF for fish , which are based on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) embryolethality data. These results suggest that relative potencies are species-specific and that the current ReP for PCB126 and 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF underestimates their toxicity for some fish species.The slopes of the dose-response relationships for prey capture ability for PCB126 and 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF were steeper than for TCDD, suggesting different pathways of effects. Expression levels of several genes were also studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) following exposure to single doses of TCDD or PCB 126 (1280 and 1250 pg g-1 wet weight, respectively) causing similar EROD induction. A different pattern of responses was observed between PCB 126 and TCDD : PCB 126 appeared to induce antioxidant responses by inducing sod2 expression, while TCDD did not. It suggests that these two compounds act through different mechanisms to produce behavioral alterations in F. heteroclitus larvae, and that oxidative stress may be a key factor in the case of PCB 126.The 1988 and 1998 eel ex tracts were the most toxic, causing a pattern of sublethal embryotoxic responses similar to those reported in F. heteroclitus embryos exposed to previously cited DLCs or to Aroelor 1254 : stunted growth, craniofacial deformities, induction of EROD activity, and reduced predatory capacities of larvae. The potency of these extracts declined over time : the only significant effect of 2008 eel ex tracts was EROD induction. Other POPs measured in eel extracts (NDL PCBs, PBDEs and organochlorinated pesticides) did not appear to be important agonistic contributors to the observed toxicity. Due to the combination of its concentrations and its high ReP compared to TCDD in F. heteroclitus early life stages (ELS), PCB 126 was probably the most important contributor to the overall embryotoxicity observed with Aroelor 1254 or eel extracts. However, as observed with Aroelor 1254, the chemically derived TCDD-TEQs of eel extracts, calculated using measured concentrations of some DLCs and their RePs for F. heteroclitus ELS, overestimated their potency to induce EROD activity possibly due to interactions among POPs.The toxicity of the complex mixtures of POPs accumulated by LO eels may have been underestimated as a result of several factors, including the loss of POPs during ex tracts preparation and the non-assessment of their potential long-term effects. In addition to the interspecific differences in terms of sensitivity to TCDD documented in the literature, our results demonstrates that interspecific differences also exist for TEFs. Thus, there is uncertainty in the prediction of the toxicity of complex mixtures of DLCs to A. rostrata from data obtained with other species. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that contamination of LO with DLCs may have represented a threat for the American eel population through ecologically relevant effects such as altered larval prey capture ability. These results prioritize the need to assess ELS toxicity of DLCs in Anguilla species, to investigate long-term or delayed effects of complex eel ex tracts to ELS of fish and to further develop biomarkers to assess potential effects in eel ELS col1ected in the field.Alternate abstract:Le recrutement des juvéniles de l'anguille d'Amérique (Anguilla rostrata) vers le lac Ontario (LO), Canada, a décliné drastiquement depuis les années 1980. Afin d'explorer la contribution possible à ce déclin du transfert maternel des polluants organiques persistants (POP), la présente étude mesure les variations temporelles de la toxicité de mélanges organiques complexes extraits d'anguilles capturées dans le LO en 1988, 1998 et 2008, chez les embryons de Fundulus heteroclitus exposés par injection intravitelline (IVi). Afin d'identifier les composés les plus toxiques accumulés par les anguilles et de caractériser leurs effets embryotoxiques, des embryons de F. heteroclitus ont été exposés par injection IVi à des doses sous-létales de plusieurs POP historiquement mesurés dans les tissus des poissons du LO, incluant certains composés apparentés aux dioxines (TCDD, BPCI26, BPC77 et 2,3,4,7,8- PnCDF), des BPC non-coplanaires (BPC52 et BPCI10) ainsi qu'à un mélange technique de BPC, ]' Aroclor 1254. Tous les composés apparentés aux dioxines ainsi que l'Aroclor 1254 ont causé des malformations crânio-faciales, une réduction dose-dépendante de la croissance larvaire et de la capacité de prédation sans altération de l'activité locomotrice de base, ainsi qu'une induction de l'activité de l'ethoxyrésorufine-O-dééthylase (EROD) chez les larves de F. heteroclitus. Aucune de ces réponses n'a été observée avec les BPC non-coplanaires. Les relations doseréponse pour l'activité EROD pour la TCDD, le BPCl26 et le 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF avaient des pentes similaires et les potentiels toxiques relatifs (PTR) du BPC126 et du 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF par rapport à la TCDD ont été estimés à 0.71 et 2.40, respectivement. Ils étaient respectivement environ 140 et 5 fois supérieurs aux facteurs d'équivalence toxique (FET) de référence de l'Organisation Mondiale de la Santé (OMS) pour ces deux composés chez les poissons, qui sont basés sur des données d' embryo-mortalité obtenues chez la truite arc-en-ciel (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Ces résultats suggèrent que les PTR sont spécifiques à chaque espèce et que les FET actuels du BPC126 et du 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF pourraient sous-estimer leurs potentiels toxiques chez certaines espèces de poissons.  Les pentes des relations dose-réponse pour la capacité de prédation étaient plus prononcées pour le BPC126 et le 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF par rapport à la TCDD, suggérant différentes voies d'effets. Le niveau d'expression de plusieurs gènes a également été mesuré par réaction en chaîne par polymérase quantitative (qPCR) à la suite d'expositions à des doses uniques de TCDD ou de BPC126 (1280 et 1250 pg g-1 de poids humide, respectivement) causant un même niveau d'induction EROD. Un patron de réponses différent a été observé entre le BPCl26 et la TCDD : le BPC126 a semblé induire des réponses anti-oxydantes par l'intermédiaire du gène sod2, mais pas la TCDD. Cela suggère que ces deux composés agissent selon des mécanismes différents pour induire les altérations comportementales observées chez les larves de F. heteroclitus, et que le stress oxydant est un facteur clef dans le cas du BPCI26. Les extraits d'anguille de 1988 et 1998 ont été les plus toxiques, provoquant un patron de réponses embryotoxiques sous-létales similaire à celui observé chez des embryons de F. heteroclitus exposés aux composés apparentés aux dioxines précédemment cités ou à l'Aroclor 1254 : retard de croissance, malformations crânio-faciales, induction de l'activité EROD et réduction de la capacité de prédation des larves. Le potentiel toxique des extraits a décliné avec le temps: le seul effet significatif observé avec les extraits de 2008 était l'induction de l' activité EROD. Les autres POP mesurés dans les extraits d' anguilles (BPC non-coplanaires, PBDE et pesticides organochlorés) n' ont pas semblé être d'importants contributeurs à l'embryotoxicité observée. En raison de la combinaison de ses concentrations élevées et de son PTR élevé par rapport à la TCDD chez les jeunes stades de vie de F. heteroclitus, le BPC 126 était probablement le plus important contributeur à l'embryotoxicité observée avec l'Aroclor 1254 et les extraits d' anguille. Néanmoins, comme cela a pu être observé avec l'Aroclor 1254, les EQT-TCDD dérivés des données chimiques, calculés à partir des concentrations de certains composés apparentés aux dioxines dans les extraits et de leurs PTR respectifs chez F. heteroclitus, ont surestimé la capacité des extraits à induire l'activité EROD, possiblement en raison d'interactions entre les différents POP. La toxicité des mélanges organiques complexes de POP accumulés par les anguilles du LO a pu être sous-estimée en raison de plusieurs facteurs, incluant les pertes chimiques durant la préparation des extraits, ainsi que l'absence d'évaluation de leurs effets à long terme. En plus de différences interspécifiques en termes de sensibilité à la TCDD déjà documentées dans la littérature, nos résultats démontrent qu ' il existe des différences interspécifiques de FEI. Il existe donc une incertitude quant à la prédiction de la toxicitié d' un mélange complexe de composés apparentés aux dioxines chez A. rostrata à partir de données obtenues chez d' autres espèces. Dans l' ensemble, nos résultats supportent l'hypothèse selon laquell e la contamination du LO par les composés apparentés aux dioxines aurait représenté une menace pour la population de l'anguille d'Amérique en altérant des paramètres pertinents d' un point de vue environnemental, telle que la capacité de prédation des larves. Ces résultats soulignent l'importance de tester l'embryotoxicité des composés apparentés aux dioxines chez les jeunes stades de vie des différentes espèces d' anguilles, d' explorer les effets à long terme d' extraits organiques d'anguilles sur les jeunes stades de vie des poissons et de développer des biomarqueurs pour évaluer les altérations potentielles chez les jeunes anguilles collectées sur le terrain.

T1  - Impacts of Hypersaline Acclimation on Chlorpyrifos Toxicity to Salmonids
AN  - 1656489205
AB  - As part of their unique life cycle, most Pacific salmonids transition from freshwater to saltwater, requiring various adjustments in physiology. However, molecular mechanisms underlying this transition are largely unknown. Additionally, acclimation to hypersaline conditions enhances the acute toxicity of certain thioether organophosphate and carbamate pesticides in some species of euryhaline fish, yet sublethal impacts have been far less studied. The current study aimed to determine underlying molecular mechanisms of Pacific salmonid smoltification, as well as determine how hypersaline acclimation impacts acute and sublethal toxicity of a common organophosphate pesticide, chlorpyrifos (CPF). A transcriptomics approach was used to assess differential gene expression in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) liver, gills, and olfactory rosettes after salinity acclimation and found that the majority of the altered genes were tissue and salinity concentration dependent. From the few shared genes, a potential osmosenor was identified. Osmotic signal transduction cascades were also impacted in the three tissues. Salinity acclimation was then coupled with CPF to determine impacts on acute toxicity. Time to death of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by CPF was more rapid in freshwater than in hypersaline water (16 ppth). Salinity acclimation did not impact metabolism, precipitation, or acetylcholinesterase inhibition of CPF. In contrast, mRNA expression of certain neurological targets was upregulated in saltwater acclimated fish, consistent with diminished neuronal signaling which may protect fish from cholinergic overload associated with acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Sublethal experiments, which are more environmentally relevant, were conducted to determine impacts on olfaction. Combined acclimation and exposure to CPF impacted rainbow trout olfaction at the molecular, physiological, and behavioral levels. Concurrent exposure to hypersalinity and 0.5 µg/L CPF upregulated four genes that inhibit olfactory signal transduction. At the physiological level, hypersalinity and chlorpyrifos caused a decrease in sensory response to the amino acid L-serine and the bile salt taurocholic acid. Combined acclimation and exposure also negatively impacted behavior and reduced the avoidance of a predator cue (L-serine). Overall, these results will be very useful in risk assessment strategies evaluating compounds of this nature in estuarine environments and freshwater environments that may be altered by hypersaline stress or rising sea levels.

T1  - Persistent locomotor and behavioral effects resulting from developmental exposure to pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin are mediated by dopaminergic and serotonergic system dysfunction
AN  - 1654753057
AB  - Pyrethroid pesticides are generally considered to be a safer alternative to other classes of insecticides. However, there is increasing concern that children are more susceptible to the adverse effects of pesticides. The hypothesis tested in this thesis is that exposure to pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin, at concentrations below the LOAEL, during the critical developmental period would result in persistent behavioral deficits, which are due, in part, to changes in dopamine and serotonin system gene expression and neurochemistry. Zebrafish embryos were treated with deltamethrin (0.25 µg/L - 0.5 μg/L) during the embryonic period (3-72hpf), and then reared in treatment free water until the larval (2-week) and adult stages. Deltamethrin exposure during development resulted in increased locomotor activity, decreased drd1 and drd2a transcripts, and increased levels of dopamine (DA) metabolite, homovanillic acid, at the larval stage.  Manipulating the DA system by concomitant knockdown of the dopamine transporter (DAT) during exposure rescued deltamethrin induced locomotor activity. Acute methylphenidate (DAT inhibitor) exposure increased locomotor activity in control larvae but reduced locomotor activity in larvae previously exposed to deltamethrin. These studies indicate that dopaminergic dysfunction mediates the behavioral effects observed in larval zebrafish following deltamethrin exposure during development. Behavioral characterization of adult zebrafish revealed a sex specific response in fish that had been exposed to deltamethrin during development, including increased distance travelled, velocity, bouts of high mobility, and aggression in males, and increased swim velocity, thigmotaxis, and altered rates of habituation in females. In adult males, transcript levels of serta, sertb, and drd2a, positively correlated with the magnitude of aggression. However, this correlation was lost in the population of male fish that had been developmentally exposed to deltamethrin. Fluoxetine exposure attenuated aggression exhibited by dominant male zebrafish demonstrating the involvement of the serotonin system in mediating aggressive behavior. In conclusion, this research demonstrates that environmental influences during critical neurodevelopmental stages results in persistent neurobehavioral deficits. Also, we add to zebrafish ethology using the experimental behavioral paradigms adapted for our laboratory. Finally, we provide a mode of action for deltamethrin induced behavioral deficits which can assist in the cumulative risk assessment of this class of compounds.

T1  - The Effects of Pesticides and Water Quality on the Survival of the Calanoid Copepods, Eurytemora affinis and  Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, of the San Francisco Estuary
AN  - 1627765791
AB  - In the early 2000s, pelagic fish species in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE), including the endangered Delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus , experienced a sharp population decline. Coinciding with this collapse, there was a significant decrease in zooplankton abundance in the SFE, including the critical prey items Eurytemora affinis and Pseudodiaptomus forbesi. Scientists have been unable to identify a single source of the collapse of the pelagic food web in the SFE.  Rather, they believe a combination of effects, including contaminant exposure and changes in water quality, are the cause of the pelagic organism decline. To determine a relationship between pesticide exposure and copepod survival, in chapter one I conducted a series of acute toxicity tests with E. affinis and  P. forbesi using five key pesticides (chlorpyrifos, fipronil, permethin, λ-cyhalothrin, and bifenthrin). The main conclusions of my first study were that  E. affinis and P. forbesi are sensitive to pesticides at environmental levels, E. affinis is more sensitive to pesticides than P. forbesi, and pyrethroids were the most toxic of the pesticides investigated.      In chapter one, I found baseline toxicities values of key pesticides to E. affinis and P. forbesi. However, these tests were conducted in clean water and may lack ecological significance.  In aquatic environments, organisms can be exposed to changes in water quality including variations in amount and type of organic and inorganic material, contaminants levels (e.g. toxic metals, pesticides), and physical characteristics (e.g. pH, salinity, temperature).  To    investigate the toxicity of surface ambient waters to E. affinis and P.forbesi, once per month for nine months, I sampled seven sites in the northern interior portion of the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta and exposed copepods for 96 hours. I found E. affinis and P. forbesi are sensitive to ambient waters collected from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and that conductivity, turbidity and metal concentrations were significant variables affecting copepod survival.      In chapter one bifenthrin was one of the most toxic of the pesticides investigated and in chapter two I found increasing copepod survival with decreasing turbidity. In chapter three I investigated the combination of these effects by exposing E. affinis and P. forbesi to bifenthrin in the presence of suspended solids from municipal wastewater effluent and surface water of the San Francisco Estuary.  Previous literature suggests the dissolved concentration of a pesticide in water is the best predictor of aquatic toxicity. In my study, the presence of suspended solids reduced the toxicity of bifenthrin to E. affinis and P. forbesi  by decreasing the bioavailable concentration of bifenthrin. However, the toxicity of bifenthrin to E. affinis and P. forbesi  was greater than expected from the dissolved concentration alone. An analysis of particle characteristics revealed high levels of fine particles (0.5-2 µm) resulted in greater than expected mortality. Direct ingestion of bifenthrin bound particles, changes in feeding behavior and direct of particles are all plausible explanation of increased toxicity to E. affinis  and P. forbesi.

T1  - Combined effects of bioavailable organic contaminants in the aquatic environment
AN  - 2150313747
AB  - Passive sampling, as opposed to the conventional spot or bottle water sampling technique, has shown to be reliable and efficient in monitoring the toxicologically relevant, freely dissolved (e.g. bioavaialable) concentrations of a wide range of organic contaminants in water. At the same time, partitioning controlled delivery (passive dosing; PD) techniques promise to overcome many of the challenges associated with toxicity testing of hydrophobic substances that may bias the interpretation of toxicity data. The present study investigated the feasibility of coupling silicone rubber passive sampling devices (SR-PSDs) with bioassay techniques for both chemical and ecotoxicological assessment of complex mixtures of organic contaminants in the aquatic environment. SR-PSDs were deployed in water at various locations within the Ythan catchment (north east, Scotland, UK), Forth estuary and the Firth of Forth (east coast of central Scotland, UK) for 7 to 9 weeks. Following retrieval, extracts from the SR-PSDs were analysed for dissolved concentrations of a variety of organic contaminants including PAHs and PCBs using GC-MS and GC-ECD respectively and were screened for a wide range of pesticides using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS. The extracts were further evaluated for acute cytotoxicity (i.e. neutral red uptake assay) and EROD induction potential using rainbow trout liver cell line (Oncorhynchus mykiss; RTL-W1) and for phytotoxicity and developmental toxicity potential using algal growth inhibition test (with a marine phytoplankton, Diacronema lutheri) and fish embryo toxicity test (with embryos from zebrafish Danio rerio) respectively. Overall, the individual and total dissolved concentrations of PAHs; parent and branched) and PCBs; measured in water from the Ythan, Forth estuary and Firth of Forth were relatively low compared with other studies using PSDs. A number and level of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides and fungicides of varying hydrophobicity (log KOWs 2.25 to 5.31) were detected in the silicone rubber (SR) extracts from the Ythan catchment, the Forth estuary and the Firth of Forth, suggesting input mainly from agricultural run-off and possibly from direct discharges. No statistically significant acute cytotoxicity was observed following 48 h exposure of RTL-W1 cells to SR extracts from the Ythan catchment. But, on a sublethal level, for every site, statistically significant EROD activity was observed to some degree following 72 h exposure. In addition, developmental and algal toxicities on embryos of D. rerio and D. lutheri respectively, were measured in all the deployed samples compared with the procedural controls (undeployed samples). Interestingly, extracts of SR-PSDs from the Forth estuary and the Firth of Forth exhibited growth inhibitions on D. lutheri that were similar to those of extracts from the Ythan, even though, fewer numbers of pesticides were detected in the Forth estuary and Firth of Forth than the Ythan. This suggests that pesticides were not solely responsible for the observed effects in the Ythan catchment. To further improve data from toxicity testing of hydrophobic substances, the study identified the use of SR O-rings as a suitable passive dosing format in in vitro toxicity tests and was partially validated through their use in dosing RTL-W1 cells with two individual PAHs and subsequently determining cytotoxicity and EROD-activity.

T1  - Potential Environmental Enrichment for Zebrafish Used in Regulatory Toxicology
AN  - 1221966310
AB  - The aim of environmental enrichment is to alter the environment of a captive animal in a way that results in improved mental and physical welfare. The technique has been utilised effectively for many years for captive mammals in a variety of settings. However, until now it has never been considered as a way of improving the welfare of aquatic animals such as fish.Fish that are used in regulatory toxicology studies are at present maintained solely in barren tank environments. Little is known about how these types of environments affect the well-being of the animals residing there and whether they impact either physiological heath or behavioural repertoire. This thesis aims to address this gap in the knowledge regarding the potential for environmental enrichment to improve the welfare of fish used in regulatory toxicology. More specifically it looks at two types of enrichment and the effects of these on the commonly used model species, the zebrafish (Danio rerio).The first type of enrichment studied was glass rod structures of varying heights provided to increase tank complexity and provide refuge. The glass structures did not produce any quantifiable benefits in unstressed fish and appeared to delay the formation of stable social hierarchies. When fish were stressed by a period of chasing, the presence of the glass rods appeared to reduce the magnitude of the cortisol response. Whilst this could be viewed as a potential benefit, it was felt that it would not outweigh the costs of this type of enrichment.The second type of enrichment studied was provision of airstones. Again, no clear evidence was found that fish in tanks with airstones experienced an improvement in welfare. The main observation was the vast increase in mortality in tanks containing these airstones, in particular, those of a smaller size. Regardless of the physiological cause underlying this result, this can only be viewed as a negative consequence and one that appears to rule out airstones as an effective form of enrichment for this species and strain of fish.It was also observed that both stress and the presence of enrichment influenced the absolute deviation from the mean in several endpoints. Since changes in endpoint variation will have effects both on the number of animals required to statistically measure environmentally relevant effects this is a factor that should be considered when researching methods of environmental enrichment.Finally, results from these studies suggest the possibility that laboratory zebrafish do not require the addition of environmental enrichment to tanks in order to promote maximum welfare. Furthermore, as considerable costs would be involved in implementing many types of enrichment (relating to manufacture, cleaning, incompatibility of results with previous studies etc.) it is likely that observed benefits would have to be both substantial and well established in order for changes in regulatory guidelines to take place. For a species such as zebrafish that are extremely easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory with minimal amounts of disease, social problems or mortalities, it may be that current conditions are satisfactory.

T1  - The Impacts of Chemical Discharges on the Reproductive Biology of the Bullhead Cottus Gobio and the Dipper Cinclus Cinclus in the Tamar Catchment
AN  - 1033193020
AB  - It is now well established that a wide range of natural and anthropogenic chemicals present in the aquatic environment have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system of many organisms. In fish, many of these effects appear to be of a feminising nature, including stimulation of vitellogenin production and induction of intersex. In piscivorous birds these so called endocrine disrupting contaminants have been shown to impair reproduction, influencing reproductive behaviour, sex ratio, eggshell thickness and reproductive success. The effects seen in fish have been associated with high levels of oestrogenic activity in the effluent from waste water treatments works (WwTWs), but few studies have focused on the effects of WwTWs effluents on birds.In this thesis, the effects of effluents from WwTWs on fish and birds were investigated in the Tamar catchment, SW England. The work spanned making detailed assessment on the oestrogenic and anti-androgenic activity of 3 WwTWs effluents, using a variety of water sampling techniques and applying both recombinant yeast oestrogen screen (YES) and recombinant yeast androgen screen (anti-YAS) bioassays to quantify the different hormonal activities. A survey was undertaken of the hormonal activities at 13 sites to determine concentrations of contaminants in the surface waters throughout the Tamar catchment, using both recombinant yeast screens and targeted analytical chemistry for specific pollutants (LC/MS-TOF and GCMS). An ELISA was developed to quantify vitellogenin (VTG) in the bullhead (our study fish sentinel) as a biomarker of oestrogen exposure, and evidence of endocrine disruption was investigated in wild populations of the bullhead, Cottus gobio and the dipper, Cinclus cinclus. Macroinvertebrates from upstream and downstream of three WwTW's effluent discharges and from three sampling sites were also sampled as an index of overall water quality in the Tamar catchment, and as an assessment of food availability for the bullheads and dippers.For the studies on the hormonal activities in three WwTWs in the Tamar catchment, samples were collected by both spot and passive sampling; passive samplers (in replicate) were placed in the effluent discharges for a three week period, and collected on days 7, 14 and 21, spot samples were taken simultaneously. Measurement of total oestrogenic and total anti-androgenic activity was conducted using the YES and antiYAS, respectively. Spot and passive samples were collected from 13 sites within the Tamar catchment (sampling sites were >2 km downstream of effluent discharges). Additionally, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry time-of-flight (LC/MS-TOF) was used to measure the concentration of oestrone (E1), 17β-oestrodiol (E2) and 17αethinylestradiol (EE2) in each sample. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) was used to measure the concentration of individual PBDE and PCB congeners in the spot samples only.Levels of oestrogenic and anti-androgenic activity observed in the WwTWs effluent were comparable with those measured in effluents in the UK and in other countries. Surface waters of the Tamar, away from the WwTWs effluent discharges, contained very little oestrogenic activity (<1.1 ng E2 EQs L -1), and anti-androgenic activity was undetectable. Quantification of oestrogenic activity using passive samplers showed an increasing amount of total oestrogenic activity between days 7 and 21 when measured by the both the YES and LC/MS-TOF.

T1  - The Population-Level Impacts of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Fish
AN  - 1033192746
AB  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are one of the many anthropogenic pollutants released into the environment. There is a substantial body of literature that has shown a detrimental impact on wildlife, particularly aquatic species, following exposure to these pollutants. In particular, exposure to EDCs can cause disruptions in sexual development and reproductive function. The majority of the effects observed are alterations in the physiology and behaviour of individuals and a key research question that has yet to be fully addressed is whether the effects seen in individuals exposed to EDCs manifest in measurable changes in population parameters.Whilst some work has been conducted previously investigating the population-level impacts of EDC exposure, this work has generally used mathematical models to examine whether measured short-term changes in individual fecundity and survival may lead to alterations in population viability and growth in the long-term. Such an approach ignores the potential impact of EDCs on more subtle factors (for example alterations in behaviour and genetics) that can potentially affect fish population dynamics.The work presented in this thesis used two model species, the zebrafish, Danio rerio and stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, to examine whether exposure to EDCs had an effect on previously ignored factors that determine group dynamics, including behaviour, parentage and reproductive success. In groups of zebrafish (two males and two females) exposure to the model oestrogenic compound ethinylestradiol (EE2) at 10 ng/L caused a reduction in the paternity success of the most successful male, reducing the skew in paternity, relative to controls. This disruption in the reproductive hierarchy was associated with a suppression of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) concentrations in exposed males. Such alterations in reproductive hierarchies have implications for population genetic diversity as well as usual patterns of sexual behaviour and selection.In a second study, males were exposed to EE2 (females were not exposed) and then placed into colonies of varying size with either 1, 2 or 4 males competing to breed with one female. The reproductive success of the most reproductively successful male in colonies containing two males and one female was unaffected by previous exposure to EE2, relative to controls, but was significantly affected for the most reproductively successful male in tanks containing four males competing to breed with one female. This finding suggests that the impact of EDC exposure on reproductive hierarchies and success is dependent on the group structure and is not a straightforward monotonic effect.It is well known that there exist so-called „windows of sensitivity‟ for the effects of EDCs on sexual development in fish. Exposure to EDCs during this period can cause dramatic alterations in development, including complete sex reversal if the magnitude and/or duration of exposure are sufficient. In the third study in this thesis, zebrafish were exposed during the key window of sexual development, from 20-60 days post fertilisation (dpf). The reproductive success of both mature males and females was then examined in competitive breeding scenarios. Whilst there were no obvious effects of the early life EE2 exposures on the gonadal phenotypes in either males or females at maturity, the reproductive success in males exposed to 2.76ng EE2/L was increased. In contrast, exposure of females to 9.86 ng EE2 /L during early life reduced their subsequent reproductive success. Given the importance of female reproductive capability in population demographics and dynamics, the effect of exposure to EE2on female reproductive success may therefore have significant implications for exposed fish populations.Whilst conducting the EE2exposure experiments, it became clear that the genetic diversity in the laboratory strains of zebrafish was much lower than that previously published for wild zebrafish. A study was therefore conducted in which several laboratory strains of zebrafish and a population of zebrafish obtained directly from the wild in Bangladesh were genotyped in order to elucidate the genetic diversity in the different strains. The results showed that the genetic diversity in commonly used laboratory strains (even those described as outbred or „wild type‟) was significantly lower than that of wild zebrafish. Given the impact of reductions in genetic diversity and variation on fitness at both the individual and population level, this has implications for studies that extrapolate results from laboratory studies to wild populations, as exposure to EDCs may have a different impact on laboratory strains than their more genetically diverse wild counterparts.

T1  - Ecological implications of physiological condition in temperate fishes
AN  - 304732721
AB  - Variation in individual performance and condition appear to play an important role in fish population demography. I determined the separate and combined effects of nutritional condition and refuge availability on survival of the blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii), and how condition influenced burst swimming performance to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the observed patterns of survival. Recent recruits fed high or low rations were placed on standardized plots of rock in the field, and monitored daily to determine mortality. To examine the effects of condition and refuge availability, high- and low-ration fish were placed on plots of high, medium, or low amounts of rock. On standardized plots, low-ration fish experienced higher mortality than high-ration fish; however, swimming ability did not explain these patterns. As expected, survival increased with refuge availability, and low-ration fish experienced higher mortality than high-ration fish at medium and high levels of refuge. Surprisingly, higher mortality was observed for high-ration fish on low-refuge plots. These results indicate that both post-settlement processes and individual condition, mediated by environmental conditions, are important determinants of fish population demography. Pesticide exposure also plays an important role in determining condition, performance, and survival of fishes. Due to increasing use of pyrethroid insecticides, my second objective was to determine the effects of the pyrethroid esfenvalerate on food consumption, growth, behavior, and predation risk in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). For growth experiments, minnow larvae were exposed to five esfenvalerate treatments (control, solvent control, 0.1μg/L, 0.7μg/L, 1.5μg/L) for 4 h. After exposure, unconsumed food and abnormal swimming behavior were recorded daily for 7 d. For predation experiments, minnows from each treatment were transferred to aquaria containing one threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). After 45 min, the number of minnows remaining was recorded. Fish exposed to 1.5 and 0.7μg/L esfenvalerate exhibited impaired swimming and feeding ability and growth relative to fish exposed to 0.1μg/L and controls. Predation risk was significantly higher in minnows exposed to 1.5 and 0.7μg/L esfenvalerate than in control fish. These results demonstrate that larval fish can experience significant growth and swimming impairment, and increased predation pressure, even after short-term exposures to esfenvalerate.

T1  - Development of a 3-D multimedia regional fate and chemical transport modelling system for pesticides: Modifying and coupling models-3/CMAQ with PEM.
AN  - 33174362; 200904-16-0032948 (SO)
AB  - Many pesticides have been identified as persistent, bio-accumulative, and toxic pollutants. Concerns about their adverse effects on the environment have been expressed for many years. Due to applications in the past, significant pesticide residues remain in the soil. These residues can result in significant pesticide emissions into the atmosphere, where pesticides can be transported over long distances and deposited far from where they were originally applied. To investigate issues related to pesticides in the environment, this project has developed a 3-D Eulerian multimedia regional fate and chemical transport modelling system based on the US EPA MM5/MCIP/SMOKE/CMAQ air quality modelling system, which this project has coupled to PEM, a dynamic pesticide emission model. This study has, to our knowledge for the first time, incorporated the Koa gas-particle partitioning model into Models-3/CMAQ for the semi-volatile behaviour of pollutants. The modelling package takes into account the important physical and chemical processes and factors, from sources to sinks, related to pesticides in both the atmosphere and the soil, including pesticide application modes, soil types, soil tilling, growing stages of crops, advection and diffusion in the soil, emission, partitioning, transport in the atmosphere, chemical transformation, dry deposition, and wet deposition. Moreover, this modelling system models pesticides along with other atmospheric compounds (e.g. O( 3), OH radicals, NO(3) radicals, and particulate materials) simultaneously and addresses chemical and physical interactions among all these pollutants, including pesticides. This project has used the modelling system to study the environmental behaviour of toxaphene, a persistent, bio-accumulative, and toxic pesticide. The study was carried out for a 11/2 year period from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001 and covers a domain that includes most of North America with a resolution of 36x36 km. Comparisons of the modeled results with measured or estimated values show good agreement. The comparisons include (i)comparison of modeled daily-average toxaphene air concentrations against measurements; (ii)comparison of toxaphene fraction on particle phase over that of all phases against estimate as well as measurements; (iii)comparison of modeled annual wet deposition against measurements; (iv)comparison of modeled annual dry deposition against estimate; (v)and comparisons of surface temperatures and soil moistures predicted by MM5 and PEM. The comparison of modeled daily-average air concentrations against measurements was conducted at five measuring sites for the year 2000. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish the relationship between modeled daily-average pesticide air concentrations and measurements at so many locations and for such a long period. The good agreement of these comparisons shows that the modelling system has the ability to simulate emissions, air concentrations in gas phase and particle phase, dry deposition, and wet deposition, which are determined by simulation of the important physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere and the soil, as well as agricultural practices and meteorology. This work has estimated a toxaphene residue inventory for Mexico, and has converted the U.S. residue inventory, obtained from Environment Canada, from Latitude-Longitude projection to Lambert projection. Although this study has found anomalous residues around the Texas site in the U.S. residue inventory, data analyses imply that the inventories are generally reasonable. This project has used the merged Mexican and U.S. residue inventory and coupled MM5-PEM to develop an hourly and gridded toxaphene emission inventory for a period from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001. To our knowledge, this is the first such gridded and hourly toxaphene emission inventory developed for North America. The spatial distribution of simulated emissions in the domain is consistent with that of toxaphene residues. Modeled emissions have a strong diurnal and seasonal signature in each grid and also in the entire domain. In the entire domain, the greatest emissions occur in April (35748 kg/month), May (51466 kg/month), and June (35273 kg/month). Although monthly toxaphene emission in 2001 is usually smaller than that in its counterpart month of 2000 because of decay and loss of residues in the soil, this study shows that exceptions exist because of different meteorology, which can lead to greater emission in a month compared to its corresponding month in the previous year. Toxaphene was not heavily used around the Great Lakes. Toxaphene was never licensed for use in Canada. Although toxaphene was used in the United States, primarily in cotton-growing areas of southeastern U.S it was banned in this nation more than two decades ago. However, toxaphene concentrations in water and fish in the Great Lakes are still very high, posing a threat to the life and health of one quarter of Canadian population and one tenth of U.S. population living in the Great Lakes region. One of greatest challenges that scientists face is to identify atmospheric sources to the region's waters and to determine the patterns of emission, transport, and deposition. This study shows that long-range atmospheric transport and deposition play a vital role for the contamination of the Great Lakes by toxaphene. This study provides detailed modeled deposition estimates for the five Great Lakes, using a modelling package that takes into account all important factors that may affect the fate of pesticides, including agricultural practices, meteorology, physical and chemical processes in the soil and the atmosphere. This study reveals that boundary conditions are very important for modelling both toxaphene air concentrations and depositions, and neglecting boundary conditions may result in the underestimates of both air concentrations at some locations and dry and wet depositions into the Great Lakes. The modeled results show that both North American residues and boundary conditions, which are partly contributed by toxaphene sources outside the domain, contribute to the contamination of the Great Lakes. During the warm months, the southerly winds prevail, and they carry toxaphene emitted primarily in the southeastern United States to the Great Lakes region, causing significant dry and wet depositions of toxaphene into the Great Lakes. Therefore, the major contributor to the contamination of the Great Lakes in warm months is the soil residues in the United States. During cold months, however, the prevalent north-westerly winds probably carry toxaphene through the northern boundary to the Great Lakes region, leading to toxaphene deposition into the Great Lakes. The upper lakes, especially Lake Superior, are significantly affected by the boundary conditions. This study shows that pollutants can be transported southward and deposited into the sensitive receptors such as the Great Lakes. Although the lower Great Lakes are also influenced by the boundary conditions, they are mainly affected by the U.S. residues throughout the year. This study found that Mexican residues in the domain do not have significant impact on the concentrations at the five measuring sites and depositions into the Great Lakes.

T1  - Pesticide effects on amphibians: A community ecology perspective
AN  - 305364894
AB  - The presence of pesticides in aquatic systems has been implicated as a cause for amphibian declines across the world. This dissertation examines the sub-lethal effects of several commonly used pesticides when amphibian larvae are exposed to both the contaminant and another species simultaneously. Chapter one discusses the issue of amphibian declines and the evidence justifying a further investigation on the role of pesticides in altering amphibian traits. Chapter two examines the lethality of four commonly used pesticides (atrazine, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, and diazinon) on the Pacific tree frog, Hyla regilla, and on the threatened foothill yellow legged frog,  Rana boylii. R. boylii tadpoles are more susceptible to carbaryl and diazinon than H. regilla but more resistant to atrazine. Chlorpyrifos exhibits similar toxicity to both species. Species exhibit similar shifts in behavior (e.g., both increase activity with diazinon) while in other cases species exhibit opposite shifts in behavior (e.g., with carbaryl, refuge use increases with H. regilla and decreases with R. boylii). In chapter three, I examine H. regilla  with a fish predator, Gambusia affinis, in the presence of diazinon. Diazinon significantly impacts the fish predator, drastically reducing its ability to prey upon tadpoles. Chapter four examines the competitive interactions of H. regilla and R. boylii when exposed to carbaryl. The combined presence of carbaryl and a competitor ceases both development and growth in R. boylii. Contrary to this, H. regilla exhibit increased growth and development likely due to the reduced competitive ability of R. boylii . The final chapter combines these two competitors with a non-native predator, the signal crayfish, Pacifasticus leniusculus. In the combined context of predator and pesticide, R. boylii survival is reduced from nearly 100% to 50%. Carbaryl increases the susceptibility of R. boylii to predation from a resistant crayfish predator. In summary, pesticide presence can have significant impacts on community dynamics. Alteration of one species' behavior or development can lead to the benefit of another, be it prey or competitor. By studying these community interactions and which species are most heavily impacted by pesticides, we can better understand why specific species are declining while others are not.

T1  - Biological studies of bottlenose dolphins from Natal coastal waters
AN  - 2130258740
AB  - The biology of bottlenose dolphins from the east coast of southern Africa is investigated. Births occur predominantly in summer, after a one year gestation period. Calves are born at a length of approximately 103 cm and a mass of nearly 14 kg. Neonates are closely attended by the mother, she determines the calf's respiration rate and behaviour as it swims in a negative pressure vortex high on her flank. The initial weeks are marked by the calf's acquisition of swimming skills and its ability to regulate its own respiration rate. Although the calf takes solid food between six months and one year, suckling may continue for as much as three years. Initial growth is rapid but slows with the approach to puberty. Females reach sexual maturity at about ten years of age and may undergo a series of rapid ovulations before fertilisation occurs. Subsequently, the mean ovulation rate indicates a three year calving interval. Males show a mass growth spurt at the onset of puberty, between 10 and 12 years, and reach sexual maturity between 12 and 15 years of age. In both sexes, physical maturity and asymptotic size are reached at about 15 years and maximum life-span is in excess of 40 years. Although a wide variety of fish and cephalopods are taken, the fishes Pomadasys olivaceum, Scomber japonicus, Pagellus bellotti, Trachurus delagoae, and the cephalopods Sepia officinalis and Loligo sp. contribute some 60 % by mass of all prey taken. Different sex and maturity classes of dolphins consume differing sizes and species of prey, implying a partitioning of food resources within the group. Comparisons of stomach volumes with estimates of prey mass and nutritional requirements suggest that calves and lactating females may need to feed more often than other sex and maturity classes. Examination of shark stomachs indicates that shark predation may be an important component of dolphin natural mortality. Four species of shark, the Zambesi (Carcharhinus leucas), the tiger (Galeocerdo cuvien), the great white (Carcharodon carcharias) and the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) are implicated as dolphin predators. Estimates from the number of these four species caught annually and the frequency of occurrence of dolphin flukes and vertebrae in their stomachs suggest that a minimum of 20 bottle nosed dolphins or 2.2 % of the estimated population in southern Natal coastal waters are killed each year by sharks. Some 32 bottlenose dolphins, about 4 % of the estimated population, are captured in shark nets annually. Calves of two years or less constitute nearly 45 % of the catch, while lactating females make up a further 15 %. An analysis of biological, environmental and physiographic factors associated with each capture, suggest that feeding and probably prey movement and distribution are directly associated with capture. PCB, t-DDT and dieldrin concentrations in the blubber of male bottlenose dolphins increase with age and reach levels that may impair testosterone production. In females, there is an 80 % decline in residue concentrations after the first or second ovulation. Evidence presented suggests that first born calves receive possibly lethal doses of residues within two months of birth. Residue concentrations in dolphins from different geographical areas varied significantly, implying a degree of isolation of sections of the population. Investigation of reproductive parameters indicates that mortality of bottlenose dolphins off Natal probably equals or exceeds the replacement rate. The necessity for and requirements of further research on the natural history of bottlenose dolphins off the east coast of southern Africa are summarised.
