"PKADHAKV","thesis","1977","Van den Broek, Willem Louis Frits","Aspects of the biology of fish populations from the Medway Estuary, based on power station intake sampling with special reference to parasitism and pollution","","","","","http://repository.londonmet.ac.uk/7752/","Historical records suggest there has been a decline in the diversity of fish species in the Medway Estuary. The aims of the present study were to assess the type and composition of fish populations currently using the estuary, investigate aspects of their biology and gather information on the occurrence of specific pollutants in their tissues with a view to evaluating the influence of man's activities. Quantitative sampling was carried out monthly between 1973 and 1975 from the intake screens of Kingsnorth Power Station. Trawl samples were also taken as a check for selectivity. During the study over 46,000 fish, divided between 59 species, were collected. All individuals were weighed and measured, and selected species were aged. The annual cycle of species-occurrence, their relative abundance, population structure and growth of the most common species were investigated. The diets of plaice, Pleuronectes platessa L., flounder, Platichthys flesus (L.), whiting, Merlangius merlangus (L.) and pouting, Trisopterus luscus (L.) were monitored. Seasonal and/or age variations in food intake and feeding behaviour were considered in conjunction with parasite and pollution studies. The integumental tissues and branchial cavities of fish were inspected for parasites. Adults of the blood-feeding ectoparasitic copepod Lernaeocera branchialis (L.) infested whiting. Fish so infected showed a statistically significant reduction in body weight. Also, a brief study of their liver lipids revealed an approximately 50 percent loss in weight and this primarily reflected lower levels of phospholipid. Selected fish, and some of their dietary constituents, were analysed for organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls and five heavy metals. Heavy metal levels were low in comparison with other A literature values. Chlorinated hydrocarbon values showed no marked seasonal variations connected with agricultural activities but their concentrations were correlated with the lipid content of most tissues.","1977","2024-03-01 05:50:32","2024-03-01 05:50:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","590 Animals (Zoology)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Migration barriers and selective pesticides are used to control sea lamprey, but there is a desire to develop additional control tools such as traps with deterrents. Sound has been used as a deterrent for other invasive species but its potential for manipulating sea lamprey behavior in natural stream conditions remains untested. The behavioural threshold for sea lamprey nor a behavioural comparison of life stages has also not been established. Here, behavioral responses of upstream migrating adult sea lamprey in response to low frequency sounds of 70 or 90 Hz was tracked in a small stream using passive integrated transponder (PIT) telemetry. The low frequency sounds shifted sea lamprey distribution with up to 30% more sea lamprey detected on PIT antennas without sound compared to PIT antennas with sound playing. The same frequency tones were used for behavioral responses of adult and juvenile sea lamprey and were tracked in a lab setup. The low frequency sounds changed the sea lampreys behaviour with juvenile and adult sea lamprey showing similar swimming behavioural thresholds and twitch (startle) behavioural thresholds for both frequencies. Future studies could continue testing low frequency sounds in natural setting for use as a natural deterrent at sea lamprey barriers to push sea lamprey toward traps at different life stages and continued studies in a lab setting could be useful for knowledge of the behaviour of sea lamprey to apply to traps for population control.","2021","2024-03-01 05:50:32","2024-03-01 05:50:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Windsor","","eng","","","","","","","","","","","Behavioural control; Behavioural threshold; Invasive species; Low frequency sound; Natural deterrent; Sound detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies evaluating the effects of sublethal concentrations of pesticide mixtures are limited, especially in coastal systems [1]. The purpose of this dissertation research was to investigate both lethal and sublethal effects of realistic pesticide exposure scenarios on two life-stages (juvenile and adult) of an important invertebrate estuarine predator, prey, and fishery species, the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). Importantly, blue crab populations are declining throughout the U.S., but the potential role of pesticides in declines remains largely unexplored. In a series of laboratory experiments, I investigated: (1) lethal and sublethal effects of a single exposure to carbaryl (carbamate), malathion (organophosphate) and resmethrin (pyrethroid) + PBO (synergist), individually and in mixtures, on juvenile and adult blue crab survival and neuromuscular functioning by measuring changes in mortality, righting time (RT), and eyestalk reflexes. These responses serve as a proxy for the direct effects of exposure on survival and indirect effects on coordinated behaviors critical to blue crab survival (e.g., predator escape or foraging). Pesticides were selected because they are three of the mostly commonly used throughout the U.S. and have different modes of action. Effects observed at the organismal level were subsequently evaluated and linked with changes in (2) predator-prey interactions (mesocosms), and (3) physiological responses (enzyme assays). Lastly, (4) differences in susceptibility between juvenile (post-planktonic) and adult life-stages were also evaluated in behavioral and predator-prey ...","2017","2024-03-01 05:50:32","2024-03-01 05:50:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","","","","","","","","","","","Carbaryl; Estuarine; Invertebrate; malathion; PBO; Resmethrin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, exposure to pathogens can have transgenerational implications and influence the susceptibility of offspring. Understanding the outcomes of these interactions can also have implications for developing effective control strategies for insect pests. Asian longhorned beetles, Anoplophora glabripennis, are invasive wood borers which have been introduced into North America and Europe and the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum is being developed for their control. Studies were conducted to determine how sexual maturity, insect age, mating status (unmated vs mated), host thermoregulatory behavior, and prior maternal pathogen exposure influence A. glabripennis susceptibility to M. brunneum and ability to suppress a fungal infection, even across a generation. Additionally, potential mechanisms of synergy between M. brunneum and the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid were investigated. Beetles did not exhibit thermoregulatory behavior although it would have been beneficial. Prior maternal pathogen exposure enhanced offspring survival but whether offspring survival was enhanced depended on the pathogen used to expose mothers and whether or not the pathogen was living or dead. Beetle susceptibility to A. glabripennis was iii also influenced by the age and mating status of beetles. We found that old beetles were not more susceptible than younger beetles and only found a cost of mating for mature but not old beetles. Finally we found that starvation may be a potential mechanism for the synergy between a pesticide (imidacloprid) and the fungal pathogen M. brunneum. These findings provide insight into insect-pathogen interactions and ecoimmunology in beetles. iv","2016","2024-03-01 05:50:32","2024-03-01 05:50:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","","","","","","","","","","","Asian longhorned beetle; Invertebrate Immunity; Metarhizium brunneum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diuron, a chlorinated phenylurea herbicide and its primary metabolite, 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) exert toxic effects on non-target organisms. Growth, survival, and reproduction are the primary factors determining an organism's population structure in its habitat. Javanese medaka (Oryzias javanicus) is an emerging euryhaline model fish distributed around the coastal and estuarine regions of Peninsular Malaysia and other parts of Southeast Asia. The fish is a sentinel species that bioindicates ecosystem health. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acute toxicity of diuron and 3,4-DCA on different life stages of Javanese medaka, to determine the effect of diuron and 3,4-DCA on the fecundity and reproductive biomarkers of Javanese medaka, and to evaluate the embryotoxicity of diuron and 3,4-DCA on Javanese medaka. Larvae, juveniles, and adults of Javanese medaka were exposed to diuron and 3,4-DCA for 96 hours to determine mortality (96 hour-LC50; 50% lethal concentration to exposed organisms) and behavioural toxicity symptoms. Fish embryo toxicity (FET) test; mortality (LC50) at 10-days and 96-hour for diuron and 3,4-DCA, and subchronic embryonic toxicity (20 days) for both diuron and 3,4-DCA were also evaluated. Reproductively active adults were used for a 21-day diuron and 3,4-DCA fish short-term reproductive assay (FSTRA). All the bioassays were conducted in a semi-static method. The LC50 of diuron and 3,4-DCA for embryo were; 632.5 mg/L (95% CI = 622.6 645, R2 = 0.98, 10 days) and 32.87 mg/L (95% CI = 27.90 - 38.74, R2 = 0.95, 96-hours), respectively. No behavioural toxicity symptoms were observed in both diuron and 3,4- DCA exposed individuals. The curve fit models (concentration-mortality) indicate a low concentration-dependent increase in the mortality rate for diuron and 3,4-DCA exposed adults. The LC50 trend was; larvae > juveniles > adults for both diuron and 3,4-DCA.

In this project, firstly, we in-vestigated the mechanism of action of rotenone, a commercialized pesticide that was previously described to reproduce the bradykinetic dopaminergic neurodegeneration symptoms of Parkin-son’s Disease in zebrafish by inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I. We found out that rote-none caused change in the morphology of the zebrafish dopaminergic mitochondrial network. We also observed the altered expression of various genes involves in mitochondrial fusion and fission in response to rotenone exposure. Secondly, to develop the use of adult zebrafish as a toxin-based model for Parkinson’s Disease, we sought to minimize any off-target effects by exposure of rotenone specifically to the brain. We demonstrated that microinjection of rotenone into the forebrain ventricular zone of adult zebrafish decreases the number of dopaminergic neurons. However, behavioural tests suggested that did not translate into locomotor impairment in these fish. Taken together, these results gave us more information about the potential use of zebrafish to study the physiological mechanism leading to dopaminergic degeneration and allow for the development of therapeutic strategies for Parkinson’s Disease.","2018","2024-03-01 05:50:32","2024-03-01 05:50:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa","","en","","","","","","","","","","","complex I inhibitor; dopaminergic neurons; Parkinson's disease; rotenone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study evaluates the rotational rice-fish farming systems and the use of new fish species for concurrent rice-fish culture. The overall objective is to present scientifically sound conclusions, able to further improve rice farmers’ income as well as a sustainable rice production through better performing rice-fish systems. Hereto the following specific objectives were selected: (1) evaluate economic returns of a rotational double rice crop - fish pen culture system (2R-FP) and compare them with the double and triple rice monoculture systems (2RM and 3RM) in the flood-prone area, (2) investigate the factors affecting fish yield and profit of the fish pen culture system, (3) investigate the predation potential of climbing perch (Anabas testudineus. B.) on insects and its production parameters in concurrent rice-fish systems, and (4) investigate the feeding habits of snakehead murrel (Channa striata B.), its production parameters and its effects on the production of major stocked fish species in the concurrent rice-fish systems. This study includes two parts. Part A (Chapter 2 & 3) makes use of household surveys carried out in 2006 to address the specific objectives 1 and 2. In Part B (Chapter 4 to 7) a series of on-station experiments, undertaken from 2003 to 2010, address the specific objectives 3 and 4. Chapter 2 analyzes the economic returns of three farming systems: 2R-FP, 2RM and 3RM in the flood-prone area of the MD. Adopting an additional crop during the flood season, fish pen culture in 2R-FP had a significantly higher return above variable costs (4.1 million VND per ha) than the third rice crop (2.1 million VND per ha) in 3RM, due to comparatively low production costs. Comparing 2R-FP with 3RM shows that less chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used in 2R-FP. The present study suggests that in the flood-prone region of the MD, 2R-FP could replace the commonly practiced 2RM or 3RM systems from an economical as well as ecological point of view.Chapter 3 investigates the factors affecting fish yield and profit of the fish pen culture from the 2R-FP. Fish net yield significantly increased with stocking density and specific polycultures. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio L.) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis R.) perform best, both in production and profit considerations. Low fish price at harvest and the difficulty to sell below market sized common carp at a period of oversupply, were the main problems indicated for fish pen culture. A larger harvest size of common carp resulted in a significantly higher return above variable costs. Harvest size of common carp was mainly limited by increasing common carp stocking density, while increasing stocking density of common carp was not significantly correlated with the return above variable costs for all stocked fish.Therefore, we recommend for commoncarp a stocking density of around 6,000 fish per ha in order to obtain the optimum combination of marketable sizes, a good price, biomass and profit at harvest. The stocking density of bighead carp fingerlings should be increased above the mean stocking density as applied in this study (1,000 fish per ha). Partial fish harvesting strategy is recommended in order to avoid temporary oversupplies. Chapter 4 investigates natural food use and growth performance of climbing perch, grown in concurrent rice-fish fields under different combinations of fish species and stocking densities. Insects were the major food item of climbing perch. The proportion of rice grains was significantly higher in the stomach of climbing perch when Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus niloticus L.) was included in the polyculture than with a combination of silver barb (Barbonymus gonionotus B.) or common carp. Meanwhile, the proportion of insects in the stomach of climbing perch was significantly higher in combination with silver barb than with Nile tilapia. The net yield of climbing perch was significantly higher in combination with Nile tilapia than with silver barb or common carp. The survival rate of climbing perch dropped significantly with increasing stocking density from 2,500 to 5,000 fish per ha, suggesting that food availability is probably the major constraint for climbing perch. Lower stocking densities of climbing perch and silver barb, stocking larger fingerlings of climbing perch, a longer culture period (8-10 months) and supplemental nutrient inputs are advisable to get a marketable size for climbing perch and to improve its net production.Chapter 5 investigates in rice-fish aquariums and concrete tanks, the feeding behavior of different fish species as well as their ability to control brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Homoptera: Delphacidae). In the aquarium studies we found that climbing perch spent more time attempting to graze BPH, especially on rice tillers above the water surface, compared to common carp and Nile tilapia. This resulted in a higher number of BPH eaten by climbing perch than by other fish species. In the tank studies all sizes of climbing perch from 10 to 80 g per fish reduced the number of BPH at both vegetative, reproductive and ripening phases of the rice crop, but the effects were dependent on the fish size. Small and medium climbing perch reduced better the number of BPH than the larger ones. The present study suggests that despite the limited biomass yield, climbing perch can be incorporated in rice-fish fields in order to enhance the biological control of rice pests, especially BPH. Chapter 6 investigates the natural food use of snakehead murrel in concurrent rice-fish fields, next to the major stocked white fish species, silver barb, common carp, Nile tilapia and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix V.). Two experiments were conducted with different stocking sizes (19, 38 and 89 g per fish) and densities (500, 1,500 and 3,000 fish per ha) of snakehead murrel. The prey selection and feeding strategy of the introduced snakehead murrel change with size. The non-stocked riceland prawn (Macrobrachium lanchesteri D.) and small indigenous fish species (Esomus longimanus L. and Trichogaster trichopterus P.) are important preys for snakehead murrel within the size class 64 to 99 g per fish. When the size of snakehead murrel increases further, they capture larger non-stocked indigenous fish (Trichogaster trichopterus P. and Anabas testudineus B.), followed by stocked fish species (common carp, Nile tilapia, silver barb and snakehead murrel). The snakehead murrel production parameters and their effect on other stocked fish production are analyzed in Chapter 7. The net production of snakehead murrel in concurrent rice-fish fields system was dependent on their stocking size and density, as this influenced their intraspecific competition for natural food items and cannibalism. Small stocking size snakehead murrel (about 20 g per fish) and low stocking densities (500 fish per ha) present the better results concerning survival rates, net production and return above fingerling cost of snakehead murrel. The stocked snakehead murrel, applied at different sizes, or densities, did not adversely affect the net production of stocked white fish. Nevertheless, after four months culture the estimated return above fingerling cost for stocked snakehead murrel was two times lower than the cost for fence construction preventing them from escaping. For this reason, it is not recommended to incorporate snakehead murrel in concurrent rice-fish fields. Further research is still needed to improve snakehead murrel production in concurrent rice-fish system in order to make it economically profitable.In brief, this study suggests that in the flood-prone region of the MD, next to the concurrent rice-fish systems, the 2R-FP could replace the commonly practiced 2RM and 3RM from an economical and ecological point of view. Applying (1) polyculture with common carp and bighead carp, (2) a lower common carp stocking density, and (3) a partial fish harvesting strategy, is advisable to improve the net yield and profit of fish pen culture in the 2R-FP. Further controlled experiments are needed in order to pinpoint critical fish stocking rates as well as to better quantify synergistic interactions between fish pen culture and rice production to further enhance the economic performance of these combined agricultural systems. In concurrent rice-fish systems, climbing perch can be incorporated in order to enhance the biological control of rice pests, especially BPH. On the other hand, under our experimental conditions it is not recommended to incorporate snakehead murrel in concurrent rice-fish fields.The estimated direct return above fingerling cost for stocked snakehead murrel is too low after four months of culture. Improvement of snakehead murrel production in concurrent rice-fish fields is needed to make the stocking of this species profitable. ; Table of contents Acknowledgments iii Abbreviations iv Table of contents vi Chapter 1 General introduction 1 Part A Rotational rice-fish farming systems 27 Chapter 2 Profit versus ecological considerations - rotational rice-fish farming systems as an alternative to rice monoculture systems 29 Chapter 3 Factors affecting fish yield and profit in fish pen culture in flooded ricefields 53 Part B Incorporation in concurrent rice-fish systems of indigenous black fish next to the major stocked white fish species 79 Chapter 4 Natural food use and production parameters of climbing perch (Anabas testudineus Bloch) in a concurrent rice-fish system 81 Chapter 5 Investigation of the predation potential of different fish species on brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens (Stål)) in experimental rice-fish aquariums and tanks 103 Chapter 6 Feeding habits of snakehead murrel (Channa striata Bloch) in concurrent rice-fish systems 125 Chapter 7 Production parameters of the snakehead murrel (Channa striata Bloch) and the impact on fish polyculture in concurrent rice-fish systems 153 Chapter 8 General discussion and perspectives 175 References 195 Summary (English) 213 Summary (Dutch) 217 Curriculum vitae 223 List of publications 224 ; nrpages: 226 ; status: published","2011","2024-03-01 05:50:32","2024-03-01 05:50:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated farming systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Penaeids are one of the most important fishery resources worldwide, and in Mozambique they are the basis of a profitable commercial fishery, landing hundreds of tons per year. Ecological knowledge concerning habitat use and factors driving the distribution and abundance of shrimp in nursery areas, and regarding the successful movement of juveniles from the nurseries to adult grounds, are critical to characterize productive nurseries for penaeid shrimp and provide important information for a sustainable management of their fishery. In this thesis I used a combination of stable isotope methods, ecotoxicology techniques and extensive field studies to assess feeding behaviour and factors affecting density and distribution of four shrimp species (Metapenaeus monoceros, M. stebbingi, Penaeus indicus and P. japonicus) in three estuaries (Espírito Santo, Maputo river and Incomati river) and two coastal marine areas (Bembe and Inhaca Island) in Maputo Bay, the second greatest shrimp fishing ground in Mozambique, to assess their values as nursery areas for the fishery. Stable isotope analyses showed that the assessed shrimp species were mainly using seagrass beds and shallow sand and mud flats as feeding grounds, whereas only P. indicus appeared to also feed within the mangrove habitat. The analysis of metals concentration in shrimp showed no indication of elevated levels, and although levels for pesticides in the water exceed environmental thresholds in some of the nursery areas, only a localized effect of insecticides was detected in P. indicus in Espírito Santo estuary. In Maputo Bay, juvenile shrimp were found to use many different types of coastal environments as nursery areas, including both estuarine and coastal marine areas, where different environmental and landscape factors appeared to control shrimp densities in seemingly ...","2017","2024-03-01 05:50:32","2024-03-01 05:50:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","","","Acetyl cholinesterase; Butyryl cholinesterase; Carbon and nitrogen isotopes; Decapods; Diet; Estuaries; Metals; Nursery ground value; Penaeidae; Shallow water; Southeast Africa; Tropics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
