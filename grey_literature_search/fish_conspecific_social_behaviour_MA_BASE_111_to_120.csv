To accomplish the purpose of this study, Piedecuesta strain (collected in the field) and Rockefeller strain were used. In both cases, the total proteins and cholinesterase rates were quantified. In the case of the larvae that had been previously exposed to sublethal concentration of the insecticides, residual cholinergic activity was determined, as well as the type of inhibition caused by the AChE. The results of the research showed that the wild-type strain was highly resistant to Malathion and Chlorpyrifos; it was also registered that 14 of the tested piperidines, by acting as mixed-type cholinergic inhibitors, are a promising alternative to control the populations of larvae due to their high toxicity. ; Magister en Ciencias y Tecnologías Ambientales ; http://www.ustabuca.edu.co/ustabmanga/presentacion ; Maestría","2021","2024-03-01 05:47:59","2024-03-01 05:47:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad Santo Tomás ; Maestría Ciencias y Tecnologías Ambientales ; Facultad de Química Ambiental","","spa","","","","","","","","","","","Acetilcolinesterasa; Acetylcholinesterase; Aedes aegypti; Compuestos organofosforados; Enzimas - Análisis; Enzymatic activity; Expresión enzimática; Insecticidas; Insectos vectores; Larvas de insectos; Mosquitos; Organofosforados; Organophosphate; Piperidinas; Piperidines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both compounds are highly neurotoxic to fish, but each with distinct biological target sites and mechanisms of action. We used common biochemical and physiological indicators of toxicity, and correlated these effects with potentially significant behavioral alterations. For chlorpyrifos, the mechanism of toxic action is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) throughout the peripheral and central nervous system. Here, we conducted biochemical assays of AChE activity in brain and muscle tissues after exposing steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (0. kisutch) to chlorpyrifos for 96 hours. We then correlated the AChE inhibition with behavioral impairment in swimming and feeding activities. In juvenile steelhead and coho exposed to 0.6-2.5 μg/L chlorpyrifos, AChE activity was inhibited between ~10-65%. This biochemical indicator was significantly correlated with changes in behavioral patterns. Spontaneous swimming rates were reduced ~30-80% in the exposed fish, and strikes at food items (brine shrimp) were reduced ~10-70%. For copper and some other neurotoxicants, the olfactory nervous system is a sensitive target site in fish. The highly-developed olfactory system in salmonids is particularly susceptible to toxic insult by dissolved chemicals since receptor neurons are in direct contact with the aquatic environment. Here, we used electrophysiological techniques to record odor-evoked responses from the sensory epithelium and the olfactory bulb as direct measures of olfactory function in juvenile coho salmon. In fish exposed to copper, chlorpyrifos, or esfenvalerate for 7 days, field potentials recorded from the sensory epithelium and the olfactory bulb showed reduced or obscured olfactory responses to two classes of odorants, which activate non-overlapping populations ...","","2024-03-01 05:48:00","2024-03-01 05:48:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","Oregon State University","","English [eng]","","","","","","","","","","","Chlorpyrifos -- Environmental aspects; Copper -- Environmental aspects; Salmonidae -- Effect of pesticides on; Salmonidae -- Effect of pollution on","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, not all of these factors have been investigated. This research looked into the links between information sources and the use of pesticides; and focused particularly on the attitudes and behaviour of farmers towards both these aspects. A review of several models proposed to explain attitudes and behaviour was undertaken and Fishbein and Ajzen’s model was chosen to investigate farmers attitudes and behaviour towards information sources and pesticide use. The first, preliminary, survey of farmers in West Sussex produced an unexpected result: that they did not apply pesticides as many times as they had indicated at the beginning of the growing season. Systems analysis using the Failures methodology identified areas where anomalies had occurred. It also showed that systems of crop protection were dynamic.","1997","2024-03-01 05:48:00","2024-03-01 05:48:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Health risk factors in this sector really need comprehensive handling. The health problems faced in the agricultural sector are very triggering for workers who cannot be separated from the use of pesticides. Many farmers behave unsafely and do not comply with the procedures for using pesticides, so they are at high risk of experiencing subjective health complaints such as headaches, difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blurred vision and itching of the skin, so it is important to conduct this research. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between pesticide use and subjective health complaints among farmers in the lowlands of Majasto Village, Tawangsari District, Sukoharjo Regency. The type of research used is quantitative with a correlation-analytic observational research design with a cross-sectional study approach. The sampling technique in this study was carried out by purposive sampling with a total sample of 64 respondents. Statistical test using the fisher exact correlation test. The conclusion of this study shows that there is a relationship between the use of pesticides and the incidence of subjective health complaints in farmers with a p-value (0.000 <0.05) while there is no relationship between the use of PPE and subjective health complaints in farmers with a p-value (1,000 > 0.05). it is advisable to use pesticides to adjust the dosage for the use of agar contained on the pesticide packaging label and it is advisable to use PPE completely and use it according to the recommendations.","2022","2024-03-01 05:48:00","2024-03-01 05:48:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","RA0421 Public health.

Toxicity was ranked and compared to the ranked toxicity of the same compounds in rats and mice. Toxic mechanism was also examined through cholinesterase activity assays performed on worms exposed to 8 of the 15 OPs. A significant correlation was found between rank order of toxicity in C. elegans and rats and mice. Cholinesterase inhibition by some OPs was also confirmed in C. elegans.
