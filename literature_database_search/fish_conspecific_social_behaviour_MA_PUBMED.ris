AB  - Excessively used pesticides in agricultural areas are spilled into aquatic environments, wherein they are suspended or sedimented. Owing to climate change,  herbicides are the fastest growing sector of the pesticide industry and are  detected in surface water, groundwater, and sediments near agricultural areas. In  freshwater, organisms, including mussels, snails, frogs, and fish, are exposed to  various types and concentrations of herbicides. Invertebrates are sensitive to  herbicide exposure because their defense systems are incomplete. At the top of  the food chain in freshwater ecosystems, fish show high bioaccumulation of  herbicides. Herbicide exposure causes reproductive toxicity and population  declines in freshwater organisms and further contamination of fish used for  consumption poses a risk to human health. In addition, it is important to  understand how environmental factors are physiologically processed and assess  their impacts on reproductive parameters, such as gonadosomatic index and steroid  hormone levels. Zebrafish is a good model for examining the effects of herbicides  such as atrazine and glyphosate on embryonic development in freshwater fish. This  review describes the occurrence and role of herbicides in freshwater environments  and their potential implications for the reproduction and embryonic development  of freshwater organisms.

AB  - Olfaction conveys critical environmental information to fishes, enabling activities such as mating, locating food, discriminating kin, avoiding predators  and homing. All of these behaviors can be impaired or lost as a result of  exposure to toxic contaminants in surface waters. Historically, teleost olfaction  studies have focused on behavioral responses to anthropogenic contaminants (e.g.,  avoidance). More recently, there has been a shift towards understanding the  underlying mechanisms and functional significance of contaminant-mediated changes  in fish olfaction. This includes a consideration of how contaminants affect the  olfactory nervous system and, by extension, the downstream physiological and  behavioral processes that together comprise a normal response to naturally  occurring stimuli (e.g., reproductive priming or releasing pheromones). Numerous  studies spanning several species have shown that ecologically relevant exposures  to common pollutants such as metals and pesticides can interfere with fish  olfaction and disrupt life history processes that determine individual survival  and reproductive success. This represents one of the pathways by which toxic  chemicals in aquatic habitats may increasingly contribute to the decline and  at-risk status of many commercially and ecologically important fish stocks.  Despite our emerging understanding of the threats that pollution poses for  chemical communication in aquatic communities, many research challenges remain.  These include: (1) the determination of specific mechanisms of toxicity in the  fish olfactory sensory epithelium; (2) an understanding of the impacts of complex  chemical mixtures; (3) the capacity to assess olfactory toxicity in fish in situ;  (4) the impacts of toxins on olfactory-mediated behaviors that are still poorly  understood for many fish species; and (5) the connections between sublethal  effects on individual fish and the long-term viability of wild populations. This  review summarizes and integrates studies on fish olfaction-contaminant  interactions, including metrics ranging from the molecular to the behavioral, and  highlights directions for future research.

AB  - Glyphosate is the active ingredient of some of the most highly produced and used herbicides worldwide. The intensive applications of glyphosate-based herbicides  and its half-life in water lead to its presence in many aquatic ecosystems.  Whereas recent studies have reported neurotoxic effects of glyphosate including  autism-related effects, most of them used extremely high (mg/L to g/L)  concentrations, so it is still unclear if chronic, low environmentally relevant  concentrations of this compound (ng/L to μg/L) can induce neurotoxicity. In this  study we analyzed the neurotoxicity of glyphosate in adult zebrafish after  waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 3 μg/L)  for two weeks. Our data showed that exposed fish presented a significant  impairment of exploratory and social behaviors consistent with increased anxiety.  The anterior brain of the exposed fish presented a significant increase in  dopamine and serotonin levels, as well as in the DOPAC/dopamine and homovanillic  acid/dopamine turnover ratios. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in the  dopaminergic system, as th1, th2, comtb, and scl6a3 was downregulated. Finally,  the brain of exposed fish presented a significant increase in the catalase and  superoxide dismutase activities, with a concomitant decrease of glutathione  stores. These changes in the antioxidant defense system are consistent with the  observed increase in oxidative stress, reflected by the increase in the levels of  lipid peroxidation in the brain. The presented results show that current  glyphosate concentrations commonly found in many aquatic ecosystems may have  detrimental consequences on fish survival by decreasing exploration of the  environment or altering social interactions. Furthermore, as zebrafish is also a  vertebrate model widely used in human neurobehavioral studies, these results are  relevant not only for environmental risk assessment, but also for understanding  the risk of chronic low-dose exposures on human health.

T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - Biologically active compounds used in agriculture that develop near aquatic environments easily spill into rivers or lakes. As a result, insecticides,  herbicides and fungicides are observed worldwide in aquatic environments and  accumulated in aquatic organism. Many insecticides, including organochlorine and  organophosphate, have long been banned long ago because of their high persistence  and non-target toxicity. However, previous studies have shown that persistent  pesticides remain in aquatic organisms. The immune system is the first defense  mechanism against exposure to persistent organic pollutants or pesticides that  have been released into the aquatic environment. Many insecticides have been  reported to cause immunotoxicity, which is represented by alteration of  phagocytic and lysozyme activity. Recent studies show that immunotoxicity by  insecticides exerts a more complex mechanism in fish. Insecticides induce  immunotoxic effects, such as the release of inflammatory cytokines from head  kidney macrophages and inhibition of immune cell proliferation in fish, which can  lead to death in severe cases. Even currently used pesticides, such as  pyrethroid, with low bioaccumulation have been shown to induce  immunotoxicological effects in fish when exposed continuously. Therefore, this  review describes the types and bioaccumulation of insecticides that cause  immunotoxicity and detailed immunotoxicological mechanisms in fish tissues.

AB  - Glyphosate has become the most widely used herbicide in the world, due to the wide scale adoption of transgenic glyphosate resistant crops after its  introduction in 1996. Glyphosate may be used alone, but it is commonly applied as  an active ingredient of the herbicide Roundup(®). This pesticide contains several  adjuvants, which may promote an unknown toxicity. The indiscriminate application  poses numerous problems, both for the health of the applicators and consumers,  and for the environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death  of plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is quickly gaining popularity in  behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals, sensitivity  to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost, short spawning  intervals, external fertilization, transparency of embryos through larval stages,  and rapid development. The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of  glyphosate and Roundup(®) on behavioral and morphological parameters in zebrafish  larvae and adults. Zebrafish larvae at 3days post-fertilization and adults were  exposed to glyphosate (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5mg/L) or Roundup(®) (0.01, 0.065, and  0.5mg/L) for 96h. Immediately after the exposure, we performed the analysis of  locomotor activity, aversive behavior, and morphology for the larvae and  exploratory behavior, aggression and inhibitory avoidance memory for adult  zebrafish. In zebrafish larvae, there were significant differences in the  locomotor activity and aversive behavior after glyphosate or Roundup(®) exposure  when compared to the control group. Our findings demonstrated that exposure to  glyphosate at the concentration of 0.5mg/L, Roundup(®) at 0.065 or 0.5mg/L  reduced the distance traveled, the mean speed and the line crossings in adult  zebrafish. A decreased ocular distance was observed for larvae exposed at 0.5mg/L  of glyphosate. We verified that at 0.5mg/L of Roundup(®)-treated adult zebrafish  demonstrated a significant impairment in memory. Both glyphosate and Roundup(®)  reduced aggressive behavior. Our data suggest that there are small differences  between the effects induced by glyphosate and Roundup(®), altering morphological  and behavioral parameters in zebrafish, suggesting common mechanisms of toxicity  and cellular response.

T2  - Mutation research. Genetic toxicology and environmental mutagenesis
AB  - Epigenetics can play a role in interactions between chemicals and exposed species, between species and abiotic ecosystem components or between species of  the same or another population in a community. Technological progress and  advanced insights into epigenetic processes have led to the description of  epigenetic features (mainly DNA methylation) in many ecologically relevant  species: algae, plants, several invertebrates and fish. Epigenetic changes in  plants, insects and cladocerans have been reported to be induced by various  environmental stress factors including nutrition or water deficiency, grazing,  light or temperature alterations, social environment, and dissolved organic  matter concentrations. As regards chemicals, studies in rats and mice exposed to  specific pesticides, hydrocarbons, dioxins, and endocrine disrupting chemicals  demonstrated the induction of epigenetic changes, suggesting the need for further  research with these substances in an ecotoxicological context. In fish and  plants, exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and soluble fractions of  solid waste affected the epigenetic status. A novel concept in ecotoxicological  epigenetics is the induction of transgenerational stress resistance upon chemical  exposure, as demonstrated in rice exposed to metals. Evaluating epigenetics in  ecotoxicological field studies is a second relatively new approach. A cryptic  lineage of earthworms had developed arsenic tolerance in the field, concurrent  with specific DNA methylation patterns. Flatfish caught in the framework of  environmental monitoring had developed tumours, exhibiting specific DNA  methylation patterns. Two main potential implications of epigenetics in an  ecotoxicological context are (1) the possibility of transgenerationally  inherited, chemical stress-induced epigenetic changes with associated phenotypes  and (2) epigenetically induced adaptation to stress upon long-term chemical  exposure. Key knowledge gaps are concerned with the causality of the relation  between epigenetic and phenotypic changes, the persistence of transgenerational  effects, the implications at population level and the costs of tolerance.  Epigenetic changes following exposure to multiple stressors constitute another  promising area of further research.

AB  - Edwardsiella piscicida is an Enterobacteriaceae that is abundant in water and causes food and waterborne infections in fish, animals, and humans. The bacterium  causes Edwardsiellosis in farmed fish and can lead to severe economic losses in  aquaculture worldwide. E. piscicida is an intracellular pathogen that can also  cause systemic infection. Type III and type VI secretion systems are the  bacterium's most lethal weapons against host defenses. It also possesses  multi-antibiotic resistant genes and is selected and enriched in the environment  due to the overuse of antibiotics. Therefore, the bacterium has great potential  to contribute to the evolution of the resistome. All these properties have made  this bacterium a perfect model to study bacteria virulence mechanisms and the  spread of antimicrobial genes in the environment. We summarize recent advance in  E. piscicida biology and provide insights into future research in virulence  mechanisms, vaccine development and novel therapeutics.

AB  - Atrazine and Diuron are widely used herbicides. The use of pesticides contaminates the aquatic environment, threatening biodiversity and non-target  organisms such as fish. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute  exposure for 96 h hours to atrazine and diuron commercial formulations in  zebrafish (Danio rerio, wild-type AB) embryos and larvae and adult stages. We  observed a significant concentration-dependent survival decrease and hatching  delays in animals exposed to both herbicides and in the frequency of  malformations compared to the control groups. Morphological defects included  cardiac edema, tail reduction, and head malformation. At 7 days  post-fertilization (dpf), atrazine exposure resulted in a reduction in the head  length at 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L and increased the ocular distance at 1, 2, 2.5, and  5 mg/L atrazine when compared to controls. At the same age, diuron increased the  ocular distance in animals exposed to diuron (1.0 and 1.5 mg/L) and no effects  were observed on the head length. We also evaluated a behavioral repertoire in  larvae at 7 dpf, and there were no significant differences in distance traveled,  mean speed, time in movement, and thigmotaxis for atrazine and diuron when  animals were individually placed in a new environment. The cognitive ability of  the larvae was tested at 7 dpf for avoidance and optomotor responses, and neither  atrazine nor diuron had significant impacts when treated groups were compared to  their corresponding controls. Adults' behavior was evaluated 7 and 8 days after  the end of the acute herbicide exposure. Exploration of a new environment and  associated anxiety-like parameters, social interaction, and aggressiveness were  not altered. Our results highlight the need for further studies on the sublethal  effects of both herbicides and the consideration of the effects of commercial  formulas vs. isolated active ingredients. It also emphasizes the need to take  sublethal effects into consideration when establishing the environmental limits  of residues.

AB  - Mitochondria are central players in host immunometabolism as they function not only as metabolic hubs but also as signaling platforms regulating innate  immunity. Environmental exposures to mitochondrial toxicants occur widely and are  increasingly frequent. Exposures to these mitotoxicants may pose a serious threat  to organismal health and the onset of diseases by disrupting immunometabolic  pathways. In this study, we investigated whether the Complex I inhibitor rotenone  could alter C. elegans immunometabolism and disease susceptibility. C. elegans  embryos were exposed to rotenone (0.5 µM) or DMSO (0.125%) until they reached the  L4 larval stage. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by rotenone and  disruption of mitochondrial metabolism were evidenced by rotenone-induced  detrimental effects on mitochondrial efficiency and nematode growth and  development. Next, through transcriptomic analysis, we investigated if this  specific but mild mitochondrial stress that we detected would lead to the  modulation of immunometabolic pathways. We found 179 differentially expressed  genes (DEG), which were mostly involved in detoxification, energy metabolism, and  pathogen defense. Interestingly, among the down-regulated DEG, most of the known  genes were involved in immune defense, and most of these were identified as  commonly upregulated during P. aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, rotenone  increased susceptibility to the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14). However,  it increased resistance to Salmonella enterica (SL1344). To shed light on  potential mechanisms related to these divergent effects on pathogen resistance,  we assessed the activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response  (UPR(mt)), a well-known immunometabolic pathway in C. elegans which links  mitochondria and immunity and provides resistance to pathogen infection. The  UPR(mt) pathway was activated in rotenone-treated nematodes further exposed for  24 h to the pathogenic bacteria P. aeruginosa and S. enterica or the common  bacterial food source Escherichia coli (OP50). However, P. aeruginosa alone  suppressed UPR(mt) activation and rotenone treatment rescued its activation only  to the level of DMSO-exposed nematodes fed with E. coli. Module-weighted  annotation bioinformatics analysis was also consistent with UPR(mt) activation in  rotenone-exposed nematodes consistent with the UPR being involved in the  increased resistance to S. enterica. Together, our results demonstrate that the  mitotoxicant rotenone can disrupt C. elegans immunometabolism in ways likely  protective against some pathogen species but sensitizing against others.

T2  - The Indian journal of medical research
AB  - One of the main reasons for the set-back in the urban malaria control programme is the peculiar biobehaviour of the principal urban malaria vector Anopheles  stephensi. Certain relevant facts such as incrimination as the vector of malaria,  sibling or biological species, resting habitat, manlanding behaviour, seasonal  prevalence, blood meal analysis, longevity, parity status, daily survival and  mortality rates of adults, breeding habitats and vertical distribution of larvae  of An. stephensi have been discussed. Determination of density of the vector  using various parameters and their relation to malaria endemicity in an urban  situation have been reviewed. An. stephensi has become resistant to DDT, HCH,  malathion and propoxur in many places in India. Hence for control source  reduction, use of predators such as fish and biolarvicides such as Bacillus  thuringiensis var israelensis H14 and B. sphaericus, personal protection, i.e.,  use of appropriate clothing, bed nets, indigenous repellents, etc., information,  education and communication (IEC) are to be stressed.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the socio-environmental and health effects of sugarcane crops in a county in the Zona da Mata of the state of Pernambuco,  Brazil. A collective mapping was carried out with use of social cartography. The  issues investigated were plotted on maps, whose final versions were elaborated by  means of the ArcGIS 10.2 software. The study was carried out in the district of  Tejucupapo, located in the municipality of Goiana, selected due to its proximity  to the sugarcane fields. In the environment there was an increase in  deforestation, mangrove degradation, silting of rivers, reduction of fish and  contamination of water and other crops by pesticides and sewage. For health,  respiratory problems were pointed out by sugarcane burning, pesticide poisoning  and the precariousness of the governmental health care. In the socio-cultural  dimension, conflicts related to land use and occupation were identified, with  loss, expropriation and destruction of historical objects and symbols of the  community, reflecting the loss of cultural identity. The problems related to  sugarcane production severely affect human health and destroy the territory both  in its environmental aspects and the very identity construction of the community,  threatening traditional livelihoods.

AB  - There is a growing recognition of the challenges associated with ensuring good nutrition for all without compromising the environment. This is particularly true  for aquaculture, given the reliance on marine extraction for key feed  ingredients, yet at the same time it delivers key nutrients such as omega-3 long  chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. This review will consider progress in  transitioning away from oceanic-derived fish oils as feed ingredients, focusing  on the emerging transgenic plant sources of these fatty acids. Specific  consideration is given to the "validation" phase of this process, in which oils  from GM plants are used as substitutes for bona fide fish oils in aquafeed diets.  Equally, consideration is given to the demonstration of "real-world" potential by  GM field trials. Collectively, the status of these new plant-based sources of  omega-3 fish oils confirm the arrival of a new wave of plant biotech products, 25  years after the introduction of herbicide-tolerant input traits and demonstrate  the power of GM agriculture to contribute to food security and operating within  planetary boundaries.

AB  - The presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living organisms was described more than 60 years ago and virtually immediately it was suggested that ROS were  involved in various pathological processes and aging. The state when ROS  generation exceeds elimination leading to an increased steady-state ROS level has  been called "oxidative stress." Although ROS association with many pathological  states in animals is well established, the question of ROS responsibility for the  development of these states is still open. Fish represent the largest group of  vertebrates and they inhabit a broad range of ecosystems where they are subjected  to many different aquatic contaminants. In many cases, the deleterious effects of  contaminants have been connected to induction of oxidative stress. Therefore,  deciphering of molecular mechanisms leading to such contaminant effects and  organisms' response may let prevent or minimize deleterious impacts of oxidative  stress. This review describes general aspects of ROS homeostasis, in particular  highlighting its basic aspects, modification of cellular constituents, operation  of defense systems and ROS-based signaling with an emphasis on fish systems. A  brief introduction to oxidative stress theory is accompanied by the description  of a recently developed classification system for oxidative stress based on its  intensity and time course. Specific information on contaminant-induced oxidative  stress in fish is covered in sections devoted to such pollutants as metal ions  (particularly iron, copper, chromium, mercury, arsenic, nickel, etc.), pesticides  (insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides) and oil with accompanying pollutants.  In the last section, certain problems and perspectives in studies of oxidative  stress in fish are described.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense) is one of the weeds that evolves resistance to glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)-glycine], the most widely used  herbicide, and the weed may cause agronomic troublesome in the southern USA. This  paper reports a study on developing a hyperspectral plant sensing approach to  explore the spectral features of glyphosate-resistant (GR) and  glyphosate-sensitive (GS) plants to evaluate this approach using machine learning  algorithms to differentiate between GR and GS plants. RESULTS: On average, GR  plants have higher spectral reflectance compared with GS plants. The sensitive  spectral bands were optimally selected using the successive projections algorithm  respectively wrapped with the machine learning algorithms of k-nearest neighbors  (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) with Fisher linear  discriminant analysis (FLDA) to classify between GS and GS plants. At 3 weeks  after transplanting (WAT) KNN and SVM could not acceptably classify the GR and GS  plants but they improved significantly with the stages to have their overall  accuracies reaching 73% and 77%, respectively, at 5 WAT. RF and FLDA had a better  ability to classify the plants at 3 WAT but RF was low in accuracy at 2 WAT while  FLDA dropped accuracy to 50% at 4 WAT from 57% at 3 WAT and raised it to 73% at 5  WAT. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies were conducted developing the hyperspectral  imaging approach to differentiate GR Palmer amaranth from GS Palmer amaranth and  GR Italian ryegrass from GS Italian ryegrass with classification accuracies of  90% and 80%, respectively. This study demonstrated that the hyperspectral plant  sensing approach could be developed to differentiate GR johnsongrass from  glyphosate-sensitive GS johnsongrass with the highest classification accuracy of  77%. The comparison with our previous studies indicated that the similar  hyperspectral approach could be used and transferred from classification across  different GR and GS weed biotypes, such as Palmer amaranth, Italian ryegrass and  johnsongrass, so it is highly possible for classification of more other GR and GS  weed biotypes as well. On the basis of classic pattern recognition approaches the  process of plant classification can be enhanced by modeling using machine  learning algorithms. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Difenoconazole (DCZ) is a triazole fungicide that negatively affects aquatic organisms and humans. However, data regarding the reproductive toxicity of DCZ  are insufficient. In this study, we used zebrafish (from 2 h post-fertilization  [hpf] to adulthood) as a model to evaluate whether DCZ at environmentally  relevant concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 μg/L) induces reproductive toxicity.  After exposure to DCZ, egg production and fertilization rates were reduced by 1.0  and 10.0 μg/L. A significant decrease in gamete frequency (late vitellogenic  oocytes and spermatozoa) was observed at 10.0 μg/L. The concentrations of  17β-estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and vitellogenin (VTG) were disrupted in  females and males by 1.0 and 10.0 μg/L. Exposure to 10.0 μg/L DCZ significantly  inhibited the contact time between female and male fish, which was mainly  achieved by affecting male fish. The transcription of genes involved in the  hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis was significantly changed after treatment  with DCZ. Overall, these data show that the endocrine-disrupting effect of DCZ on  the zebrafish HPG axis inhibited gamete maturation and disrupted reproductive  behavior, reducing fertility.

AB  - Toxicity imposed by organophosphate pesticides to the freshwater cultivable fish species mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala) was assessed under laboratory conditions.  Healthy juveniles were exposed to chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, and their equitoxic  mixture in geometric series. Median lethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos were  found to be 0.906 (0.689-1.179), 0.527 (0.433-0.633), 0.435 (0.366-0.517) and  0.380 (0.319-0.450) mg/L and dichlorvos were found to be 38.432 (33.625-47.866),  22.477 (19.047-26.646), 12.442 (9.619-14.196) and 11.367 (9.496-13.536) mg/L  after 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h of exposure respectively. Surprisingly, the joint  toxicity of these organophosphates in the binary mixture was less than additive  during most of the exposure periods. Behavioral changes exhibited by individual  as well as mixture pesticide treatments were loss of schooling behavior,  aggregating at corners of the test chamber, elevated opercular beatings, surplus  mucus secretion, slight color changes and sudden and rapid body movements before  death. Loss of fish equilibrium was noticed only in chlorpyrifos treated fish,  whereas sluggish behavior was noticed only in mixture pesticide treatment. Such  behavioral studies can be applied as a non-invasive bio-monitoring tool for water  quality assessment for fish growth and development. Despite the same mode of  action of both pesticides, the antagonistic action in the binary mixture is an  interesting outcome of this research that requires further investigation for a  lucid understanding of the joint toxicity mechanism of such pesticides.

AB  - Roundup® is one of the most widely marketed glyphosate-based herbicides in the world. There are many different formulations of this brand that differ from each  other in glyphosate concentration, salts and adjuvants, including surfactants,  which are labelled as "inert" compounds. Several studies have shown that these  formulations are highly toxic to fish, even compared with pure glyphosate.  However, mechanisms underlying this toxicity are not fully understood. In this  context, this study evaluated the effects of exposure to Roundup Original® (RO),  Roundup Transorb® (RT), and Roundup WG® (RWG) on the behavioural patterns of the  livebearer Jenynsia multidentata. This fish naturally inhabits agricultural areas  in southern Brazil and Argentina where glyphosate is used extensively. In the  experiment, animals were exposed to the herbicides for 96 h, at the  environmentally relevant concentration of 0.5 mg/L of glyphosate. Swimming  performance, anxiety, aggressiveness, long-term memory and male sexual activity  were recorded. The formulation RWG negatively affected swimming performance,  thigmotaxia and long-term memory consolidation. Conversely, RT reduced the sexual  performance of males. These results confirm that Roundup® formulations are  extremely harmful and also that they have different targets of toxicity,  affecting behaviours that are essential for fish survival.

AB  - Microplastics and pesticides are emerging contaminants in the marine biota, which cause many harmful effects on aquatic organisms, especially on fish. Fish is a  staple and affordable food source, rich in animal protein, along with various  vitamins, essential amino acids, and minerals. Exposure of fish to microplastics,  pesticides, and various nanoparticles generates ROS and induces oxidative stress,  inflammation, immunotoxicity, genotoxicity, and DNA damage and alters gut  microbiota, thus reducing the growth and quality of fish. Changes in fish  behavioral patterns, swimming, and feeding habits were also observed under  exposures to the above contaminants. These contaminants also affect the Nrf-2,  JNK, ERK, NF-κB, and MAPK signaling pathways. And Nrf2-KEAP1 signalling modulates  redox status marinating enzymes in fish. Effects of pesticides, microplastics,  and nanoparticles found to modulate many antioxidant enzymes, including  superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione system. So, to protect fish  health from stress, the contribution of nano-technology or nano-formulations was  researched. A decrease in fish nutritional quality and population significantly  impacts on the human diet, influencing traditions and economics worldwide. On the  other hand, traces of microplastics and pesticides in the habitat water can enter  humans by consuming contaminated fish which may result in serious health hazards.  This review summarizes the oxidative stress caused due to microplastics,  pesticides and nano-particle contamination or exposure in fish habitat water and  their impact on human health. As a rescue mechanism, the use of nano-technology  in the management of fish health and disease was discussed.

AB  - Marine pollution and bacterial disease outbreaks are two closely related dilemmas that impact marine fish production from fisheries and mariculture. Oil, heavy  metals, agrochemicals, sewage, medical wastes, plastics, algal blooms,  atmospheric pollutants, mariculture-related pollutants, as well as thermal and  noise pollution are the most threatening marine pollutants. The release of these  pollutants into the marine aquatic environment leads to significant ecological  degradation and a range of non-infectious disorders in fish. Marine pollutants  trigger numerous fish bacterial diseases by increasing microbial multiplication  in the aquatic environment and suppressing fish immune defense mechanisms. The  greater part of these microorganisms is naturally occurring in the aquatic  environment. Most disease outbreaks are caused by opportunistic bacterial agents  that attack stressed fish. Some infections are more serious and occur in the  absence of environmental stressors. Gram-negative bacteria are the most frequent  causes of these epizootics, while gram-positive bacterial agents rank second on  the critical pathogens list. Vibrio spp., Photobacterium damselae subsp.  Piscicida, Tenacibaculum maritimum, Edwardsiella spp., Streptococcus spp.,  Renibacterium salmoninarum, Pseudomonas spp., Aeromonas spp., and Mycobacterium  spp. Are the most dangerous pathogens that attack fish in polluted marine aquatic  environments. Effective management strategies and stringent regulations are  required to prevent or mitigate the impacts of marine pollutants on aquatic  animal health. This review will increase stakeholder awareness about marine  pollutants and their impacts on aquatic animal health. It will support competent  authorities in developing effective management strategies to mitigate marine  pollution, promote the sustainability of commercial marine fisheries, and protect  aquatic animal health.

T2  - Journal of environmental management
AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production industry globally and is considered to have the greatest potential to meet the growing demand for seafood  and being a solution to overfishing. Despite the benefits of aquaculture, the  rapid growth and intensification of production (so-called conventional  aquaculture) has raised concerns about food safety, fish welfare, and  environmental and social issues stemming from a tragedy of the commons. These  concerns need to be addressed to enable sustainable aquaculture development.  While the negative environmental impacts of aquaculture have been evaluated using  physical and chemical indicators, the social acceptance has not been fully  considered when evaluating aquaculture sustainability. With this backdrop, our  study investigates knowledge and beliefs towards shrimp aquaculture development  among two key stakeholder groups in Vietnam: the public and producers (shrimp  farmers). Our results show that stakeholders were concerned about the social and  environmental impacts of conventional shrimp aquaculture, although the different  stakeholder groups emphasized different aspects. The public believed biodiversity  loss and the overuse of antibiotics and pesticides to be more problematic  compared to producers, who believed water quality and disease outbreaks were the  main problems facing the industry. Following on from this, most respondents  perceived sustainable aquaculture production positively, implying social  acceptability for its development. Awareness of and knowledge about sustainable  aquaculture positively and significantly affected stakeholders' support for  expansion, suggesting that communication and education may be effective tools for  improving social acceptance of aquaculture.

AB  - Fenpropathrin is one of the widely used pyrethroid pesticides in agriculture and is frequently detected in the environment, groundwater, and food. While  fenpropathrin was found to have neurotoxic effects in mammals, it remains unclear  whether it has similar effects on fish. Here, we used adult zebrafish to  investigate the impacts of fenpropathrin on fish social behaviors and neural  activity. Exposure of adult zebrafish to 500 ppb of fenpropathrin for 72 h  increased anxiety levels but decreased physical fitness, as measured by a novel  tank diving test and swimming tunnel test. Fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared  to spend more time in the conspecific zone of the tank, possibly seeking greater  comfort from their companions. Although learning, memory, and aggressive behavior  did not change, fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to have shorter fighting  durations. The immunocytochemical results showed the tyrosine hydroxylase  antibody-labeled dopaminergic neurons in the teleost posterior tuberculum  decreased in the zebrafish brain. According to a quantitative polymerase chain  reaction (qPCR) analysis of the brain, exposure to fenpropathrin resulted in a  decrease in the messenger (m)RNA expression of monoamine oxidase (mao), an enzyme  that facilitates the deamination of dopamine. In contrast, the mRNA expression of  the sncga gene, which may trigger Parkinson's disease, was found to have  increased. There were no changes observed in expressions of genes related to  antioxidants and apoptosis between the control and fenpropathrin-exposed groups.  We provide evidence to demonstrate the defect of the neurotoxicity of  fenpropathrin toward dopaminergic neurons in adult zebrafish.

T2  - Annual review of pharmacology and toxicology
AB  - The neonicotinoids, the newest major class of insecticides, have outstanding potency and systemic action for crop protection against piercing-sucking pests,  and they are highly effective for flea control on cats and dogs. Their common  names are acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram,  thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam. They generally have low toxicity to mammals (acute  and chronic), birds, and fish. Biotransformations involve some activation  reactions but largely detoxification mechanisms. In contrast to nicotine,  epibatidine, and other ammonium or iminium nicotinoids, which are mostly  protonated at physiological pH, the neonicotinoids are not protonated and have an  electronegative nitro or cyano pharmacophore. Agonist recognition by the  nicotinic receptor involves cation-pi interaction for nicotinoids in mammals and  possibly a cationic subsite for interaction with the nitro or cyano substituent  of neonicotinoids in insects. The low affinity of neonicotinoids for vertebrate  relative to insect nicotinic receptors is a major factor in their favorable  toxicological profile.

AB  - Background: Rotenone (ROT) is currently being used in various research fields, especially neuroscience. Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a  Parkinson’s disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical  spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses  through the blood−brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochondria.  Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the  present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination  with different potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive  behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material  and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT—2.5 µg/L, valproic acid (VPA)—0.5  mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)—250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics  (PROBIO)—3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti-social profile and mirror tests  and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We  observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a)  CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views,  this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal  intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05). Four out of  eight studied groups—(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA—displayed  an impaired, often antithetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on  distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p < 0.05, 0.005, and  0.0005). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT +  PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the  above groups (p > 0.05). Except for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a  normalized trend in terms of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental  groups exhibited exacerbated levels of aggression (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001)  not only near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001).  Conclusions: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement compared with  (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT-treated zebrafish (e−h). Independently of the  aggressive-like reactions and fluctuations among the testing day(s) and groups,  ROT disrupted the social behavior, while VPA promoted a specific typology in  contrast with LEV/CARB.

AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides are widely used in global agriculture, and their effects on different non-target animal organisms have been the focus of many  toxicological studies. Regarding the potential role of glyphosate-based  herbicides as an endocrine disruptor, the present study aims to investigate the  effects of the herbicide Roundup WG® (RWG) on female reproduction, specifically  on the ovarian maturation of Danio rerio. Adult females were exposed to low  concentrations of RWG (0.065, 0.65, and 6.5 mg L(-1)) for 15 days, and then the  ovaries were submitted to structural and morphometric procedures, accompanied by  analysis of the vitellin protein content. Our results showed an increase of  initial ovarian follicle numbers, decrease of late ovarian follicles, and smaller  diameter of ovarian follicles in fish exposed to 0.065 and 6.5 mg L(-1). The  thickness of vitelline envelope was reduced, and the vitellin protein content was  increased in the ovarian follicle in the two highest concentrations.  Ultrastructural changes in the ovarian follicular component were evident and  expressed by the cell index; vacuolization in follicular cells, increase of  perivitelline space, and impaired mitochondria in oocytes were observed.  Therefore, RWG adversely affects the ovarian maturation in D. rerio, and these  changes can lead to reproductive toxicity, compromising population dynamics.

AB  - Pyrethroid insecticides are broadly used. They have low toxicity for warm-blooded living creatures, but high toxicity for both insects and fish. Therefore, it is  important to reduce the environmental impact of pyrethroids. Pyrethroic acids are  chiral compounds. An effective way to decrease pollution is to use enantio-pure  insecticide products instead of their racemic mixtures. Enantiomer-pure products  require enantiomer selective synthesis and analysis. The chiral selective  analysis of pyrethroic acids (an intermediate of pyrethroids) is also important  in terms of process control and from the point of view of their degradation  metabolism in the environment. This study used various enantiomeric selective  chromatographic methods for the separation of different pyrethroic acids,  including gas chromatography, supercritical fluid chromatography and capillary  electrophoresis. Systematic experiments were conducted to find the optimum  conditions for their chiral separation. The employed enantio-selective agents  were cyclodextrin derivatives with different ring sizes and substitution  patterns. The β-cyclodextrin proved to be excellent for the chiral separation of  these acids. The different chiral recognition mechanisms were established using  different ring-sized cyclodextrins. The results of these systematic studies  demonstrated the correlations of the chiral selectivity features of selectors and  the structures of analytes.

AB  - The current study estimates the impact of different common herbicides on antioxidant defenses and histological structure of liver and spinal cord of  juvenile tilapia. Eighty-four fish were divided into seven groups: group 1 fish  acted as controls and the remaining fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations  of acetochlor, bispyribac-sodium, bentazon, bensulfuron-methyl,  halosulfuron-methyl, or quinclorac at sublethal concentrations 2.625, 0.800,  36.00, 2.50, 1.275, and 11.250 mg/l, respectively, for 96 h. Antioxidant  parameters changed in response to some test herbicides and the greatest effects  were caused by exposure to acetochlor and quinelorac for all antioxidant  measurements. Prominent histological changes in liver tissue included loss of  liver architecture and the appearance of fatty liver cells, necrotic areas, foci  of leukocytic infiltration and many apoptotic cells. The most obvious changes in  the spinal cord in all treated fish were degradation of myelinated white matter  fibers with the emergence of empty spaces, large aggregation of pyknotic  neuroglial nuclei, and damaged areas in the dorsal horn of gray matter.  Collectively, the harmful effect of tested herbicides on antioxidant capacity and  significant alterations in histological structures of liver and spinal cord of  Oreochromis niloticus.

T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - The use of agrochemicals has grown in recent years following the increase in agricultural productivity, to eliminate weeds that can compromise crop yields.  The intensive use of these products combined with the lack of treatment of  agricultural wastewater is causing contamination of the natural environments,  especially the aquatics. Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] is the most  commonly used herbicide in agriculture worldwide. Studies have shown that this  compound is toxic to a variety of fish species at the concentrations of  environmental relevance. Glyphosate-based herbicides can affect fish biochemical,  physiological, endocrine, and behavioral pathways. Changes in behaviors such as  foraging, escaping from predators, and courtship can compromise the survival of  species and even communities. The behavior patterns of fish has been shown to be  a sensitive tool for risk assessment. In this sense, this review summarizes and  discusses the toxic effects of glyphosate and its formulations on the behavior of  fish in different life stages. Additionally, behavioral impairments were  associated with other negative effects of glyphosate such as energy imbalance,  stress responses, AChE inhibition, and physiological and endocrine disturbances,  which are evidenced and described in the literature.

AB  - Fipronil is a current use pesticide, widely used in many crops, commonly adsorbed to sediments of aquatic environments. The purpose of this study was to evaluate  the biomarker responses and fipronil distribution pattern in different matrixes  (fish, sediment and water) after juveniles P. lineatus exposure at two  environmental concentrations (5.5 and 82 μg kg(-)(-1)) of fipronil-spiked  sediments. The levels of oxidized proteins (PO), lipid peroxidation (LPO), and  enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione content  (GSH), antioxidant capacity against peroxyls (ACAP) and acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) were evaluated in liver, gills and brain. Concentrations of fipronil and  its metabolites (f. desulfinyl, f sulphpHide and f. sulfone) were quantified by  GC-ECD. F. desulfinyl was the major metabolite found in all matrixes, followed by  f. sulphide in sediments, while f. sulfone was mainly accumulated in fish.  Fipronil promoted oxidative stress in P. lineatus, as evidenced by the increases  in LPO and PO levels and the decrease brain AChE activity. Fish exposed at both  concentrations showed significant decrease in antioxidant capacity. Alterations  in the antioxidant defenses system was evidenced in all organs. These results  suggest that the occurrence of fipronil in aquatic environments can generate  oxidative stress at different levels in P. lineatus, showing that this species is  highly sensitive to the deleterious effects of fipronil and metabolites.

T2  - Biology
AB  - Food allergies are a global food challenge. For correct food labelling, the detection and quantification of allergens are necessary. However, novel product  formulations and industrial processes produce new scenarios, which require much  more technological developments. For this purpose, OMICS technologies, especially  proteomics, seemed to be relevant in this context. This review summarises the  current knowledge and studies that used proteomics to study food allergens. In  the case of the allergenic proteins, a wide variety of isoforms,  post-translational modifications and other structural changes during food  processing can increase or decrease the allergenicity. Most of the plant-based  food allergens are proteins with biological functions involved in storage,  structure, and plant defence. The allergenicity of these proteins could be  increased by the presence of heavy metals, air pollution, and pesticides.  Targeted proteomics like selected/multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) have  been very useful, especially in the case of gluten from wheat, rye and barley,  and allergens from lentil, soy, and fruit. Conventional 1D and 2-DE  immunoblotting have been further widely used. For animal-based food allergens,  the widely used technologies are 1D and 2-DE immunoblotting followed by  MALDI-TOF/TOF, and more recently LC-MS/MS, which is becoming useful to assess  egg, fish, or milk allergens. The detection and quantification of allergenic  proteins using mass spectrometry-based proteomics are promising and would  contribute to greater accuracy, therefore improving consumer information.

AB  - Rotenone, commonly used as a pesticide in agriculture and as a piscicide in aquaculture, is a toxic compound that causes dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in  the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brain. At the neuroendocrine level,  dopamine (DA) drives behavioral (locomotion, emotion, feeding, and social  interactions, etc.) and reproductive functions of fish. In the current  investigation, we examined effects of rotenone toxicity on neurobehavioral and  reproductive functions in whole brain and in selected brain regions in an Indian  freshwater catfish, locally known as gulsha (Mystus cavasius). After fish were  exposed to water containing rotenone at 0, 2.5, 25, and 250 μg/L for 2 days,  significant reductions of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; a DA  metabolite), and their ratio (DOPAC/DA) were observed in whole brain at 250 μg/L  ambient concentrations of rotenone. When fish were treated with rotenone at  250 μg/L concentration for 2 days, there was a significant reduction of DA, DOPAC  and DOPAC/DA in diencephalon, DA and DOPAC in pituitary, and only DA in the  telencephalon, compared with control fish. In parallel, numbers of tyrosine  hydroxylase-positive (TH(+)) neurons declined significantly in the diencephalon  and pituitary after rotenone treatment. Slowed, spontaneous movement and reduced  feeding behavior were observed in rotenone-treated fish. Rotenone treatment  resulted in a significantly higher gonadosomatic index with many mature  vitellogenic oocytes in ovaries and lowered dopaminergic activity in these fish.  These results indicate that rotenone influences neurobehavioral and reproductive  functions through dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in gulsha brain.

AU  - Iqbal, Hafiz M. N.
T2  - Medicines (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - Plant-based secondary metabolites with medicinal potentialities such as defensins are small, cysteine-rich peptides that represent an imperative aspect of the  inherent defense system. Plant defensins possess broad-spectrum biological  activities, e.g., bactericidal and insecticidal actions, as well as antifungal,  antiviral, and anticancer activities. The unique structural and functional  attributes provide a nonspecific and versatile means of combating a variety of  microbial pathogens, i.e., fungi, bacteria, protozoa, and enveloped viruses. Some  defensins in plants involved in other functions include the development of metal  tolerance and the role in sexual reproduction, while most of the defensins make  up the innate immune system of the plants. Defensins are structurally and  functionally linked and have been characterized in various eukaryotic  microorganisms, mammals, plants, gulls, teleost species of fish, mollusks, insect  pests, arachnidan, and crustaceans. This defense mechanism has been improved  biotechnologically as it helps to protect plants from fungal attacks in  genetically modified organisms (GMO). Herein, we review plant defensins as  secondary metabolites with medicinal potentialities. The first half of the review  elaborates the origin, structural variations, and mechanism of actions of plant  defensins. In the second part, the role of defensins in plant defense, stress  response, and reproduction are discussed with suitable examples. Lastly, the  biological applications of plant defensins as potential antimicrobial and  anticancer agents are also deliberated. In summary, plant defensins may open a  new prospect in medicine, human health, and agriculture.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are currently subjected to dual stresses of chemical pollution and climate change. Through a series of laboratory experiments, this study  investigated the impact of exposure to chemical contaminant such as DDT or copper  (Cu), in combination with cold or warm temperature extremes on the marine medaka  fish Oryzias melastigma. The results showed that extreme seawater temperatures  (i.e., 15 and 32 °C in sub-tropical Hong Kong) exacerbated adverse chemical  impacts on the growth performance of O. melastigma, in particular at the high  thermal extreme. This was likely associated with an interruption of oxygen  consumption and aerobic scope. Most importantly, the results of acclimation  experiments, as reflected by thermal tolerance polygons, showed that chemical  exposure substantially narrowed the thermal tolerance of the medaka, making them  more vulnerable to temperature changes and extreme thermal events. Under dual  stresses of thermal extremes and chemical exposure, the medaka switched their  metabolic pathway to anaerobic respiration that might deplete their energy  reserve for chemical detoxification. Although stress proteins such as heat shock  proteins (HSP90) were up-regulated for cellular protection in the fish, such a  defensive mechanism was repressed with intensifying dual stresses at high  temperature and high chemical concentration. Bioconcentration of DDT or Cu  generally increased with increasing temperature and its exposure concentration.  Overall, these complex chemical-temperature interactions concomitantly exerted a  concerted adverse impact to O. melastigma. The temperature-dependent toxicity of  DDT or Cu shown in this study clearly demonstrated the potential challenge  brought by the risk of chemical pollution under the impact of global climate  change.

TI  - Randomised controlled trials and changing public health practice.
AU  - Cockcroft, Anne
T2  - BMC public health
AB  - One reason for doing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is that experiments can be convincing. Early epidemiological experimenters, such as Jenner and the  smallpox vaccine and Snow and his famous Broad Street pump handle, already knew  the answer they were demonstrating; they used the experiments as knowledge  translation devices to convince others.More sophisticated modern experiments  include cluster randomised controlled trials (CRCTs) for experiments in the  public health setting. The knowledge translation value remains: RCTs and CRCTs  can potentially stimulate changes of practice among stakeholders. Capitalising on  the knowledge translation value of RCTs requires more than the standard reporting  of trials. Those who are convinced by a trial and want to act, need to know how  the trial relates to their own context, what contributed to success, and what  might make it even more effective. Implementation research unpacks the  back-story, examining how and why an intervention worked.The Camino Verde trial  of community mobilisation for control of dengue reported a significant impact on  entomological indices of the Aedes aegypti vector, and on serological dengue  virus infection and self-reported dengue cases. This important study should lead  to studies of similar interventions in other contexts, and ultimately to changes  in dengue control practices. This supplement is the back-story of the trial,  providing information to help researchers and planners to make use of the trial  findings.Background articles include the full protocol, a systematic review of  CRCTs of approaches for Aedes aegypti control, epidemiological and entomological  findings from the baseline survey, and how baseline findings were used to set up  the intervention. Secondary analyses of the entomological findings examine  associations with the use of the larvicide temephos, and the impact of the  intervention in different conditions of water supply and seasons.Other articles  describe implementation and other impacts: the underlying approach;  implementation in the trial's different social contexts; the different impact in  women and men; the effects of using fish for vector control; the impact on  household costs of personal protection and of cases of dengue illness; and  ethical issues.We hope this supplement will increase the knowledge translation  value of the Camino Verde trial.

AB  - A sequence of different classes of synthetic insecticides have been used over the past 70 years. Over this period, the widely-used organochlorines were eventually  replaced by organophosphates, with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and  chlorpyrifos (CPF) as the principal prototypes. Considerable research has  characterized the risks of DDT and CPF individually, but little is known about  the toxicology of transitioning from one class of insecticides to another, as has  been commonplace for agricultural and pest control workers. This study used adult  zebrafish to investigate neurobehavioral toxicity following 5-week chronic  exposure to either DDT or CPF, to or their sequential exposure (DDT for 5 weeks  followed by CPF for 5 weeks). At the end of the exposure period, a subset of fish  were analyzed for brain cholinesterase activity. Behavioral effects were  initially assessed one week following the end of the CPF exposure and again at  14 months of age using a behavioral test battery covering sensorimotor responses,  anxiety-like functions, predator avoidance and social attraction. Adult  insecticide exposures, individually or sequentially, were found to modulate  multiple behavioral features, including startle responsivity, social approach,  predator avoidance, locomotor activity and novel location recognition and  avoidance. Locomotor activity and startle responsivity were each impacted to a  greater degree by the sequential exposures than by individual compounds, with the  latter being pronounced at the early (1-week post exposure) time point, but not  3-4 months later in aging. Social approach responses were similarly impaired by  the sequential exposure as by CPF-alone at the aging time point. Fleeing  responses in the predator test showed flee-enhancing effects of both compounds  individually versus controls, and no additive impact of the two following  sequential exposure. Each compound was also associated with changes in  recognition or avoidance patterns in a novel place recognition task in late  adulthood, but sequential exposures did not enhance these phenotypes. The  potential for chemical x chemical interactions did not appear related to changes  in CPF metabolism to the active oxon, as prior DDT exposure did not affect the  cholinesterase inhibition resulting from CPF. This study shows that the effects  of chronic adult insecticide exposures may be relevant to behavioral health  initially and much later in life, and that the effects of sequential exposures  may be unpredictable based on their constituent exposures.

AB  - Atrazine (ATZ) is a frequent contaminant in freshwater ecosystems within agricultural regions. The capacity of this herbicide to interfere with the  vertebrate endocrine system is broadly recognized, but the mechanisms and  responses usually differ among species. In this study, ATZ effects on  hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis key genes expression and early gonadal  development were evaluated in Odontesthes bonariensis larvae waterborne exposed  during the gonadal differentiation period. Fish were treated to 0, 0.7, 7.0, and  70 µg ATZ/L at 25 °C from the 2nd to 6th week after hatching (wah), and a group  was kept in clean water until the 12th wah. Parallelly, a group was submitted to  0.05 µg/L of ethinylestradiol (EE(2)) as a positive estrogenic control. From each  treatment, eight larvae were sampled at 6 wah for gene expression analysis and  twelve larvae at 12 wah for phenotypic sex histological determination. The  expression of gnrh1, lhb, fshb, and cyp19a1b was assessed in the head, and the  ones of amha, 11βhsd2, and cyp19a1a in the trunk. Fish growth was significantly  higher in fish exposed to 7 and 70 µg ATZ/L in the 6 wah, but the effect vanished  at the 12 wah. The expression of lhb was upregulated in both sex larvae exposed  from 7 µg ATZ/L. However, a dimorphic effect was induced on cyp19a1a expression  at 70 µg ATZ/L, up or downregulating mRNA transcription in males and females,  respectively. Delayed ovarian development and increased number of testicular germ  cells were histologically observed from 7 to 70 µg ATZ/L, respectively, and a sex  inversion (genotypic male to phenotypic female) was found in one larva at 70 µg  ATZ/L. The lhb expression was also upregulated by EE(2), but the cyp19a1a  expression was not affected, and a complete male-to-female reversal was induced.  Further, EE(2) upregulated gnrh1 in females and cyp19a1b in both sexes, but it  did not alter any assessed gene in the trunk. In conclusion, ATZ disrupted HPG  axis physiology and normal gonadal development in O. bonariensis larvae at  environmentally relevant concentrations. The responses to ATZ only partially  overlapped and were less active when compared to the model estrogenic compound  EE(2).

AB  - Many natural and synthetic compounds present in the environment exert a number of adverse effects on the exposed organisms, leading to endocrine disruption, for  which they were termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). A decrease in  reproduction success is one of the most well-documented signs of endocrine  disruption in fish. Estrogens are steroid hormones involved in the control of  important reproduction-related processes, including sexual differentiation,  maturation and a variety of others. Careful spatial and temporal balance of  estrogens in the body is crucial for proper functioning. At the final step of  estrogen biosynthesis, cytochrome P450 aromatase, encoded by the cyp19 gene,  converts androgens into estrogens. Modulation of aromatase CYP19 expression and  function can dramatically alter the rate of estrogen production, disturbing the  local and systemic levels of estrogens. In the present review, the current  progress in CYP19 characterization in teleost fish is summarized and the  potential of several classes of EDCs to interfere with CYP19 expression and  activity is discussed. Two cyp19 genes are present in most teleosts, cyp19a and  cyp19b, primarily expressed in the ovary and brain, respectively. Both aromatase  CYP19 isoforms are involved in the sexual differentiation and regulation of the  reproductive cycle and male reproductive behavior in diverse teleost species.  Alteration of aromatase CYP19 expression and/or activity, be it upregulation or  downregulation, may lead to diverse disturbances of the above mentioned  processes. Prediction of multiple transcriptional regulatory elements in the  promoters of teleost cyp19 genes suggests the possibility for several EDC classes  to affect cyp19 expression on the transcriptional level. These sites include cAMP  responsive elements, a steroidogenic factor 1/adrenal 4 binding protein site, an  estrogen-responsive element (ERE), half-EREs, dioxin-responsive elements, and  elements related to diverse other nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator  activated receptor, retinoid X receptor, retinoic acid receptor). Certain  compounds including phytoestrogens, xenoestrogens, fungicides and organotins may  modulate aromatase CYP19 activity on the post-transcriptional level. As is shown  in this review, diverse EDCs may affect the expression and/or activity of  aromatase cyp19 genes through a variety of mechanisms, many of which need further  characterization in order to improve the prediction of risks posed by a  contaminated environment to teleost fish population.

AB  - Deltamethrin, a widely used type II pyrethroid insecticide, was reported with neurotoxicity to aquatic organisms, such as fish. However, the effects and  potential mechanisms on the central nervous system remain largely unknown,  especially under environmental concentrations. Therefore, we exposed adult female  zebrafish to environmentally relevant levels of deltamethrin (30, 100, and 333  ng/L) for 21 days to assess neurobehavioral changes related to the central  nervous system and explore the modes of action. Behavioral assays revealed  significant increases in the swimming speeds, residence time near other fish and  the shoaling cohesion in exposed fish. Transcriptomic results enriched the  disrupted neural functions involving the glutamatergic and dopaminergic synapses  in the brain. The qRT-PCR confirmed the upregulation of the factors for promoting  the glutamate release. The measurement of neurotransmitters showed significantly  increased content of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain.  Taken together, deltamethrin exposure increased the glutamate level and promoted  the release of such an excitatory neurotransmitter between the glutamatergic  synapses in the brain, which eventually led to hyperactivity of social behaviors  in adult zebrafish.

AB  - The herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and the insecticide fipronil have been used widely in agriculture and detected in aquatic ecosystems, where  they threaten wildlife. This study evaluated the whole-body bioconcentration and  the biochemical and morphological changes in the gills of the neotropical fish  Prochilodus lineatus exposed for 96 h to 2,4-D or fipronil as single compounds or  as a mixture (2,4-D + fipronil). Fish exposed to either compound alone  bioconcentrated 2,4-D (77 ± 23 ng g (-) (1) fish dry mass) and fipronil  (789 ± 178 ng g (-) (1) fish dry mass). Fish exposed to 2,4-D + fipronil  bioconcentrated fipronil (683 ± 73 ng g (-) (1) fish dry mass) but not 2,4-D. In  the gills, catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities and the  lipid peroxidation (LPO) level increased after exposure to 2,4-D. GST activity  increased after exposure to fipronil. Conversely, no changes occurred in CAT and  GST activities and LPO upon exposure to 2,4-D + fipronil. Histopathological  changes such as hyperplasia, cellular hypertrophy, epithelial lifting, and  vascular congestion were frequent in the gills of fish exposed to 2,4-D or  fipronil individually or 2,4-D + fipronil. The mitochondria-rich cell (MRC)  density increased on gill surface in fish exposed to fipronil or  2,4-D + fipronil. Only exposure to 2,4-D alone induced oxidative stress in the  gills. Most morphological changes showed defense responses against the  pesticides; however, hypertrophy and the change in MRC indicated compensatory  responses to maintain the gill osmoregulatory function. The 2,4-D + fipronil  mixture showed antagonistic interaction, except for the MRC fractional area at  gill surface, which showed synergistic interaction. This is the first report  showing antagonistic interaction of 2,4-D and fipronil in the gills after  exposing fish to the mixture of both pesticides. The biochemical and  morphological changes in gills endanger the gill functions, a phenomenon that  implies an energy cost for fish.

AB  - Galectin-8 and galectin-9 belong to tandem repeat-type galectins, and in the present study, these two genes were cloned in mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi.  The open reading frame (ORF) of the mandarin fish galectin-8 and galectin-9  contains 942, and 1008 bp, encoding 313 and 335 amino acids, respectively. As a  conserved feature, an N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), and a  C-terminal CRD were observed in each of the two galectins in mandarin fish. In  healthy fish, galectin-8 and -9 were constitutively expressed in all  organs/tissues examined, and their expression can be induced following the  stimulation of LPS and poly(I:C). It is obvious that galectin-8 had a higher  increase at mRNA level following the stimulation of poly(I:C). It is further  demonstrated that mandarin fish galectin-8 inhibited the growth of Flavobacterium  columnare and Streptococcus agalactiae, and in addition to the two species of  bacteria, galectin-9 inhibited also the growth of Edwardsiella piscicida, which  provides the basis for further understanding their antibacterial role in immune  response of mandarin fish.

TI  - DIRS-1 and the other tyrosine recombinase retrotransposons.
AU  - Poulter, R. T. M.
AU  - Goodwin, T. J. D.
T2  - Cytogenetic and genome research
AB  - DIRS-1 is a retroelement from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Until recently only two related retrotransposons had been described: PAT from the  nematode Panagrellus redivivus and Prt1 from the zygomycete fungus Phycomyces  blakesleeanus. Analyses of the reverse transcriptase sequences encoded by these  three elements suggested that they were closely related to each other and more  distantly related to the Ty3/gypsy Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retroelements. They  have several unusual structural features that distinguish them from typical LTR  elements. For instance, they each encode a tyrosine recombinase (YR), but not a  DDE-type integrase or an aspartic protease. Although the DIRS-1-related elements  are bordered by terminal repeats these differ from typical LTRs in a number of  ways. In DIRS-1, for example, the terminal repeats are inverted (complementary),  non-identical in sequence, and the outer edges of the terminal sequences are  repeated (adjacent to each other) in the internal region. PAT has so-called  "split" direct repeats in which the unrelated terminal sequences appear as direct  repeats adjacent to each other in the internal region. The only repetition  displayed by Prt1 is the presence of short inverted terminal repeats, but the  sequenced copy of this element is believed to be a truncated version of an  element with a structure resembling DIRS-1. The unusual structure of the terminal  repeats of the DIRS1-like elements appears to be related to their replication via  free circular intermediates. Site-specific recombination is believed to integrate  the circle without creating duplications of the target sites. In recognition of  these important distinctions it is proposed that the retrotransposons that encode  tyrosine recombinases be called the tyrosine recombinase (or YR)  retrotransposons. Recently a large number of additional YR retrotransposons have  been described, including elements from fungi (zygomycetes and basidiomycetes),  plants (green algae) and a wide range of animals including nematodes, insects,  sea urchins, fish and amphibia, while remnants of elements related to DIRS-1  occur in the human genome. The complete set of YR retrotransposons can be divided  into two major groups, the DIRS elements and the Ngaro elements, the two groups  forming distinct clades on phylogenetic trees based on alignments of RT/RH and  recombinase sequences, and also having some structural distinctions. A third  group of transposable elements, which we call Cryptons, also carry tyrosine  recombinases. These elements do not encode a reverse transcriptase and so are  believed to be DNA transposons not retrotransposons. They have been detected in  several pathogenic fungi, including the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans,  and the ascomycetes Coccidioides posadasii and Histoplasma capsulatum. Sequence  comparisons suggest that the Crypton YRs are related to those of the YR  retrotransposons. We suggest that the YR retrotransposons arose from the  combination of a Crypton-like YR DNA transposon and the RT/RH encoding sequence  of a retrotransposon.

AB  - Pesticides reach aquatic ecosystems and interact with various targets in cells of fish and other living organisms. Toxicity originates during the metabolization  process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase  (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and levels of reduced glutathione  (GSH) indicate toxicants interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant  systems, i.e., they are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We  meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and  variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect  of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker  respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult)  influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex  (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different  classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of  exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and  the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity  increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased  and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD  and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus  (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole  fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of  concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles  and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100%. Additionally, we  identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant  pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of  studies evaluating GSH on female fish. Future researchers may use these gaps as a  guide towards enhanced experimental designs and, consequently, a better  understanding of pesticide toxic effects on fish.

AB  - Understanding the negative impact of a variety of environmental contaminants on aquatic animals is essential to curb biodiversity loss and stop degradation of  ecological functions. Excessive and unrestricted use of pesticides is the most  serious threat to aquatic animals including amphibians and fishes. Among the  known pesticides, glyphosate based formulations have been shown to have lethal  effects on many aquatic organisms. However, negative effects of pesticides on  crucial ecological interactions such as prey-predator interactions are relatively  unknown from tropics. In many aquatic organisms, recognition of predators is  based on odor signatures; and therefore any anthropogenic alteration in water  chemistry has the potential to impair recognition and learning of predators.  Through a series of behavioral experiments we evaluated the effect of glyphosate  based herbicide (Roundup®) on the antipredator behavior of common spiny loach,  Lepidocephalichthys thermalis to understand the effects of pesticide-exposure on  recognition of conspecific alarm cues, and associative learning to avoid  predation. We exposed common spiny loach (for 3 h or 15 days) to sub-lethal  concentration (0.5 mg a.e./L) of Roundup® and subsequently with conspecific alarm  cues, signaling the proximity of a predator. Unexposed prey fish showed a  significant reduction in activity level in response to conspecific alarm cues.  Whereas such alarm response was not observed in prey fish that were exposed to  Roundup® either for 3 h or 15 days. Such lack of response could be associated  with alteration of olfactory function in prey individuals. However, this  inability to detect the conspecific alarm cues was found to be transient and  exposed fish recovered within 2 days. In subsequent experiments, we showed that  Roundup® deactivates the conspecific alarm cues thus making them unavailable for  prey to evoke the response. Furthermore, Roundup® mediated degradation of  conspecific alarm cues and diminished the associative learning necessary for  detection of the invasive/unknown/novel predators. Overall, due to the worldwide  occurrence of glyphosate in water bodies, glyphosate mediated behavioral  suppression exposes the prey animals to a considerable risk of predation, both by  native and non-native predators.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Understanding biotransformation pathways in aquatic species is an integral part of ecological risk assessment with respect to the potential  bioactivation of chemicals to more toxic metabolites. The long-range goal is to  gain sufficient understanding of fish metabolic transformation reactions to be  able to accurately predict fish xenobiotic metabolism. While some metabolism data  exist, there are few fish in vivo exposure studies where metabolites have been  identified and the metabolic pathways proposed. Previous biotransformation work  has focused on in vitro studies which have the advantage of high throughput but  may have limited metabolic capabilities, and in vivo studies which have full  metabolic capacity but are low throughput. An aquatic model system with full  metabolic capacity in which a large number of chemicals could be tested would be  a valuable tool. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study evaluated the ex vivo  rainbow trout liver slice model, which has the advantages of high throughput as  found in vitro models and non-dedifferentiated cells and cell to cell  communication found in in vivo systems. The pesticide diazinon, which has been  previously tested both in vitro and in vivo in a number of mammalian and aquatic  species including rainbow trout, was used to evaluate the ex vivo slice model as  a tool to study biotransformation pathways. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: While somewhat  limited by the analytical chemistry method employed, results of the liver slice  model, mainly that hydroxypyrimidine was the major diazinon metabolite, are in  line with the results of previous rainbow trout in vivo studies. CONCLUSION:  Therefore, the rainbow trout liver slice model is a useful tool for the study of  metabolism in aquatic species.

AB  - Male genital tract birth defects have been associated in previous studies with several prenatal exposures to environmental and dietary risk factors. The purpose  of this study was to explore the association between hypospadias and  cryptorchidism, and the dietary habits of an agricultural population in Italy. A  population-based case-control study was conducted in the Sicilian Province of  Ragusa. Cases (n = 90) and controls (n = 202) included births for the period  1998-2002. Data on dietary habits of the mothers, as well as health-related  social, occupational and environmental exposures prior to and during the index  birth, were collected through interviews. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were  calculated by logistic regression after adjustment for confounding variables.  Increased ORs were observed for mothers of children with hypospadias who, during  pregnancy, frequently consumed fish (OR = 2.33 [95% confidence interval (CI)  1.03, 5.31]) and market-purchased fruit (OR = 5.10 [95% CI 1.31, 19.82]). For  cryptorchidism, increased risk was observed in mothers consuming liver (OR = 5.21  [95% CI 1.26, 21.50]), and smoked products (OR = 2.46 [95% CI 1.15, 5.29]). For  the two malformations pooled together, increased risk was associated with  maternal consumption of liver (OR = 4.38 [95% CI 1.34, 14.26]) and with frequent  consumption of wine (OR = 1.98 [95% CI 1.01, 3.86]). This study suggests that  some maternal dietary factors may play a role in the development of congenital  defects of the male reproductive tract. In particular, our data indicate that  further research may be warranted on the endocrine-disrupting effects resulting  from the bioaccumulation of contaminants (fish, liver), pesticides (marketed  fruit, wine) and/or potentially toxic food components (smoked products, wine,  liver).

AB  - The use of pesticides has been growing along with the demand for agricultural products. These compounds, however, are not restricted to the field, spreading  easily through the soil, contaminating groundwater and reaching urban centers.  Propiconazole is a triazole fungicide that has been increasingly used in  agriculture. However, there are few data about its effects on non-target  organisms. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of propiconazole in  zebrafish. The animals were exposed for 96 h to different concentrations of  propiconazole (425, 850, 1700, 8500 ng/L), then submitted to the novel tank test  for behavioral analyses. The brains were collected for evaluation of oxidative  stress parameters. Exposure to propiconazole (1700 and 8500 ng/L) decreased the  number of crossings, entries, and time spent in the top, and increased the time  spent in the bottom area of the tank. We also observed an increase in the  activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in zebrafish brain exposed to  propiconazole at 425, 850, and 1700 ng/L. We conclude that propiconazole alters  normal fish behavior and disrupts oxidative status. More studies are necessary to  elucidate the exact mechanism underlying the effects of propiconazole on  non-target-organisms.

AB  - Diuron, a commonly used herbicide and antifouling biocide, has been frequently detected in seawater. The effects of diuron on fish behaviour are currently  poorly understood. Herein, the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was  continuously exposed to environmentally realistic levels of diuron from the  fertilised egg stage to the adult stage. Behavioural evaluation of adult marine  medaka indicated that exposure to diuron increased anxiety in the light-dark test  and increased predator avoidance. In addition, diuron exposure significantly  reduced aggression, social interaction, shoaling, and learning and memory  ability. However, only negligible variations in foraging behaviour and in  behaviour in the novel tank test were observed. Marine medaka chronically exposed  to diuron also showed decreased levels of dopamine in the brain, and changes were  observed in the transcription of genes related to dopamine synthesis, degradation  and receptors. Exposure to 5000 ng/L diuron caused significant downregulation of  the expression of the genes of tyrosine hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase and  significantly upregulated the expression of the genes of the D(5) dopaminergic  receptor. The relative expression of the D(4) dopaminergic receptor was  significantly upregulated in the 50, 500 and 5000 ng/L diuron-treated groups.  These findings highlight the significant neurotoxic effects of diuron and the  extent to which this may involve the dopaminergic system of the brain. More  broadly, this study reveals the ecological risk associated with environmentally  realistic levels of diuron in marine animals.

AB  - Model organisms are often used in biological, medical and environmental research. Among insects, Drosophila melanogaster, Galleria mellonella, Apis mellifera,  Bombyx mori, Periplaneta americana, and Locusta migratoria are often used.  However, new model organisms still appear. In recent years, an increasing number  of insect species has been suggested as model organisms in life sciences research  due to their worldwide distribution and environmental significance, the  possibility of extrapolating research studies to vertebrates and the relatively  low cost of rearing. Beetles are the largest insect order, with their  representative - Tribolium castaneum - being the first species with a completely  sequenced genome, and seem to be emerging as new potential candidates for model  organisms in various studies. Apart from T. castaneum, additional species  representing various Coleoptera families, such as Nicrophorus vespilloides,  Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Coccinella septempunctata, Poecilus cupreus, Tenebrio  molitor and many others, have been used. They are increasingly often included in  two major research aspects: biomedical and environmental studies. Biomedical  studies focus mainly on unraveling mechanisms of basic life processes, such as  feeding, neurotransmission or activity of the immune system, as well as on  elucidating the mechanism of different diseases (neurodegenerative,  cardiovascular, metabolic, or immunological) using beetles as models.  Furthermore, pharmacological bioassays for testing novel biologically active  substances in beetles have also been developed. It should be emphasized that  beetles are a source of compounds with potential antimicrobial and anticancer  activity. Environmental-based studies focus mainly on the development and testing  of new potential pesticides of both chemical and natural origin. Additionally,  beetles are used as food or for their valuable supplements. Different beetle  families are also used as bioindicators. Another important research area using  beetles as models is behavioral ecology studies, for instance, parental care. In  this paper, we review the current knowledge regarding beetles as model organisms  and their practical application in various fields of life science.

T2  - Developmental and comparative immunology
AB  - During infection, macrophage lineage cells eliminate infiltrating pathogens through a battery of antimicrobial responses, where the efficacy of these innate  immune responses is pivotal to immunological outcomes. Not surprisingly, many  intracellular pathogens have evolved mechanisms to overcome macrophage defenses,  using these immune cells as residences and dissemination strategies. With  pathogenic infections causing increasing detriments to both aquacultural and wild  fish populations, it is imperative to garner greater understanding of fish  phagocyte antimicrobial responses and the mechanisms by which aquatic pathogens  are able to overcome these teleost macrophage barriers. Insights into the  regulation of macrophage immunity of bony fish species will lend to the  development of more effective aquacultural prophylaxis as well as broadening our  understanding of the evolution of these immune processes. Accordingly, this  review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of teleost macrophage  antimicrobial responses and the strategies by which intracellular fish pathogens  are able to avoid being killed by phagocytes, with a focus on Mycobacterium  marinum.

AB  - Individual and combined toxicities of endosulfan (ENDO) with phenanthrene (PHE) were evaluated using zebrafish (Danio rerio) adults. The 96-h LC(50) values for  ENDO and PHE were 4.6 μg L(-1) and 920 μg L(-1), respectively. To evaluate the  mixture toxicity, LC(10) and LC(50) concentrations were grouped into four  combinations as ENDO-LC(10) + PHE-LC(10), ENDO-LC(10) + PHE-LC(50),  ENDO-LC(50) + PHE-LC(10), and ENDO-LC(50) + PHE-LC(50), and their acute  toxicities were determined. The combination of LC(50)-ENDO and LC(10)-PHE  exhibited a synergistic effect. In addition, acetylcholinesterase activity  decreased in zebrafish bodies exposed to ENDO with or without PHE. Combined  treatments induced higher glutathione S-transferase activity compared to  individual treatments. Carboxylesterase activity increased in both heads and  bodies of ENDO-treated fishes compared with PHE-treated fishes. Using RT-qPCR  technique, CYP1A gene expression significantly up-regulated in all combinations,  whereas CYP3A was unchanged, suggesting that enzymes involved in defense may play  different roles in the detoxification. CYP7A1 gene responsible for bile acid  biosynthesis is dramatically down-regulated after exposure to the synergistic  combination exposure, referring that the synergistic effect may be resulted from  the reduction of bile production in zebrafishes. Among gender-related genes,  CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 genes in female zebrafish decreased after treatment with ENDO  alone and combination of LC(50)-ENDO and LC(10)-PHE. This might be related to a  reduction in cortisol production. The overall results indicated that ENDO and PHE  were toxic to zebrafish adults both individually and in combination, and that  their co-presence induced changes in the expression of genes responsible for  metabolic processes and defense mechanisms.

AU  - Vieira, Carlos Eduardo Delfino

T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - The λ-cyhalothrin (CL) is a globally used pyrethroid insecticide that has been detected in different water bodies worldwide. However, studies on the effects of  CL on freshwater fishes are still incipient. In this context, we evaluated the  acute effects of a commercial formulation containing CL (Karate Zeon(®) CS 50) in  juveniles of the teleost Prochilodus lineatus exposed for 96 h to four  concentrations of the active ingredient (5, 50, 250 and 500 ng.L(-1)).  Biochemical, physiological, and genotoxic biomarkers were evaluated in different  organs of the fish. Exposure to CL induced significant changes in the enzymatic  profiles of P. lineatus, with specific alterations in biotransformation enzymes  and antioxidant defence in different tissues. Lipid peroxidation was observed in  fish gills and kidney. Increases in esterases were observed in the liver of fish  exposed to all CL concentrations evaluated, whereas acetylcholinesterase activity  decreased in the muscles of fish at all concentrations. CL also promoted  osmoregulatory disorders, with decreases in calcium and magnesium gill ATPases,  with consequent hypocalcaemia, in addition an increase in sodium-potassium ATPase  activity was observed in the gills of fish exposed to the highest CL  concentration, probably in order to compensate a reduction in plasma sodium.  Besides, increases in DNA damage were observed in the erythrocytes of fish  exposed to all CL concentrations. Thus, despite the low CL concentrations and the  short exposure time, this pyrethroid caused hematological adjustments, oxidative  stress, osmoregulatory disorders, and DNA damage in P. lineatus, showing that the  species is highly sensitive to the deleterious effects of CL.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of three concentrations of a pesticide mixture on the first development stages of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus  mykiss). The mixture was made up of three commonly used pesticides in  viticulture: glyphosate (GLY), chlorpyrifos (CPF) and copper sulfate (Cu). Eyed  stage embryos were exposed for 3 weeks to three concentrations of the pesticide  mixture. Lethal and sub-lethal effects were assessed through a number of  phenotypic and molecular endpoints including survival, hatching delay, hatching  success, biometry, swimming activity, DNA damage (Comet assay), lipid  peroxidation (TBARS), protein carbonyl content and gene expression. Ten target  genes involved in antioxidant defenses, DNA repair, mitochondrial metabolism and  apoptosis were analyzed using real-time RT-qPCR. No significant increase of  mortality, half-hatch, growth defects, TBARS and protein carbonyl contents were  observed whatever the pesticide mixture concentration. In contrast, DNA damage  and swimming activity were significantly more elevated at the highest pesticide  mixture concentration. Gene transcription was up-regulated for genes involved in  detoxification (gst and mt1), DNA repair (ogg1), mitochondrial metabolism (cox1  and 12S), and cholinergic system (ache). This study highlighted the induction of  adaptive molecular and behavioral responses of rainbow trout larvae when exposed  to environmentally realistic concentrations of a mixture of pesticides.

AB  - Emerging evidences having suggested that particular lncRNAs have a potential effect on PD progression through provoking damage and inflammatory responses of  microglia/ dopaminergic cells. In addition, paraquat can be accumulated in human  body through various approaches and have an increased risk for Parkinson's  disease. However, the specific role and mechanism of lncRNA related to neurotoxic  in the progression of PD is unclear. In our study, a mouse PD model was  established induced by the intraperitoneal injection of paraquat (5 mg/kg and  10 mg/kg) every three days (10 times). We determined differential expression of  lncRNA AK039862 and its potential targeted genes Pafah1b1/Foxa1 in PD mouse  model, then we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to visualize the  cellular distribution of AK039862. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and  overexpression plasmids were designed for knockdown or overexpression of  AK039862. To simulate the coexisting dopaminergic cells and microglia cells in  vitro, we applied several non-contact co-culture models, including conditioned  medium and Transwell co-culture systems. Cytotoxicity of PQ was evaluated using  bv2 cells with the concentrations: 30, 60 μM, and mn9d cells with the  concentrations: 50, 100 μM. As a result, we depicted multiple interesting  individual and interactive features of inflammatory lncRNA AK039862 involved in  PQ-induced cellular functional effects. First, we detected that AK039862  contributed to the neuronal injury process in PQ-treated mice and co-localization  of AK039862 with dopaminergic cells in vivo. And interestingly, we demonstrated  that PQ significantly inhibited microglia and dopaminergic cells proliferation  and microglia migration in vitro. Further research indicated that the PQ-induced  low expression of AK039862 rescued microglia proliferation and migration  inhibition via the AK039862/Pafah1b1/Foxa1 pathway. Meanwhile, AK039862 also  participated in the interaction between microglia and dopaminergic cells with PQ  treatment in non-contact co-culture models. In summary, we found that PQ  inhibited the proliferation and migration of microglial cells, and elucidated  AK039862 played a key role in PQ-induced neuroinflammatory damage through  Pafah1b1/Foxa1. Finally, inflammatory AK039862 is involved in the complex  communication between microglia and dopaminergic cells in the environment of PQ  damage.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Fish behaviors have great potential as models for the study of pharmacology, genetics, and neuroscience. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Japanese medaka (Oryzias  latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) are popular freshwater  animal models. However, their behavioral use in aquatic toxicology research is  generally hampered by oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are  not well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented a  comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e., anxiety-like behavior,  novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus  and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory). We found that only medaka  (d-rR) presented a weak or no response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise  stimulus. In addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the  three species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01% v/v  carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and DMSO). In contrast to zebrafish and  Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes in spatial memory after  subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5 μg/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead,  a hyperactivity response in the open field test and reduced social time were  induced by cpf and imidacloprid, respectively. Our results suggest that: (1)  behavioral effects are negligible when using <0.01% v/v carrier solvents for  behavioral assessment; (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral  responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be insufficient for  estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other environmental contaminants.  In conclusion, these results could have major implications for aquatic toxicology  research and water quality monitoring and ecotoxicological risk assessment.

T2  - PloS one
AB  - Increasingly, studies are revealing that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can alter animal behavior. Early life exposure to EDCs may permanently alter  phenotypes through to adulthood. In addition, the effects of EDCs may not be  isolated to a single generation - offspring may indirectly be impacted, via  non-genetic processes. Here, we analyzed the effects of paternal atrazine  exposure on behavioral traits (distance moved, exploration, bottom-dwelling time,  latency to enter the top zone, and interaction with a mirror) and whole-brain  mRNA of genes involved in the serotonergic system regulation (slc6a4a, slc6a4b,  htr1Aa, htr1B, htr2B) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). F0 male zebraFIsh were exposed  to atrazine at 0.3, 3 or 30 part per billion (ppb) during early juvenile  development, the behavior of F1 progeny was tested at adulthood, and the effect  of 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment on mRNA transcription was quantified. Paternal  exposure to atrazine significantly reduced interactions with a mirror (a proxy  for aggression) and altered the latency to enter the top zone of a tank in  unexposed F1 offspring. Bottom-dwelling time (a proxy for anxiety) also appeared  to be somewhat affected, and activity (distance moved) was reduced in the context  of aggression. slc6a4a and htr1Aa mRNA transcript levels were found to correlate  positively with anxiety levels in controls, but we found that this relationship  was disrupted in the 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment group. Overall, paternal atrazine  exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behavioral traits and showed  signs of serotonergic system dysregulation, demonstrating intergenerational  effects. Further research is needed to explore transgenerational effects on  behavior and possible mechanisms underpinning behavioral effects.

AB  - Fish are able to accumulate by ingestion various contaminants of aquatic environment, with negative consequences on their intestine, being continuously  threatened worldwide by heavy metals, pesticides and antibiotics resulted from  the human activities. Consequently, the health of other species can be affected  by eating the contaminated fish meat. In this context, our study aimed to perform  a comparison between the changes in intestine samples of Carassius gibelio  individuals collected from different artificial lakes in Bucharest (Romania),  used by people for leisure and fishing. The presence of various metals,  pesticides and antibiotics in the gut of fish was assessed in order to correlate  their accumulation with changes of antioxidative enzymes activities and  microbiome. Our results showed that fish from Bucharest lakes designed for  leisure (Chitila, Floreasca and Tei lakes) have an increased level of oxidative  stress in intestine tissue, revealed by affected antioxidant enzymes activities  and GSH levels, as well as the high degree of lipid peroxidation, compared to the  fish from protected environment (Vacaresti Lake). Some heavy metals (Fe, Ni and  Pb) and pesticides (aldrin and dieldrin) were in high amount in the gut of fish  with modified antioxidative status. In conclusion, our study could improve the  knowledge regarding the current state of urban aquatic pollution in order to  impose several environmental health measures.

TI  - Effects of cypermethrin on antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation of Lake Van fish (Alburnus tarichi).
AU  - Özok, Necati
T2  - Drug and chemical toxicology
AB  - Lake Van fish is the only vertebrate species that lives in extreme condition (salinity of 2.2%, alkalinity of 151.2 meq/kg, and pH of 9.8) of largest soda  lake of the world. This fish is an important source of protein for the people  living in Van and surrounding provinces. . Cypermethrin (CYP) is used extensively  against insects in agricultural, livestock, and domestic applications in Lake Van  basin. CYP has toxic effects highly on non-target organisms as aquatic animals.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of commercial formulas of CYP  (0.05 µg/L) on Van Lake fish (Alburnus tarichi) for 24, 48, 72, 96 h under  semi-static conditions using oxidative damage biomarkers. In this study,  antioxidant defense system enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT),  glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and lipid peroxidation (LPO) product  malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined in the liver, kidney, gills, and  brain tissues. According to the results of this study, the decrease in SOD (at  48, 72, and 96 h) and CAT and GPx (at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h) enzyme activities  were significant with exposure to CYP (p < 0.05). In addition, the increase in  MDA levels, which is the indicator of LPO, was found to be significant  (p < 0.05). However, in the 24 h period exposed to CYP, a significant increase in  SOD activity was determined in kidney and brain compared to the control group  (p < 0.05). In conclusion, sublethal concentrate application of CYP is thought to  cause oxidative stress and disrupt the oxidant, antioxidant balance of Lake Van  fish.

AB  - Evidence on the effectiveness of low-cost, sustainable biological vector control tools for Aedes mosquitoes is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this trial was  to estimate the impact of guppy fish in combination with the larvicide  pyriproxyfen (PPF) (Sumilarv® 2MR) and communication for behavioral impact  (COMBI) activities to reduce entomological indices in Cambodia. In this cluster  randomized, controlled superiority trial, 30 clusters comprised of one or more  villages each was allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either 1) all three  interventions (guppies, PPF, and COMBI), 2) two interventions (guppies and  COMBI), or 3) control (standard vector control). Entomological surveys among 40  randomly selected households per cluster were carried out quarterly. The primary  outcome was the population abundance of adult female Aedes mosquitoes trapped  using adult resting collections. In the primary analysis, adult female Aedes  abundance and mosquito infection rates was aggregated over follow-up time points  to give a single rate per cluster. These data were analyzed by negative binomial  regression, yielding abundance ratios (ARs). The number of Aedes females was  reduced roughly by half compared with the control in both the guppy, PPF, and  COMBI arm (AR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34-0.85; P = 0.0073); and the guppy and COMBI arm  (AR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31-0.77; P = 0.0021). The effectiveness demonstrated and  extremely low cost of including fish rearing in community-based health structures  suggest they should be considered as a vector control tool as long as the  benefits outweigh any potential environmental concerns. Sumilarv® 2MR was also  highly accepted and preferred over current vector control tools used in Cambodia.

AU  - Calvo-Ochoa, Erika
AU  - Byrd-Jacobs, Christine A.
T2  - International journal of molecular sciences
AB  - The olfactory system, composed of the olfactory organs and the olfactory bulb, allows organisms to interact with their environment and through the detection of  odor signals. Olfaction mediates behaviors pivotal for survival, such as feeding,  mating, social behavior, and danger assessment. The olfactory organs are directly  exposed to the milieu, and thus are particularly vulnerable to damage by  environmental pollutants and toxicants, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and  surfactants, among others. Given the widespread occurrence of olfactory  toxicants, there is a pressing need to understand the effects of these harmful  compounds on olfactory function. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a valuable model for  studying human physiology, disease, and toxicity. Additionally, the anatomical  components of the zebrafish olfactory system are similar to those of other  vertebrates, and they present a remarkable degree of regeneration and  neuroplasticity, making it an ideal model for the study of regeneration,  reorganization and repair mechanisms following olfactory toxicant exposure. In  this review, we focus on (1) the anatomical, morphological, and functional  organization of the olfactory system of zebrafish; (2) the adverse effects of  olfactory toxicants and injury to the olfactory organ; and (3) remodeling and  repair neuroplasticity mechanisms following injury and degeneration by olfactory  toxicant exposure.

AB  - Sustainable aquaculture arises as key to increase food production in the coming years. However, the sector still faces many challenges such as the exposure of  the cultured animals to pesticide-contaminated water. Pesticides used in  agriculture can reach aquaculture systems either directly (integrated-agriculture  aquaculture practices) or indirectly (soil leakage) and cause a broad range of  ecotoxicological effects on cultured fish and shellfish. Here, we studied how  glyphosate affects several haematological, biochemical, and immune parameters in  common carp (Cyprinus carpio) fingerlings, the fourth most important cultured  fish species worldwide. We also evaluated the potential of dietary  supplementation with black seed (Nigella sativa, 0.25, 0.5 and 1%) to lower  glyphosate-associated toxicity. Our results showed that 14-day sub-lethal  exposure of common carp fingerlings to glyphosate increases oxidative stress,  decreases antioxidant defences, affects several metabolic pathways, and induced  immune depression. Furthermore, we showed that fish fed with N. sativa-enriched  diets at 0.25, 0.5 and 1% for 60 days coped better with glyphosate exposure than  control fish and displayed more stable levels of biochemical serum parameters  (total protein, albumin, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein LDL), cholesterol  and high-density lipoprotein HDL), higher levels of immune defences (lysozyme and  immunoglobulin) and higher antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase SOD,  glutathione peroxidase GPx) than control fish. Fish fed with all enriched diets  also displayed lower lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde MDA), lower metabolic  enzymes (alanine aminotransferase ALT, aspartate aminotransferase AST and  alkaline phosphatase ALP) levels in blood serum and lower cortisol levels than  control fish. Altogether, our results show that dietary inclusion of black seed  can be used as a sustainable bio-remediation strategy, mitigating many of the  negative effects of glyphosate exposure in fish.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As every organ within the body, the brain is also extremely susceptible to a plethora of noxious agents that change its chemistry. One  component frequently found in current products against harmful species to crops  is rotenone whose effect under prolonged exposure has been demonstrated to cause  neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The latest reports have  indeed revealed that rotenone promotes Parkinson's in humans, but studies aiming  to show congruent effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) are lacking. Material and  Methods. In this context, the aim of the present study was to demonstrate how  chronic administration of rotenone for 3 weeks impairs the locomotor activity and  sociability and induces oxidative stress in zebrafish. RESULTS: There were no  statistically significant differences following the analysis of their social  interaction and locomotor tests (p > 0.05). However, several exceptions have been  noted in the control, rotenone, and probiotics groups when we compared their  locomotor activity during the pretreatment and treatment interval (p < 0.05). We  further assessed the role of rotenone in disturbing the detoxifying system as  represented by three enzymes known as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione  peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Despite the fact that there were no  statistically significant changes within SOD and GPx levels between the control  group and rotenone, probiotics, and rotenone + probiotics (p > 0.05), relevant  changes have been observed between the analyzed groups (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005,  respectively). On the other hand, significant differences (p < 0.05) have been  observed for MDA when we analyzed the data between the control group and the  other three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rotenone can be  successfully used to trigger Parkinson's disease-related symptomatology in  zebrafish.

AB  - This study is the first to report sound production in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). Sound production was affected by exposure to the carbamate insecticide  (aldicarb) and heavy-metal compound (copper sulfate). Medaka were exposed at four  concentrations (aldicarb: 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg L(-1); copper sulfate: 0, 0.5,  1, and 2 mg L(-1)), and sound characteristics were monitored for 5 h after  exposure. We observed constant average interpulse intervals (approx 0.2 s) in all  test groups before exposure, and in the control groups throughout the experiment.  The average interpulse interval became significantly longer during the recording  periods after 50 min of exposure to aldicarb, and reached a length of more than  0.3 s during the recording periods after 120 min exposure. Most medaka fish  stopped to produce sound after 50 min of exposure to copper sulfate at 1 and  2 mg L(-1), resulting in significantly declined number of sound pulses and pulse  groups. Relative shortened interpulse intervals of sound were occasionally  observed in medaka fish exposed to 0.5 mg L(-1) copper sulfate. These  alternations in sound characteristics due to toxicants exposure suggested that  they might impair acoustic communication of medaka fish, which may be important  for their reproduction and survival. Our results suggested that using acoustic  changes of medaka has potential to monitor precipitate water pollutions, such as  intentional poisoning or accidental leakage of industrial waste.

T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Herbicide pollution is persistent, which not only has a negative impact on individual organisms, but also may endanger the interspecific relationship  between predators and prey. Cladocerans, i.e. zooplankton that plays an important  role in the energy flow and material circulation in freshwater ecosystem, usually  develop induced defense in response to predation risk. We used atrazine, one of  the most used herbicides in the world, and Daphnia pulex, a representative  cladocerans, to test the possible interference effect of herbicides on the  induced defensive traits of cladocerans in response to predator fish (Rhodeus  ocellatus) kairomone, including morphological defense, life history strategies,  and the expression of defense-related genes. Atrazine reduced the body size,  spine size, growth rate, total offspring, and the relative reproductive output of  D. pulex, which further affected the response strength of the morphological and  life history defenses, i.e., atrazine significantly reduced the spine size,  relative spine size, and fecundity of D. pulex in response to R. ocellatus  kairomone. Exposure to atrazine affected the expression of defense-related genes,  and we speculated that atrazine affected the signaling process in the induced  anti-predation defense of cladocerans. Specially, fish kairomone attenuated the  negative effects of high concentrations of atrazine on the life history traits of  D. pulex. Our results will help to accurately assess the potential risk of  artificial compounds in freshwater ecosystems from the perspective of  interspecific relationships, and help to understand the impact of environmental  changes on the inducible anti-predator defense of prey in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Glyphosate (GLP), the most widely used and productive pesticide worldwide, which safety and reliability gradually become a social concern. It is important to  explore the toxic of GLP on the limitation level by governments on piglets and  the potential role of hepatic CAR/PXR and Keap1-Nrf2 pathways in low levels of  glyphosate detoxification. Compared with the control group, the production  performance and organ index of GLP group showed no significant change. However,  the liver GLP residue of 40 mg/kg group was significantly higher than the control  group. We also found that the activity of ALP increased linearly and DBIL content  increased quadratically. Furthermore, GLP could significantly increase SOD and  GSH-Px and decrease T-AOC and CAT activities and significantly increase MDA and  H(2)O(2) contents (P < 0.05); however, the genes expression of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway  was not affected. Gene expression of CAR/PXR pathway showed that GLP could  significantly stimulate the expression of CAR, but it could not affect the  expression of phase Ⅰ (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2A19, CYP3A29), phase Ⅱ  (UGT1A6, GSTA1, GSTA2) detoxification enzymes and transporters (MDR1, MRP2,  P-gp). Our study showed that although 10-40 mg/kg GLP would inevitably cause some  liver damage and dysfunction, it can self-alleviating the toxic effect of GLP.

AU  - Palm, Roger C. Jr
AU  - Powell, David B.
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - The sense of smell in fish is thought to be important for behaviors associated with alarm scent recognition and predator avoidance. Olfactory function of  juvenile chinook salmon was evaluated in two separate experiments following 2-h  immersion exposures to 0, 1, 10, or 100 microg diazinon/L. In the first test  system, groups of 10 salmon were transferred to the prechoice zone of a Y-maze  fluviarium with parallel streams of water. A dilute alarm scent composed of  either chinook skin extract or L-serine was pumped into the water supply of one  arm. Fish were allowed to choose either upstream arm by raising a containment  screen for 10 min, then their positions were photographed and the screen lowered.  In the second test system the relationship of diazinon exposure to predation  susceptibility was directly examined by transferring groups of 20 salmon (10  diazinon-exposed, 10 control) to troughs containing a protective cover. These  salmon were given two olfactory warnings by delivering conspecific skin extract  to both their transfer container and the predation tank they entered. After a  2-min prey acclimation period, larger predator rainbow trout were allowed access  to the downstream section of the tank containing the test salmon. The combined  fish were observed until approximately 50% of the prey fish had been consumed.  Statistical comparisons indicated that although the salmon did avoid the water  streams containing alarm scents, none of the diazinon exposure levels resulted in  significantly different outcomes from the controls (alpha=0.05) in either the  two-choice maze study or the predation study. Possible environmental and  population implications are discussed in light of related olfaction and diazinon  studies.

AB  - Consumption of seafood brings health benefits but may increase the ingestion of contaminants. Compared with other ethnic groups in the U.S., Asians consume  seafood more frequently. However, there is little information about how  culturally specific fish consumption contributes to exposure to toxicants. In  this work, we surveyed fish consumption among Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese  communities and purchased 103 seafood samples from local markets in Chicago. Each  sample was analyzed for mercury (Hg) and 92 organic chemicals including  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs),  polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and Dechlorane Plus and related compounds  (DPs). The rank order of pollutant concentration in all samples was  Hg ≫ Σ(66)PCBs > Σ(17)OCPs > Σ(8)PBDEs > Σ(8)DPs. Positive correlations were  noted among most contaminant groups. Bluefish, pike and tuna steak had the  highest mean Hg (>1 mg/kg). The mean Σ(66)PCBs was highest in pike and bluefish  (>100 ng/g) followed by pollock and mackerel (>40 ng/g). Overall, octopus, shrimp  and tilapia were the least contaminated; while pike, bluefish, and pollock were  the most contaminated. Omega-3 fatty acids were more strongly affiliated with the  organic contaminants than mercury. A risk assessment identified seven types of  fish that should have consumption limitations and six that should not be  consumed. For these seafoods, consumption advice based on Hg levels would  adequately protect health. In the survey participants, 17% of seafood mass  consumed is from types of fish that should be limited to 1 or 2 meals/week, while  7% of the seafood mass consumed comes from types that should not be consumed at  all. This work adds additional contaminants to the profile of health risks  resulting from fish consumption among Asian Americans, which can be used in  interventions aimed at conserving consumption of healthy fish while avoiding  contaminants.

AB  - Farmers are often chronically exposed to insecticides, which may present health risks including increased risk of neurobehavioral impairment during adulthood and  across aging. Experimental animal studies complement epidemiological studies to  help determine the cause-and-effect relationship between chronic adult  insecticide exposure and behavioral dysfunction. With the zebrafish model, we  examined short and long-term neurobehavioral effects of exposure to either an  organochlorine insecticide, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or an  organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). Adult fish were exposed  continuously for either two or 5 weeks (10-30 nM DDT, 0.3-3 μM CPF), with short-  and long-term effects assessed at 1-week post-exposure and at 14 months of age  respectively. The behavioral test battery included tests of locomotor activity,  tap startle, social behavior, anxiety, predator avoidance and learning. Long-term  effects on neurochemical indices of cholinergic function were also assessed. Two  weeks of DDT exposure had only slight effects on locomotor activity, while a  longer five-week exposure led to hypoactivity and increased anxiety-like diving  responses and predator avoidance at 1-week post-exposure. When tested at  14 months of age, these fish showed hypoactivity and increased startle responses.  Cholinergic function was not found to be significantly altered by DDT. The  two-week CPF exposure led to reductions in anxiety-like diving and increases in  shoaling responses at the 1-week time point, but these effects did not persist  through 14 months of age. Nevertheless, there were persistent decrements in  cholinergic presynaptic activity. A five-week CPF exposure led to long-term  effects including locomotor hyperactivity and impaired predator avoidance at  14 months of age, although no effects were apparent at the 1-week time point.  These studies documented neurobehavioral effects of adult exposure to chronic  doses of either organochlorine or organophosphate pesticides that can be  characterized in zebrafish. Zebrafish provide a low-cost model that has a variety  of advantages for mechanistic studies and may be used to expand our understanding  of neurobehavioral toxicity in adulthood, including the potential for such  toxicity to influence behavior and development during aging.

AB  - Deltamethrin (DMN) exposure causes severe damage to the gill and liver tissues of aquatic organisms, as well as neurotoxic effects and metabolic disorders. The  goal of the present study was to assess the impacts of DMN toxicity on blood  biochemistry, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, catalase (CAT) levels, behavior  disorder, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, histopathology and  8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8 OHdG) of brown trout (Salmo trutta fario). Acute  concentrations (1.0 and 2.0μg/L) of DMN caused behavioral disorder such as rapid  swimming, loss of balance, aggressiveness and increasing in the surface activity  and inactivity in brown trout. A significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA),  aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and a  significant decrease in CAT, AChE, blood albumin, and blood total protein content  were observed. Histopathologically, both doses of DMN have caused steatosis,  necrosis, and degeneration in hepatocytes and hyperemia in the liver. Also, they  led to inflammation, adhesion and fusion depending on severe hyperplasia in  secondary lamellae, hyperemia and lamellar edema in gill tissues when compared to  control group. Additionally, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8 OHdG) levels at  2.0 μg/L dose of DMN in liver tissues were more severe according to 1.0 μg/L dose  of DMN. Finally, different concentrations of DMN led to changes of the  histopathology, 8OHdG, the CAT levels, plasma AChE activity, and the serum  metabolites, as well as behavioral disorder in brown trout.

AB  - The insecticide fipronil, one of the main pesticides used in Brazil, is often detected in natural aquatic environments, and causes neuronal hyperexcitation by  inhibiting GABAergic neurotransmission, leading to putative alterations in  behaviour and development. This work sought to analyse the toxicity of formulated  Regent(®) 800WG (80% fipronil) on development (fish embryo toxicity test, FET),  morphology, and swimming behaviour of larvae and adults of zebrafish (Danio  rerio). FET was performed following OECD236 guidelines at concentrations ranging  from 0.002 to 1600 μg.L(-1) of formulated Regent(®) 800WG. Adults were exposed to  0.2, 2 and 20 μg.L(-1) of the product for 24 and 96 h, and were submitted to the  light-dark, novel tank and swimming endurance tests No lethal parameters were  observed in larvae, but in concentrations above 400 µg.L(-1), there was  shortening of the body axis and decreased swimming behavior. In adults, exposure  to the pesticide did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a  marked decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental  treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion, since  baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at all  conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish adults did not show their natural preference  for the dark environment. The pesticide likely has anxiolytic effects on  zebrafish, as well as a compromising effect on locomotor control, illustrating  that behavioural changes, which could affect activities on the natural  environment, such as escape and predation, may occur even in environmentally  relevant concentrations of this pollutant.

TI  - Xenoendocrine disrupters: laboratory studies on male reproductive effects.
AU  - Gray, L. E. Jr
T2  - Toxicology letters
AB  - Wildlife from ecosystems contaminated with endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) display a variety of reproductive alterations including cryptorchidism in the  Florida panther, small baculum in young male otters, small penises in alligators,  sex reversal in fish, and altered social behavior in birds. It has been proposed  that EDCs also may have contributed to increases in testicular cancer and  hypospadias and the reported decline in human sperm counts. Combined in vivo and  in vitro studies are necessary to fully characterize EDC induced alterations of  reproduction. We have identified several pesticides (vinclozolin, procymidone,  p,p'-DDE) which bind rat and human androgen receptors, block androgen-induced  gene expression in vitro and in vivo, delay puberty, reduce sex accessory gland  size and alter sex differentiation in the male rat. Some of the phthalates, which  are estrogenic in vitro but not in vivo, cause malformations in male rats that  appear to result from antagonism of androgens in utero. In contrast,  xenoestrogens affect male offspring but they are not malformed or infertile.  Prenatal administration of an Ah receptor agonist (2,3,7,8-TCDD or PCB 169)  produces a different spectrum of effects including reduced ejaculated sperm  numbers in male rats.

AB  - This study was conceptualized in order to assess the 96-h LC(50) of bifenthrin (BF) in O. niloticus and also to measure the biochemical, behavioral, and  molecular responses of the fish suchronically exposed to a sub-lethal  concentration of the insecticide. The role of Petroselinum crispum essential oil  (PEO) supplementation in mitigating the resulted neurotoxic insult was also  investigated. The acute toxicity study revealed that the 96-h LC(50) of BF is  6.81 μg/L, and varying degrees of behavioral changes were recorded in a  dose-dependent manner. The subchronic study revealed reduction of dissolved  oxygen and increased ammonia in aquaria of BF-exposed fish. Clinical signs  revealed high degree of discomfort and aggressiveness together with reductions in  survival rate and body weight gain. The levels of monoamines in brain, and GABA  and amino acids in serum were reduced, together with decreased activities of  Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and acetylcholine esterases (AchE). The activities of  antioxidant enzymes were also diminshed in the brain while oxdative damage and  DNA breaks were elevated. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in serum increased with  overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain tissue. BF also  upregulated the expression of brain-stress related genes HSP70, Caspase-3 and  P53. Supplemention of PEO to BF markedly abrogated the toxic impacts of the  insecticide, specially at the high level. These findings demonstrate  neuroprotective, antioxidant, genoprotective, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptic  effects of PEO in BF-intoxicated fish. Based on these mechanistic insights of  PEO, we recommend its use as an invaluable supplement in the fish feed.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are now chronically polluted by a cocktail of many chemical substances. There is now clear evidence of associations between exposure to  pollutants and greater susceptibility to pathogens. The aim of the present study  was to characterize the defense capacities of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus  mykiss), chronically exposed to pendimethalin (PD), to subsequent experimental  challenge with the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). Immunological  responses were examined at different organizational levels, from individuals to  gene expression. No negative effects of PD were noted on the Fulton index nor on  the liver or spleen somatic indices (LSI; SSI) before viral infection, but the  infectious stress seems to generate a weak but significant decrease in Fulton and  LSI values, which could be associated with consumption of energy reserves. During  the viral challenges, the distribution of cumulative mortality was slightly  different between infected groups. The impact of the virus on fish previously  contaminated by PD started earlier and lasted longer than controls. The  proportion of seropositive fish was lower in the fish group exposed to PD than in  the control group, with similar quantities of anti-IHNV antibodies secreted in  positive fish, regardless of the treatment. While no significant differences in  C3-1 expression levels were detected throughout the experiment, TNF1&2, TLR3,  Il-1β and IFN expression levels were increased in all infected fish, but the  difference was more significant in fish groups previously exposed to herbicide.  On the other hand, β-def expression was decreased in the pendimethalin-IHNV group  compared to that in fish only infected by the virus (control-IHNV group).

AB  - Photobacteriosis is a septicaemic bacterial disease affecting several marine species around the globe, resulting in significant economic losses. Although many  studies have been performed related to the pathogen virulence and resistance  factors, information regarding the host defence mechanisms activated once an  infection takes place is still scarce. The present study was designed to  understand innate immune responses of farmed juvenile gilthead seabream (Sparus  aurata) after Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) infection.  Therefore, two groups of seabream juveniles were intraperitoneally injected with  100 µL of PBS (placebo) or 100 µL of exponentially growing Phdp (1 × 10(6)  CFU/mL; infected). The blood, plasma, liver, and head kidney of six fish from  each treatment were sampled immediately before infection and 3, 6, 9, 24 and 48 h  after infection for the broad screening of fish immune and oxidative stress  responses. Infected animals presented marked anaemia, neutrophilia and  monocytosis, conditions that are correlated with an increased expression of genes  related to inflammation and phagocytic activity. Similar studies with different  fish species and bacteria can be useful for the definition of health biomarkers  that might help fish farmers to prevent the occurrence of such diseases.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the risk assessment, median lethal concentration LC(50-96h), development, and mortality of Nile tilapia Oreochromis  niloticus larvae exposed to atrazine after stress management. An LC(50-96h) trial  was carried out using fish (n = 147; 8.5 ± 1.0 mg; seven larvae/aquarium), which  were allocated randomly in 21 aquaria (1 L) and exposed to five concentrations of  atrazine: 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 mg L(-1) plus one control (without herbicide) and a  control with a solubility adjuvant (acetone). Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen,  conductivity, and total ammonia were measured daily. In addition, a stress test  was performed with fish (n = 150; 17.9 ± 1.7 mg; 10 larvae/aquarium) submitted to  air exposition (five minutes) and posteriorly distributed randomly in 15 aquaria  (1 L), and exposed to atrazine at 0.18, 6, 12, and 18 mg L(-1). The LC(50-96h) of  atrazine for Nile tilapia larvae was 17.87 mg L(-1). Significant differences  (P < 0.05) were found for weight and final length, pH, and dissolved oxygen that  was responsive to the increased levels of herbicide. Larvae mortality post-stress  was registered to 6, 12, and 18 mg L(-1) of atrazine, and was more critical at  24 h. The increased doses of atrazine used in LC(50-96h) test depressed the  development of Nile tilapia larvae. Fish submitted to stress (air exposition) and  exposed to sub-lethal doses of atrazine showed significant mortality, indicating  that stressors may increase the toxic effect of atrazine for Nile tilapia larvae.  On the other hand, based on risk assessment atrazine can be classified as  herbicide with low toxicity for Nile tilapia larvae and low toxicological risk.

AB  - Chronic exposure to synthetic insecticides in the early life of a child can lead to a series of disorders. Several causes as parental age, maternal smoking, birth  complications, and exposure to toxins such as insecticides on childhood can lead  to Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) occurrence. The aim of this study was to  evaluate the potential protective role of vitamin C (Vit. C) from children's  supplements after 14 days chronic exposure to insecticide mixture fipronil (Fip)  + pyriproxyfen (Pyr) on juvenile zebrafish for swimming performances, social  behavior and oxidative stress associated with ASD model. Juvenile (14-17 mm)  wild-type AB zebrafish (Danio rerio) (45 days) were exposed to relevant  concentrations: vit. C (25 µg L(-1)), Fip (600 µg L(-1)/1.372 μM) + Pyr (600 µg  L(-1)/1.89 μM), and [Fip (600 µg L(-1)/1.372 μM) + Pyr (600 µg L(-1) /1.89 μM)] +  vit. C (25 µg L(-1)). Our results showed that insecticides can disturb the social  behavior of zebrafish during 14 days of the administration, decreased the  swimming performances, and elevated the oxidative stress biomarkers of SOD  (superoxide dismutase), GPx (glutathione peroxidase), and MDA (malondialdehyde).  The vitamin C supplement significantly attenuated the neurotoxicity of  insecticide mixture and oxidative stress. This study provides possible in vivo  evidence to show that vitamin C supplements could attenuate oxidative stress and  brain damage of fipronil and pyriproxyfen insecticide chronic exposure on  zebrafish juvenile.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of heparin eye drops in the treatment of paraquat-induced ocular surface injury. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective  study, we included 25 patients (31 eyes) with paraquat-induced ocular surface  injury, who attended the Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University  between October 2008 and October 2013. The patients were split into two groups  according to whether or not received heparin eye drops. The clinical data were  compared between the two groups, i.e. clinical histories, results of  examinations, treatments and outcomes. RESULTS: Eleven patients (group A, 15  eyes) received prompt irrigation with 0.9% saline every two hours, 0.1%  pranoprofen eye drops four times a day, 20% autologous serum every two hours,  recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor eye-gel two times a day, oral  vitamin C 2.0 g and prednisone 30 mg daily. Fourteen patients (group B, 16 eyes)  received additional treatment with heparin eye drops. Ten eyes in group A and  seven eyes in group B developed a pseudomembrane on the ocular surface at  significantly different rate (mean ± SD) of 1.20 ± 1.01 and 0.43 ± 0.51,  respectively (t = 2.66, p = 0.01). Seven eyes among 10 had a pseudomembrane  reoccurred in group A while none had a pseudomembrane reoccurred in group B  (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.01). No significant differences were seen in the  duration of epithelial recovery between the two groups: 15.13 ± 5.13 days in  group A and 16.81 ± 5.56 days in group B (t = 0.87, p = 0.39). After the  treatment, mild corneal opacity and pannus were observed in five patients of  group A and four patients of group B, without any significant difference between  the two groups (p = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: The paraquat-induced ocular surface  injury observed in this case series was characterized by the formation of  conjunctival pseudomembrane with good prognosis and mild complications. Heparin  eye drops reduce the occurrence, especially the reoccurrence of pseudomembrane.  Further studies are warranted.

AB  - More than fifty years have passed since the outbreak of Minamata disease, and large-scale methylmercury poisoning due to industrial effluents or  methylmercury-containing fungicide intoxication has scarcely happened in  developed countries. On the other hand, widespread environmental mercury  contamination has occurred in gold and mercury mining areas of developing  countries. In this article, we provided an overview of recent studies addressing  human health effects of methylmercury, which we searched using the PubMed of the  US National Library of Medicine. The following suggestions were obtained for  low-level methylmercury exposure: (1) In recent years, the proportion of human  studies addressing methylmercury has tended to decrease. (2) Prenatal exposure to  methylmercury through fish intake, even at low levels, adversely affects child  development after adjusting for polychlorinated biphenyls and maternal fish  intake during pregnancy, whereas maternal seafood intake has some benefits. (3)  Long-term methylmercury exposure through consumption of fish such as bigeye tuna  and swordfish may pose a potential risk of cardiac events involving sympathovagal  imbalance. (4) In measuring methylmercury levels in preserved umbilical cord  collected from inhabitants born in Minamata areas between 1945 and 1989, the  elevated concentrations (≥1 mg/g) were observed mainly in inhabitants born  between 1947 and 1968, and the peak coincided with the peak of acetaldehyde  production in Minamata. (5) Since some developing countries appear to be in  similar situations to Japan in the past, attention should be directed toward  early recognition of a risky agent and precautions should be taken against it.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the propensity of permethrin (PTN) to induce oxidative stress and changes in enzyme activities in liver of rainbow  trout and its possible attenuation by vitamin C. Forty-eight fish were randomly  assigned to 1 of 6 treatment groups and their livers were used for liver  perfusion method: control (0 µgL(-1) permethrin and 0 mgL(-1) vitamin C),  PTN-0.16 (0.16 µgL(-1) permethrin), PTN-0.32 (0.32 µgL(-1) permethrin), PTN-0.64  (0.64 µgL(-1) permethrin), Vit. C (17.2 mgL(-1) vitamin C), and PTN-0.64 + Vit. C  (0.64 µgL(-1) permethrin and 17.2 mgL(-1) vitamin C). Results obtained showed  that permethrin significantly (P<0.05) increased ALT, AST and LDH activities in  the liver perfusion medium and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in liver tissue. The  values of reduced glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant capacity (FRAP) in the  liver tissue were significantly decreased due to permethrin administration.  Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between MDA  concentration and ALT, AST and LDH activities in the permethrin groups,  suggesting that the enhanced lipid peroxidation may be linked to hepatic damage  caused by permethrin. On the other hand, treatment with vitamin C in the PTN-0.64  + Vit. C group increased the values of GSH and FRAP, and decreased the level of  MDA and the activities of hepatic enzymes, when compared to the PTN-0.64 group.  The present study revealed that vitamin C could ameliorate permethrin-induced  oxidative damage by decreasing lipid peroxidation and altering antioxidant  defense system in liver of rainbow trout.

AB  - The presence of the transmembrane proteins of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, which perform the efflux of several substances, contributes to the  survival of aquatic organisms in a contaminated environmental. Those proteins  provide a phenotype named the multixenobiotic resistance mechanism (MXR) by  performing the efflux of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds  (ABCB) and biotransformation products and anionic compounds (ABCC). The aim of  the present study was to evaluate the cellular defense pathway of an established  culture from zebrafish hepatocytes (ZF-L) after 24 and 48 h of exposure to  glyphosate and Original Roundup(®), an herbicide used globally. Through abcb4,  abcc1, abcc2 and abcc4 gene expression, ABCB and ABCC2 protein expression and ABC  pump activity in ZF-L cells exposed to glyphosate and Roundup(®). The results  showed an increase in ABCB gene and protein expression; however, although ABCC2  showed an increase in gene expression, its protein expression was lower than in  the control group. Regarding ABC activity, only exposure to Roundup(®) at the  lowest concentration showed an increase at 48 h, but in the presence of  inhibitors, both glyphosate and Roundup(®) appeared to modulate ABC activity,  reducing its inhibition and returning activity to levels without inhibitor.

AB  - The excessive levels of aquatic endocrine disruptors (EDs) and namely heavy metals plus xenoestrogens account for irregular gas exchange processes, reduced  reproductive success, as well as abnormal social interactions of marine teleost  fish. These effects at the encephalic level appear to derive from the  interference of major signaling factors such as histamine (HA) neuroreceptor  subtypes (H(1-4)R). HA is one of the main biogenic amine neuronal system  responsible for regulatory homeostatic functions, including sleep-wake rhythms  and motor activities. Recently, interests have begun to focus attention on toxic  effects of some heavy metals, i.e., cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and how they are  capable of eliciting motor dysfunctions via HAergic receptor subtypes.  Interestingly, subtype 2 (H(2)R) proved to be a preferential target of heavy  metal-dependent altered locomotor maneuvers, as displayed by its specific  antagonist (cimetidine)-inducing non-synchronous swimming activities (Santos et  al., 2003, Pharmacol Biochem Behav 75:25-33). Conversely, although the  preferential H(3)R antagonist (thioperamide) did not interfere with normal  swimming behaviors, it surprisingly did ameliorate heavy metal-dependent  hyperactive states (Giusi et al., 2008, Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 227:248-256). In  the case of the xenoestrogens atrazine and endosulfan, their actions tend to  mostly account for feeding alterations through hypothalamic H(3)R-dependent  mechanisms. The aim of this review is to highlight the type of ED-HAergic  neuroreceptor variations that are involved in stressor-dependent neurobehavioral  responses of commercially valuable marine teleosts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Cambodia dengue vector control activities are focused on larviciding with temephos and pyrethroid based adulticide sprays to which Aedes  have been shown to be increasingly resistant. A cluster randomized trial assessed  the impact of using biological control tools (guppy fish, pyriproxyfen (PPF), and  Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities in combination), which  would be used in a value comparison to traditional chemical control tools. Given  these new intervention methods, a qualitative assessment was designed in order to  represent the quality of understanding, acceptance, and implementation by  participants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 103 participants in 12  Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and nine In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) were included  in the study. The majority of participants in intervention villages (50 out of  80) preferred guppy fish over other vector control methods due to ease of use and  rearing, quick reproduction and propensity to eat larvae. A substantial number of  participants (11 out of 40) in intervention villages with PPF favored it due to  long-lasting effectiveness, lack of smell and easy maintenance. Participants  showed high demand for both interventions and were willing to pay between 100-500  riel (0.03-0.13 USD). Nearly all participants perceived that the interventions  resulted in a reduction in Aedes mosquitos (both adults and immatures) and dengue  cases. The presence of larvae in the water despite the use of PPF was a source of  concern for some participants, although this was overcome in some cases with  proper health education through health volunteers. Interpersonal communication  through health volunteers was the most favorite method of transmitting prevention  messages. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The community led COMBI strategy resulted in  high acceptance and perceived effectiveness of the interventions in target  villages. Health volunteers are an effective and accepted channel of  communication to engage communities, disseminate information and promote  behavioral change at the household and community level. If shown effective  through corresponding entomological surveys, the interventions should be  continued and further strengthened to ensure they are accessible, available and  affordable.

AB  - Recent investigations have focused on the potential role of gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The 'dual-hit'  hypothesis of PD speculates that a putative pathogen enters the brain via two  routes: the olfactory system and the GI system. Here, we investigated (1) whether  local exposures of the neurotoxin rotenone in the gut or the brain of mice could  induce PD-like neurological and GI phenotypes as well as a characteristic  neuropathology in accordance with this 'dual-hit hypothesis' and (2) the effects  of a diet containing uridine and fish oil providing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA),  in both models. Mice were given rotenone either orally or by an injection in the  striatum. Dietary interventions were started 1 week before rotenone exposures. We  found that (1) both oral and intrastriatal administration of rotenone induced  similar PD-like motor deficits, dopaminergic cell loss, delayed intestinal  transit, inflammation, and alpha-synuclein accumulation in the colon; (2) the  uridine and DHA containing diet prevented rotenone-induced motor and GI  dysfunctions in both models. The models suggest possible bidirectional  communication between the gut and the brain for the genesis of PD-like phenotype  and pathology. The dietary intervention may provide benefits in the prevention of  motor and non-motor symptoms in PD.

AB  - Strobilurins represent the most widely used class of fungicides nowadays andare considered relatively non-toxic to mammals and birds but highly toxic to aquatic  biota. Dimoxystrobin is one of the novel strobilurins, recently included in the  3rd Watch List of the European Commission as available data indicate that it  could pose a significant risk to aquatic species. As yet, the number of studies  explicitly assessing the impact of this fungicide on terrestrial and aquatic  species is extremely low, and the toxic effects of dimoxystrobin on fish have not  been reported. Here we investigate for the first time the alterations induced by  two environmentally relevant and very low concentrations of dimoxystrobin (6.56  and 13.13 μg/L) in the fish gills. morphological, morphometric, ultrastructural,  and functional alterations have been evaluated using zebrafish as a model  species. We demonstrated that even short-term exposure (96 h) to dimoxystrobin  alters fish gills reducing the surface available for gas exchange and inducing  severe alterations encompassing three reaction patterns: circulatory disturbance  and both regressive and progressive changes. Furthermore, we revealed that this  fungicide impairs the expression of key enzymes involved in osmotic and acid-base  regulation (Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and AQP3) and the defensive response against  oxidative stress (SOD and CAT). The information presented here highlights the  importance of combining data from different analytical methods for evaluating the  toxic potential of currently used and new agrochemical compounds. Our results  will also contribute to the discussion on the suitability of mandatory  ecotoxicological tests on vertebrates before the introduction on the market of  new compounds.

AB  - Fish consumption is the principal source of intake of organochlorinated compounds in humans. Compared with other types of foods of animal origin, fish contain the  highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-  p-dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, all of which are classified as  highly toxic organochlorine compounds. Currently, lakes and fish farms in  northern Italy are not regularly monitored for PCBs and dioxins in areas  contaminated by industrial sources, partially because of the high costs of  traditional analytical methods that limit the number of samples to be analyzed.  The DR-CALUX cell bioassay is based on the uptake of the cellular aryl  hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. The aim of this  study was to assess the levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCB contamination in  Lake Maggiore and Lake Como, two lakes in northwestern Italy, and in nearby  areas. The levels were quantified using the cell bioassay DR-CALUX and reference  controls in two wild fish species, perch ( Perca fluviatilis) and roach ( Rutilus  rutilus), and in a farmed species, rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss). Tissue  samples collected from the farmed rainbow trout were also submitted to  immunohistochemical analysis of CYP1A expression as a marker for environmental  pollutant-induced liver damage. The levels of dioxins, furans, and dioxin-like  PCBs were all below the maximum levels and action limits set by European Union  Regulation, suggesting no risk for human health associated with the consumption  of the fish species caught or farmed in these areas.

AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition proteins are members of the family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), that play important roles in the recognition of  peptidoglycan and various biological processes. In this study, we have  characterized peptidoglycan recognition protein-SC2 (PGRP-SC2) in rock bream  (Oplegnathus fasciatus) (RbPGRP-SC2) and analysed its expression in various  tissues after pathogen challenge. A sequence alignment revealed that the residues  essential to zinc binding of the deduced protein were highly conserved among all  the organisms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RbPGRP-SC2 is most closely  related to the large yellow croaker PGRP-SC2. RbPGRP-SC2 was ubiquitously  expressed in all tissues analysed, predominantly distributed in muscle and skin.  After challenge with microbial pathogens (Edwardsiella piscicida), Streptococcus  iniae or red seabream iridovirus [RSIV]), RbPGRP-SC2 was up-regulated in all the  tissues examined, especially in liver. We produced recombinant RbPGRP-SC2  (rRbPGRP-SC2) using an Escherichia coli expression system. The rRbPGRP-SC2 had  agglutination activity towards both Gram-negative (E. piscicida) and  Gram-positive bacteria (S. iniae). In addition, rRbPGRP-SC2 induced leukocyte  apoptosis and promoted leukocyte phagocytosis. These results suggest that the  RbPGRP-SC2 plays an important role in the immune system and in maintaining  cellular homeostasis of rock bream.

TI  - Effects of Roundup Transorb on fish: hematology, antioxidant defenses and acetylcholinesterase activity.
AU  - Modesto, Kathya A.
AU  - Martinez, Cláudia B. R.
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Roundup Transorb(RDT) is a glyphosate-based herbicide containing a mixture of surfactants. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of this  herbicide on the Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. Juvenile fish were  acutely exposed (6, 24 and 96 h) to 1 mg L(-1) of RDT (RDT 1), 5 mg L(-1) of RDT  (RDT 5) or only water (control) and blood samples for hematological analysis,  liver for antioxidants analysis, and brain and muscle for acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) determination, were collected. RDT effects were more evident in fish  exposed to the higher concentration of the herbicide. Hematologic alterations  appeared only after 96 h exposure, when fish showed an increase in the hematocrit  and in the number of both red and white blood cells. After 6h exposure fish  showed a transient reduction in superoxide dismutase and catalase activity. RDT  also inhibited glutathione-S-transferase, after 6 and 24h of exposure. The  reduction in these enzymes is probably related to the occurrence of lipid  peroxidation (LPO) in fish exposed to the herbicide for 6h. LPO returned to  control levels after 24 and 96 h exposure to RDT, when fish showed an increased  activity of glutathione peroxidase. The content of reduced glutathione also  increased after 96 h exposure. Thus, after 24 and 96 h the antioxidant defenses  were apparently enough to combat ROS, preventing the occurrence of oxidative  damage. The exposure to RDT for 96 h led to an inhibition of AChE in brain and  muscle at rates which may not be considered a life-threatening situation.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the role of the clinical pharmacist in the rational use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in a general surgery department. All  enrolled patients had attended the general surgery department of a tertiary  hospital. This single-center prospective study compared differences in the  overall rate of rational PPI use, proportion of unindicated PPI use, utilization  rate, average defined daily dose (DDD), drug costs, PPI costs, and  cost-effectiveness of clinical pharmacist intervention between the intervention  (538 cases) and control (536 cases) groups. In the intervention group, Pareto and  fishbone diagram analyses were combined with the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle;  Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used for analyzing all data. The  overall rate of rational PPI use was significantly higher in the intervention  group than in the control group (p < 0.01). The proportion of unindicated PPI  use, utilization rate, average DDD, drug costs, and PPI costs were significantly  lower in the intervention group than in the control group (p < 0.05).  Cost-effectiveness analysis for the overall rate of rational PPI use indicated a  positive impact of intervention, with economic benefits in the intervention  group. Clinical pharmacist intervention for rational use of PPIs in general  surgery departments could significantly increase the overall rate of rational PPI  use; it could also reduce the proportion of unindicated PPI use, utilization  rates, average DDDs, drug costs, and PPIs costs. Pharmacist intervention also  offers economic benefits by improving the overall rate of rational PPI use.

AB  - In this study zebrafish specimens were exposed for 15 days to 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 μg L(-1) non-lethal concentrations of deltamethrin (DM) knowing that is the  active compound in insecticides used on agricultural crops. They were  investigated important issues resulted during the chronic exposure with DM:  effects on aggressive behavior and swimming performances knowing that is a high  neurotoxic compound; toxicity on nervous system investigated on telencephalon,  optic tectum and cerebellum; activity of PCNA, p53 and TUNEL as toxicity markers  in immunocytochemistry of the histological samples; changes of elements  concentrations in the fish body and their role in detoxification of DM. This  scenario investigated the harmful effects of this compound for freshwater fish  communities. The aggressive behavior significantly increased and remained  constant for the concentration 0.5 μg L(-1). They were not evidences in changing  of anxiety level and swimming performances. The nervous system suffered  significant damage for all studied concentrations and confirmed the changes in  the behavior. Selenium concentration in the body decreased and may be involved in  the detoxification processes.

AB  - Considering the antioxidant properties of sodium selenite (Na(2)SeO(3)) and the involvement of oxidative stress events in paraquat-induced neurotoxicity, this  study investigated the protective effect of dietary Na(2)SeO(3) on biochemical  and behavioral parameters of zebrafish exposed to paraquat (PQ). Fish were  pretreated with a Na(2)SeO(3) diet for 21 days and then PQ (20 mg/kg) was  administered intraperitoneally with six injections for 16 days. In the novel tank  test, the Na(2)SeO(3) diet prevented the locomotor impairments, as well as the  increase in the time spent in the top area of the tank, and the exacerbation of  freezing episodes. In the preference for conspecifics and in the mirror-induced  aggression (MIA) tasks, Na(2)SeO(3) prevented the increase in the latency to  enter the area closer to conspecifics and the agonistic behavior of PQ-treated  animals, respectively. Na(2)SeO(3) prevented the increase of carbonylated protein  (CP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels, as well as  the decrease in non-protein thiols (NPSH) levels. Regarding the antioxidant  enzymatic defenses, Na(2)SeO(3) prevented the increase in catalase (CAT) and  glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities caused by PQ. Altogether, dietary  Na(2)SeO(3) improves behavioral and biochemical function impaired by PQ treatment  in zebrafish, by modulating not only redox parameters, but also anxiety- and  aggressive-like phenotypes in zebrafish.

AB  - The present study was designed to determine the modulatory effects of arginine and citrulline dietary supplementation on the immune condition and inflammatory  response of European seabass, Dicentrarchus labrax. Four diets were manufactured:  a control diet (CTRL) was formulated to meet the indispensable amino acids  profile established for seabass. Based on this formulation, three other diets  were supplemented with l-arginine at two different levels (0.5% and 1%, ARG1 and  ARG2, respectively) and l-citrulline at 0.5% (CIT). Fish were fed these diets for  2 or 4 weeks under controlled conditions. At the end of 4 weeks, fish from all  dietary treatments were intraperitoneally-injected with Photobacterium damselae  piscicida and sampled after 4, 24 our 48 h. Immune status was characterized by a  lymphocyte time-dependent decrease regardless of dietary treatment, whereas  peroxidase values dropped in time in fish fed ARG1 and ARG2 and was lower at 4  weeks in fish fed ARG1 than in fish fed CTRL. Up-regulation of several genes was  more evident in ARG1-and CIT-fed fish, though pro-inflammatory cytokines were  down-regulated by CIT dietary treatment. Following immune stimulation, seabass  fed ARG1 showed a decrease in neutrophils and monocytes circulating numbers. On  the other hand, expression of 17 selected immune and inflammatory responses genes  was barely affected by dietary treatments. Based on the analyzed parameters,  results suggest an active role of dietary arginine/citrulline supplementation in  modulating immune defences that seem to translate into a suppressed immune  repertoire, mostly at the cell response level. The observed changes due to  citrulline dietary supplementation were in part similar to those caused by  arginine, suggesting that citrulline might have been used by macrophages as an  arginine precursor and then engaged in similar immune-impairment leading  mechanisms.

AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), including Roundup®, are the most used herbicides in agricultural and non-agricultural areas, which can reach aquatic  environments through drift during application or surface runoff. Some studies,  mostly in fish, demonstrated that GBH caused oxidative stress in non-target  animals. However, only few information is available on the GBH effects in the  antioxidant and stress proteins of many other organisms, such as freshwater  crustaceans. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of environmentally  relevant GBH concentrations on the relative transcript expression (RTE) of the  superoxide dismutase (sod1), catalase (cat), selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase (gpx), glutathione-S-transferase (gst), thioredoxin (txn), heat shock  protein (hsp70 and hsp90) in the hepatopancreas of the ecologically important  freshwater prawn Macrobrachium potiuna. Moreover, this study aimed to assess the  gender-differences responses to GBH exposure. Male and female prawns were exposed  to three Roundup WG® concentrations (0.0065, 0.065 and 0.28 mg of glyphosate/L)  and a control group (0.0 mg/L) for 7 and 14 days. In general, males had an  under-expression of the studied genes, indicating an oxidative stress and  possible accumulation of ROS in the hepatopancreas. In the opposite, females had  an overexpression of the same genes, indicating a more robust antioxidant system,  in order to cope with the possible ROS increase after Roundup WG® exposure.  Therefore, results confirmed that gender could be a confounding factor in  ecotoxicological assessment of GBH effects. Additionally, this work highlights  that sod1, cat, gpx, gst, txn, hsp70 and hsp90 gene expressions seem to be useful  biomarkers to investigate the oxidative stress caused by Roundup WG® in  Macrobrachium sp.

AB  - Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide active substance worldwide, has raised many scientific, political and public debates in the context of its recent  re-registration in the European Union, highlighting in particular a lack of data  concerning its potential generational effects. In this study, we investigated the  intergenerational toxicity of this active substance used alone or coformulated in  glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) on the ability of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus  mykiss) to face a viral challenge. Juvenile trout from parents exposed for eight  months to four different chemical exposure conditions (non-exposed control, pure  glyphosate, Roundup Innovert®, and Viaglif Jardin® were experimentally infected  with the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNv). Various enzymatic and  hemato-immunological markers were assessed before and after the viral challenge.  Chemical contamination with GBHs strongly modulated viral trout susceptibility.  Pure glyphosate induced a cumulative mortality of 35.8%, comparable to the  control (37.0%), which was significantly reduced with Roundup Innovert® (-9.9%)  and increased (+14.8%) with Viaglif Jardin®. No modification was observed for the  biomarkers analysed for any conditions. These results demonstrate that the nature  of the co-formulants associated to glyphosate in GHBs can modulate the  susceptibility of fish to pathogens.

AB  - The use of commercial pesticides combinations increases the risk of intoxication in non-target aquatic organisms. Here, we investigate the potential of a  commercial pesticide formulation containing (CYP) plus chlorpyrifos (CPF) to  induce oxidative damage on two fish species (common carp and zebrafish). Carp and  zebrafish were exposed for 96 h under laboratory conditions. Fish were divided in  three different groups: CTL, 0.3 μg L(-1) or 0.6 μg L(-1) of CYP and 0.5 or  1 μg L(-1) of CPF in commercial formulation. Both carp and zebrafish showed an  increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity  when compared to control group. Other oxidative parameters responded differently  to exposure in carp and zebrafish. There were an increase in ascorbic acid (ASA)  levels and decrease in catalase (CAT) activity and non-protein thiols (NPSH)  levels in treated groups of carps. In the other hand, zebrafish showed  significant decrease in ASA and increase in CAT activity and NPSH levels.  Overall, we demonstrate noxious effects on redox parameters in two fish  experimental models and different effects were observe in each fish species  exposed to commercial pesticide formulation. This difference responses observed  can be related with specific mechanisms of detoxification and antioxidant defense  system of each species.

AB  - The formation of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) is a critical host defense when neutrophils migrate to infection sites. Pyroptosis is a newly identified  programmed cell death, which is tightly regulated by inflammasome activation.  However, the mechanism of pyroptotic signaling participating in NET production  remains to be elucidated. In this study, the zebrafish larvae otic vesicle  microinjection model was used to infect larvae with hemolysin-overexpressing  Edwardsiella piscicida (EthA(+)), and a rapid migration of neutrophils to  infection sites was observed. Intriguingly, EthA(+) infection effectively induced  significant neutrophil membrane rupture in vivo, which was dependent on caspase-B  (caspy2) and gasdermin Eb (GSDMEb) but not caspase-A or gasdermin Ea.  Specifically, the EthA(+) E. piscicida infection induced pyroptosis along with  NETosis in vitro, and depletion of either caspy2 or GSDMEb impaired NET formation  in vivo. Consequently, inhibition of the caspy2-GSDMEb axis-gated NETosis  impaired bacterial clearance in vivo. Altogether, these data provide evidence  that teleost fish innate immune cells, including neutrophils, express features of  pyroptosis that are critical for NETosis in teleost innate immunity.

AB  - In this study, a comprehensive investigation was performed to understand the overall occurrence, relative distribution, and bioaccumulation of seven different  groups of POPs, comprising 27 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 76  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 23 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), three  hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), and 13 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) as  legacy POPs, and 41 polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) and 24 short-chain  chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) as emerging POPs, by monitoring crucian carp,  sediment, and river water in the freshwater system. Among the targeted POPs,  SCCPs were predominant in sediment and crucian carp (more than 95%), while a  dominance of PFASs was observed in river water (92%). Principal component  analysis revealed four different groups/patterns of POPs in all media: one for  PBDEs, PCBs, and OCPs, another for HBCDs and PFASs, and the two others for PCNs  and SCCPs. Also, sexually dimorphic growth-dependent accumulation of legacy POPs  was observed in crucian carp such that POPs concentration increased with  increasing fish size and males recorded significantly higher levels of POPs  compared to females.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly used in health services. Paper forms are still often used to register such data.  Manual double data entry (DDE) has been defined as the gold standard for  transferring data to an electronic format but is laborious and costly. Automated  form processing (AFP) is an alternative, but validation in a clinical context is  warranted. The study objective was to examine and validate a local hospital AFP  setup. METHODS: Patients over 18 years of age who were scheduled for knee or hip  replacement at Stavanger University Hospital from 2014 to 2017 who answered PROMs  were included in the study and contributed PROM data. All paper PROMs were  scanned using the AFP techniques of optical mark recognition (OMR) and  intelligent character recognition (ICR) and were processed by DDE by health  secretaries using a data entry program. OMR and ICR were used to capture  different types of data. The main outcome was the proportion of correctly entered  numbers, defined as the same response recorded in AFP and DDE or by consulting  the original paper questionnaire at the data field, item, and PROM level.  RESULTS: A total of 448 questionnaires from 255 patients were analyzed. There was  no statistically significant difference in error proportions per 10 000 data  fields between OMR and DDE for data from check boxes (3.52 95% confidence  interval (CI) 2.17 to 5.72 and 4.18 (95% CI 2.68-6.53), respectively P = .61).  The error proportion for ICR (nine errors) was statistically significantly higher  than that for DDE (two errors), that is, 3.53 (95% CI 1.87-6.57) vs 0.78 (95% CI  0.22-2.81) per 100 data fields/items/questionnaires; P = .033. OMR (0.04% errors)  outperformed ICR (3.51% errors; P < .001), Fisher's exact test. CONCLUSIONS: OMR  can produce an error rate that is comparable to that of DDE. In our setup, ICR is  still problematic and is highly dependent on manual validation. When AFP is used,  data quality should be tested and documented.

AB  - The use of feed additives in aquatic animals improves health conditions and well-being under pesticide toxicity. Thus, this study was aimed at evaluating the  effect of an immunobiotic mixture (IM) on the growth performance,  hemato-biochemistry, and immunity of Nile tilapia exposed to subacute  deltamethrin (DMT). Fish were distributed into four groups: groups 1 and 2 were  fed a control diet, while groups 3 and 4 were fed IM. Groups 2 and 4 were exposed  to DMT (15 μg/L) in rearing water. The results revealed that DMT-exposed fish  exhibited significantly lower final body weights, weight gain, specific growth  rate, and survival rate (P < 0.05), while IM feeding resulted in improved growth  performance and survival rate in fish with or without DMT toxicity. After 15 and  30 days, DMT-treated fish showed a significant increase in blood urea and  bilirubin as well as hepatic enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate  aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase) (P < 0.05), while supplementation  of the IM mixture significantly lowered these levels in Nile tilapia. Blood total  protein, globulin, albumin, white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin,  phagocytic index, and phagocytic and lysozyme activities were significantly  decreased in tilapia subjected to DMT (P < 0.05), while supplementation of the IM  mixture significantly increased these levels. Fish fed IM without DMT exposure  showed the lowest cortisol and glucose levels, while fish exposed to DMT without  IM showed the highest levels (P < 0.05) after 15 and 30 days. To conclude, IM  supplementation exhibited defensive effects against DMT toxicity in Nile tilapia  by improving growth performance, hematology, blood biochemistry, and immunity.

AB  - Atrazine (ATR) is a commonly used triazine herbicide, which will remain in the water source, soil and biological muscle tissue for a long time, threatening the  survival of related organisms and future generations. Tannic acid (TAN), a  glucosyl compound found in gallnuts, has previously been shown to antagonize  heavy metal toxicity, antioxidant activity, and inflammation. However, it is  unclear whether TAN can antagonize ATR-induced Grass carp hepatocytes  (L8824 cells) cytotoxicity. Therefore, we treated L8824 cells with  3 μg mL(-1) ATR for 24 h to establish a toxic group model. The experimental data  of flow cytometry and AO/EB staining together showed that the ratio of apoptosis  and necrosis in L8824 cells after ATR exposure was significantly higher than that  in the control group. Furthermore, RT-qPCR showed that inflammatory factors  (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, INF-γ) were up-regulated and antimicrobial peptides  (hepcidin, β-defensin and LEAP2) were induced down-regulated in L8824 cells,  leading to immune dysfunction. The measurement results of oxidative  stress-related indicators showed that the levels of ROS and MDA increased after  ATR exposure, the overall anti-oxidative system was down-regulated. Western  blotting confirmed that TNF-α/TNFR 1-related genes were also up-regulated. This  indicates that ATR stimulates oxidative stress in L8824 cells, which in turn  promotes the binding of TNF-α to TNFR 1. In addition, TRADD, FADD, Caspase-3,  P53, RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL were found to be significantly up-regulated by Western  blotting and RT-qPCR. Conditioned after ATR exposure compared to controls. It  indicates that ATR activates apoptosis and necrosis of TNF-α/TNFR 1 pathway by  inducing oxidative stress in L8824 cells. Furthermore, the use of TAN (5 μM)  significantly alleviated the toxic effects of ATR on L8824 cells mentioned above.  In conclusion, TAN restrains ATR-induced apoptosis, programmed necrosis and  immune dysfunction through the ROS/TNF-α/TNFR 1 pathway.

AB  - Terrorism is the intentional use of indiscriminate violence to create fear and terror as a means to achieve an ideological, financial, religious, or political  aim. It is often used against non-combatant targets. Terror tactics may include  biologic, chemical, nuclear, or explosive events. Biologic Bioterrorism is the  intentional release of biological agents to cause illness or death in humans,  animals, or plants. These agents may be bacteria, fungi, toxins, or viruses. They  may be naturally occurring or human-modified. The agents are typically found in  nature, but they may be altered in a laboratory to increase their resistance to  antibiotics, and ability to spread in the environment. Biological and chemical  agents may be spread through the air, food, or water. Terrorists use biological  agents because they are often difficult to detect and illness onset may be  delayed for hours to days increasing dispersal. The challenge with bioweapons is  that they may affect both enemy and friendly forces, and do not discriminate  between combatants and civilians.  In the last 100 years, the United States and  the international community have experienced multiple acts of bioterrorism which  have targeted civilians. World War I: Germany launched a biological sabotage  campaign in France, Romania, Russia, and the United States by infecting horses  and mules with glanders. World War II: Japanese biological weapons attacks in  China, testing botulism, anthrax, and plague. 1972: Two college students, Allen  Schwander and Stephen Pera, were arrested for planning to poison the Chicago  water supply with typhoid bacteria. 1979: Anthrax leak from chemical weapons  research facility, Sverdlosk, Soviet Union. 1984: The Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh  followers in Oregon attempted to affect a local election by infecting doorknobs  and salad bars in restaurants with Salmonella typhimurium bacteria. 1993: Aum  Shinrikyo religious group released anthrax in Tokyo. 2001: Anthrax-laced of  infectious anthrax were delivered to news media offices and the US Congress.  Chemical During World War I there was widespread use of chemical weapons  resulting in many deaths, both military and civilian. The atrocities experienced  on all sides of this conflict led to the 1925 Geneva Protocol, prohibiting the  use of chemical and biological weapons in war. While most modern states are  either signatories to, or voluntarily abide by, this treaty and subsequent United  Nations resolutions, there have been a few instances of chemical weapos use more  recently. Iraqi forces utilized organophosphate neurotoxins against several  targets in 1987-1988 in the war with the Islamic Republic of Iran on both  military and civilan targets. In 2017, the Syrian government was accused of using  nerve agents and chlorine munitions against the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the  ongoing civil war. Nuclear To date, other than the dropping of nuclear bombs by  the United States to end World War II, there have been no acts of nuclear attack  or nuclear terrorism. Nuclear terrorism is an act of terrorism in which a  terrorist organization detonates a nuclear device. The possibility of terrorist  organizations using nuclear is considered plausible as terrorists could acquire a  nuclear weapon. However, despite thefts of small amounts of fissile material,  there is no credible evidence any terrorist group has succeeded in obtaining the  necessary multi-kilogram critical mass amounts of weapons-grade plutonium  required to make a nuclear weapon. Explosive Traditional small-arms munitioins  and improvised explosive devices are among the most common agents used in  terrorist actions. Explosive devices and arms can be stolen or purchased, as was  seen in the 2015 attacks on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. More commonly  they are manufactured as improvised explosive devices and hidden, such as the  1988 Pan Am flight from Lockerbie, Scotland, the 2004 bombings of the Madrid  subway, or the 2013 bombings of the Boston marathon race in the United States.  Terrorism Definitions What is terrorism? What is a mass casualty incident? The  United Nations definition of terrorism describes it as “an anxiety-inspiring  method of repeated violent action, employed by (semi-) clandestine individual,  group, or state actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal, or political reasons,  whereby—in contrast to assassination—the direct targets of violence are not the  main targets.”. The Department of Defense defines terrorism as “the unlawful use  of violence or threat of violence, often motivated by religious, political, or  other ideological beliefs, to instill fear and coerce governments or societies in  pursuit of goals that are usually political.” . The Federal Emergency Management  Agency defines terrorism as “the use of force or violence against persons or  property in violation of the criminal laws of the United States for purposes of  intimidation, coercion, or ransom. Terrorists often use threats to create fear  among the public, to try to convince citizens that their government is powerless  to prevent terrorism, and to get immediate publicity for their cause”. . The US  Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force and  violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the  civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or  social objectives.”. A mass casualty incident is defined terrorist act that  generates more patients than available resources can manage using routine  procedures. Terrorism is generally considered to be the use of force or violence  outside the law to create fear among citizens with the intent to coerce some sort  of action. Health professionals should be aware bioterrorism is a perfect vehicle  for terrorists to strike fear into the hearts and minds of citizens in the hopes  they will bend the will of the people to support their agendas. All health  professionals need to be prepared for this potentially catastrophic event.

AB  - Crossed effects between climate change and chemical pollutions were identified on community structure and ecosystem functioning. Temperature rising affects the  toxic properties of pollutants and the sensitiveness of organisms to chemicals  stress. Inversely, chemical exposure may decrease the capacity of organisms to  respond to environmental changes. The aim of our study was to assess the  individual and crossed effects of temperature rising and pesticide contamination  on fish. Goldfish, Carassius auratus, were exposed during 96 h at two  temperatures (22 and 32 °C) to a mixture of common pesticides (S-metolachlor,  isoproturon, linuron, atrazine-desethyl, aclonifen, pendimethalin, and  tebuconazol) at two environmentally relevant concentrations (total concentrations  MIX1 = 8.4 μg L(-1) and MIX2 = 42 μg L(-1)). We investigated the sediment  reworking behavior, which has a major ecological functional role. We also focused  on three physiological traits from the cellular up to the whole individual level  showing metabolic status of fish (protein concentration in liver and muscle,  hepatosomatic index, and Fulton's condition factor). Individual thermal stress  and low concentrations of pesticides decreased the sediment reworking activity of  fish and entrained metabolic compensation with global depletion in energy stores.  We found that combined chemical and thermal stresses impaired the capacity of  fish to set up an efficient adaptive response. Our results strongly suggest that  temperature will make fish more sensitive to water contamination by pesticides,  raising concerns about wild fish conservation submitted to global changes.

AB  - Fipronil has been widely used in agriculture to prevent aggressive insects from damaging agricultural products. Fipronil residues circulate in the environment  and they have been detected in non-targeted organisms in aquatic environments. To  study the effect of fipronil toxicity on environmental health, 6 h post  fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were treated with fipronil for 72 h. LC(50)  value was obtained by applying varying concentrations of fipronil to zebrafish  embryos for 72 h. As zebrafish embryos are useful vertebrate models for studying  developmental and genetic findings in toxicology research, they were exposed to  fipronil to study detailed elucidating mechanisms with hazardous end points of  toxicity. Cell cycle arrest-related apoptosis supported pathological alterations,  such as increased mortality, shortened body length, and reduced hatchability.  Furthermore, observed heart defects, including edema and irregular heartbeat were  caused due to abnormal blood circulation. In transgenic zebrafish models  (fli1:eGFP and olig2:dsRED), disrupted blood vessel formations were indicated by  eGFP(+) endothelial cells. Moreover, neurogenic defects were observed by studying  dsRED(+) motor neurons and oligodendrocytes. This study demonstrates fipronil  accumulation in aquatic environment and its ability to impair essential  processes, such as angiogenesis and neurogenesis during early developmental stage  of zebrafish, along with general developmental toxicity.

AB  - The invasion of the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America by sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) in the early 20th century contributed to the depletion of  commercial, recreational and culturally important fish populations, devastating  the economies of communities that relied on the fishery. Sea lamprey populations  were subsequently controlled using an aggressive integrated pest-management  program which employed barriers and traps to prevent sea lamprey from migrating  to their spawning grounds and the use of the piscicides (lampricides)  3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) and niclosamide to eliminate larval sea  lampreys from their nursery streams. Although sea lampreys have not been  eradicated from the Great Lakes, populations have been suppressed to less than  10% of their peak numbers in the mid-1900s. The ongoing use of lampricides  provides the foundation for sea lamprey control in the Great Lakes, one of the  most successful invasive species control programs in the world. Yet, significant  gaps remain in our understanding of how lampricides are taken-up and handled by  sea lampreys, how lampricides exert their toxic effects, and how they adversely  affect non-target invertebrate and vertebrates species. In this review we examine  what has been learned about the uptake, handling and elimination, and the mode of  TFM and niclosamide toxicity in lampreys and in non-target animals, particularly  in the last 10 years. It is now clear that the mode of TFM toxicity is the same  in non-target fishes and lampreys, in which TFM interferes with oxidative  phosphorylation by the mitochondria leading to decreased ATP production.  Vulnerability to TFM is related to abiotic factors such as water pH and  alkalinity, which we propose changes the relative amounts of the bioavailable  un-ionized form of TFM in the gill microenvironment. Niclosamide, which is also a  molluscicide used to control snails in areas prone to schistosomiasis infections  of humans, also likely works by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, but less is  known about other aspects of its toxicology. The effects of TFM include  reductions in energy stores, particularly glycogen and high energy phosphagens.  However, non-target fishes readily recover from sub-lethal TFM exposure as  demonstrated by the rapid restoration of energy stores and clearance of TFM.  Although both TFM and niclosamide are non-persistent in the environment and  critical for sea lamprey control, increasing public and institutional concerns  about pesticides in the environment makes it imperative to explore other means of  sea lamprey control. Accordingly, we also address possible "next-generation"  strategies of sea lamprey control including genetic tools such as RNA  interference and CRISPR-Cas9 to impair critical physiological processes (e.g.  reproduction, digestion, metamorphosis) in lamprey, and the use of green  chemistry to develop more environmentally benign chemical methods of sea lamprey  control.

AB  - Fipronil is a broad-use insecticide with severe toxicity to fish. Biomarkers responses and bioaccumulation were evaluated on Prochilodus lineatus after  exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of fipronil (0.5 μg L(-1), 9  μg L(-1), and 100 μg L(-1)) in a prolonged flow-through assay and ex vivo gills  short-term exposition. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), oxidatively modified proteins  (PO), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), the content of reduced  glutathione (GSH), antioxidant capacity against peroxyles (ACAP), and  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were evaluated. Besides, levels of fipronil and  metabolites were analyzed by GC-ECD. At the end of the flow-through assay,  fipronil, Fp. sulfone and Fp. desulfinyl were detected in fish, being liver the  target organ. Fipronil prolonged exposition promoted oxidative damage in lipids  and proteins, alterations in the defense system and low-antioxidant capacity in  organs of P. lineatus. The brain AChE activity was affected after prolonged  exposition. Ex vivo gills exposition to fipronil promoted changes in antioxidant  capacity and damage to lipids, providing a fast and suitable test to assess the  pesticide exposure in fish. The results revealed that fipronil at environmental  concentrations would be an inducer of oxidative stress in this fish, becoming a  vulnerable species to the effects of fipronil in aquatic environments.

AB  - The behavioral and biochemical responses of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to acute and subacute (sublethal) levels of chlorpyrifos were studied. In the acute  exposure test, medaka were exposed to 0.018, 0.055, 0.166, or 0.500 mg L(-1)  chlorpyrifos for 4 d. As a result, fish showed hypoactivity compared to the  control (at 0.018, 0.055, and 0.166 mg L(-1), swimming speeds were 55.6%, 39.0%,  and 27.3% those of the control), Brain acetylcholinesterase activity and swimming  speed were significantly correlated. In the subacute toxicity test, medaka were  exposed to 0.012 mg L(-1) chlorpyrifos (10% of LC(50)) for 8 d. On day 4, there  were no significant differences in behavioral and biochemical endpoints in  exposed fish as compared to the control. On day 8, exposed fish became  hyperactive, and the swimming speed of the social group increased to 2 times that  of the control, whereas acetylcholinesterase activity was decreased to 68% that  of the control. In addition, fish exhibited significant alterations in social  behavior (schooling duration increased to 2.6 times and solitary duration  decreased to 28% that of the control). Our findings clearly demonstrate a  subacute effect of chlorpyrifos on the social behavior of medaka, which may pose  a risk at population level because of the disturbance of social behavior. In  addition, the recorded behavioral alterations may provide a useful tool for  assessing the toxicity of organophosphorous pesticides to aquatic organisms.

AB  - Fipronil is a highly effective, broad-spectrum insecticide with potential value for the control of a wide range of crop, public hygiene, amenity, and veterinary  pests. It can generally be applied at low to very low dose rates to achieve  effective pest control. Application rates vary between 0.6 and 200 g a.i./ha,  depending on the target pest and formulation. It belongs to the phenyl pyrazole  or fiprole group of chemicals and is a potent disrupter of the insect central  nervous system via interference with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA-)  regulated chloride channel. Fipronil degrades slowly on vegetation and relatively  slowly in soil and in water, with a half-life ranging between 36 hr and 7.3 mon  depending on substrate and conditions. It is relatively immobile in soil and has  low potential to leach into groundwater. One of its main degradation products,  fipronil desulfinyl, is generally more toxic than the parent compound and is very  persistent. There is evidence that fipronil and some of its degradates may  bioaccumulate, particularly in fish. Further investigation on bioaccumulation is  warranted, especially for the desulfinyl degradate. The suitability of fipronil  for use in IPM must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In certain situations,  fipronil may disrupt natural enemy populations, depending on the groups and  species involved and the timing of application. The indications are that fipronil  may be incompatible with locust IPM; hence, this possibility requires further  urgent investigation. It is very highly toxic to termites and has severe and  long-lasting negative impacts on termite populations. It thus presents a  long-term risk to nutrient cycling and soil fertility where termites are  "beneficial" key species in these ecological processes. Its toxicity to termites  also increases the risk to the ecology of habitats in which termites are a  dominant group, due to their importance as a food source to many higher animals.  This risk has been demonstrated in Madagascar, where two endemic species of  lizard and an endemic mammal decline in abundance because of their food chain  link to termites. Fipronil is highly toxic to bees (LD50 = 0.004 microgram/bee),  lizards [LD50 for Acanthodactylus dumerili (Lacertidae) is 30 micrograms a.i./g  bw], and gallinaceous birds (LD50 = 11.3 mg/kg for Northern bobwhite quail), but  shows low toxicity to waterfowl (LD50 > 2150 mg/kg for mallard duck). It is  moderately toxic to laboratory mammals by oral exposure (LD50 = 97 mg/kg for  rats; LD50 = 91 mg/kg for mice). Technical fipronil is in toxicity categories II  and III, depending on route of administration, and is classed as a nonsensitizer.  There are indications of carcinogenic action in rats at 300 ppm, but it is not  carcinogenic to female mice at doses of 30 ppm. The acute toxicity of fipronil  varies widely even in animals within the same taxonomic groups. Thus,  toxicological findings from results on standard test animals are not necessarily  applicable to animals in the wild. Testing on local species seems particularly  important in determining the suitability of fipronil-based products for  registration in different countries or habitats and the potential associated risk  to nontarget wildlife. Risk assessment predictions have shown that some fipronil  formulations present a risk to endangered bird, fish, and aquatic and marine  invertebrates. Great care should thus be taken in using these formulations where  they may impact any of these endangered wildlife groups. Work in Madagascar has  highlighted field evidence of this risk. The dose levels at which fipronil  produces thyroid cancer in rats are very high and are unlikely to occur under  normal conditions of use. There is also dispute as to whether this is relevant to  human health risk. However, as fipronil is a relatively new insecticide that has  not been in use for long enough to evaluate the risk it may pose to human health,  from data on human exposure to the product, a precautionary approach may be  warranted. The use of some fipronil-based products on domestic animals is not  recommended where handlers spend significant amounts of time grooming or handling  treated animals. In general, it would appear unwise to use fipronil-based  insecticides without accompanying environmental and human health monitoring, in  situations, regions, or countries where it has not been used before, and where  its use may lead to its introduction into the wider environment or bring it into  contact with people. Further work is needed on the impacts of fipronil on  nontarget vertebrate fauna (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) in the  field before the risk to wildlife from this insecticide can be adequately  validated. Further field study of the effects of fipronil on the nutrient cycling  and soil water-infiltration activities of beneficial termites is required to  assess the ecological impacts of the known toxicity of fipronil to these insects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: First Nations (FNs) populations in Canada experience a disproportionally higher rate of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to  the general population. Recent data suggest that a high consumption of fish may  help prevent T2D. On the other hand, fish might also be a potential source of  environmental contaminants which could potentially be a risk factor for T2D.  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential associations between self-reported T2D  and consumption of locally-harvested fish, dietary long-chain omega-3 fatty acids  (n-3FAs) and persistent organic pollutants intake among adult FNs living on  reserve in Ontario. DESIGN: Data from the First Nations Food Nutrition and  Environment Study, which included a cross-sectional study of 1429 Ontario FNs  adults living in 18 communities across 4 ecozones in 2012 were analyzed. Social  and lifestyle data were collected using household interviews. The consumption of  locally-harvested fish was estimated using a traditional food frequency  questionnaire along with portion size information obtained from 24hr recalls.  Fish samples were analyzed for the presence of contaminants including  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  Dietary intakes of DDE and PCBs were estimated using community-specific levels of  DDE/PCBs in fish species. Multiple logistic regression models adjusted for  potential covariates including age, gender, body mass index, physical activity,  total energy intake, smoking, and education were developed. RESULTS: The  prevalence of T2D in Ontario FNs was 24.4%. A significant positive association  between fish consumption of one portion per week and more and T2D compared to no  fish consumption was found (OR=2.5 (95% CI: 1.38-4.58). Dietary DDE and PCBs  intake was positively associated with T2D (OR=1.09 (95%CI: 1.05-1.75) for DDE and  OR=1.07 (95%CI: 1.004-1.27) for PCBs) per unit increase in DDE/PCBs while n-3-FAs  intake, adjusted for DDE/PCBs intake, showed an inverse effect against T2D among  older individuals (OR=0.86 (95% CI: 0.46-0.99). CONCLUSION: Our results support  previous findings that exposure to DDE and PCBs may increase the risk of T2D.  Elevated levels of contaminants in fish may counteract with potentially  beneficial effects of n-3FAs from fish consumption. However, the overall health  benefits of high consumption of fish with a high n-3 FAs content may outweigh the  adverse effect of contaminants.

AB  - Experiments were performed in goldfish to determine the effects of a short-term exposure (24 h) to atrazine or diuron (0.5, 5, 50 microgram/L) on some behavior  endpoints related to swimming and social activities. Observations were also made  to assess the influence of such exposure on the behavioral responses of fish to  the flow of a crude skin extract solution from conspecifics, active in social  chemocommunication and producing alarm behaviors. Additive tests were run to  check the behavioral responses of previously unexposed goldfish to the flow of a  solution of atrazine- or diuron-contaminated water, at three concentrations (0.1,  1, 10 mg/L). Significant burst swimming reactions appeared in response to a 24-h  exposure to atrazine, at the lowest concentration tested (0.5 microgram/L). A  24-h exposure to 5 microgram/L atrazine or diuron was found to induce various  significant behavioral alterations in fish. At this concentration, both  herbicides decreased grouping behavior and atrazine also increased surfacing  activity. Herbicide-exposed fish showed a decreased grouping behavior during the  flow of the skin extract solution. Sheltering was also decreased during the flow  of the biological solution in fish exposed to atrazine. Moreover, fish exposed to  diuron clearly displayed attraction responses to the flow of the skin solution.  Previously unexposed fish showed a significant increase in burst swimming  reactions in response to the flow of a solution of atrazine- or  diuron-contaminated water, at all concentrations tested (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L).  Furthermore, the diuron-contaminated flow was found to be significantly  attractive at the highest concentration. These results indicate that a short-term  exposure to a relatively low concentration (5 microgram/L) of atrazine or diuron  can affect various behaviors of fish not only directly but also indirectly by  altering the chemical perception of natural substances of eco-ethological  importance. In consideration of the basic role of olfaction in fish behavior,  these results also emphasize the need for further developments on the possible  effects of aquatic toxicants on olfactory-mediated behaviors.

AB  - Glyphosate is an efficient herbicide widely used worldwide. However, its toxicity to non-targeted organisms has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the  toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicide was evaluated on goldfish (Carassius  auratus) after long-term exposure. Tissues of brains, kidneys and livers were  collected and submitted to NMR-based metabolomics analysis and histopathological  inspection. Plasma was collected and the blood biochemical indexes of AST, ALT,  BUN, CRE, LDH, SOD, GSH-Px, GR and MDA were measured. Long-term glyphosate  exposure caused disorders of blood biochemical indexes and renal tissue injury in  goldfish. Metabolomics analysis combined with correlation network analysis  uncovered significant perturbations in oxidative stress, energy metabolism, amino  acids metabolism and nucleosides metabolism in glyphosate dosed fish, which  provide new clues to the toxicity of glyphosate. This integrated metabolomics  approach showed its applicability in discovering the toxic mechanisms of  pesticides, which provided new strategy for the assessment of the environmental  risk of herbicides to non-target organisms.

AB  - Glyphosate is a broad spectrum herbicide used aggressively in agricultural practices as well as home garden care. Although labeled "safe" by the chemical  industry, doses tested by industry do not mimic chronic exposures to sublethal  doses that organisms in the environment are exposed to over long periods of time.  Given the widespread uses of and exposure to glyphosate, studies on developmental  toxicity are needed. Here we utilize the zebrafish vertebrate model system to  study early effects of glyphosate on the developing heart. Treatment by embryo  soaking with 50μg/ml glyphosate starting at gastrulation results in structural  abnormalities in the atrium and ventricle, irregular heart looping, situs  inversus as well as decreased heartbeats by 48h as determined by live imaging and  immunohistochemistry. Vasculature in the body was also affected as determined  using fli-1 transgenic embryos. To determine if the effects noted at 48h post  fertilization are due to early stage alterations in myocardial precursors, we  also investigate cardiomyocyte development with a Mef2 antibody and by mef2ca in  situ hybridization and find alterations in the Mef2/mef2ca staining patterns  during early cardiac patterning stages. We conclude that glyphosate is  developmentally toxic to the zebrafish heart.

AB  - During pre-pandemic time, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were investigated in the surface water of Periyar River (PR) and  Bharathappuzha River (BR) in Ernakulam and Malappuram districts of Kerala,  respectively and Adyar River (AR) and Cooum River (CR) in Chennai district of  Tamil Nadu. After the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, variation in OCPs and PCBs  were evaluated for AR and CR. Dominance of β-HCH and γ-HCH in south Indian rivers  indicate historical use of technical HCH and ongoing use of Lindane,  respectively. In > 90 % sites, p,p'-DDT/ p,p'-DDE ratio was < 1, indicating past  DDT usage. However during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, elevated  p,p'-DDT in AR and CR reflects localized use of DDT possibly for vector control.  Similarly, during the first wave of pandemic, over a 100-fold increase in PCB-52  in these rivers of Chennai mostly via surface run-off and atmospheric deposition  can be reasoned with open burning of dumped waste including added waste plastic  in the solid waste stream. On contrary, a significant (p < 0.05) decline of  dioxin-like PCBs level, suggests lesser combustion related activities by the  formal and informal industrial sectors after the lockdown phase in Tamil Nadu.  Eco-toxicological risk assessment indicated a higher risk for edible fish in PR  due to endosulfan.

AB  - The regulation of populations through density dependence (DD) has long been a central tenet of studies of ecological systems. As an important factor in  regulating populations, DD is also crucial for understanding risks to populations  from stressors, including its incorporation into population models applied for  this purpose. However, study of density-dependent regulation is challenging  because it can occur through various mechanisms, and their identification in the  field, as well as the quantification of the consequences on individuals and  populations, can be difficult. We conducted a targeted literature review  specifically focusing on empirical laboratory or field studies addressing  negative DD in freshwater fish and small rodent populations, two vertebrate  groups considered in pesticide Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA). We found that  the most commonly recognized causes of negative DD were food (63% of 19 reviewed  fish studies, 40% of 25 mammal studies) or space limitations (32% of mammal  studies). In addition, trophic interactions were reported as causes of population  regulation, with predation shaping mostly small mammal populations (36% of the  mammal studies) and cannibalism impacting freshwater fish (26%). In the case of  freshwater fish, 63% of the studies were experimental (i.e., with a length of  weeks or months). They generally focused on the individual-level causes and  effects of DD, and had a short duration. Moreover, DD affected mostly juvenile  growth and survival of fish (68%). On the other hand, studies on small mammals  were mainly based on time series analyzing field population properties over  longer timespans (68%). Density dependence primarily affected survival in  subadult and adult mammal stages and, to a lesser extent, reproduction (60% vs.  36%). Furthermore, delayed DD was often observed (56%). We conclude by making  suggestions on future research paths, providing recommendations for including DD  in population models developed for ERA, and making the best use of the available  data.

AB  - GOALS, SCOPE AND BACKGROUND: Changing environmental conditions and handling stress are well known to cause chronic or acute stress situations in fish with  subsequent infections. These requires a therapy by means of antibiotics and  chemicals. In contrast to the huge number of pathogens, only a few substances are  permitted for application as therapeutics in German aquaculture. Hence, there  emerges an urgent need for highly effective and residueless alternatives. MAIN  FEATURES: The prophylactic stimulation and training of the defense system of fish  by alternative approaches becomes increasingly necessary. One approach is the  application of dissolved humic substances (HS) of natural or artificial origin.  For example, there exist several reports on the positive effect of HS to fishes.  These effects shall be considered in detail. Furthermore, the impact of HS on the  constitution of parasites and pathogens will be displayed. The reports on this  issue are diverse, if not inconsistent. We try to shed some light on these  discrepancies. The last aspect covered by this review is the outdated paradigm  that calcium ions act as antidotes. In the presence of HS, even the opposite  effect may occur. APPROACH: To overcome old paradigms on HS and their potential  interactions with fish and fish parasites, we reviewed recent international  literature, as well as 'grey' literature. We also include results from own former  and ongoing studies. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: HS are able to increase the  physiological condition of the individuals and to reduce adverse physiological  and histological consequences caused by stress; the mechanism behind remains  obscure. HS detoxify heavy metals and organic pollutants. Damages caused by  several fish pathogens, such as bacteria and parasites, can be repaired more  quickly in the presence of HS. Some parasites--mainly fungi--appear to be  directly affected by HS. Comparing the fungicidal effects of HS from various  sources, evidence is increasing that the aliphatic moiety may be the effective  structures. However, further research is necessary to relate more physiological  and anti-pathogenic effects to the chemical characteristics of HS. CONCLUSIONS:  HS are not real alternatives to strong traditional therapeutics. However, they  show different advantages in repairing secondary, stress induced damages in fish.  The ecophysiological relevance of HS in either aquatic systems or aquaculture is  getting conspicuously. PERSPECTIVES: The lack of therapeutic and antiparasitic  substances in aquaculture requires new strategies and ways of thinking. The  search for alternatives to the 'traditional' chemical therapeutics calls for the  intensive research. Inevitably, this search will lead to an intensive  contemplation on HS as 'health promoting substances' and/or even therapeutics.  Basic research is needed to detect the functional groups of the HS responsible  for the effects observed. Health promoting effects of first investigations made  in vitro to affect pathogens via application of HS and several field studies with  HS raises hopes for a broader utilisation of HS to reduce stress consequences in  fish and fish pathogens residuelessly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonicotinoid insecticides are becoming more widely applied as organophosphate (OP) insecticides are decreasing in use. Because of their  relative specificity to insect nicotinic receptors, they are thought to have  reduced risk of neurotoxicity in vertebrates. However, there is scant published  literature concerning the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure of  vertebrates to neonicotinoids. METHODS: Using zebrafish, we investigated the  neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure to imidacloprid, a prototypic  neonicotinoid pesticide. Nicotine was also administered for comparison. Zebrafish  were exposed via immersion in aqueous solutions containing 45 μM or 60 μM of  imidacloprid or nicotine (or vehicle control) from 4h to 5d post fertilization.  The functional effects of developmental exposure to both imidacloprid and  nicotine were assessed in larvae using an activity assay and during adolescence  and adulthood using a battery of neurobehavioral assays, including assessment of  sensorimotor response and habituation in a tactile startle test, novel tank  swimming, and shoaling behavior. RESULTS: In larvae, developmental imidacloprid  exposure at both doses significantly decreased swimming activity. The 5D strains  of zebrafish were more sensitive to both nicotine and imidacloprid than the AB*  strain. In adolescent and adult fish, developmental exposure to imidacloprid  significantly decreased novel tank exploration and increased sensorimotor  response to startle stimuli. While nicotine did not affect novel tank swimming,  it increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli at the low dose. No effects  of either compound were found on shoaling behavior or habituation to a startling  stimulus. DISCUSSION: Early developmental exposure to imidacloprid has both  early-life and persisting effects on neurobehavioral function in zebrafish. Its  developmental neurotoxicity should be further investigated.

T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Fish are capable of sensing water-borne chemicals at sub-lethal concentrations. Inadequate behavioral responses to physiological and environmental stimuli owing  to adverse effects of aquatic toxicants can have serious implications for  survival. In this study we exposed juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  during 5 days to a low-concentration mixture of three co-occurring herbicides:  atrazine, linuron and metolachlor, at maximum concentrations of 4.5, 4.9 and 13.4  μg L(-1), respectively. Our hypothesis was that fish behavior - swimming activity  and interactions between individuals - would be modified due to exposure to the  mixture. We studied these behaviors by observing fish twice-daily throughout the  exposure period at 30-s intervals for 5 min, registering the vertical  distribution of fish in the water column and the number of agoniztic acts between  all individuals. Fish exposed to the mixture of herbicides were hypoactive and  spent more time in the lower parts of the aquaria in comparison to non-exposed  controls, reflecting inhibited swimming activity. Average swimming height of  exposed fish decreased significantly with the number of agoniztic acts, whilst in  control groups there was no significant relationship between the two behaviors.  Overall, behavior of fish exposed for a short time to the herbicide mixture was  altered in comparison to control-fish behavior. The behavioral endpoints chosen  here were easily observed, simple to quantify, and of ecological relevance.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - The marine environment acts as a sink for diverse anthropogenic pollutants, although the environmental contamination may be non-uniformly distributed. In  recent decades, the aquaculture sector has experienced a steady growth  postulating as a good alternative for seafood production. However, a social  debate exits about the differential level of pollutants in wild and farmed  species. This study was designed to evaluate the level of pollutants in a  sentinel species: Bogue (Boops boops) associated and non-associated to fish-farm  cages. A total of 82 chemical substances were determined by gas  chromatography-mass spectrometry, including persistent (polychlorobiphenyls  (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)), semi-persistent (bromodiphenyl  ethers (BDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), and emerging  pollutants (such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and UV-filters). In  general, aquaculture-associated bogues showed lower levels of semi-persistent and  emerging pollutants than wild-caught fish, especially when sums were considered.  Thus, sum of BDEs was significantly lower in the aquaculture group (p=0.01). A  similar trend was also observed for benzo(a)anthracene, the UV-filter  2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate and some OPFRs. In the case of persistent  pollutants, the sum of dioxin-like PCBs and sum of DDTs were lower in the group  of wild-caught bogues (p=0.034 and p=0.003, respectively) than in  aquaculture-associated bogues, as previously described for some aquaculture  species. Fish feed appear as an important factor in the uptake of such substances  suggesting a diet intervention to reduce their levels in the aquaculture  products. Another interesting result is that for almost all chemical substances  analyzed, bogues captured near sewage outfalls showed the highest levels of  pollutants, pointing out the need of stringent measures for wastewater treatment  units discharging in coastal areas. On the light of these results, further  research in specific farmed and wild fish species in relation to their dietary  value and pollutant's levels seems to be mandatory.

T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
AB  - As a major neonicotinoid insecticide, thiacloprid (THCP) is frequently detected in aquatic environments worldwide due to its heavy use, posing potential threats  to aquatic organisms. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed  to THCP (1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10,000 μg/L) for 5 days and then recovered in  THCP-free water for 20 days to investigate the effects of early-stage THCP  exposure on the development, antioxidant defense, and neurotransmitter systems of  zebrafish, and explore their recovery mechanism. The results show that THCP  exposure induced developmental toxicity and oxidative stress in zebrafish. The  hypoactivity, behavioral alterations (decreased avoidance and edge preference  behaviors) and neurotoxicity were found throughout the exposure-recovery  experiments. THCP exposure altered the expression of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-  and serotonin (5-HT)-related genes accompanied by the decrease in GABA and 5-HT  contents. However, after recovery, GABA content returned to the control level,  but 5-HT did not, indicating that only the serotonergic system was persistently  disrupted. Overall, our results suggest that the disruption of the serotonergic  system and oxidative stress may aggravate neurotoxicity and that the former was  the main reason for the depressive-like behavior. This study could help to  unravel the mechanisms of the behavioral alterations induced by early-stage THCP  exposure in zebrafish.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine the behavioral and molecular responses in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) central nervous system (CNS)  following a dietary exposure to the pesticide dieldrin. Zebrafish were fed  pellets spiked with 0.03, 0.15, or 1.8μg/g dieldrin for 21days. Behavioral  analysis revealed no difference in exploratory behaviors or those related to  anxiety. Transcriptional networks for T-cell aggregation and selection were  decreased in expression suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of dieldrin,  consistent with other studies investigating organochlorine pesticides. Processes  related to oxidative phosphorylation were also differentially affected by  dieldrin. Quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) using a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap  identified 226 proteins that were different following one or more doses. These  proteins included ATP synthase subunits (mitochondrial) and hypoxia up-regulated  protein 1 which were decreased and NADH dehydrogenases (mitochondrial) and signal  recognition particle 9 which were up-regulated. Thus, proteins affected were  functionally associated with the mitochondria and a protein network analysis  implicated Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease as diseases  associated with altered proteins. Molecular networks related to mitochondrial  dysfunction and T-cell regulation are hypothesized to underlie the association  between dieldrin and PD. These data contribute to a comprehensive transcriptomic  and proteomic biomarker framework for pesticide exposures and neurodegenerative  diseases. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine  pesticide that has been associated with human neurodegenerative disease such as  Parkinson's disease. Dieldrin is ranked 18th on the 2015 U.S. Agency for Toxic  Substances and Disease Registry and continues to be a pesticide of concern for  human health. Transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics (ITRAQ) were employed  to characterize the molecular networks in the central nervous system that are  altered with dietary exposure to dieldrin. We found that transcriptional and  protein networks related to the immune system, mitochondria, and Parkinson's  disease were preferentially affected by dieldrin. The study provides new insight  into the mechanisms of dieldrin neurotoxicity that may explain, in part, the  association between this pesticide and increased risks to neurodegeneration.  These data contribute in a significant way to developing a molecular framework  for pesticide induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Both dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and titanium dioxide nanoparticle (TiO(2) NP) have worldwide-scale commercial applications, resulting in their  co-pollution in the ecosystems and posing combined health risks. However, there  is a lack of toxicity studies for the interactions of DDT and TiO(2) NP in the  environmental relevant concentrations. In this study, we characterized the  coexposures using a zebrafish waterborne exposure approach and evaluated the  neurotoxicity response of the treated embryos or adults. Our results showed that  DDT/TiO(2) NP coexposure enhanced the DDT accumulation in vivo and increased the  larval locomotor. The chronic DDT/TiO(2) NP coexposure did not affect the overall  survival rate, sex ratio and growth. However, DDT/TiO(2) NP coexposure severely  affected the adult locomotor activity, social contact, shoaling and aggressive  behaviors compared to single treatment groups or controls. These adult behavioral  deficits were accompanied by changes in neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACH)  level in the brain and muscle tissues, as well as neural development genes  expression activation of growth-associated protein 43 (gap43) and synaptic  vesicle glycoprotein 2 (sv2) in the brain. The significantly increased ACH level  and the activated neural genes expression in the DDT/TiO(2) NP co-exposed fish  may account for the observed hyperactivity and social deficits.

AB  - The toxicity of Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide widely used in agriculture, was determined for the Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. The 96 h-LC(50) of  Roundup was 13.69 mg L(-1), indicating that this fish is more sensitive to  Roundup than rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo  salar). These differences should be considered when establishing criteria for  water quality and animal well-being in the Neotropical region. Short-term (6, 24  and 96 h) toxicity tests were then performed to evaluate the effects of  sub-lethal concentrations of the herbicide (7.5 and 10 mg L(-1)) to P. lineatus.  Roundup did not interfere with the maintenance of the ionic balance and there was  no significant alteration in plasma cortisol levels in Roundup-exposed fish.  However an increase in plasma glucose was noted in fish exposed to 10 mg L(-1) of  the herbicide, indicating a typical stress response. Catalase liver activity also  showed an increase in fish exposed to 10 mg L(-1) of the herbicide, suggesting  the activation of antioxidant defenses after Roundup exposure. In addition,  Roundup induced several liver histological alterations that might impair normal  organ functioning. Therefore, short-term exposure to Roundup at subletal  concentrations induced biochemical, physiological and histological alterations in  P. lineatus.

AB  - Industrial and consumer products, such as pesticides, lubricants, and cosmetics, can contain perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). Although many short-chain PFCs have  been linked to physiological and behavioral changes in fish, there are limited  data on longer-chain PFCs. The objective of this study was to determine the  potential impact of perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTeDA) exposure on zebrafish  (Danio rerio) during early developmental stages. We measured several endpoints  including gene expression, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and locomotor activity in  zebrafish. Survival, timing of hatching, and deformity frequency were unaffected  by PFTeDA at the concentrations tested (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 µM) over a 7-day  exposure period. The expression levels of mitochondrial-related genes (cox1 and  mt-nd3) and oxidative stress-related genes (cat, hsp70, and hsp90a) were  increased in larval fish with exposure to 10 µM PFTeDA; however, there was no  change in oxidative respiration of embryos (i.e., basal respiration and  oligomycin-induced ATP-linked respiration). Reactive oxygen species were reduced  in larvae treated with 10 µM PFTeDA, coinciding with the increased transcription  of antioxidant defense genes. Both the visual motor response test and light-dark  preference test were conducted on 7 dpf larvae and yielded no significant  findings. This study improves current knowledge regarding toxicity mechanisms for  longer-chain PFCs such as PFTeDA.

AB  - Bifenthrin is a common pesticide that is widespread in aquatic environments. Although it has been shown to be toxic to aquatic organisms, its immunotoxicity  and mechanism are unclear. Herein, we reported the immunotoxicity of bifenthrin  on adult Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) after 28 days of exposure to  different concentrations of bifenthrin (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 μg/L) and 36-h  Pseudomonas fluorescens challenge. Bifenthrin inhibited the fish humoral immune  response to bacteria by altering the lymphocyte and neutrophil ratios and  decreasing the production of lysozyme, complement component 3, immunoglobulin M,  and C-reactive protein, particularly were 1.0 μg/L. Bifenthrin caused intestinal  damage and significantly reduced the volume of intestinal mucus at 12 and 36  hours postinjection (hpi) (p < 0.05). Moreover, 1.0 μg/L bifenthrin significantly  increased the fish mortality and bacterial loads at 12 and 36 hpi (p < 0.05).  RNA-seq analysis revealed several enriched genes involved in pathogen attachment  and recognition, inflammatory responses, and complement system at the  early-to-mid stage of infection (4-12 hpi). Overall, our results corroborated  that bifenthrin induced immunotoxicity in Gobiocypris rarus, resulting in immune  dysfunction of fish and increasing their sensitivity to bacterial infection and  accelerating mortality. Moreover, 4-12 hpi was better than 36 hpi for analyzing  immune responses against pathogen infection in fish exposed to bifenthrin.

AB  - The presence and toxicity of waterborne diuron in aquatic environments pose a severe threat to non-target organisms. However, the chronic impact of diuron in  marine fish has been poorly investigated. In this study, we report the chronic  effects (30 and 60 days) of environmentally relevant concentrations of diuron  (0.1, 1, and 10 μg L(-1)) on economically important marine fish, red seabream  (Pagrus major), and black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii) by evaluating several  parameters, including hormone levels, immunity, hepatic function, and antioxidant  defense. Significant decreases in 17β-estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone levels  and gonadosomatic index were observed on day 60 in fish exposed to 10 μg L(-1)  diuron. Parameters of immunity, such as alternative complement activity, lysozyme  activity, and total immunoglobulin levels, were significantly lowered by 60-day  exposure to 10 μg L(-1) diuron in both fish. Significant decreases in the hepatic  enzyme activities of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase were  observed with an induction of cortisol on day 60 in fish exposed to 10 μg L-(1)  diuron. Intracellular malondialdehyde and glutathione levels were significantly  increased by 10 μg L-(1) diuron at day 60 with an increase in the enzymatic  activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase. Overall, black rockfish were  more sensitive to diuron than red seabream. These results suggest that consistent  exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of diuron is detrimental to  the reproduction, immunity, and health of marine fish.

AB  - In order to evaluate the effects of copper and atrazine on the stress response of the freshwater fish Prochilodus lineatus, juvenile fish were pre-exposed to  copper (20 μg L(-1)) or atrazine (10 μg L(-1)) for 24 h and then submitted to air  exposure for 3 min. Simultaneously fish kept in dechlorinated water for 24 h were  subjected to air exposure and a non-stress group was not subjected to air stress  or any contaminants. Animals were sampled immediately (t0) and after 1, 3 and 6 h  of air exposure (t1, t3 and t6 respectively) for the analysis of plasma cortisol,  glucose and Na(+), hepatic glycogen, branchial Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA), number of  red blood cells per cubic millimeter of blood (RBC), hematocrit (Hct) and  hemoglobin content (Hb). In fish pre-exposed to copper the stress response was  inhibited, and at t1 and t3 both cortisol and glucose remained significantly  lower compared to fish subjected to air stress only. In fish pre-exposed to  atrazine there was no rise in cortisol, but there was an increase in plasma  glucose, RBC, Hct and Hb at t0 and a return of these parameters to basal levels  at t1, as they did not differ significantly in relation to non-stressed fish.  Animals pre-exposed to either Cu or atrazine showed a significant reduction in  NKA activity at t1 and t3, in relation to air stressed fish. These results  clearly indicate that copper and atrazine impair cortisol stress response of P.  lineatus and that fish subjected to a contaminant-induced stress, either by  copper or atrazine, may not be able to respond to any additional stressors.

AB  - Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are susceptible to anthropogenic mortality factors, including toxic compounds in the environment such as anticoagulant  rodenticides (AR) and sources of man-made energy. The physical and behavioral  effects of some toxins may predispose eagles to certain causes of death (COD). To  investigate the influence of ARs on mortality of Golden Eagles at wind turbine  farms, we randomly tested liver samples from 31 eagles found dead on wind farms  and submitted to the National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory from 2013-20.  The comparison group was composed of 31 Golden Eagles sampled during the same  time frame with a COD of power line electrocution as a proxy for a relatively  lower effort and altitude activity. Associations between COD, AR exposure, sex,  and life stage were assessed. In each group, 12 birds (35%) were found to have  been exposed to brodifacoum or bromadiolone prior to death. Logistic regression  showed no significant association between COD and sex (P=0.194) or life stage  (P=0.895). Across both mortality types, life stage was not a significant  predictor of AR exposure (P=0.725), but males were more likely to have been  exposed to ARs (P=0.032). These findings suggest that there is no difference in  the influence of anticoagulant exposure on higher and lower altitude activity in  Golden Eagles.

AB  - Pyrethroid-based insecticides are largely used for mosquito control. These compounds have household and agricultural applications with different  formulations. Two important compounds used as household insecticides are  prallethrin and transfluthrin, both from the pyrethroid chemical group. With the  mode of action centered on sodium channels, pyrethroids keep the ionic sodium  channels open for a long time causing the death of the insect by nervous  hyperexcitability. Given the increased use of household insecticides by humans  and the incidence of disease outbreaks with unknown etiology such as autism  spectrum disease, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease we investigate some  physiological inputs of these compounds on zebrafish. In this study, we evaluated  the social interaction, shoaling formation, and anxiety-like behavior of  zebrafish exposed chronically to transfluthrin- and prallthrin-based insecticides  (T-BI and P-BI). In addition, we quantified the activity of the enzyme  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in different brain regions. We observed that both  compounds caused anxiolytic behavior and reduced shoaling formation and social  interaction. Their behavioral biomarkers indicated a harmful ecological effect on  the specie as well as a possible impact of these compounds on autism spectrum  disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZP). In addition, the AChE activity would  change its activity in different brain regions modulating the anxiety-like  behavior and social behavior in zebrafish. We conclude that P-BI and T-BI make us  alert about the relationship of these compounds with nervous diseases related to  cholinergic signaling.

T2  - Toxicology
AB  - For salmon, amino acid and bile salt detection form the basis for important behaviors including predator evasion and conspecific recognition, respectively.  For this reason, decreases in olfactory sensory neuron responses to the amino  acid l-serine and the bile salt taurocholic acid (TChA) have been used in studies  as indicators of acute olfactory pesticide toxicity to environmental contaminants  such as metals and pesticides. In this study, we first compare baseline responses  to these two odorant classes across three salmonids, and then explore how two  currently used pesticides alter these responses. We found baseline differences in  electro-olfactogram (EOG) responses and their sensitivity to pesticide exposure  between rainbow trout, coho and sockeye salmon. For example, rainbow trout had  lower baseline EOGs than either coho or sockeye (e.g. 10(-5)M TChA EOGs of  1.34+/-0.17 versus 2.57+/-0.46 and 2.72+/-0.43 mV, respectively). At 15 min after  exposure to 10 microg/L of the herbicide linuron, rainbow l-serine-evoked EOGs  were 49.6% of control versus 78.5 and 69.8% for sockeye and coho, indicating  rainbow were more sensitive to linuron. In contrast, at 30 min of exposure to 100  microg/L carbaryl, l-serine-evoked EOGs of sockeye were 49.7% of control versus  60.3 and 62.3% for rainbow and coho, suggesting sockeye were more sensitive to  carbaryl. In all species the l-serine-evoked EOGs did not return to baseline by  15 min after 100 microg/L carbaryl exposure, suggesting persisting impairment of  amino acid detection. The TChA-evoked EOGs were less affected by carbaryl  exposure (i.e. EOGs were 83.3, 84.9 and 66.0% of control 15 min after exposure)  and not affected at all by 100 microg/L linuron exposure. Species-specific  differences in pesticide sensitivity may limit extrapolation of toxicity across  salmonids while the generally greater sensitivity of amino acid olfaction may  lead to selective impairment of behaviors such as predator evasion.

T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Dichlorvos (2,2-dichlorovinyl-dimethylphosphate), an organophosphorus pesticide used for indoor insect and livestock parasite control, is among the most common  commercially available pesticides. However, there are significant concerns over  its toxicity, especially due to its relative stability in water, soil, and air.  Zebrafish, an important developmental model, has been used for studying the  effects of toxic compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure to  dichlorvos at early life stages (1 h postfertilization - 7 days  postfertilization) in the zebrafish and its toxicological effects during the  development, through morphological (7 days postfertilization), locomotor and  social behavior analysis (7, 14, 30, 70, and 120 days postfertilization).  Dichlorvos (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) exposure reduced the body length and heartbeat  rate at 7 days postfertilization (dpf), as well as the surface area of the eyes  (5 and 10 mg/L). The avoidance behavior test showed a significant decrease in  escape responses at 7 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 14 (5 and 10 mg/L) dpf zebrafish.  The evaluation of larval exploratory behavior showed a reduction in distance  traveled, mean speed (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and time mobile (10 mg/L) between  control and dichlorvos groups. In addition, the analysis performed on adult  animals showed that the changes in distance traveled and mean speed remained  reduced in 30 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 70 dpf (5 and 10 mg/L), recovering values  similar to the control at 120 dpf. The social behavior of zebrafish was not  altered by exposure to dichlorvos in the early stages of development. Thus, the  exposure to organophosphorus compounds at early stages of development induces an  increased susceptibility to behavioral and neuronal changes that could be  associated with several neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The Arctic is subject to long-range atmospheric deposition of globally-distilled semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) that bioaccumulate and biomagnify in  lipid-rich food webs. In addition, locally contaminated sites may also contribute  SVOCs to the arctic environment. Specifically, Alaska has hundreds of formerly  used defense (FUD) sites, many of which are co-located with Alaska Native  villages in remote parts of the state. The purpose of this study was to  investigate the extent of SVOC contamination on Alaska's St. Lawrence Island  through the analysis of sentinel fish, the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius  pungitius), collected from Troutman Lake located within the watershed of an FUD  site and adjacent to the Yupik community of Gambell. We measured the  concentrations of legacy and emerging SVOCs in 303 fish samples (81 composites),  including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers  (PBDEs), organophosphate esters (OPEs) and their diester metabolites, and per-  and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PBDEs and PCBs were the most abundant  SVOC groups found in stickleback with ΣPBDE and ΣPCB median concentrations of  25.8 and 10.9 ng/g ww, respectively, followed by PFAS (median ΣPFAS 7.22 ng/g  ww). ΣOPE and ΣOPE metabolite concentrations were lower with median  concentrations of 4.97 and 1.18 ng/g ww, respectively. Chemical patterns and  distributions based on correlations and comparison with SVOC concentrations in  stickleback from other parts of the island suggest strong local sources of PCBs,  PBDEs, and PFAS on St. Lawrence Island.

AB  - Pyriproxyfen is one of the most used larvicides and insecticides; it acts as an analog of juvenile insect hormone (a growth regulator). It is highly toxic during  all stages of mosquito development, suppresses metamorphosis, and interferes in  insect reproduction and proliferation. Pyriproxyfen and its main metabolite have  been shown to affect brain development in rodents. This compound is employed  mainly to eliminate outbreaks of the genus Aedes, even in potable water. Despite  the increasing number of toxicological studies about larvicides and  insecticides-with an indication of continuous use-there have been few studies  about the effects of pyriproxyfen in non-target species such as fish. This study  evaluated the effects of pyriproxyfen on behavioral, cognitive, and endocrine  parameters in zebrafish. We exposed adult zebrafish to different pyriproxyfen  (Pestanal(®)) concentrations (0.125, 0.675, and 1.75 mg/l) for 96 h. We analyzed  behavioral parameters, memory, cortisol levels, and gene expression of  glucocorticoid receptor (gr) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (crf) after  pyriproxyfen exposure. This exposure did not alter locomotion (distance or mean  speed), anxiety-like behavior (latency to enter to the top zone of the tank or  time in the top zone of the tank), and social or aggressive behavior. However,  there was impaired inhibitory avoidance memory at all tested pyriproxyfen  concentrations. Cortisol levels were reduced in exposed groups when compared to  control or vehicle. However, gr and crf gene expression in pyriproxyfen-treated  animals were unaltered when compared to control or vehicle groups. Taken  together, these findings indicate that pyriproxyfen may induce cognitive  impairment and altered cortisol levels in zebrafish, a non-target species.

AB  - BACKGROUND, AIM, AND SCOPE: 2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT) metabolites, other than those routinely measured [i.e.,  2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (DDE) and  2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane (DDD)], have recently been detected in  elevated concentrations not only in the surface water of Teltow Canal, Berlin,  but also in sediment samples from Elbe tributaries (e.g., Mulde and Havel/Spree).  This was paralleled by recent reports that multiple other metabolites could  emerge from the degradation of parent DDT by naturally occurring organisms or by  interaction with some heavy metals. Nevertheless, only very few data on the  biological activities of these metabolites are available to date. The objective  of this communication is to evaluate, for the first time, the cytotoxicity,  dioxin-like activity, and estrogenicity of the least-studied DDT metabolites.  METHODS: Four DDT metabolites, p,p'-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1-chloroethylene  (DDMU), p,p'-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1-chloroethane (DDMS),  p,p'-2,2-bis(4-ch1oropheny1)acetonitrile (DDCN), and  p,p'-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)acetic acid (DDA), were selected based on their  presence in environmental samples in Germany such as in sediments from the Mulde  River and Teltow Canal. O,p'-DDT was used as reference in all assays.  Cytotoxicity was measured by neutral red retention with the permanent cell line  RTG-2 of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Dioxin-like activity was determined  using the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deetylase assay. The estrogenic potential was  tested in a dot blot/RNAse protection-assay with primary hepatocytes from male  rainbow trout (O. mykiss) and in a yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay. RESULTS:  All DDT metabolites tested revealed a clear dose-response relationship for  cytotoxicity in RTG-2 cells, but no dioxin-like activities with RTL-W1 cells. The  dot blot/RNAse protection-assay demonstrated that the highest non-toxic  concentrations of these DDT metabolites (50 μM) had vitellogenin-induction  potentials comparable to the positive control (1 nM 17β-estradiol). The  estrogenic activities could be ranked as o,p'-DDT > p,p'-DDMS > p,p'-DDMU >  p,p'-DDCN. In contrast, p,p'-DDA showed a moderate anti-estrogenic effect. In the  YES assay, besides the reference o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDMS and p,p'-DDMU displayed  dose-dependent estrogenic potentials, whereas p,p'-DDCN and p,p'-DDA did not show  any estrogenic potential. DISCUSSION: The reference toxicant o,p'-DDT displayed a  similar spectrum of estrogenic activities similar to 17β-estradiol, however, with  a lower potency. Both p,p'-DDMS and p,p'-DDMU were also shown to have  dose-dependent estrogenic potentials, which were much lower than the reference  o,p'-DDT, in both the vitellogenin and YES bioassays. Interestingly, p,p'-DDA did  not show estrogenic activity but rather displayed a tendency towards  anti-estrogenic activity by inhibiting the estrogenic effect of 17β-estradiol.  The results also showed that the p,p'-metabolites DDMU, DDMS, DDCN, and DDA do  not show any dioxin-like activities in RTL-W1 cells, thus resembling the major  DDT metabolites DDD and DDE. CONCLUSIONS: All the DDT metabolites tested did not  exhibit dioxin-like activities in RTL-W1 cells, but show cytotoxic and estrogenic  activities. Based on the results of the in vitro assays used in our study and on  the reported concentrations of DDT metabolites in contaminated sediments, such  substances could, in the future, pose interference with the normal reproductive  and endocrine functions in various organisms exposed to these chemicals.  Consequently, there is an urgent need to examine more comprehensively the risk of  environmental concentrations of the investigated DDT metabolites using in vivo  studies. However, this should be paralleled also by periodic evaluation and  monitoring of the current levels of the DDT metabolites in environmental  matrices. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: Our results clearly point out the  need to integrate the potential ecotoxicological risks associated with the  "neglected" p,p'-DDT metabolites. For instance, these DDT metabolites should be  integrated into sediment risk assessment initiatives in contaminated areas. One  major challenge would be the identification of baseline data for such risk  assessment. Further studies are also warranted to determine possible additive,  synergistic, or antagonistic effects that may interfere with the fundamental  cytotoxicity and endocrine activities of these metabolites. For a more conclusive  assessment of the spectrum of DDT metabolites, additional bioassays are needed to  identify potential anti-estrogenic, androgenic, and/or anti-androgenic effects.

AB  - Organism immune defences might be weakened by pollutants, largely detected in aquatic ecosystems, leading to the facilitation for opportunistic pathogens to  infect organisms. In this context, destabilization of fish non-specific immune  parameters and erythrocyte DNA integrity was tested, on a model fish species, the  three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), after exposure to chlorpyrifos  (CPF). Alone, pesticide exposure induced a genotoxic potential (chlorpyrifos at  1.75 and 0.88µg/L) in addition to a decrease in phagocytosis capacity and a  stimulation of respiratory burst. Then, to mimic pathogenic infection, fish  exposure to chlorpyrifos was combined with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stress. In  this second experiment, an increase of DNA damage was observed in fish exposed to  a lower concentration of chlorpyrifos and LPS. Moreover, at the higher  concentration of chlorpyrifos, an early destabilization of innate immunity was  observed as suggested by the absence of an increase of lysosomal presence in fish  injected with LPS. This study highlighted the usefulness of stress on stress  responses to better understand the impact of contaminants on the organism's  health.

T2  - One health (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - OBJECTIVES: One Health is transiting from multidisciplinary to transdisciplinary concepts and its viewpoints should move from 'proxy for zoonoses', to include  other topics (climate change, nutrition and food safety, policy and planning,  welfare and well-being, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), vector-borne diseases,  toxicosis and pesticides issues) and thematic fields (social sciences, geography  and economics). This work was conducted to map the One Health landscape in  Africa. METHODS: An assessment of existing One Health initiatives in Sub-Saharan  African (SSA) countries was conducted among selected stakeholders using a  multi-method approach. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to One  Health initiatives were identified, and their influence, interest and impacts  were semi-quantitatively evaluated using literature reviews, questionnaire survey  and statistical analysis. RESULTS: One Health Networks and identified initiatives  were spatiotemporally spread across SSA and identified stakeholders were  classified into four quadrants. It was observed that imbalance in stakeholders'  representations led to hesitation in buying-in into One Health approach by  stakeholders who are outside the main networks like stakeholders from the policy,  budgeting, geography and sometimes, the environment sectors. CONCLUSION:  Inclusion of theory of change, monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and tools  for standardized evaluation of One Health policies are needed for a sustained  future of One Health and future engagements should be outputs- and  outcomes-driven and not activity-driven. National roadmaps for One Health  implementation and institutionalization are necessary, and proofs of concepts in  One Health should be validated and scaled-up. Dependence on external funding is  unsustainable and must be addressed in the medium to long-term. Necessary policy  and legal instruments to support One Health nationally and sub-nationally should  be implemented taking cognizance of contemporary issues like urbanization,  endemic poverty and other emerging issues. The utilization of current  technologies and One Health approach in addressing the ongoing pandemic of  COVID-19 and other emerging diseases are desirable. Finally, One Health  implementation should be anticipatory and preemptive, and not reactive in  containing disease outbreaks, especially those from the animal sources or the  environment before the risk of spillover to human.

AB  - Fluralaner is a novel isoxazoline insecticide which shows high insecticidal activity against parasitic, sanitary and agricultural pests, but there is little  information about the effect of fluralaner on non-target organisms. This study  reports the acute toxicity, bioconcentration, elimination and antioxidant  response of fluralaner in zebrafish. All LC(50) values of fluralaner to zebrafish  were higher than 10 mg L(-1) at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. To study the  bioconcentration and elimination, the zebrafish were exposed to sub-lethal  concentrations of fluralaner (2.00 and 0.20 mg L(-1)) for 15 d and then held 6 d  in clean water. The results showed medium BCF of fluralaner with values of 12.06  (48 h) and 21.34 (144 h) after exposure to 2.00 and 0.20 mg L(-1) fluralaner,  respectively. In the elimination process, a concentration of only 0.113 mg kg(-1)  was found in zebrafish on the 6th day after removal to clean water. After  exposure in 2.00 mg L(-1) fluralaner, the enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GST,  GSH-PX, CarE and content of MDA were measured. Only CAT and CarE activities were  significantly regulated and the others stayed at a stable level compared to the  control group. Meanwhile, transcriptional expression of CYP1C2, CYP1D1, CYP11A  were significantly down-regulated at 12 h exposed to 2.00 mg L(-1) of fluralaner.  Except CYP1D1, others CYPs were up-regulated at different time during exposure  periods. Fluralaner and its formulated product (BRAVECTO(®)) are of low toxicity  to zebrafish and are rapidly concentrated in zebrafish and eliminated after  exposure in clean water. Antioxidant defense and metabolic systems were involved  in the fluralaner-induced toxicity. Among them, the activities of CAT and CarE,  and most mRNA expression level of CYPs showed fast response to the sub-lethal  concentration of fluralaner, which could be used as a biomarker relevant to the  toxicity.

T2  - BMC veterinary research
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pyrethroid class of insecticides, including deltamethrin, is being used as substitutes for organochlorines and organophosphates in  pest-control programs because of their low environmental persistence and  toxicity. This study was aimed to investigate the impact of commonly used  pesticides (deltamethrin) on the blood and tissue oxidative stress level in  catfish (Clarias gariepinus); in addition to the protective effect of  α-tocopherol on deltamethrin induced oxidative stress. Catfish were divided into  three groups, 1st control group include 20 fish divided into two tanks each one  contain 10 fish, 2nd deltamethrin group, where Fish exposed to deltamethrin in a  concentration (0.75 μg/l) and 3rd Vitamin E group, Fish exposed to deltamethrin  and vitamin E at a dose of 12 μg/l for successive 4 days.Serum, liver, kidney and  Gills were collected for biochemical assays. Tissue oxidative stress biomarkers  malondialdhyde (MDA) and catalase activity in liver, kidney and gills tissues,  serum liver enzymes (ALT and AST), serum albumin, total protein, urea and  creatinine were analysed. RESULTS: Our results showed that 48 h. exposure to 0.75  μg/l deltamethrin significantly (p < 0.05) increased lipid peroxidation (MDA) in  the liver, kidney and gills while catalase activity was significantly decreased  in the same tissues. This accompanied by significant increase in serum ALT, AST  activity, urea and creatinine and a marked decrease in serum albumin and total  proteins. CONCLUSIONS: It could be concluded that deltamethrin is highly toxic to  catfish even in very low concentration (0.75 μg/l). Moreover the effect of  deltamethrin was pronounced in the liver of catfish in comparison with kidneys  and gills. Moreover fish antioxidants and oxidative stress could be used as  biomarkers for aquatic pollution, thus helping in the diagnosis of pollution.  Administration of 12 μg/l α-tocopherol restored the quantified tissue and serum  parameters, so supplementation of α-tocopherol consider an effective way to  counter the toxicity of deltamethrin in the catfish.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of Roundup on oxidative status in adult Danio rerio liver and gills. Reactive oxygen species  (ROS) and antioxidant capacity (ACAP) were measured in fish after exposure to  Roundup (5 and 10 mg/L) for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Furthermore, gene expression  related to antioxidant response was evaluated after 24 and 96 h. In gills, an  increase in ACAP was observed after 96 h in the highest concentration. In the  liver, a reduction in ROS and ACAP was observed after 24 h, whereas an increase  in ACAP was observed after 48 h in the highest concentration. Exposure to the  lowest concentration caused a reduction in ROS after 72 and 96 h. Regarding gene  expression, a reduction in superoxide dismutase 2 (sod2) and glutathione  S-transferase (gstπ) was observed. An increase in uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1)  expression was observed in gills of animals exposed to the highest concentration  after 24 h. Glutathione peroxidase (gpx) gene expression was reduced in the gills  of animals exposed to the lowest concentration; however, it was induced in liver  tissue after 96 h of exposure to the highest concentration. These results  indicate that zebrafish exposure to Roundup alters oxidative status and causes a  response in terms of antioxidant defense system gene expression.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most widely used insecticides and has been found in both urban and rural water bodies. In this study, we studied variations in the  social behavioral patterns, swimming behavior, and brain acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) activity of Japanese medaka exposed to lethal (0.12mg/L) and sublethal  (0.012mg/L) concentrations of CPF after different exposure times. Group behavior  performance (schooling, shoaling, and solitary) was determined on day 4 of lethal  exposure and on days 4, 8, and 12 of sublethal exposure. Swimming speed and brain  AChE activity were measured on days 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 of sublethal CPF  exposure. We observed significant decreases in social behavior and swimming speed  (i.e., hypoactivity) in fish exposed to lethal CPF concentrations for 4 days. At  the sublethal concentration, there was increased schooling duration and  hyperactivity of fish on day 8 but not on day 4. In contrast, 12 days of  sublethal CPF exposure resulted in social behavior responses similar to those  after 4 days' lethal exposure, i.e., significant decreases in schooling frequency  and duration with a notable increase in duration of solitary behavior. Brain AChE  activity was inhibited in a time-dependent manner. Altered fish behavior in  response to organophosphorus pesticides such as CPF may be mediated by more than  AChE inhibition alone.

AB  - The EcoToxChip project includes RNA-sequencing data from experiments involving model (Japanese quail, fathead minnow, African clawed frog) and ecological  (double-crested cormorant, rainbow trout, northern leopard frog) species at  multiple life stages (whole embryo and adult) exposed to eight chemicals of  environmental concern known to perturb a wide range of biological systems  (ethinyl estradiol, hexabromocyclododecane, lead, selenomethionine, 17β  trenbolone, chlorpyrifos, fluoxetine, and benzo[a]pyrene). The objectives of this  short communication were to (1) present and make available this RNA-sequencing  database (i.e., 724 samples from 49 experiments) under the FAIR principles (FAIR  data are data which meet principles of findability, accessibility,  interoperability, and reusability), while also summarizing key meta-data  attributes and (2) use ExpressAnalyst (including the Seq2Fun algorithm and  EcoOmicsDB) to perform a comparative transcriptomics analysis of this database  focusing on baseline and differential transcriptomic changes across species-life  stage-chemical combinations. The database is available in NCBI GEO under  accession number GSE239776. Across all species, the number of raw reads per  sample ranged between 13 and 58 million, with 30% to 79% of clean reads mapped to  the "vertebrate" subgroup database in EcoOmicsDB. Principal component analyses of  the reads illustrated separation across the three taxonomic groups as well as  some between tissue types. The most common differentially expressed gene was  CYP1A1 followed by CTSE, FAM20CL, MYC, ST1S3, RIPK4, VTG1, and VIT2. The most  common enriched pathways were metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of cofactors and  biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and chemical carcinogenesis, drug  metabolism, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. The RNA-sequencing  database in the present study may be used by the research community for multiple  purposes, including, for example, cross-species investigations, in-depth analyses  of a particular test compound, and transcriptomic meta-analyses.

T2  - Toxics
AB  - Imidacloprid (IMI) is part of the neonicotinoids family, insecticides widely used by humans and also found in wastewater. This class of compounds, if present in  the environment, can cause toxicity to different species such as bees and  gammarids, although little is known about vertebrates such as fish. In addition,  several substances have been reported in the environment that can cause damage to  aquatic species, such as potassium perchlorate (KClO(4)), if exposed to high  concentrations or for long periods. Often, the co-presence of different  contaminants can cause a synergistic action in terms of toxicity to fish. In the  present study, we first analyzed different concentrations of IMI (75, 100 and 150  mg/L) and KClO(4) (1, 1.5 and 5 mM) to highlight the morphological effects at 96  hpf and, subsequently, chose two nontoxic concentrations to evaluate their  co-exposure and the pathway involved in their co-toxicity. Morphological  alteration, mucus production, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression related to  intestinal function and oxidative stress were measured. These results suggest  that co-exposure to IMI and KClO(4) could affect zebrafish embryo development by  increasing gut toxicity and the alteration of antioxidative defense mechanisms.

T2  - Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology
AB  - Roundup is the most popular commercial glyphosate formulation applied in the cultivation of genetically modified glyphosate-resistant crops. The aim of this  study was to evaluate the histological lesions of the neotropical native fish,  Jenynsia multidentata, in response to acute and subchronic exposure to Roundup  and to determine if subchronic exposure to the herbicide causes changes in male  sexual activity of individuals exposed to a sublethal concentration (0.5 mg/l)  for 7 and 28 days. The estimated 96-h LC50 was 19.02 mg/l for both male and  female fish. Gill and liver histological lesions were evaluated through  histopathological indices allowing quantification of the histological damages in  fish exposed to different concentrations of the herbicide. Roundup induced  different histological alterations in a concentration-dependent manner. In  subchronic-exposure tests, Roundup also altered normal histology of the studied  organs and caused a significant decrease in the number of copulations and mating  success in male fish exposed to the herbicide. It is expected that in natural  environments contaminated with Roundup, both general health condition and  reproductive success of J. multidenatata could be seriously affected.

AB  - In teleost fish, radial glial cells (RGCs) are progenitor cells for neurons and the major cell type synthesizing neuroestrogens. We hypothesized that chemical  exposure impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics of RGCs, which then may lead to  downstream consequences for neuroestrogen production. Here we provide proof of  concept that mitochondria of RGCs can be perturbed by fungicides. We isolated  RGCs from a mixed sex population of goldfish (Carassius auratus) and measured  metabolic capacity of primary cells to a model mitotoxin fluazinam, a  broad-spectrum fungicide that inhibits mitochondria electron transport chain (or  ETC) Complex I. Using immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR, we demonstrate that  the goldfish primary cell cultures are highly enriched for glia after multiple  passages. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that glia treated with >25 μM fluazinam  for 24 and 48-h showed reduced viability. As such, metabolic assays were  conducted with non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.25-12.5 μM). Fluazinam did not  affect oxygen consumption rates of RGCs at 24 h, but after 48 h, oligomycin  induced ATP-linked respiration was decreased by both 6.25 and 12.5 μM fluazinam.  Moreover, concentrations as low as 0.25 μM disrupted the mitochondrial membrane  potential of RGCs, reflecting strong uncoupling effects of the fungicide on  mitochondria. Here we provide proof of concept that mitochondrial bioenergetics  of teleostean RGCs can be responsive to agrochemicals. Additional studies are  required to address low-dose exposures in vivo and to determine if metabolic  disruption impairs neuroendocrine functions of RGCs. We propose this mechanism  constitutes a novel aspect of neuroendocrine disruption, significant because  dysregulation of neuron-glia communication is expected to contribute to  neuroendocrine disruption.

AB  - Two topically applied spot-on products--65% permethrin (Defend Exspot Treatment for Dogs, Schering-Plough Animal Health, Union, NJ) and 9.7% fipronil (Frontline  Spot On Dog, Merial Limited, Iselin, NJ)--used for canine flea and tick control  were evaluated for repellency against Ixodes ricinus, the tick species that is  the primary vector of Lyme disease in Europe. Eighteen dogs were randomly  assigned to the following treatment groups (n = 6): (1) 65% permethrin, (2) 9.7%  fipronil, or (3) untreated control. Dogs were exposed to ticks in individually  assigned cages with a carpet that covered =70% of the cage bottom. Dogs in  treatment groups 1 and 2 were treated in accordance with label directions for  each re-spective product on study day 0. Fifty unfed, male and female adult ticks  were placed in the cages 15 to 30 minutes before the dogs. The dogs were placed  in the cages for a 2-hour exposure period at 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 41 days  after treatment. After a 2-hour exposure period, dogs were removed from the cages  and live (attached and unattached) and dead ticks were counted on the dogs, on  the carpets, and in the cages. Cages were thoroughly cleaned and new carpet was  used for each tick exposure period. Treatment of dogs with 65% permethrin reduced  tick numbers on dogs by 99.1% at 2 days, 99.0% at 1 week, 95.9% at 2 weeks, 88.5%  at 3 weeks, 87.1% at 4 weeks, and 48.0% at 6 weeks after application. In  contrast, treatment of dogs with 9.7% fipronil reduced tick numbers on dogs by  61.4% at 2 days, 51.6% at 1 week, 37.0% at 2 weeks, 33.7% at 3 weeks, 10.8% at 4  weeks, and 0% at 6 weeks after application. The efficacy of 65% permethrin was  significant (P < or = .05) when compared to the control at all challenges,  whereas the efficacy of 9.7% fipronil was not significant as compared to controls  at 21, 28, 35, and 41 days after treatment. The 65% permethrin killed  significantly more Ixodes ricinus ticks (P < or = .05) than 9.7% fipronil from 2  to 41 days after treatment. The 65% permethrin repelled 1.9-, 2.0-, 3.0-, 43.3-,  3.9-, 8.9-, and 17.3-fold more Ixodes ricinus than did 9.7% fipronil at 2, 7, 14,  21, 28, 35, and 41 days after treatment, respectively, and all differences in  repellency were significant (P < or = .05).

AB  - Atrazine (ATZ) is a herbicide worldwide used. That can cause oxidative damage in non-target organisms, such as fish. Furthermore, the threat of exposure to  pesticides together with poor nutrition is hazardous to the normal development of  fish, and supplementation of the fish diet with antioxidants compounds is an  alternative approach to prevent the hazardous effects of pesticide exposure. Here  we aimed to investigate the capacity of diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)(2) diet  supplementation to improve the antioxidant defense of Cyprinus carpio (carp)  exposed to environmental concentrations of ATZ. To prove the efficiency of  (PhSe)(2), we used the Integrated Biomarkers Response (IBR) methodology.  Therefore, carp were fed for 8 weeks diets either with or without (PhSe)(2) and  exposed to 2 or 10µg/L of ATZ for 96h, euthanized, and their liver, gills, and  muscle tissues were removed for biochemical assays. ATZ was able to cause  oxidative damage from reactive species production in all tissues of carp, as  observed by the increase of lipid peroxidation and protein damage. The activity  of some antioxidant enzymes was inhibited in carp exposed to ATZ. However,  (PhSe)(2) supplementation was able to prevent this ATZ-induced damage by  improving the activities of antioxidant enzymes and through antioxidant  competence of (PhSe)(2)per se. Furthermore, IBR was shown to be a useful tool to  compare treatments, even at different concentrations, and identify the  efficiently antioxidant behavior of the organoselenium compound.

AB  - Sea bass were experimentally infected with Listonella anguillarum or Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp). At 24 and 72h post-infection,  the expression analysis of immune-relevant genes (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, Hepcidin),  the transcriptional level and detection of HSP70, and the quantification of serum  iron were investigated in association with the histological analysis and the  bacterial recognition in tissues by immunohistochemistry. At 15 days  post-infection, the specific antibody response was detected in surviving fish, as  well as the transcriptional levels of TcR and BcR sequences. Both experimental  infections were characterized by a similar acute response, whereas different  histological and immunohistochemistry evidences were observed. In particular, the  early reaction appeared suitable for the clearance of L. anguillarum, thus  limiting the histological lesions, the bacterial dissemination and the further  development of acquired immunity in surviving fish. On the contrary, the innate  response appeared not enough to resolve the Phdp infection, which was  characterized by tissue damage, bacterial widespread and substantial detection of  specific humoral immunity in surviving fish, also associated to lymphocytes  clonal expansion. Besides the opportunistic conditions involved in fish vibriosis  and pasteurellosis, the comparison between these experimental infection models  seems to suggest that the rate of development of the acquired immunity is  strictly linked to the activation of the host innate response combined to the  degree of bacterial virulence.

AB  - Imidacloprid, a widely used neonicotinoid insecticide, poses a significant threat to aquatic ecosystems. Behavior is a functional indicator of the net sensory,  motor, and integrative processes of the nervous system and is presumed to be more  sensitive in detecting toxicity. In the present study, we investigated the  behavioral effects of imidacloprid at the level of environmental concentrations  (1, 10 and 100 μg/L) for a constant exposure to zebrafish adults, and performed  the integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis to analyze the molecular  mechanism underlying behavioral effects of imidacloprid. Our results show that  imidacloprid exposure significantly induce behavioral disruptions characterized  by anxiety, depression, and reduced physiological function including exploratory,  decision, social interaction and locomotor activity. Integrated transcriptomic  and metabolomic analysis indicate that the disruption of circadian rhythm,  metabolic imbalance of arginine and proline, and neurotransmitter disorder are  the underlying molecular mechanisms of behavioral impairment induced by  imidacloprid. The "gene-metabolite-disease" network consisted by 11 metabolites  and 15 genes is associated human disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) and  schizophrenia. Our results confirm the behavioral impairment induced by  imidacloprid at environmental concentrations for constant exposure. The  identified genes and metabolites can be used not only to illustrate the  underlying mechanisms, but also can be developed as biomarkers in determining the  ecological risk of imidacloprid to aquatic organisms even Homo sapiens.

AB  - Inflammasomes are important innate immune components in mammals. However, the bacterial factors modulating inflammasome activation in fish, and the mechanisms  by which they alter fish immune defences, remain to be investigated. In this  work, a mutant of the fish pathogen Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida), called  0909I, was shown to overexpress haemolysin, which could induce a robust  pyroptotic-like cell death dependent on caspase-5-like activity during infection  in fish nonphagocyte cells. E. piscicida haemolysin was found to mainly associate  with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which were internalised into the  fish cells via a dynamin-dependent endocytosis and induced pyroptotic-like cell  death. Importantly, bacterial immersion infection of both larvae and adult  zebrafish suggested that dysregulated expression of haemolysin alerts the innate  immune system and induces intestinal inflammation to restrict bacterial  colonisation in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest a critical role of  zebrafish innate immunity in monitoring invaded pathogens via detecting the  bacterial haemolysin-associated OMVs and initiating pyroptotic-like cell death.  These new additions to the understanding of haemolysin-mediated pathogenesis in  vivo provide evidence for the existence of noncanonical inflammasome signalling  in lower vertebrates.

AB  - Pesticides applied to paddy fields may pose considerable danger to non-target aquatic organisms and further threaten human health. Flufiprole is a pesticide  used in rice fields; considering the widespread existence of rice-fish-farming  ecosystems, the acute toxicities of flufiprole enantiomers and its six  metabolites (fipronil, flufiprole sulfide, flufiprole sulfone,  detrifluoromethylsulfinyl flufiprole, desulfinyl flufiprole, and flufiprole  amide) to four common aquatic organisms in rice fields including Misgurnus  anguillicaudatus (pond loach), Carassius gibelio (Prussian carp), Pelophylax  nigromaculatus (black-spotted frog), and Daphnia magna (water flea) were  investigated. Genotoxicity, pathological changes and the effects on the  antioxidant system of M. anguillicaudatus were also evaluated after exposure. The  LC(50) (EC(50)) values showed that fipronil and desulfinyl flufiprole were the  most toxic compounds and were approximately about six times as toxic as  flufiprole. No enantioselective toxicity was observed between the two  enantiomers. The activity of antioxidant defense enzymes and the content of  malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver and gills of M. anguillicaudatus were  significantly increased by the chemicals in most cases. In addition, fipronil and  desulfinyl flufiprole were found to induce an increase in the micronucleus rate  in M. anguillicaudatus. Histopathological analysis showed that the liver of  M. anguillicaudatus was not significantly affected by flufiprole. Our study  demonstrated a potential negative effect on flufiprole-treated aquatic organisms.  As an alternative to fipronil, the environmental risk of flufiprole and its  metabolites to non-target organisms in rice fields cannot be ignored.

AB  - Galectin (Gal) is a member of a family of β-galactoside-binding lectin. The members of this family play important roles in the recognition of carbohydrate  ligands and in various other biological processes. In this study, we identified  the gene encoding Gal-9 in Pagrus major (PmGal-9) and analyzed its expression in  various tissues after pathogen challenge. Alignment analysis revealed that the  two galactose-binding lectin domains of the deduced protein were highly conserved  among all the teleosts. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PmGal-9 is most  closely related to the Gal-9 gene of gilthead sea bream. PmGal-9 was ubiquitously  expressed in all tissues analyzed but was predominantly expressed in the spleen,  head kidney, and intestine. After challenges with major microbial pathogens  (Edwardsiella piscicida, Streptococcus iniae, or red sea bream iridovirus) of red  sea bream, PmGal-9 mRNA expression was significantly regulated in most  immune-related tissues. These results suggested that PmGal-9 not only plays an  important role in the immune system of red sea bream but is also a possible  inflammatory marker for pathogenic diseases.

AB  - Pesticide usage has contributed to increasing food production; it has also caused them to be found in ecosystems inducing adverse effects on biota. Fish are the  most abundant and diverse vertebrates in the world and are of great importance  both economically and ecologically. Some fishes are indicators of the  environmental quality of aquatic ecosystems and provide insight as to how  pollutants might influence public health. The tilapias species can be considered  biomonitors because they present little displacement representing the  contamination level of a site. This study aimed at three goals: (1) to determine  the concentration of 20 pesticides in tilapia muscle in the Ayuquila-Armería  basin, (2) to describe the spatiotemporal variation of analytes and (3) to  evaluate the risk of consuming contaminated fish. The presence of 11 pesticides  was determined. Ametrine, glyphosate and malathion concentrations showed  significant differences by season. The risk assessment showed that the  consumption of tilapia muscle from the Ayuquila-Armería basin does not represent  a risk for the population. Diazinon concentrations were relatively low compared  to the other pesticides concentrations, but its toxic characteristics were the  ones that most negatively influenced the risk assessment. The results obtained  are relevant from the social and economic points of view.

AB  - Three varieties of a popular African cichlid aquarium species, Pseudotropheus zebra, from 2 tropical fish farms in east central Florida were submitted for  diagnostic evaluation because of the development of multifocal green lesions. The  percentage of infected fish in these populations varied from 5 to 60%. Fish were  otherwise clinically normal. Microscopic examination of fresh and fixed lesions  confirmed algal dermatitis, with light invasion of several internal organs in  each group. A different alga was identified from each farm. Fish from farm A were  infected with Chlorochytrium spp, whereas fish from farm B were infected with  Scenedesmus spp. Because of the numbers of fish involved, bath treatments to  remove the algae from affected fish from farm B were attempted, with different  dosages of several common algaecides including copper sulfate pentahydrate,  diuron, and sodium chloride. However, none of these treatments were successful,  possibly because of the location of the algae under the scales and within the  dermis, and also because of the sequestering effect of the granulomatous  response. To our knowledge, this is the first report of algal dermatitis in  ornamental cichlids, as well as the first report of Scenedesmus spp infection in  any fish.

AB  - The glyphosate-based herbicide, Roundup, is among the most used pesticides worldwide. Due to its extensive use, it has been widely detected in aquatic  ecosystems representing a potential threat to non-target organisms, including  fish. Despite the negative impact of this commercial formulation in fish, as  described in literature, the scarcity of studies assessing its genotoxicity and  underlying mechanisms is evident. Therefore, as a novel approach, this study  evaluated the genotoxic potential of Roundup to blood cells of the European eel  (Anguilla anguilla) following short-term (1 and 3 days) exposure to  environmentally realistic concentrations (58 and 116 microg/l), addressing also  the possible association with oxidative stress. Thus, comet and erythrocytic  nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) assays were adopted, as genotoxic end points,  reflecting different types of genetic damage. The pro-oxidant state was assessed  through enzymatic (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase  and glutathione reductase) and non-enzymatic (total glutathione content)  antioxidants, as well as by lipid peroxidation (LPO) measurements. The Roundup  potential to induce DNA strand breaks for both concentrations was demonstrated by  the comet assay. The induction of chromosome breakage and/or segregational  abnormalities was also demonstrated through the ENA assay, though only after  3-day exposure to both tested concentrations. In addition, the two genotoxic  indicators were positively correlated. Antioxidant defences were unresponsive to  Roundup. LPO levels increased only for the high concentration after the first day  of exposure, indicating that oxidative stress caused by this agrochemical in  blood was not severe. Overall results suggested that both DNA damaging effects  induced by Roundup are not directly related with an increased pro-oxidant state.  Moreover, it was demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations of  Roundup can pose a health risk for fish populations.

AB  - MicroRNA (miRNA) can regulate the expression of its target gene by mediating mRNA cleavage or by translational repression at a post-transcriptional level. Usually,  one miRNA may regulate many genes as its targets, while one gene may also be  targeted by many miRNAs. We previously demonstrated that cyb561d2, whose protein  product is involved in cell defense, and chemical stress, is targeted by miR-155  in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) when exposed to fipronil  (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl)  sulphinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile). Microcosm Targets prediction showed that  the cyb561d2 gene is also highly possibly targeted by miR-194a, miR-216b,  miR-429, and miR-499. These interactions need to be further validated  experimentally. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR-194a,  miR-216b, miR-429, miR-499 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish and investigated whether  these four miRNAs could regulate the expression of cyb561d2 in both mRNA and  protein levels. The expression of cyb561d2 was upregulated in both mRNA and  protein level in a dose-dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil, and  miR-216b and miR-499 were downregulated concurrently, whereas there was no  significant changes were observed in the expression level of miR-194a and  miR-429. The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR-216b and miR-499  interacted with cyb561d2 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR), miR-194a and miR-429  did not stimulate degradation of cyb561d2 mRNA. The expression of cyb561d2 was  reduced in both mRNA and protein level when ZF4 cells were transfected with  miR-499 mimic, whereas expression level of both mRNA and protein was increased  when endogenous miR-499 was inhibited by transfection with miR-499 inhibitor.  Likewise, the mRNA and protein level of cyb561d2 was affected by treatment with  the mimics and the inhibitor of miR-216b. In contrast, when ZF4 cells were  transfected with a mimic of miR-194a or miR-429, the expression of cyb561d2 mRNA  was not significantly changed. As a result, cyb561d2 is targeted by miR-155,  miR-216b and miR-499 upon fipronil exposure, and miR-194a and miR-429 can not  target cyb561d2. The expression pattern of these 3 miRNAs presents novel fipronil  responses that could be used as a toxicological biomarker.

AB  - Diuron and its biodegradation metabolites were recently reported to cause alterations in plasma steroid hormone concentrations with subsequent impacts on  reproductive development in fish. Since steroid hormone biosynthesis is regulated  through neurotransmission of the central nervous system (CNS), studies were  conducted to determine whether neurotransmitters that control hormone  biosynthesis could be affected after diuron and diuron metabolites treatment. As  the same neurotransmitters and steroid hormones regulate behavioral outcomes,  aggression was also evaluated in male Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Male  tilapias were exposed for 10 days to waterborne diuron and the metabolites  3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA), 3,4-dichlorophenyl-N-methylurea (DCPMU), at nominal  concentrations of 100 ng L(-1). In contrast to Diuron, DCA and DCPMU  significantly diminished plasma testosterone concentrations (39.4% and 36.8%,  respectively) and reduced dopamine levels in the brain (47.1% and 44.2%,  respectively). In addition, concentrations of the stress steroid, cortisol were  increased after DCA (71.0%) and DCPMU (57.8-%) exposure. A significant decrease  in aggressive behavior was also observed in animals treated with the metabolites  DCA (50.9%) and DCPMU (68.8%). These results indicate that biotransformation of  diuron to active metabolites alter signaling pathways of the CNS which may impact  androgen and the stress response as well as behavior necessary for social  dominance, growth, and reproduction.

AB  - Atrazine is a herbicide that is banned in Europe but remains widely used on different types of crops in several countries in the American continent. Atrazine  is known to be an endocrine disruptor and its effects on gonads have been  extensively reported, but the toxic action on other organs is poorly documented.  In this paper, we investigated the toxicity of atrazine on the gills and spleens  of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The median lethal concentration  (LC(50)), capable of killing one-half of the test animals was calculated, and  sublethal concentrations of atrazine were used in a semistatic and subchronic  assay. The following four experimental groups were formed: control not exposed to  atrazine, a group exposed to 1 ppm atrazine for 15 days, a group exposed to 2 ppm  for 7 days, and a group exposed to 2 ppm for 15 days. The concentrations were  verified during the study by high performance liquid chromatography. The gills  and spleens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and histopathological  findings were made. The Perls technique was used on the spleens to identify  hemosiderin, lipofuscin, and melanin pigments in the cells from melanomacrophage  centres (MMCs). The spleens were submitted to proliferating cell nuclear antigen  (PCNA) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunohistochemistry, and  morphometry was used to assess splenocyte proliferation and melanomacrophage iNOS  expression. Finally, a colorimetric assay for caspase-3 was performed on the  spleens to identify apoptosis. Vascular and structural alterations, such as  venous sinus congestion, aneurysm, hemorrhage, pillar cell hypertrophy,  disarrangement of secondary lamellae, and epithelial lifting were observed in the  gills. The frequency of individuals with aneurysms was higher in the groups  treated with 2 ppm than in other groups. Atrazine had an immunomodulatory effect  on the spleen, observed by the alteration in the percentage of red and white  pulp, alteration of the MMC area, changes in the melanomacrophage pigment  content, slight iNOS suppression, decrease in splenocyte proliferation under  1 ppm atrazine, and increased caspase 3 activity under 2 ppm atrazine after 7 and  15 d. Such effects could compromise oxygenation and the immune response and,  ultimately, the survival and fitness of the fish.

AB  - As the lowest organisms possessing T cells, fish are instrumental for understanding T cell evolution and immune defense in early vertebrates. This  study established in Nile tilapia models suggests that T cells play a critical  role in resisting Edwardsiella piscicida infection via cytotoxicity and are  essential for IgM(+) B cell response. CD3 and CD28 monoclonal antibody  crosslinking reveals that full activation of tilapia T cells requires the first  and secondary signals, while Ca(2+) -NFAT, MAPK/ERK, NF-κB, and mTORC1 pathways  and IgM(+) B cells collectively regulate T cell activation. Thus, despite the  large evolutionary distance, tilapia and mammals such as mice and humans exhibit  similar T cell functions. Furthermore, it is speculated that transcriptional  networks and metabolic reprogramming, especially c-Myc-mediated glutamine  metabolism triggered by mTORC1 and MAPK/ERK pathways, underlie the functional  similarity of T cells between tilapia and mammals. Notably, tilapia, frogs,  chickens, and mice utilize the same mechanisms to facilitate  glutaminolysis-regulated T cell responses, and restoration of the glutaminolysis  pathway using tilapia components rescues the immunodeficiency of human Jurkat T  cells. Thus, this study provides a comprehensive picture of T cell immunity in  tilapia, sheds novel perspectives for understanding T cell evolution, and offers  potential avenues for intervening in human immunodeficiency.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate Roundup effects on biochemical biomarkers of the neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. Fish were acutely exposed (6, 24 and 96 h)  to 10 mg L(-1) of Roundup (RD) or only water (control) and samples of liver, for  antioxidants analysis, and brain and muscle, for acetylcholinesterase (AChE)  determination, were collected. Fish exposed to RD for 24h showed reduction on  superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, and  increased glutathione (GSH) content. After 24 and 96h, fish of RD group showed  increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity and lipid peroxidation. AChE  activity was inhibited in brain after 96h and in muscle after 24 and 96h of  exposure. Thus, acute exposure to RD stimulated the biotransformation pathway,  with increased GST, but interfered on the antioxidant defenses, with reduction of  SOD and GPx activity, leading to the occurrence of lipid peroxidation. Inhibition  of AChE showed that RD acts as a contaminant with anti-AChE action.

AB  - Lufenuron is a benzoylurea insecticide that interfere in chitin synthesis in insects. Although lufenuron is widely used in agriculture and aquaculture, rare  are studies described that relates to possible toxic effects in fish. This work  aimed to evaluate acute and chronic toxic effects of benzoylurea pesticide  (lufenuron) on biological parameters of Colossoma macropomum (Tambaqui). In the  acute test, juveniles of Tambaqui were divided into control group and five  experimental groups with exposure from 0.1 to 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron for 96 h.  Animals were also submitted to chronic toxicity test for four months in  concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/L of lufenuron, the concentration used in the  treatment of ectoparasites in fish and 50% of LC50 96 h, respectively. The  presence of hemorrhages was observed in eyes, fins and operculum of fish exposed  to 0.7 and 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron. Histological analysis showed changes in the  morphology of fish gills submitted to acute toxicity test, as lamellar aneurysm  and blood congestion inside lamellae. Lufenuron promoted damage in fish retina as  in ability to respond to stimuli in photoreceptors and in ON-bipolar cells in  acute test. In chronic test, blood glucose analysis and morphometric parameters  showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). In general, Tambaqui exhibited  behaviors associated with stress when exposed to lufenuron. Thus, lufenuron  showed several toxic effects in relation to biological parameters in Tambaqui.  This concerns about the use and discard of lufenuron, and indicates the  requirement of environmental actions to prevent potential contamination of  aquatic biota.

AB  - Our earlier studies showed the inhibitory effects of cadmium (Cd) and paraquat (PQ) on the gene expression of DNA mismatch recognition proteins in zebrafish  (Danio rerio) embryos. This study explored the effects of Cd and PQ on nucleotide  excision repair (NER) capacity in zebrafish embryos. Exposure of embryos at 1 h  post fertilization (hpf) to 3-5 μM Cd or 30-100 μM PQ for 9 h induced a 2-3-fold  increase of oxidative stress, while a 6.5-fold increase of oxidative stress was  induced by 200 μM PQ. Real-time RT-PCR detected a down-regulated xeroderma  pigmentosum C (XPC) and an up-regulated UV-DDB2 gene expression in  mildly-stressed embryos, whereas 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) gene  expression increased with PQ exposure levels. NER of UV-damaged DNA was enhanced  in weakly oxidant-stressed embryos as shown by a transcription-based DNA repair  assay, yet repair activities of both UV and cisplatin-damaged DNA were inhibited  in embryos exposed to 200 μM PQ. Band shift assay showed a suppression of  cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) binding activity in all stressed embryos. In  contrast, (6-4) photoproduct (6-4PP) recognition activity was weakly stimulated  except in embryos exposed to 200 μM PQ, revealing a link of NER capacity to 6-4PP  binding. Our results showed that Cd and PQ imposed similar inducing effects on  UV-DDB2 gene expression, NER of UV-damaged DNA and 6-4PP binding activity in  zebrafish embryo under low levels of oxidative stress and NER capacity could be  inhibited if the intensity of oxidative stress increased to a critical level.

AB  - The presence of neuropathological effects proved to be, for many years, the main endpoint for assessing the neurotoxicity of a chemical substance. However, in the  last 50 years, the effects of chemicals on the behavior of model species have  been actively investigated. Progressively, behavioral endpoints were incorporated  into neurotoxicological screening protocols, and these functional outcomes are  now routinely used to identify and determine the potential neurotoxicity of  chemicals. Behavioral assays in adult zebrafish provide a standardized and  reliable means to study a wide range of behaviors, including anxiety, social  interaction, learning, memory, and addiction. Behavioral assays in adult  zebrafish typically involve placing the fish in an experimental arena and  recording and analyzing their behavior using video tracking software. Fish can be  exposed to various stimuli, and their behavior can be quantified using a variety  of metrics. The novel tank test is one of the most accepted and widely used tests  to study anxiety-like behavior in fish. The shoaling and social preference tests  are useful in studying the social behavior of zebrafish. This assay is  particularly interesting since the behavior of the entire shoal is studied. These  assays have proven to be highly reproducible and sensitive to pharmacological and  genetic manipulations, making them valuable tools for studying the neural  circuits and molecular mechanisms underlying behavior. Additionally, these assays  can be used in drug screening to identify compounds that may be potential  modulators of behavior. We will show in this work how to apply behavioral tools  in fish neurotoxicology, analyzing the effect of methamphetamine, a recreational  drug, and glyphosate, an environmental pollutant. The results demonstrate the  significant contribution of behavioral assays in adult zebrafish to the  understanding of the neurotoxicological effects of environmental pollutants and  drugs, in addition to providing insights into the molecular mechanisms that may  alter neuronal function.

AB  - Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic molecule playing vital roles in various signaling cascades, including cell proliferation, and  activation of immune responses against infections. It is well known as a pivotal  regulator of innate immunity. In this study, we have rescued and characterized  two members of the MIF family, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (OfMIF) and  D-Dopachrome tautomerase (OfDDT) from rock bream, Oplegnathus fasciatus. The  deduced OfMIF and OfDDT protein sequences revealed the presence of the catalytic  oxidoreductase (CXXC), motif. They also possessed highly conserved proline (P(2))  and lysine residues (K(33)), responsible for their isomerase and tautomerase  functions. Rock bream MIF and DDT homologues shared higher identity with fish  homologues and also with mammals and occupied a distinct position in the  phylogenetic tree, depicting their evolutionary conservation. The spatial  expression analysis revealed the highest expression of both OfMIF and OfDDT in  liver, while portraying constitutive expression in other tissues. The recombinant  proteins purified using the Escherichia coli system revealed potent  oxidoreductase activity against insulin with both dithiothreitol and glutathione  as reducing agents. Stimulation of rock bream head kidney cells with recombinant  OfMIF and OfDDT proteins induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines like  tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-1β  (IL-1β). These results together suggest their involvement in rock bream immune  defense and this study on the novel MIF family member DDT from rock bream will  pave the way for further studies of this homologue in other teleosts and  delineate its multiple functions.

AB  - The widespread use of atrazine, a herbicide used to control weeds, has contributed to the increased contamination of aquatic environments. To assess the  toxicological effects of a xenobiotic on a nontarget organism in the laboratory,  different models of toxicological exposure systems have been widely used.  Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the action of  sublethal concentrations of atrazine on the hepatic histology of Oreochromis  niloticus, considering two models of exposure: static (where atrazine was only  added once) and semi-static (where atrazine was periodically renewed). Fish were  exposed to a concentration of 2 ppm atrazine for 15 days, which was verified by  high-performance liquid chromatography. The livers were stained with hematoxylin  and eosin and histopathological data were collected. In addition, they were  submitted to immunohistochemistry for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). A  maximum variation of 45% (static) and 12.5% (semi-static) was observed between  the observed and nominal atrazine concentration. Nuclear and cytoplasmic changes  were observed in both experimental models. Hepatocytes from the livers of the  static system showed a degenerative appearance, while in the semi-static system,  intense cytoplasmic vacuolization and necrosis were observed. iNOS positive cells  were identified only in macrophages in the hepatocytes of fish in the semi-static  system. These results directly showed how the choice of exposure system can  influence the results of toxicological tests. However, future analysis  investigating the by-products and nitrogen products should be carried out since  the histopathological findings revealed the possibility of these compounds  serving as secondary contamination routes.

AB  - The herbicide atrazine (ATZ) is used worldwide in the control of annual grasses and broad-leaved weeds. The present study evaluated sperm quality parameters in  zebrafish Danio rerio after 11-day exposure to nominal ATZ concentrations of 2,  10, and 100 μg L(-1). All ATZ concentrations caused a decrease in motility,  mitochondrial functionality, and membrane integrity, as measured using  conventional microscopy or fluorescence microscopy with specific probes. The DNA  integrity of sperm was not affected. The levels of expression of genes related to  spermatogenesis, antioxidant defenses, and DNA repair were also investigated  using RT-qPCR. The ATZ caused transcriptional repression of the  spermatogenesis-related genes SRD5A2 and CFTR, the antioxidant defense genes SOD2  and GPX4B, and the DNA repair gene XPC. This is the first study to show that  environmentally relevant concentrations of ATZ significantly affect the sperm  quality in fish, possibly resulting in reduced fertility rates. In addition, we  showed that the repression of genes related to spermatogenesis and cellular  defense could be part of the mechanisms involved in the ATZ toxicity in the  testes of male fish.

T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - In fishes, the impacts of environmental constraints undergone during development on the behavioural response of individuals are not well understood. Obtaining  more information is important since the aquatic environment is widely exposed to  pollution involving neurotoxic compounds likely to cause phenotypic changes that  can affect animal fitness. We explored how early exposure to the pyrethroid  insecticide permethrin (PM), a compound known for its neurotoxicity, influences  the phenotypic traits in both larvae and adults of the self-fertilizing fish  mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus. First, we investigated immediate  effects of PM on larvae after one-week exposure (0-7 days post-hatching): larvae  exposed to high concentration (200 µg.L(-1)) grew less, were less active, had  negative thigmotaxis and were less likely to capture prey than control  individuals and those exposed to low concentration (5 µg.L(-1)). No difference  was found between treatments when considering oxygen consumption rate and  cortisol levels. Persistent effects of early exposure to PM on adults (147-149  days post-hatching) showed that fish previously exposed to high concentration of  PM overcompensated growth, leading them to finally be longer and heavier than  fish from other treatments. Moreover, we evidenced that levels of cortisol  interacted with early PM exposure to affect behaviours during dyadic contests.  Fish were more likely to initiate fighting behaviours and were more likely to be  aggressive when they have low pre-contest levels of cortisol, but these effects  were less pronounced when individuals were exposed to PM. This study shows that  PM can have both immediate and persistent effects on phenotypic traits in a  self-fertilizing vertebrate and suggests that a pyrethroid can interact with  hormones action to affect animal behaviour.

T2  - Biochemical Society transactions
AB  - Arguably, bacteriocins deployed in warfare among related bacteria are among the most diverse proteinacous compounds with respect to structure and mode of action.  Identification of the first prokaryotic member of the so-called MMBLs (monocot  mannose-binding lectins) or GNA (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin) lectin family and  discovery of its genus-specific killer activity in the Gram-negative bacteria  Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas has added yet another kind of toxin to this group of  allelopathic molecules. This novel feature is reminiscent of the protective  function, on the basis of antifungal, insecticidal, nematicidal or antiviral  activity, assigned to or proposed for several of the eukaryotic MMBL proteins  that are ubiquitously distributed among monocot plants, but also occur in some  other plants, fish, sponges, amoebae and fungi. Direct bactericidal activity can  also be effected by a C-type lectin, but this is a mammalian protein that limits  mucosal colonization by Gram-positive bacteria. The presence of two divergent  MMBL domains in the novel bacteriocins raises questions about task distribution  between modules and the possible role of carbohydrate binding in the specificity  of target strain recognition and killing. Notably, bacteriocin activity was also  demonstrated for a hybrid MMBL protein with an accessory protease-like domain.  This association with one or more additional modules, often with predicted  peptide-hydrolysing or -binding activity, suggests that additional bacteriotoxic  proteins may be found among the diverse chimaeric MMBL proteins encoded in  prokaryotic genomes. A phylogenetic survey of the bacterial MMBL modules reveals  a mosaic pattern of strongly diverged sequences, mainly occurring in  soil-dwelling and rhizosphere bacteria, which may reflect a trans-kingdom  acquisition of the ancestral genes.

AB  - Chronic exposure to paraquat (Pq), a toxic herbicide, can result in Parkinsonian symptoms. This study evaluated the effect of the systemic administration of Pq on  locomotion, learning and memory, social interaction, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)  expression, dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels, and  dopamine transporter (DAT) gene expression in zebrafish. Adult zebrafish received  an i.p. injection of either 10 mg/kg (Pq10) or 20 mg/kg (Pq20) of Pq every 3 days  for a total of six injections. Locomotion and distance traveled decreased at 24 h  after each injection in both treatment doses. In addition, both Pq10- and  Pq20-treated animals exhibited differential effects on the absolute turn angle.  Nonmotor behaviors were also evaluated, and no changes were observed in  anxiety-related behaviors or social interactions in Pq-treated zebrafish.  However, Pq-treated animals demonstrated impaired acquisition and consolidation  of spatial memory in the Y-maze task. Interestingly, dopamine levels increased  while DOPAC levels decreased in the zebrafish brain after both treatments.  However, DAT expression decreased in the Pq10-treated group, and there was no  change in the Pq20-treated group. The amount of TH protein showed no significant  difference in the treated group. Our study establishes a new model to study  Parkinson-associated symptoms in zebrafish that have been chronically treated  with Pq.

AB  - Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are frequently used as experimental animals in ecotoxicological studies, in which they are experimentally exposed to defined  concentrations of test substances, such as heavy metals, pesticides, or  pharmaceuticals. Following exposure to a broad variety of aquatic pollutants,  early morphologically detectable toxic effects often manifest in alterations of  the gills. Suitable methods for an accurate and unbiased quantitative  characterization of the type and the extent of morphological gill alterations are  therefore essential prerequisites for recognition, objective evaluation and  comparison of the severity of gill lesions. The aim of the present guidelines is  to provide practicable, standardized and detailed protocols for the application  of unbiased quantitative stereological analyses of relevant morphological  parameters of the gills of rainbow trout. These gill parameters inter alia  include the total volume of the primary and secondary gill lamellae, the surface  area of the secondary gill lamellae epithelium (i.e., the respiratory surface)  and the thickness of the diffusion barrier. The featured protocols are adapted to  fish of frequently used body size classes (300-2000 g). They include  well-established, conventional sampling methods, probes and test systems for  unbiased quantitative stereological analyses of light- and electron microscopic  2-D gill sections, as well as the application of modern 3-D light sheet  fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) of optically cleared gill samples as an  innovative, fast and efficient quantitative morphological analysis approach. The  methods shown here provide a basis for standardized and representative  state-of-the-art quantitative morphological analyses of trout gills, ensuring the  unbiasedness and reproducibility, as well as the intra- and inter-study  comparability of analyses results. Their broad implementation will therefore  significantly contribute to the reliable identification of no observed effect  concentration (NOEC) limits in ecotoxicological studies and, moreover, to limit  the number of experimental animals by reduction of unnecessary repetition of  experiments.

AB  - Methionine presents a pivotal role in the regulation of many cellular events with crucial impact on the immune system, such as in processes involved in the control  of inflammation and polyamines synthesis. Accordingly, the present study aimed to  assess the modulatory effects of dietary methionine on the European seabass  (Dicentrarchus labrax) immune status, inflammatory response and disease  resistance to Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp). For this purpose,  fish were randomly distributed in three independent groups (three replicates per  group) and each was fed the corresponding diet: a control diet (CTRL) formulated  to meet the established amino acid requirements for the species; a diet  supplemented with methionine at 0.5% of feed weight relative to the CTRL diet  (8.2% of methionine concentration above CTRL); and one supplemented with  methionine at 1% of feed weight to the CTRL diet (11.8% of methionine  concentration above CTRL). To evaluate the immune status of fish fed with each of  the diets before being submitted to bacterial infection fish were sampled from  each group at 2 and 4 weeks after the beginning of feeding. Non-sampled fish were  injected intraperitoneally with Phdp (5 × 10(3) cfu/fish) at 4 weeks after  initiation of feeding and the inflammatory response (at 4, 24, and 48 h  post-infection) and survival (lasting 21 days post-infection) evaluated. Fish  hematological profile, peripheral cell dynamics, plasma humoral immune  parameters, leucocyte migration to the inflammatory focus and head-kidney gene  expression were evaluated. Results show that methionine dietary supplementation  improves seabass cellular immune status without evidence of activation of  pro-inflammatory mechanisms. Additionally, the observed enhanced immune status  provided by methionine supplementation translated into an improved immune  response to infection, as higher cellular differentiation/proliferation and  recruitment to the inflammatory focus, improved plasma humoral immune parameters  and modulation of key immune-related genes was observed. Lastly, after a  bacterial challenge, higher survival was observed in fish fed supplemented diets,  ultimately corroborating the positive effect of methionine administration for 4  weeks in the cellular immune status.

TI  - The effects of environmental pollutants on complex fish behaviour: integrating behavioural and physiological indicators of toxicity.
AU  - Scott, Graham R.
AU  - Sloman, Katherine A.
T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Environmental pollutants such as metals, pesticides, and other organics pose serious risks to many aquatic organisms. Accordingly, a great deal of previous  research has characterized physiological mechanisms of toxicity in animals  exposed to contaminants. In contrast, effects of contaminants on fish behaviour  are less frequently studied. Because behaviour links physiological function with  ecological processes, behavioural indicators of toxicity appear ideal for  assessing the effects of aquatic pollutants on fish populations. Here we consider  the many toxicants that disrupt complex fish behaviours, such as predator  avoidance, reproductive, and social behaviours. Toxicant exposure often  completely eliminates the performance of behaviours that are essential to fitness  and survival in natural ecosystems, frequently after exposures of lesser  magnitude than those causing significant mortality. Unfortunately, the  behavioural toxicity of many xenobiotics is still unknown, warranting their  future study. Physiological effects of toxicants in the literature include  disruption of sensory, hormonal, neurological, and metabolic systems, which are  likely to have profound implications for many fish behaviours. However, little  toxicological research has sought to integrate the behavioural effects of  toxicants with physiological processes. Those studies that take this  multidisciplinary approach add important insight into possible mechanisms of  behavioural alteration. The most commonly observed links with behavioural  disruption include cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition, altered brain  neurotransmitter levels, sensory deprivation, and impaired gonadal or thyroid  hormone levels. Even less frequently studied are the implications of interrelated  changes in behaviour and physiology caused by aquatic pollutants for fish  populations. We conclude that future integrative, multidisciplinary research is  clearly needed to increase the significance and usefulness of behavioural  indicators for aquatic toxicology, and aim to highlight specific areas for  consideration.

AB  - Infectious diseases are one of the main causes of social and economical losses in world aquaculture. Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) is an important species  for aquaculture in southern Europe, whose production is affected by the  appearance of bacterial diseases such as photobacteriosis, a septicemia caused by  Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp). The aim of this study was to  obtain an oral DNA nanovaccine and to evaluate its efficacy against Phdp in S.  senegalensis juveniles. For this purpose, the amplified product corresponding to  the protein inosine-5'-monophophate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) from Phdp, was cloned  into the expression vector pcDNA™6.2/C-EmGFP-GW obtaining the DNA vaccine named  as pPDPimpdh. The correct transcription and protein expression was verified at  48 h post tansfection in HEK293 cells. Chitosan nanoparticles (CS-TPP NPs) were  prepared by ionotropic gelation and their features were appropriate for use as  oral delivery system. Therefore, pPDPimpdh was protected with chitosan CS-TPP NPs  throughout complex coacervation method giving as a result a DNA nanovaccine  referred as CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs. Sole juveniles were vaccinated orally with  CS-TPP NPs, pPDPimpdh and CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs followed by a challenge with Phdp  at 30 days post vaccination (dpv). The relative percentage survival (RPS) for  pPDPimpdh vaccinated groups was 6.25%, probably due to its degradation in the  digestive tract. RPS value obtained for CS-TPP NPs and CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs was  40% and antibodies were observed in both cases. However, a delay in mortality was  observed in sole juveniles vaccinated orally with CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs. In fact,  an upregulation of tf, mhcII, cd8a and igm in the posterior gut and c3, hamp1, tf  and cd4 in spleen was observed in juveniles vaccinated with CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs.  After challenge, a modulation of cd8a and cd4 expression levels in the posterior  gut and c3, tf, lyg, cd4, igm and igt expression levels in spleen was observed.  Moreover, the concentration of lysozyme in skin mucus significantly increased in  fish vaccinated orally with CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs at 11 dpc. These data indicate  that oral vaccination with CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs could be acting through the  non-specific immune responses as well as the specific humoral and cell mediated  immunity and provide the first step toward a development of an oral DNA  nanovaccine against Phdp in sole.

AB  - Exposure to dieldrin induces neurotoxic effects in the vertebrate CNS and disrupts reproductive processes in teleost fish. Reproductive impairment observed  in fish by dieldrin is likely the result of multiple effects along the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, but the molecular signaling cascades are not  well characterized. To better elucidate the mode of action of dieldrin in the  hypothalamus, this study measured neurotransmitter levels and examined the  transcriptomic response in female largemouth bass (LMB) to an acute treatment of  dieldrin. Male and female LMB were injected with either vehicle or 10 mg  dieldrin/kg and sacrificed after 7 days. There were no significant changes in  dopamine or DOPAC concentrations in the neuroendocrine brain of males and females  after treatment but GABA levels in females were moderately increased 20-30% in  the hypothalamus and cerebellum. In the female hypothalamus, there were 227  transcripts (p<0.001) identified as being differentially regulated by dieldrin.  Functional enrichment analysis revealed transcription, DNA repair,  ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and cell communication, as biological processes  over-represented in the microarray analysis. Pathway analysis identified DNA  damage, inflammation, regeneration, and Alzheimer's disease as major cell  processes and diseases affected by dieldrin. Using multiple bioinformatics  approaches, this study demonstrates that the teleostean hypothalamus is a target  for dieldrin-induced neurotoxicity and provides mechanistic evidence that  dieldrin activates similar cell pathways and biological processes that are also  associated with the etiology of human neurological disorders.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) uses the in vivo fish acute toxicity test to assess potential risk of substances to non-target aquatic  vertebrates. The test is typically conducted on a cold and a warm freshwater  species and a saltwater species for a conventional pesticide registration,  potentially requiring upwards of 200 or more fish. A retrospective data  evaluation was conducted to explore the potential for using fewer fish species to  support conventional pesticide risk assessments. Lethal concentration 50%  (LC(50)) values and experimental details were extracted and curated from 718  studies on fish acute toxicity submitted to USEPA. The LC(50) data were analysed  to determine, when possible, the relative sensitivity of the tested species to  each pesticide. One of the tested freshwater species was most sensitive in 85% of  those cases. The tested cold freshwater species was the most sensitive overall  among cases with established relative sensitivity and was within 3X of the LC(50)  value of the most sensitive species tested in 98% of those cases. The results  support potentially using fewer than three fish species to conduct ecological  risk assessments for the registration of conventional pesticides.

AB  - Organophosphate pesticides as diazinon disrupt the neuroimmune communication, affecting the innate and adaptive immune response of the exposed organisms. Since  the target molecule of diazinon is typically the acetylcholinesterase enzyme  (AChE), the existence of a non-neuronal cholinergic system in leukocytes makes  them susceptible to alterations by diazinon. Therefore, the aim of this work was  to evaluate the activity of AChE, acetylcholine (ACh) concentration, and the  expression of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChR) and muscarinic ACh receptors  (mAChR) in spleen mononuclear cells (SMNC) of Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) exposed  in vitro to diazoxon, a diazinon metabolite. SMNC were exposed in-vitro to 1 nM,  1 μM, and 10 μM diazoxon for 24 h. The enzyme activity of AChE was then evaluated  by spectrophotometry, followed by ACh quantification by ultra-performance liquid  chromatography. Finally, mAChR and nAChR expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR. The  results indicate that AChE levels are significantly inhibited at 1 and 10 μM  diazoxon, while the relative expression of (M3, M4, and M5) mAChR and (β2) nAChR  is reduced significantly as compared against SMNC not exposed to diazoxon.  However, ACh levels show no significant difference with respect to the control  group. The data indicate that diazoxon directly alters elements in the  cholinergic system of SMNC by AChE inhibition or indirectly through the  interaction with AChR, which is likely related to the immunotoxic properties of  diazinon and its metabolites.

AB  - Female juveniles of the Neotropical fish Astyanax altiparanae were exposed for 96 h to four treatments containing the active ingredient from Imidacloprid®  commercial formulation (IMI 1, IMI 2, IMI 3, and IMI 4) and to a control  treatment (only dechlorinated tap water). Glutathione content, glutathione  S-transferase activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation  levels, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and frequency of micronuclei and  erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENA) were measured in the fish. The muscle and  gills were the most affected organs; their antioxidant defense was not enough to  prevent oxidative damage (LPO) in the IMI 2 and IMI 4 treatment fish. IMI also  inhibited AChE activity in the muscle (IMI 3 and IMI 4) and increased ENA  frequency (IMI 4). IMI can affect the health of A. altiparanae in environmentally  relevant concentrations, causing oxidative damage in different organs, neurotoxic  effects in the muscle, and genotoxicity.

AB  - To document the levels and the determinants of dichloro-dyphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) metabolites in maternal milk, we conducted a cohort study of 50 adult  females who lived in Mexico City. We measured social and dietary characteristics  via interview. Levels of DDT metabolites were determined by gas-liquid  chromatography. The mean values (lipid milk basis) were 0.162 ppm p,p'-DDT; 0.138  ppm o,p'-DDT; and 0.594 ppm 2,2(bis)p-chlorophyenyl-1-1-dichloroethylene (DDE).  The main determinants of DDT metabolites were maternal age, lifetime lactation,  history of living in an agricultural area, and consumption of salted meat and  fish. We estimated that 6.0% of the breast-fed babies had daily intakes of DDT  above the level of 0.005 mg/kg d recommended by the World Health  Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (WHO/FAO).  Health-outcomes research among children is needed, and investigators should  design or adjust current surveillance programs.

AB  - As an important organophosphate flame retardant, tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP) is ubiquitous in the environment leading to inevitable human exposure.  However, there is a paucity of information regarding its acute/chronic effects on  obesity, lipid homeostasis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, especially regarding  the underlying molecular mechanisms in humans. Herein, we investigated the  effects of TCPP exposure (5-25 mg/L) on lipid homeostasis in larval and adult  zebrafish (Danio rerio). TCPP exposure caused remarkable lipid-metabolism  dysfunction, which was reflected in obesity and excessive lipid accumulation in  zebrafish liver. Mechanistically, TCPP induced the over-expression of  adipogenesis genes and suppressed the expression of fatty-acid β-oxidation genes.  Consequently, excess lipid synthesis and deficient expenditure triggered  oxidative damage and an inflammation response by disrupting the antioxidant  system and over-expressing proinflammatory cytokine. Based on high-throughput  transcriptome sequencing, we found that TCPP exposure led to enrichment of  several pathways involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation, as well as  several genes related to pathways of cancer. Notably, increasing expressions of  Ki-67 and 53BP1 proteins, which are reliable biomarkers for recognition and risk  prediction of cellular proliferation in cancer cells, were observed in liver  tissues of adult zebrafish. These results imply that chronic TCPP exposure  triggers a potential risk of hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC) progression.  Collectively, these findings offer new insights into our mechanistic  understanding for the health effects of organophosphorus flame retardants on  humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence on the effectiveness of low-cost, sustainable, biological vector-control tools for the Aedes mosquitoes is limited. Therefore, the purpose  of this trial is to estimate the impact of guppy fish (guppies), in combination  with the use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen (Sumilarv® 2MR), and Communication for  Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities to reduce entomological indices in Cambodia.  METHODS/DESIGN: In this cluster randomized controlled, superiority trial, 30  clusters comprising one or more villages each (with approximately 170 households)  will be allocated, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive either (1) three interventions  (guppies, Sumilarv® 2MR, and COMBI activities), (2) two interventions (guppies  and COMBI activities), or (3) control (standard vector control). Households will  be invited to participate, and entomology surveys among 40 randomly selected  households per cluster will be carried out quarterly. The primary outcome will be  the population density of adult female Aedes mosquitoes (i.e., number per house)  trapped using adult resting collections. Secondary outcome measures will include  the House Index, Container Index, Breteau Index, Pupae Per House, Pupae Per  Person, mosquito infection rate, guppy fish coverage, Sumilarv® 2MR coverage, and  percentage of respondents with knowledge about Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue.  In the primary analysis, adult female Aedes density and mosquito infection rates  will be aggregated over follow-up time points to give a single rate per cluster.  This will be analyzed by negative binomial regression, yielding density ratios.  DISCUSSION: This trial is expected to provide robust estimates of the  intervention effect. A rigorous evaluation of these vector-control interventions  is vital to developing an evidence-based dengue control strategy and to help  direct government resources.

AB  - Consumption of seafood brings health benefits but may increase the ingestion of contaminants. Compared with other ethnic groups in the U.S., Asians consume  seafood more frequently. However, there is little information about how  culturally specific fish consumption contributes to exposure to toxicants. In  this work, we surveyed fish consumption among Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese  communities and purchased 103 seafood samples from local markets in Chicago. Each  sample was analyzed for mercury (Hg) and 92 organic chemicals including  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs),  polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and Dechlorane Plus and related compounds  (DPs). The rank order of pollutant concentration in all samples was Hg »  Σ(66)PCBs > Σ(17)OCPs > Σ(8)PBDEs > Σ(8)DPs. Positive correlations were noted  among most contaminant groups. Bluefish, pike, tuna steak, and albacore tuna had  the highest mean Hg (>300 ng/g). The mean Σ(66)PCBs was highest in pike and  bluefish (>100 ng/g) followed by pollock and mackerel (>40 ng/g). Overall,  octopus, shrimp and tilapia were the least contaminated; while pike, bluefish,  and pollock were the most contaminated. Omega-3 fatty acids were more strongly  affiliated with the organic contaminants than mercury. A risk assessment  identified seven types of fish that should have consumption limitations and six  that should not be consumed. For these seafoods, consumption advice based on Hg  levels would adequately protect health, except for mackerel. In the survey  participants, 10.3% of seafood mass consumed is from types of fish that should be  limited to 1 or 2 meals/week, while 1.3% of the seafood mass consumed comes from  types that should not be consumed at all. This work adds additional contaminants  to the profile of health risks resulting from fish consumption among Asian  Americans, which can be used in interventions aimed at conserving consumption of  healthy fish while avoiding contaminants.

AB  - In the present study, to assess the immunotoxicity of cypermethrin (CYP) in fish, Chinese rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) were exposed to environmentally relevant  concentrations (0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 μg/L) of CYP for 28 d and subjected to  pathogen challenge trials for 2 d. After 28 d of CYP exposure, the levels of  Immunoglobulin M (IgM), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and C-reactive protein (CRP)  were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) after treatment with 1.5 μg/L CYP.  Moreover, an induction of inflammatory cytokine transcripts (tnfa, il-6, il-8,  and il-12) was observed (p < 0.05) after treatment with 1.5 μg/L CYP. After  challenge with Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens), plasma lysozyme (LYS)  activity at 24 and 48 hours post-injection (hpi) was significantly decreased in  the 0.5 and 1.5 μg/L CYP treatment groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, liver Complement  component 3 (C3) and CRP contents at 24 hpi were significantly decreased in the  1.5 μg/L CYP treatment group (p < 0.05), whereas significant decreases in liver  C3 and IgM contents were observed at 48 hpi (p < 0.05). Inhibition of expression  of Toll-like receptor-nuclear factor kappa B (TLR-NF-kB) signaling  pathway-related genes was observed in the CYP treatment groups and resulted in  significant down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines (il-1β and il-12) in the  1.5 μg/L CYP treatment group at 48 hpi (p < 0.05). Interestingly, the mortality  in the 0.5 and 1.5 μg/L CYP treatments was significantly increased at 48 hpi  (p < 0.05). These results indicated that environmentally relevant concentrations  of CYP suppressed the Chinese rare minnow immune system and reduced immune  defense against bacterial infection, thereby causing subsequent mortality.  Meanwhile, our results demonstrated that a subsequent host resistance challenge  is an effective method for determining the immunotoxicity of chemicals (e.g.,  CYP).

T2  - Fish physiology and biochemistry
AB  - Previous studies with olfactory-disturbing pesticides resulted after exposure in disturbed behavior and physiology in fish. In the present experiment,  reproductive behavior and milt volumes of precocious brown trout (Salmo trutta  L.) male parr were studied in a large stream aquarium after exposure to the  olfactory-disturbing fungicide 15 μg l(-1) IPBC (iodocarb; 3-iodo-2-propynyl  butyl carbamate) for 96 h. The statistical analyses did not reveal any  significant differences for time attending females between controls and  IPBC-exposed males. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in milt  volumes. However, when taking all fish into consideration, there were significant  differences in milt volumes between parr that had been attending females and  those had not been attending females. Controls that had attended females had  significantly higher milt volumes than controls or IPBC-exposed males that had  not attended females. Taking all control and IPBC parr into consideration, there  was a statistically significant positive correlation between time attended  females and volume of milt and gonadosomatic index (GSI), respectively. In  summary, 15 μg l(-1) IPBC did not have any significant effects on mature male  parr reproductive behavior and milt volumes.

AB  - Chemical exposure during the early life stages of development may have long lasting effects on organisms that are rarely studied. The present work intended  to evaluate the effect of embryonic exposure to the pesticide carbaryl on adult  fish behavior. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed, for 4 days, to  sublethal concentrations of carbaryl (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) plus a control and  then kept in standard cultivation conditions until adulthood. A battery of  behavioral tests was then performed to assess anxiety-like behavior (locomotor  activity, thigmotaxis and novel tank diving test), social behavior, and feeding.  Developmental exposure of zebrafish to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl  produced important behavioral alterations in the adulthood. Main effects included  decreased locomotion/hypoactivity (increase in slow movements and decrease of  medium and rapid movements), especially in the light periods. Moreover, spatial  pattern also changed: while during dark periods control fish increased activity  in the outer zone of the tank, this was not observed in exposed fish. Overall,  this demonstrated the importance of life stage exposure, clearly demonstrating  long lasting effects of a (chemical) stress event at embryonic stages. This data  supports the need of considering this scenario in environmental risk evaluations.  Further work should focus on the mechanistic effects of developmental disruption  responsible for the effects observed.

AB  - This study aims to determine the effect of glyphosate on the transcriptional and enzymatic activity of antioxidant metabolism enzymes of juvenile rainbow trout  with short term (6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h) and long term (21 days) exposures  followed by a recovery treatment. This study also aims to determine the effects  of glyphosate exposure on liver tissue damage and swimming performance due to  short term (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/L) and long term (2.5 and 5 mg/L) exposures.  Following pesticide administration, ten fish, each as a sample, were caught at  6th, 12th, 24th, 48th and 96th -h for the short term, and at 21st day for the  long term exposure study. GPx activity was found to be significantly induced 12 h  after the exposure to 2.5 mg/L of glyphosate as compared with the control group.  A similar degree of induction was also observed for CAT activity but not for SOD.  For long term exposure, except for the GPx activity after exposure to 5 mg/L of  glyphosate, the activities of all other enzymes remained on a par with the  control group. It was also observed that the levels of gene expression of these  enzymes were not comparable with each other. It is assumed that these differences  might result from the effect of glyphosate before translation and the possible  reasons for this scenario are also discussed. The results of swimming performance  are found to be consistent with responses of the antioxidant system, and they are  attributed to the energy metabolism. The data are also supported with liver  histopathology analysis.

AB  - The formulation of Roundup consists of the herbicide glyphosate as the active ingredient with polyethoxylene amine added as a surfactant. The acute toxicity of  Roundup (particularly of glyphosate) to animals is considered to be low according  to the World Health Organization, but the extensive use of Roundup may still  cause environmental problems with negative impact on wildlife, particularly in an  aquatic environment where chemicals may persist for a long time. Therefore, we  studied the effects of Roundup on markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant  defense in goldfish, Carassius auratus. The fish were given 96 h exposure to  Roundup at concentrations of 2.5-20 mg L(-1). Exposure to Roundup did not affect  levels of lipid peroxides (LOOH) in goldfish brain or liver, and in kidney only  the 10 mg L(-1) treatment elevated LOOH by 3.2-fold. Herbicide exposure also had  no effect on the concentrations of protein thiols or low molecular mass thiols in  kidney, but selective suppression of low molecular mass thiols by 26-29% occurred  at some treatment levels in brain and liver. Roundup exposure generally  suppressed the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione  S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  in fish tissues. For example, SOD activities were reduced by 51-68% in brain,  58-67% in liver and 33-53% in kidney of Roundup treated fish. GST activity  decreased by 29-34% in liver. However, catalase activity increased in both liver  and kidney of herbicide-exposed fish. To our knowledge this is the first study to  demonstrate a systematic response by the antioxidant systems of fish to Roundup  exposure.

AU  - Werner, D.
AU  - Pont, A. C.
T2  - Medical and veterinary entomology
AB  - Haematophagous female blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae) are serious biting pests and obligate vectors of vertebrate pathogens, namely filarial Dirofilaria,  Mansonella, Onchocerca and protozoal Leucocytozoon. Immature stages of Simuliidae  inhabit lotic waterways, the sessile larvae filter-feeding and often forming a  large proportion of the benthic biomass, usually aggregated in well-oxygenated  sections of streams, rivers, waterfalls and spillways. Simuliid control practices  depend on larvicidal chemicals, biological products (bacteria, nematodes) and  environmental modification. The potential use of predators for biological control  of Simuliidae has not been exploited. Predators of Simuliidae include examples of  at least 12 families of Diptera and other predaceous arthropods (Crustacea and  insects: Coleoptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera), invertebrates (notably  Turbellaria), as well as browsing fish. Diptera impacting upon simuliid  populations comprise mainly Chironomidae, Empididae and Muscidae, although  several other families (Asilidae, Dolichopodidae, Phoridae, Drosophilidae,  Scathophagidae) play a significant role as predators. Details of predator and  prey species and life stages are presented, by zoogeographical region, including  the prevalence of cannibalism among Simuliidae.

T2  - Waste management (New York, N.Y.)
AB  - The management of organic wastes is an environmental and social priority. Aerobic digestion (AED) or composting and anaerobic digestion (AD) are two organic waste  management practices that produce a value-added final product. Few side-by-side  comparisons of both technologies and their digestate products have been  performed. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of initial  feedstock properties (moisture content and/or C/N ratio) on stabilization rate by  AED and AD and soil amendment characteristics of the final products. Green and  food wastes were considered as they are two of the main contributors to municipal  organic waste. Stabilization rate was assessed by measurement of CH(4) and CO(2)  evolution for AD and AED, respectively. For AD, CH(4) yield showed a second-order  relationship with the C/N content (P < 0.05); the optimal C/N ratio indicated by  the relationship was 25.5. For AED, cumulative CO(2) evolution values were  significantly affected by the C/N ratio and moisture content of the initial  feedstock (P < 0.05). A response surface model showed optimal AED stabilization  for a C/N of 25.6 and moisture of 64.9% (wet basis). AD final products presented  lower soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) but lower humification degree and  aromaticity than the products from AED. This lower stability may lead to further  degradation when amended to soil. The results suggest that composting feedstocks  with higher C/N produces an end-product with higher suitability for soil  amendment. The instability of end products from AD could be leveraged in pest  control techniques that rely on organic matter degradation to produce compounds  with pesticidal properties.

AB  - The effects of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and tributyltin (TBT) association were investigated through a multi-biomarker  approach. Ten Rhamdia quelen fish per group were exposed through intraperitoneal  injections either to BaP (0.3; 3 or 30 mg kg(-1)), DDT or TBT (0.03; 0.3 or 3 mg  kg(-1)) or BaP/DDT, BaP/TBT, DDT/TBT or BaP/DDT/TBT on their lowest doses. The  experiments were divided in acute (one dose, 5-day) and sub-chronic (3 doses,  15-day). Control groups received an equal volume of PBS or canola oil (1 ml  kg(-1)). The three tested contaminants altered AChE activity in brain and muscle  in similar ways; the mixtures antagonized the increase evoked by the contaminants  alone. BaP and TBT increased GSH content and mixtures reduced it. GPx activity  was increased by DDT and TBT in the 15-day experiment and reduced by the  mixtures. BaP increased GST activity in sub-chronic experiment while TBT reduced  it in the acute experiment. BaP/TBT increased GST activity compared to all  groups; the other mixtures reduced it compared to BaP or DDT in the 5-day  experiment. BaP, DDT and TBT increased δ-ALAd activity mainly in acute exposure;  the mixtures also increased δ-ALAd compared to DDT or TBT in 5 and 15-day. BaP,  TBT and BaP/DDT decreased LPO in the acute experiment. In the sub-chronic  experiment DDT/TBT increased LPO when compared to TBT. None of the contaminants  alone altered PCO, but all mixtures increased it compared to one or another  contaminant. Contaminants isolated had a more acute effect in ALT plasma level;  their lowest dose, which had no effect alone, in combination has led to an  increase of this enzyme, especially after 15 days. DDT increased AST in the acute  and sub-chronic experiments, while TBT did the same in the latter. DDT/TBT  decreased AST opposing the effect of the contaminants alone in the 5-day  experiment. Hepatic lesions index could be explained by a more acute effect of  the contaminants alone or combined and by activation of cell defenses after the  sub-chronic exposure. TBT increased melanomacrophages counting in the 5-day  experiment and the mixtures increased it in the 5 and 15-day experiments.  Overall, the majority of the biomarkers pointed to a more toxic effect when these  contaminants were combined, leading to unexpected toxicities compared to  individual exposure scenarios. These findings are relevant considering  environmental exposure conditions, since organisms are often exposed to different  combinations of contaminants.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - In the last decades, increased intakes of contaminants and the habitats' destruction have produced drastic changes in the aquatic ecosystems. The  environmental contaminants can accumulate in aquatic organisms, leading to the  disturbance of the antioxidant/prooxidant balance in fish. In this context, we  evaluated the level of organic, inorganic and microbiological pollutants in four  leisure lakes (Chitila, Floreasca, Tei and Vacaresti) from Bucharest, the largest  city of Romania, in order to compare their effects on hepatopancreas and gills  metabolism and antioxidant defense mechanisms in Carassius gibelio, the most  known and widespread freshwater fish in this country. The lowest level of  oxidative stress was recorded in the case of fish collected from the Vacaresti  lake, a protected wetland area where aquatic organisms live in wild environmental  conditions. In contrast, significant oxidative changes were observed in the  hepatopancreas and gills of fish from the Chitila, Floreasca and Tei lakes, such  as reduced glutathione S-transferase activity and glutathione level, and  increased degree of lipid peroxidation, being correlated with elevated levels of  pesticides (such as 2,4'-methoxychlor) and Escherichia coli load in these organs.  Although different patterns of pollutants' accumulation were observed, no  important interindividual variations in cytosine methylation degree were  determined. In conclusion, the presence and concentrations of metals, pesticides  and antibiotics varied with the analyzed tissue and sampling site, and were  correlated with changes in the cellular redox homeostasis, but without  significantly affecting the epigenetic mechanisms.

AB  - Extensive use of triazophos for the chemical control of pests in agriculture or aquaculture might strongly disturb the aquatic environment due to residue  accumulation through various routes like surface run-off, spray-drift and  effluent from factories, which have potential negative effects to non-target  aquatic organisms. Previous studies have documented the antioxidative effects of  triazophos to mammals, however, the oxidative toxicity of triazophos to fish has  not been adequately studied to date. Thus, an acute exposure (96 h) to triazophos  at different concentrations of 0.06, 0.3 and 1.5 mg/L (corresponding to 1/50th,  1/10th and 1/2th of 96 h-LC(50), respectively), was conducted to investigate the  triazophos-induced oxidative stress in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). The results  showed that the time- and dose-dependent induction of oxidative stress except for  the ROS level in liver after 24 and 48 h exposure, as indicated by increased  reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) level and a compromised  antioxidant defense system, including increased superoxide dismutase (SOD)  activity, catalase (CAT) activity, glutathione (GSH) content as well as the  increased at first and decreased afterwards genes expression (Sod1, Sod2, Cat and  Gpx) in brain. Simultaneously, ROS and MDA showed an increased trend, SOD  activity, CAT activity and GSH content showed a trend of increasing at 24 h and  decreasing at 48 h, and then increasing at 96 h and Sod1, Sod2, Cat and Gpx gene  showed decreasing at first and then increasing in liver tissue. The present study  concluded that the damage of the antioxidant system by triazophos induced  oxidative stress in the brain and liver of zebrafish with concomitant lipid  peroxidation, which is an important mechanism underlying the triazophos-induced  acute toxicity.

AB  - Aquatic systems are subjected to various sources of stress due to global changes, such as increasing temperature and pollution. A major challenge for the next  decade will be to evaluate the combined effects of these multiple stressors on  organisms and ecosystems. For organisms submitted to chemical, biological or  physical stressors, the capacity to set up an efficient adaptive response is a  fundamental prerequisite for their long-term survival and performance. In this  study, goldfish (Carassius auratus) were subjected to individual and combined  pesticide mixtures and increased temperatures to evaluate their adaptive response  in multistress conditions from the molecular to the individual level. Fish were  exposed for 16 days to a mixture of pesticides at environmental relevant  concentrations (S-metolachlor, isoproturon, linuron, atrazine-desethyl,  aclonifen, pendimethalin and tebuconazole) and at two temperatures (22 °C and  32 °C). Three major physiological traits of the stress response were measured:  the hormonal response (i.e. plasma cortisol), the metabolic balance from  molecular to individuals' levels (metabolomics, cellular energy allocation,  energy reserves and global condition indexes), and the cellular defense system  induction (SOD, CAT and GST). Results show that (1) environmentally relevant  concentrations of pesticides lead to significant responses in fish at all  biological levels; (2) the metabolic response depends on the nature of stress  (thermal vs. chemical); and (3) fish may be unable to set up an efficient  adaptive response when chemical and thermal stresses were combined, with adverse  outcomes at the individuals' level.

AB  - Epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) is one of the most destructive diseases of fresh and brackish water farmed and wild fish in the Asia-Pacific region. The in  vitro germination and growth of the propagules of the EUS pathogen, Aphanomyces  invadans (= A. piscicida), were assessed in the presence of the head-kidney  macrophages, serum, and serum heated to inactivate complement proteins, of three  EUS-susceptible and one resistant fish species. The susceptible species were:  striped snakehead (Channa striata), giant gourami (Osphronemus gouramy) and  silver barb [Barbodes (= Puntius) gonionotus], and the resistant species was Nile  tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish of all species were acclimatised to either  low temperature (20 degrees C +/- 1.6) at which EUS is known to occur, or to high  temperature (32 degrees C +/- 5.0) at which EUS does not occur, except for giant  gouramis which were only studied at low temperature. The respiratory burst of the  macrophages was assessed in the presence of A. invadans or the stimulant phorbol  myristate acetate (PMA), and compared to that of controls. Anti-A. invadans  antibody concentrations were assessed in all species except silver barbs. All  assays were carried out at the same temperature, regardless of the temperature  that the fish were kept at. Macrophages of all species other than snakeheads  inhibited fungal germination at both temperatures, though only silver barb and  gourami macrophages could inhibit germling growth. PMA increased the respiratory  burst in nearly all cases. The respiratory burst in the presence of A. invadans  was consistently lower than that of controls, though the difference was only  significant in the case of snakeheads. The respiratory burst of all macrophage  treatments was higher at a low temperature. Except in the case of PMA-stimulated  macrophages, regressions between respiratory burst and inhibitory action were  only found in susceptible species, suggesting that the respiratory burst is  important in those species, but is unable to prevent the proliferation of A.  invadans. Serum inhibited fungal germination in all cases other than low  temperature tilapia, indicating that the EUS resistance of tilapia is not due to  the serum. Inhibition of germling growth by serum only occurred in silver barbs  and gourami. Heated serum did not inhibit germination in any case except that of  high temperature snakehead, and in fact stimulated germination in the case of  tilapia. Heating serum did not affect the growth inhibiting activity of silver  barbs and gouramis, but it stimulated growth in some groups. At high temperatures  snakeheads had high anti-A. invadans antibody concentrations, which may explain  the inhibitory activity of their heated serum. A role for complement and  antibodies in defence against A. invadans in susceptible species is suggested.

AB  - Edwardsiella piscicida is an important causative agent of hemorrhagic septicemia in fish and infects both cultured and wild fish species. Type VI secretion system  (T6SS) was proved to play important roles in pathogenesis of E. piscicida. In  this study, it was demonstrated that the expression of T6SS genes evpB and evpC  was under control of the global regulator H-NS in E. piscicida and the  transcriptional level of evpB and evpC was significantly down-regulated by H-NS.  Compared to the wild type, the transcriptional levels of evpB and evpC were  up-regulated in hns null mutant, while down-regulated in hns overexpression  strain. The results of EMSA and DNase I footprinting revealed that H-NS protein  directly bound to upstream region of evpC at multiple sites. A high-affinity  motif with a 9-nucleotide sequence 5'-ATATAAAAT-3' was defined for H-NS  preferential recognition based on the feature of the binding sites. These results  indicated that H-NS acted cooperatively to form extended nucleoprotein filaments  on target DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis of H-NS further showed that R86 played  an essential role in T6SS gene binding. These findings highlighted the mechanisms  underlying the complex regulation network of T6SS by H-NS in E. piscicida.

AB  - The use of toxic pesticides has become a world problem because they can contaminate streams and rivers, producing an adverse impact on non-target aquatic  biota, including fishes. Cypermethrin is one of the most important insecticides  to control ectoparasites in wide-scale. The aim of this study was to evaluate the  effect of commercial formulations of cypermethrin, SHERPA O (0.0, 0.075, 0.15,  and 0.3 µg/L of cypermethrin) in fish Prochilodus lineatus for 96 h in  semi-static condition, using biomarkers of genotoxicity: micronucleus frequency  (MNF) in erythrocytes and biomarkers of oxidative damage: lipid peroxidation  (TBARS) and antioxidant defenses, catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) in liver  tissue. Our results showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) of CAT at pesticide  concentrations of 0.150 and 0.300 μg/L, but no significant difference was  observed in TBARS or GSH in any exposed group (p > 0.05) in comparison to the  control. A significant increase was observed in the MNF in the group exposed to  0.3 μg/L of cypermethrin compared to negative control (p < 0.05). Finally, P.  lineatus proved to be a sensitive species to the commercial formulations of  cypermethrin and that CAT and MNF are effective indicators of these toxic  effects.

AB  - Animal behaviour is the interaction between environment and an individual organism, which also can be influenced by its neighbours. Variations in  environmental conditions, as those caused by contaminants, may lead to  neurochemical impairments altering the pattern of the behavioural repertoire of  the species. Atrazine (ATZ) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture that is  frequently detected in surface water, affecting non-target species. The zebrafish  is a valuable model organism to assess behavioural and neurochemical effects of  different contaminants since it presents a robust behavioural repertoire and also  all major neurotransmitter systems described for mammalian species. The goal of  this study was to evaluate the effects of subchronic ATZ exposure in defensive  behaviours of zebrafish (shoaling, thigmotaxis, and depth preference) using the  split depth tank. Furthermore, to investigate a putative role of cholinergic  signalling on ATZ-mediated effects, we tested whether this herbicide alters  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain and muscle preparations. Fish were  exposed to ATZ for 14days and the following groups were tested: control (0.2%  acetone) and ATZ (10 and 1000μg/L). The behaviour of four animals in the same  tank was recorded for 6min and biological samples were prepared. Our results  showed that 1000μg/L ATZ significantly increased the inter-fish distance, as well  as the nearest and farthest neighbour distances. This group also presented an  increase in the shoal area with decreased social interaction. No significant  differences were detected for the number of animals in the shallow area, latency  to enter the shallow and time spent in shallow and deep areas of the apparatus,  but the ATZ 1000 group spent significantly more time near the walls. Although ATZ  did not affect muscular AChE, it significantly reduced AChE activity in brain.  Exposure to 10μg/L ATZ did not affect behaviour or AChE activity. These data  suggest that ATZ impairs defensive behaviours of zebrafish, which could be  related to its action on brain cholinergic neurotransmission. Moreover, the use  of the split depth tank could be an alternative strategy to assess group  behaviour and depth preference after exposure to chemical compounds.

AB  - The imidacloprid-based insecticides (IBIs) are among the most used insecticides worldwide, and chronic and acute toxic effects (days exposure protocols) have  been reported in several species in studies of IBIs at lethal concentrations.  However, there is little information on shorter time exposures and  environmentally relevant concentrations. In this study, we investigated the  effect of a 30-min exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of IBI on  the behavior, redox status, and cortisol levels of zebrafish. We showed that the  IBI decreased fish locomotion and social and aggressive behaviors and induced an  anxiolytic-like behavior. Furthermore, IBI increased cortisol levels and protein  carbonylation and decreased nitric oxide levels. These changes were mostly  observed at 0.013 and 0.0013 µg·L(-1) of IBI. In an environmental context, these  behavioral and physiological disbalances, which were immediately triggered by  IBI, can impair the ability of fish to evade predators and, consequently, affect  their survival.

TI  - Integrated pond aquaculture and regional identity: ethnobiology of the golden humped tench of Poirino highlands, Northwest Italy.
AU  - Delpero, Alessandro

T2  - Journal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social-ecological systems are based on particular species and on their direct and human-mediated interactions. The 'golden humped tench' or tinca  gobba dorata, a variety of tench-Tinca tinca (L., 1758)-traditionally bred in  artificial ponds called peschiere in Poirino highlands, northwest Italy, is one  of such species. The aim of the study is to investigate the traditional farming  of the golden humped tench, the associated knowledge, practices, and gastronomy,  and to discuss the changes that the tench, the ponds, and their role in the local  social-ecological system are going through. METHODS: The data analyzed were  collected in different locations of Poirino highlands during May-September 2021.  Fieldwork included semi-structured interviews (n = 23) with current and former  tench farmers about the breeding and gastronomy of the tench and the management  of the peschiere. The interviewees' selection occurred through an exponential  non-discriminative snowball sampling, and interview transcripts were  qualitatively analyzed through inductive thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The  golden humped tench has been farmed for centuries in ponds used also to water  livestock and to irrigate cultivated fields, and managed by every peasant  household in the area. This integrated aquaculture system is underpinned by  detailed knowledge on the peschiera ecosystem and on the tench life cycle and  supports a gastronomic knowledge that is part of the local heritage. The ongoing  process of gastronomic valorization of the tench is sustaining the role of the  fish in locals' livelihoods and as a marker of regional identity, but it is also  transforming tench farming, already threatened by livelihood change, pesticides,  and invasive species, in controversial ways. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that ponds and  tenches are core elements of the local social-ecological system, defining the  cultural landscape and engendering a form of regional identity around them.  Studying integrated aquaculture systems and associated knowledge and practices is  relevant to design sustainable systems of food production and to address  possibilities of conservation of biodiversity and livelihoods in aquatic  environments.

AB  - Among Plant Protection Products (PPP), a new emerging category of pesticides act by stimulating plant defense in order to improve plant resistance against  microbial pathogens. Given that these compounds, the so-called Plant Defense  Stimulators (PDS) act on innate immunity, we tested, using an in vitro approach  on human mononuclear leucocytes (PBMC), the potential toxicity (XTT assay) and  inflammatory effects (production of IL-1β) of 4 PPP belonging to different  chemical families. We found that two products (LBG-01F34® and Regalis®) did not  induce any cytotoxicity or IL-1 β production. The product BION-50 WG®, that  contains Acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) and silica particles did not present any  cytotoxicity but induced a significant increase in the production of the  inflammatory cytokine IL-1 β. Finally, Vacciplant® that contains laminarin, was  highly cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory. It induced a strong production of IL-1 β  when used at a concentration in the culture medium, as low as 0.02 mg/mL. We also  tested the potential toxic effect of these 4 PPP on 4 days old zebra fish larvae.  After 24 h of exposure, our results indicate that Vacciplant® induced zebra fish  larvae mortality at concentration of 20 μg/mL. LBG did not induced significant  mortality at concentrations up to 1 mg/mL whereas Regalis was lethal for 0,3  mg/mL concentrations and BION-50 WG began to induce mortality at 2,5 mg/mL. Our  results indicate possible effects of PDS on IL-1β production in human cells and  fish survival, calling for more studies on the potential noxious side effects of  these compounds.

AB  - Glyphosate (GLY) frequently detected in various water bodies has imposed a serious risk on fish. Head kidney of fish is an important defense organ, playing  a vital part in antagonizing exogenous hazardous matter. The objective of this  study was to characterize toxic mechanisms of GLY in head kidney of common carp  based on transcriptome profiling. After 45-days exposure of GLY at  environmentally relevant concentrations, juvenile common carp were used as  experimental subjects to analyze how the head kidney responded to GLY. The  transcriptome profiling identified 1381 different expressed genes (DEGs) between  the control and exposure groups (5 and 50 mg/L). Functional analysis of DEGs  substantiated over-representative pathways mainly involving cellular stress  responses, cell proliferation and turnover, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and  innate immune processes in both treated groups compared with the control group.  Predicted network of gene regulation indicated that GLY-induced tp53 played a  vital role in linking a battery of signals. Furthermore, the expression of 10  candidate genes by qRT-PCR aligned with transcriptional profiling. In addition,  western blotting analysis confirmed that GLY-induced apoptosis and cellular  proliferation were closely involved in activating MAKP signaling pathway and  lipid metabolism pathway in both treated groups. Collectively, these data  demonstrate that head kidney of juvenile common carp mainly leverages  upregulation of genes related to cell proliferation and turnover, apoptosis, and  lipid metabolism to combat sub-chronic exposure of GLY. This study casts new  understanding into the risk of GLY in aquatic animals.

AB  - The Lymphocyte antigen-6 (Ly-6) superfamily has been considered to play an important role in the innate immunity of mammals. The functions of Ly-6 proteins  are diverse since their low sequence homology. Currently, the function of Ly-6D,  a member of Ly-6 family proteins, is completely unknown in teleost. In the  present study, we identified and characterized a Ly-6D homologue (named PoLy-6D)  from the teleost fish Paralichthys olivaceus and examined its immune function.  PoLy-6D possesses a hydrophobic signal peptide, a LU domain including a conserved  "LXCXXC" motif in N-terminus and a "CCXXXXCN" motif in C-terminus. Under normal  physiological condition, PoLy-6D expression distributes in all the examined  tissues, the highest three tissues are successively spleen, head kidney, and  blood. When infected by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and  viral pathogen, PoLy-6D expression was induced and the patterns vary with  different types of microbial pathogens infection and different immune tissues. In  vitro experiment showed recombinant PoLy-6D (rPoLy-6D) inhibited the lysis of  rabbit red blood cells by serum and selectively improved bacterial survival in  serum. After serum were treated by antibody of rPoLy-6D, bacteriostatic effect of  serum was obviously enhanced. These results indicate the importance of PoLy-6D as  a complement regulator. rPoLy-6D possessed the binding activity to multiple  bacteria but did not exhibit antimicrobial activities. The interaction between  rPoLy-6D and bacteria suggests that PoLy-6D is involved in host clearance of  pathogens probably by serving as a receptor for pathogens. Overexpression of  PoLy-6D in vivo promoted the host defense against invading E. piscicida. These  findings add new insights into the regulation mechanism of the complement system  in teleost and emphasize the importance of Ly-6D products for the control of  pathogen infection.

AB  - In this review, recent developments in monitoring toxicological responses in estuarine animals are analyzed, considering the biomarker responses to different  classes of pollutants. The estuarine environment imposes stressful conditions to  the organisms that inhabit it, and this situation can alter their sensitivity to  many pollutants. The specificity of some biomarkers like metallothionein tissue  concentration is discussed in virtue of its dependence on salinity, which is  highly variable in estuaries. Examples of cholinesterase activity measurements  are also provided and criteria to select sensitive enzymes to detect pesticides  and toxins are discussed. Regarding non-specific biomarkers, toxic responses in  terms of antioxidant defenses and/or oxidative damage are also considered in this  review, focusing on invertebrate species. In addition, the presence of an  antioxidant gradient along the body of the estuarine polychaete Laeonereis acuta  (Nereididae) and its relationship to different strategies, which deal with the  generation of oxidative stress, is reviewed. Also, unusual antioxidant defenses  against environmental pro-oxidants are discussed, including the mucus secreted by  L. acuta. Disruption of osmoregulation by pollutants is of paramount importance  in several estuarine species. In some cases such as in the estuarine crab  Chasmagnathus granulatus, there is a trade off between bioavailability of  toxicants (e.g. metals) and their interaction with key enzymes such as  Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase. Thus, the metal effect on  osmoregulation is also discussed in the present review. Finally, field case  studies with fish species like the croaker Micropogonias furnieri (Scianidae) are  used to illustrate the application of DNA damage and immunosuppressive responses  as potential biomarkers of complex mixture of pollutants.

AB  - In late January 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sponsored a workshop to discuss standardizing the laboratory materials and methods used for  in vivo fish bioassays and toxin induction experiments. Representatives from six  laboratories using these assays to conduct research on Pfiesteria piscicida  Steidinger & Burkholder, similar organisms (i.e., members of the toxic Pfiesteria  complex) or their toxins were invited to attend. The workshop objectives were a)  to discuss the need for uniform quality assurance for fish bioassays and toxin  induction, b) to encourage publishing the relevant materials and methods in the  literature, c) to foster communication among the laboratories conducting this  work, and d) to respond to requests from state health and environmental  protection agencies for guidance in interpreting the results from fish bioassays  conducted in different laboratories. To facilitate discussion at the workshop,  researchers conducting Pfiesteria research completed a detailed questionnaire in  advance about fish bioassays and toxin production assays. Workshop participants  discussed experimental factors that might influence the reproducibility or  interpretation of fish bioassays and toxin-induction experiments. The  experimental factors were categorized into physical, chemical, and biological  parameters. In addition, participants ranked experimental factors by their  relative importance in conducting these assays as a) factors that are critically  important and should be maintained within a recommended range, b) factors that  are important in conducting the assays but that may be variable among  laboratories or within experiments and whose values should be recorded and  reported by investigators, and c) factors of unknown importance that should be  considered important research questions. This article summarizes results obtained  from the questionnaire and workshop discussions.

AB  - Fungal metabolites are considered to be most efficient tools to overcome the issues related to insecticide resistance and environmental pollution. The present  study focus on the evaluation of the mosquito larvicidal efficacy of metabolites  of seven indigenous fungal isolates (Penicillium sp. Aspergillus niger, A.  flavus, A. parasiticus, Rhizopus sp. Mucor sp. and Aspergillus sp.) on the larvae  of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus under the laboratory condition. The  preliminary screening of the isolate, Penicillium sp. showed better larvicidal  effect when compared to other fungi. The fungus was grown on Potato Dextrose  Broth (PDB) in the laboratory (at 25°C) and maintained in the relative humidity  (at 76 ± 4% for 15 days). Larvicidal potency of mycelial ethyl acetate extract  (MEAE) of Penicillium sp. was performed against 1st to 4th instars larvae of Ae.  aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus using four different concentrations (100, 200,  300, and 500 μg/ml) that showed better larval mortality values (μg/ml) of LC(50)  = 6.554, 5.487, 6.874, 6.892, and the LC(90) = 11.486, 10.366, 12.879, 13.865 for  Ae. aegypti and LC(50) = 7.000, 13.943, 18.129, 25.212 and the LC(90) = 12.541,  23.761, 30.923, 41.696 for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Exposure of metabolite to larvae  resulted in behavior changes i.e., excitation, up and down with aggressive  movement, anal papillae biting behavior. Further, the larvae treated with  Penicillium sp. metabolite exhibited significant reduction in the levels of  acetylcholinesterase. The 4th instar mosquito larvae treated with the 500 μg/ml  mycelia extract showed severe histological damages. During the antibacterial  analysis of Penicillium sp.- mycelium the maximum growth inhibition zone was  recorded in Shigella dysenteriae (31.2 mm) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (31.1 mm)  followed by others. In addition, to check the toxicity of Penicillium sp. MEAE  against embryos of Zebrafish, a model system, using different concentrations of  metabolites (1.0, 0.5, 0.125 mg/ml, 30, 3.0, and 0.5 μg/ml) and life-stage  parameters were observed at 124 hpf. Furthermore, the Fourier Transformed  Infrared and GCMS spectrum analysis of mycelium reflected several chemical  compounds. The outcome of the study clearly shows that Penicillium sp.  metabolites could serve as an ideal eco-friendly, single-step and inexpensive  source for the control of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae.

AB  - In recent decades, pyrethroid pesticides have been deemed a safer alternative to previously used pesticides. While some evidence supports this assumption in  mammals and birds, exposure to certain pyrethroids can affect concentrations of  hormones vital to reproduction in fish. Thus, we hypothesized that pyrethroid  exposure impacts fish reproductive behavior and the expression of genes  associated with reproduction. We tested our hypothesis by examining effects of  the widely used pyrethroid pesticide, bifenthrin, on the reproductive behaviors  of the broadly distributed livebearing western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis. We  exposed sexually mature female fish to one of five environmentally relevant  concentrations of bifenthrin and conducted behavioral assays to assess  reproductive, social, and space use behaviors before and after exposure. We did  not detect changes in behaviors measured in response to bifenthrin. However,  exposure was associated with increased expression of an estrogen receptor gene  (ER-α) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in brain tissue at bifenthrin  concentrations at concentrations of 5.90 and 24.82 ng/L, and 5.90 and 12.21 ng/L,  respectively. Our study supports the perspective that the use of multiple  endpoints through integrative approaches is essential for understanding the  cumulative impact of pollutants. Integrating physiological, morphological, and  behavioral investigations of nonlethal concentrations of pollutants like  bifenthrin may heighten our potential to predict their impact on individuals,  populations, and communities.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been used extensively in the eastern regions of South Africa for agricultural and malaria control purposes, yet few  data exist on the local environmental and social impacts of these compounds. Such  issues have become of increasing concern in the iSimangaliso World Heritage Site,  where the continued use of OCPs may pose risks to several sensitive and protected  species. This study was designed to examine the bioaccumulation of OCPs in two  common fish species, Oreochromis mossambicus (Mozambique tilapia) and Clarias  gariepinus (African sharptooth catfish) from iSimangaliso Wetland Park. These  species are targeted by local subsistence fishermen and sustain substantial bird  and crocodile populations. Our findings indicate widespread contamination of the  aquatic environment, with ΣOCP fish tissue concentrations in the range of  6907-8740ngg(-1) lw and 2953-5874ngg(-1) lw for C. gariepinus and O. mossambicus,  respectively. HCHs (471-1570ngg(-1) lw), DDTs (645-2399ngg(-1) lw), drin-related  residues (589-1960ngg(-1) lw), chlor-related residues (455-2162ngg(-1) lw) and  endosulfans (457-1495ngg(-1) lw) were detected in all tissue samples.  Concentrations detected in the majority of samples exceeded European Commission  maximum residue limits and a health risk assessment indicated potential dietary  risk associated with exposure to heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide and dieldrin.  This study represents the first investigation into OCP bioaccumulation in fish  species from iSimangaliso Wetland Park. Our findings highlight the need for more  detailed investigations into the bioaccumulation and ecotoxicological effects of  these contaminants in the food web and the associated risks to local ecosystems  and human health. CAPSULE: High levels of OCPs detected in two common fish  species at iSimangaliso Wetland Park highlight potential human health and  ecotoxicological threats to a globally important biodiversity conservation  hotspot.

AB  - The available arable land is unable to fulfill the food production need of rapidly the exponentially growing human population in the world. Pesticides are  one of those different measures taken to meet this demand. As a plant growth  regulator to block gibberellin, paclobutrazol (PBZ) is used excessively  throughout the world to promote early fruit setting, and to increase seed setting  which might be harmful because PBZ is a very stable compound; therefore, it can  bioaccumulate into the food chain of an ecosystem. In the present study, we  discovered unexpected effects of PBZ on zebrafish larvae and adult behaviors by  challenging them with low dose exposure. Zebrafish larvae aged 4 days  post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed for 24 h at 10 µg/L (0.01 ppm) and 100 µg/L  (0.1 ppm) of PBZ, respectively, and adults were incubated at 100 µg/L (0.1 ppm)  and 1000 µg/L (1 ppm) concentrations of PBZ, respectively, for fourteen days.  After incubation, the locomotor activity, burst, and rotation movement for the  larvae; and multiple behavioral tests such as novel tank exploration, mirror  biting, shoaling, predator avoidance, and social interaction for adult zebrafish  were evaluated. Brain tissues of the adult fish were dissected and subjected to  biochemical analyses of the antioxidant response, oxidative stress, superoxide  dismutase (SOD), and neurotransmitter levels. Zebrafish larvae exposed to PBZ  exhibited locomotion hyperactivity with a high burst movement and swimming  pattern. In adult zebrafish, PBZ resulted in anxiolytic exploratory behavior,  while no significant results were found in social interaction, shoal making, and  predator avoidance behaviors. Interestingly, high dose PBZ exposure significantly  compromised the innate aggressive behavior of the adult fish. Biochemical assays  for oxidative stress, antioxidant response, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed  significant reductions in their relative contents. In conclusion, for the first  time, our behavior assays revealed that chronic PBZ exposure induced behavioral  alterations in both larvae and the adult zebrafish. Because PBZ is a widely-used  plant growth regulator, we suggest that it is necessary to conduct more thorough  tests for its biosafety and bioaccumulation.

AU  - Wheeler, James R.

T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - The chronic toxicity of chemicals to fish is routinely assessed by using fish early life stage (ELS) test results. Fish full life cycle (FLC) tests are  generally required only when toxicity, bioaccumulation, and persistence triggers  are met or when there is a suspicion of potential endocrine-disrupting  properties. This regulatory approach is based on a relationship between the  results of fish ELS and FLC studies first established more than 35 yrs ago.  Recently, this relationship has been challenged by some regulatory authorities,  and it has been recommended that more substances should undergo FLC testing. In  addition, a project proposal has been submitted to the Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) to develop a fish partial life cycle (PLC)  test including a reproductive assessment. Both FLC and PLC tests are animal- and  resource-intensive and technically challenging and should therefore be undertaken  only if there is clear evidence that they are necessary for coming to a  regulatory decision. The present study reports on an analysis of a database of  paired fish ELS and FLC endpoints for plant protection product active substances  from European Union draft assessment reports and the US Environmental Protection  Agency Office of Pesticide Programs Pesticide Ecotoxicity Database. Analysis of  this database shows a clear relationship between ELS and FLC responses, with  similar median sensitivity across substances when no-observed-effect  concentrations (NOECs) are compared. There was also no indication that  classification of a substance as a mammalian reproductive toxicant leads to more  sensitive effects in fish FLC tests than in ELS tests. Indeed, the response of  the ELS tests was generally more sensitive than the most sensitive reproduction  NOEC from a FLC test. This analysis indicates that current testing strategies and  guidelines are fit for purpose and that there is no need for fish full or partial  life cycle tests for most plant protection product active substances.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystem health is the main concern to increasing pesticides application to control agricultural pests as it is the ultimate receptor of such materials.  This study evaluated the impact of new metal-insecticide, the  [Mg(hesp)(2)(phen)], referred as MgHP, on fish using physiological, genetic,  biochemical, and morphological biomarkers. The fish, Prochilodus lineatus, was  exposed to 0 (control), 1, 10, 100, 1000 μg L(-1) MgHP, for 24 and 96 h. MgHP was  not lethal but caused genotoxicity, altered hematological variables and, the  activity of antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes and histology of liver,  depending on concentration and time exposure. Hematocrit and erythrocyte number  (RBC) increased without change hemoglobin content resulting in changes in  hematimetric indexes after 24 h; after 96 h, only RBC was changed. Erythrocyte  nuclear abnormalities and crenate cells increased after 24 h but, not after 96 h.  Erythrocytes and hepatocytes indicated instability in DNA integrity however, the  absence of micronuclei suggested DNA damage repairment. After 24 h, the  antioxidant defense system and the phase II biotransformation enzyme was  responsiveness and catalase activity decreased at high MgHP concentrations; the  antioxidant response was triggered after 96 h. Hepatocyte hypertrophy,  intracellular cytoplasmic substances, cytoplasm degeneration, melanomacrophage  and hyperemia increased in fish exposed from 10 μg L(-1) to higher MgHP  concentrations; the organ alteration index increased as MgHP concentration  increased showing dose-dependence. Most of hematological and genotoxic effects  occurred after 24 h exposure evidencing potential recover capability of organism  by activation of the antioxidant defense system and DNA repairment mechanisms.  Nevertheless, the histopathological changes in the liver was maintained over time  at high MgHP concentrations, a concentration usually no environmental relevant.  In conclusion, this data reinforced the importance of continuing research on MgHP  effects in other organisms considering the promising use of such compound to  control the leaf-cutter ants and other insects.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - The visualization of specific activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) directly in the zebrafish embryo (Danio rerio) via live-imaging is a reliable  tool to investigate the presence of dioxin-like substances in environmental  samples. The co-existence of inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450-dependent  monooxygenases (CYP1A) is typical of complex environmental mixtures and requires  modifications of the in vivo EROD assay: For this end, zebrafish embryos were  used to evaluate the EROD-modifying potentials of common single-compound  exposures as well as binary mixtures with the PAH-type Ah-receptor agonist  β-naphthoflavone. For chemical testing, chlorpyrifos and Aroclor 1254 were  selected; β-naphthoflavone served as maximum EROD induction control. Chlorpyrifos  (≤EC(10)) could be documented to be a strong CYP1A inhibitor causing  characteristic edema-related toxicity. Aroclor 1254 resulted in inhibition of  CYP1A catalytic activity in a concentration- and specific time-dependent manner.  Next to a fast CYP1A induction, CYP1A inhibition could also be detected after 3h  short-term exposure of zebrafish embryos to chlorpyrifos. This communication also  describes techniques for the quantification of fluorescence signals via  densitometry as a basis for subsequent statistical assessment. The co-exposure  approach with zebrafish embryos accounts for the nature of potential interaction  between CYP1A inducers and inhibitors and thus pays tribute to the complexity of  environmental mixtures. The co-exposure EROD live-imaging assay thus facilitates  a better understanding of mixture effects and allows a better assessment and  interpretation of (embryo) toxic potentials.

AB  - The increase in pesticide use in response to agricultural demands poses a risk to non-target organisms, including fish. Integrated analysis of biochemical,  histopathological and genetic parameters in fish exposed to Malathion insecticide  provide information on the toxicity mechanisms of this pesticide, which is  classified as a probable carcinogen for humans. The present study assessed the  biological responses of Colossoma macropomum after exposure to Malathion. We  started determining the lethal concentration, which is the concentration capable  of killing 50% of the subjects in an acute toxicity test (LC(50)-96 h), which was  15.77 ± 3.30 mgL(-1). The fish were, then, exposed to Malathion during 96 h at a  sublethal concentration, 7.30 mgL(-1). Overall, we observed an increased activity  of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes, which reduced production of  mitochondrial reactive oxygen species after 96 h exposure, as well as kept  constant the mitochondrial respiration, Acetylcholinesterase activity and DNA  damage. However, fish exposed to insecticide presented severe gill  histopathological damage and increased expression of proto-oncogene ras. Taken  together, the results suggest that, after four days of exposure to the Malathion,  C. macropomum efficiently activates its defense mechanisms, suggesting that the  basal response mechanisms are responsive. On the other hand, histopathologic  damages evidenced the adverse effects of Malathion on fish, since it promoted  gill necrosis and increased the expression of ras oncogene that is directly  related to tumorigenesis events.

AB  - In the present study, we aimed at characterizing the effect of prochloraz, an imidazole fungicide, on the oocyte meiotic maturation process in a freshwater  teleost species, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Full-grown  post-vitellogenic ovarian follicles were incubated in vitro with prochloraz,  Luteinizing Hormone (LH), or a combination of prochloraz and LH. The occurrence  of oocyte maturation was assessed by monitoring germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD)  after 62-h in vitro incubation. Experiments were repeated in presence of  actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or trilostane. The effect of prochloraz on the  production of 17,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20βP), the natural  maturation-inducing steroid, was quantified by radioimmunoassay. In addition, the  effect of prochloraz on ovarian expression of 12 genes was monitored by real-time  PCR. Prochloraz (10(-5)M) administered alone was able to induce 100% GVBD in the  most responsive females. The occurrence of GVBD observed after prochloraz  stimulation of follicles originating from various females was similar and highly  correlated with the occurrence of GVBD observed after stimulation with low LH  concentration. In addition, oocyte maturation induced by LH or prochloraz was  totally inhibited by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and trilostane. Similarly to  LH, prochloraz was able to trigger 17,20βP production by the ovarian follicle.  Finally, prochloraz induced the overexpression of genes participating in 17,20βP  production, intercellular communication, and paracrine control of preovulatory  follicular differentiation such as igf, igf2, connexin 43, and 20β hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase (hsbd20). Together, our results demonstrate that prochloraz  administered alone is able to trigger oocyte maturation through the induction of  specific genes, some of them being also triggered by LH. Finally, our results  clearly indicate that the effects of prochloraz and LH on oocyte maturation are  synergistic.

AB  - Thioredoxins (Trxs) play an important role in defending against oxidative stress and keeping disulfide bonding correct to maintain protein function. Edwardsiella  piscicida, a severe fish pathogen, has been shown to encode several thioredoxins  including TrxA, TrxC, and TrxH, but their biological roles remain unknown. In  this study, we characterized TrxH of E. piscicida (named TrxH(Ep)) and examined  its expression and function. TrxH(Ep) is composed of 125 residues and possesses  typical thioredoxin H motifs. Expression of trxH(Ep) was upregulated under  conditions of oxidative stress, iron starvation, low pH, and during infection of  host cells. trxH(Ep) expression was also regulated by ferric uptake regulator  (Fur), an important global regulatory of E. piscicida. Compared to the wild type  TX01, a markerless trxH(Ep) in-frame mutant strain TX01∆trxH exhibited markedly  compromised tolerance of the pathogen to hydrogen peroxide, acid stress, and iron  deficiency. Deletion of trxH(Ep) significantly retarded bacterial biofilm growth  and decreased resistance against serum killing. Pathogenicity analysis shows that  the inactivation of trxH(Ep) significantly impaired the ability of E. piscicida  to invade host cells, reproduce in macrophages, and infect host tissues.  Introduction of a trans-expressed trxH gene restored the lost virulence of  TX01∆trxH. There is likely to be a complex relationship of functional  complementation or expression regulation between TrxH and another two  thioredoxins, TrxA and TrxC, of E. piscicida. This is the first functional report  of TrxH in fish pathogens, and the findings suggest that TrxH(Ep) is essential  for coping with adverse circumstances and contributes to host infection of E.  piscicida.

AB  - The influence of deltamethrin on the innate immunity in rainbow trout was examined. Fish were immersed in deltamethrin at doses of 1, 2, and 4 microg/L for  30 min. The results showed that deltamethrin at doses of 2 and 4 microg/L  decreased phagocytic activity of spleen macrophages and proliferative response of  pronephros lymphocytes at days 1, 2, and 5 after immersion. Deltamethrin at these  doses decreased the lysozyme activity, total protein, and immunoglobulin levels  in serum. The greatest immunosuppressive influence of deltamethrin at dose 4  microg/L was observed at the end of the study.

AB  - In order to assess the quality of streams susceptible to contamination by pesticides we apply biochemical and genotoxic biomarkers in the Neotropical fish  Prochilodus lineatus submitted to in situ tests. Fish were caged, for 96 h, in  two streams located in areas with intensive use of pesticides, the Apertados (AP)  and the Jacutinga (JC), and in a small stream (Godoy stream — GD) found inside a  forest fragment adjacent to a State Park. Biochemical parameters, such as  biotransformation enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and  glutathione-S-transferase (GST), non-protein thiols (NPSH), lipoperoxidation  (LPO), protein carbonylation (PCO) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were evaluated  in various fish organs, as well as genotoxic biomarkers (damage to DNA and  occurrence of micronuclei and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities). Samples of  water and sediment were collected for analysis of metals (Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, Mn, Cd  and Zn), organochloride pesticides, and triazine and glyphosate herbicides. We  observed an increase in liver GST activity in fish at AP and gill GST activity in  fish at JC. An increase in liver LPO was also observed in fish exposed to AP and  JC. The same animals also exhibited increased DNA damage and erythrocyte nuclear  abnormalities (ENAs) compared to the fish kept in GD. A number of compounds  showed concentrations higher than the permitted levels, in particular,  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), its metabolites  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD),  hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH), heptachloride, diclofluanid and aldrins. These  pesticides were detected at higher concentrations in water and sediment samples  from AP, followed by JC and GD. The Integrated Biomarker Response Index (IBR)  indicated that AP and JC (AP: 21.7 > JC: 18.5 > GD: 12.6) have the worst  environmental quality. Integrated biomarker analysis revealed that the  alterations observed related well with the levels of environmental contaminants,  demonstrating the effectiveness of this biomonitoring approach.

AB  - Pyrethroids, such as deltamethrin, are toxic substances that lead to generation of reactive oxygen species, which harm living organisms. We assessed the level  and patterns of imbalance evolved by a single dose of 2 microg/L deltamethrin on  the lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the antioxidant defense system of Carassius  auratus gibelio liver and intestine, and monitored the recovery dynamics of these  parameters during a 14-day post-exposure period. LPO and antioxidative defense  mechanisms displayed different responses in the investigated tissues. Sudden  increase of LPO in the liver, persisting at this elevated level throughout the  test period, was observed on the third day post-exposure, while in the intestine  significant enhancement of this parameter was recorded from the seventh day.  Reduced glutathione (GSH) showed a transient increase in the liver, and was  depleted in the intestine by the second day of exposure, with signs of recovery  by the end of the experimental tenure. In the liver of fish a temporary  inhibition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, and  activation of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione transferase (GST), and  glutathione reductase (GR) enzymes was observed, with maximum thresholds recorded  on the third and second days, respectively. In the intestine a relevant increase  in CAT and GST activity up to the second day and almost complete recovery by the  end of the experiment was recorded, while for GR a continuous enhancement was  apparent.

AB  - The current research aims to determine alterations in gene expression and enzymatic activity of fish antioxidant metabolism in response to pesticide  administration. To this end, three different deltamethrin concentrations (0.25,  1, 2.5mug/L) were administrated to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at  different time intervals (6, 12, 24, 48 and 72h) in order to observe the  influences of the pesticide on the activity of glutathione reductase, glucose  6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-ghosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and the expression  of Hsp70 gene. We observed that the activities of the enzymes decreased with  increasing deltamethrin concentrations and exposure time. The pesticide had more  inhibitory effects on gill enzymes than those of muscle, liver and kidney. In  addition, we detected that deltamethrin increased the expression of the  stress-related protein Hsp70 with significant fold-chance values. The efficiency  rate was 96.4% which is equal to 1.96 calculated via conversion formula used to  calculate fold-chance value. We conclude that deltamethrin causes oxidative  stress in fish both at protein and mRNA levels.

AB  - Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) is an essential growth factor to control the proliferation, differentiation and survival of the macrophage lineage  in vertebrates. Sequences of MCSF have been identified in multiple teleost  species, however, the functional investigations of MCSF were documented in only a  few species. In this study, we examined the biological activity and the  immunomodulatory property of a MCSF homologue, PoMCSF, from Japanese flounder  (Paralichthys olivaceus). Structural analysis showed that PoMCSF possesses  conserved structural characteristics of MCSF proteins, including a signal  peptide, a CSF-1 domain, and a transmembrane region closed to the C-terminal.  Under normal physiological condition, PoMCSF expression distributes in all the  examined tissues, the highest three tissues are blood, muscle, and head kidney.  When infected by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and viral  pathogen, the PoMCSF expression patterns vary with different types of microbial  pathogens infection and different immune tissues. In vitro experiment showed  recombinant PoMCSF promoted the activity of macrophage. In vivo experiment  indicated that PoMCSF overexpression boosted the defensive ability of flounder  against Edwardsiella piscicida, a severe fish pathogen that infects multiple  species of economically important fish, and regulated the expression of multiple  immune-related genes. To explore the relationship between PoMCSF and its receptor  PoMCSFR, anti-PoMCSFR antibody was prepared and PoMCSFR knockdown was conducted.  The neutralization assay showed that when PoMCSFR was neutralized by its  antibody, the role of PoMCSF on host defense against E. piscicida was weakened.  Knockdown of PoMCSFR impaired the phagocytic capacity of macrophages.  Collectively, these findings suggest that PoMCSF plays a crucial role in the  immune defense system of Japanese flounder and the effect of PoMCSF is dependent  on PoMCSFR. This study provides new insights into the biological activity of MCSF  and the relationship between MCSF and MCSFR in teleost.

AB  - Freeze-frame click chemistry is a proven approach for design in situ of high affinity ligands from bioorthogonal, reactive building blocks and macromolecular  template targets. We recently described in situ design of femtomolar reversible  inhibitors of fish and mammalian acetylcholinesterases (EC 3.1.1.7; AChEs) using  several different libraries of acetylene and azide building blocks. Active center  gorge geometries of those AChEs are rather similar and identical triazole  inhibitors were detected in situ when incubating the same building block  libraries in different AChEs. Drosophila melanogaster AChE crystal structure and  other insect AChE homology models differ more in their overall 3D structure than  other members of the cholinesterase family. The portion of the gorge proximal to  the catalytic triad and choline binding site has a approximately 50% reduction in  volume, and the gorge entrance at the peripheral anionic site (PAS) is more  constricted than in the fish and mammalian AChEs. In this communication we  describe rationale for using purified recombinant Drosophila AChE as a template  for in situ reaction of tacrine and propidium based libraries of acetylene and  azide building blocks. The structures of resulting triazole inhibitors  synthesized in situ are expected to differ appreciably from the fish and  mammalian AChEs. While the latter AChEs exclusively promote synthesis of  syn-substituted triazoles, the best Drosophila AChE triazole inhibitors were  always anti-substituted. The anti-regioisomer triazoles were by about one order  of magnitude better inhibitors of Drosophila than mammalian and fish AChEs.  Moreover, the preferred site of acetylene+azide reaction in insect AChE and the  resulting triazole ring formation shifts from near the base of the gorge to  closer to its rim due to substantial differences of the gorge geometry in  Drosophila AChE. Thus, in addition to synthesizing high affinity, lead inhibitors  in situ, freeze-frame, click chemistry has capacity to generate species-specific  AChE ligands that conform to the determinants in the gorge.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is a viral and transferable disease caused by severe respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2. It can spread through breathing  droplets in human beings. It caused 5.32 million deaths around the world at the  end of 2021. COVID-19 has caused several positive impacts as well, such as a  reduction in air, water, and noise pollution. However, its negative impacts are  by far critical such as increased death rate, increased release of  microcontaminants (pesticides, biocides, pharmaceuticals, surfactants, polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, and heavy metals), increased  biomedical waste generation due to excessive use of safety equipment and its  disposal, and municipal solid waste generation. Environmental pollution was  significantly reduced due to lockdown during the COVID-19 period. Therefore, the  quality of air and water improved. COVID-19 affected all sections of the  population, particularly the most vulnerable members of society, and thus pushed  more people into poverty. At the world level, it increased risks to food safety  by increasing prices and lowering revenues, forcing households to reduce their  food consumption in terms of quantity and quality. COVID-19 also upset various  exercises e.g., horticulture, fisheries, domesticated animals, and agribusiness  hence prohibiting the development of merchandise for poor-country ranchers. Most  of the patients can self-recover from COVID-19 if they do not have any other  diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart problems. Predictably, the  appropriate execution of the proposed approaches (vaccination, wearing face  masks, social distancing, sustainable industrialization) is helpful for worldwide  environmental sustainability.

AB  - Photobacterium damsela ssp. piscicida (Phdp) isolates were grown in various bacteriological media, in eukaryotic cell culture media and in the presence of  fish cells (resembling some aspects of in vivo growth environments). Bacterial  cells, extracellular products (ECPs) and crude capsular polysaccharide were  isolated and analysed by electrophoresis and Western blot using sea bass sera.  Growth in bacteriological media conserved the synthesis of cell and extracellular  components when these were compared with those prepared under near-in vivo growth  conditions. In fact, synthesis of a larger range of cell components was induced  after growth in bacteriological media. Certain media based on yeast extract and  peptones from various sources and a specific salt formulation induced the  synthesis of novel cell components at approximately 21.3 and 14 kDa. These  antigens were recognized by sea bass sera collected after natural pasteurellosis  outbreaks and other sea bass sera raised against live or inactivated Phdp cells.  The ECPs of the pathogen were not good immunogens in their soluble form despite  various treatments prior to immunization. The results are discussed with respect  to vaccine development.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of synthetic, lipophilic organochlorines that were banned due to their impacts on human and wildlife  health and environmental persistence. Although banned, the continued release from  pre-banned products allows them to persist at toxic levels in the environment.  This is especially the case in lipid rich food webs of the Arctic, where PCBs  accumulate due to both long-range atmospheric transport and locally contaminated  sites such as formerly used defense (FUD) sites. At the request of the leadership  of the Qawalangin Tribe of Unalaska Island in the Aleutian Archipelago, we  analyzed PCB concentrations in samples of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus  aculeatus) and subsistence foods (i.e., salmonid species and blue mussels  [Mytilus edulis]) collected at both FUD and non-FUD sites. PCBs were extracted  from samples using a QuEChERS method. The mean PCB concentrations across all  mussel samples was 6.1 ppb; mussels from FUD sites had nearly double the PCB  concentrations (7.6 ppb) compared to non-military sites (3.9 ppb), and at two FUD  sites the PCB concentrations exceeded safe consumption guidelines. The mean total  PCB concentration for fish was 2.8 ppb; fish PCB concentrations were higher at  FUD sites (3.2 ppb) compared to non-military sites (1.2 ppb). These results  support the need to remediate the FUD sites of "Building 551/T Dock to Airport"  and "Delta Western". More generally, these results provide further evidence of  the continued problem of PCB contamination at FUD sites in the Arctic, many of  which are co-located with indigenous communities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although predictors of contaminants in serum or whole blood are usually examined by chemical groups (e.g., POPs, toxic and/or essential elements;  dietary sources), principal component analysis (PCA) permits consideration of  both individual substances and combined variables. OBJECTIVES: Our study had two  primary objectives: (i) Characterize the sources and predictors of a suite of  eight PCBs, four organochlorine (OC) pesticides, five essential and five toxic  elements in serum and/or whole blood of pregnant women recruited as part of the  Mother-and-Child Contaminant Cohort Study conducted in Northern Norway (The MISA  study); and (ii) determine the influence of personal and social characteristics  on both dietary and contaminant factors. METHODS: Recruitment and sampling  started in May 2007 and continued for the next 31 months until December 2009.  Blood/serum samples were collected during the 2nd trimester (mean: 18.2 weeks,  range 9.0-36.0). A validated questionnaire was administered to obtain personal  information. The samples were analysed by established laboratories employing  verified methods and reference standards. PCA involved Varimax rotation, and  significant predictors (p≤0.05) in linear regression models were included in the  multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: When considering all the  contaminants, three prominent PCA axes stood out with prominent loadings of: all  POPs; arsenic, selenium and mercury; and cadmium and lead. Respectively, in the  multivariate models the following were predictors: maternal age, parity and  consumption of freshwater fish and land-based wild animals; marine fish;  cigarette smoking, dietary PCA axes reflecting consumption of grains and cereals,  and food items involving hunting. PCA of only the POPs separated them into two  axes that, in terms of recently published findings, could be understood to  reflect longitudinal trends and their relative contributions to summed POPs.  CONCLUSIONS: The linear combinations of variables generated by PCA identified  prominent dietary sources of OC groups and of prominent toxic elements and  highlighted the importance of maternal characteristics.

AB  - Pesticides containing diazinon are frequently used in agriculture in the Vietnamese Mekong delta region leading to their potential residual occurrence in  the environment. Under laboratory conditions, exposure to diazinon has been shown  to result in adverse inhibition of cholinesterase enzyme (ChE) activity and  subsequent death in several fish species. This study investigated a 96-h median  lethal concentration (LC50) of diazinon concentrations from 0.08 to 1.25 mg/L on  juvenile giant freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii de Man, 1879) in  tanks in the laboratory. Inhibition of ChE in the flesh and in the eyes of the  tested shrimps after exposed to diazinon concentrations of 2.7, 27, 67.5 μg/L  equivalent to 1%, 10%, 25% LC50-96 h was calculated. The results indicated that  diazinon was highly toxic to giant freshwater prawn with a low LC50-96 h of  270 μg/L. The activity of ChE in the flesh was more sensitive to diazinon than  that in the eyes. Furthermore, in the future, the activity of ChE in the flesh or  in the eyes of shrimps has potential to be used as biomarker for rapid  recognition of diazinon contamination in water.

AB  - Antioxidants like lipoic acid (LA) are known to trigger augmented antioxidant and phase II and III responses. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of LA in  P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, total  antioxidant competence, levels of lipid peroxides (TBARS) and accumulation of the  organochlorine insecticide endosulfan (Endo: α-, β-isomers and sulfate  metabolite) in different organs of the fish Jenynsia multidentata. One hundred  and twenty females (1.55±0.07 g) were fed during 8 days with (n=60) or without  (n=60) a LA enriched ration (6000 mg/kg). Four experimental groups were defined:  -LA/-Endo; +LA/-Endo; -LA/+Endo; and +LA/+Endo. Endo groups were exposed during  24 h to 1.4 μg of insecticide/L. Results showed that only LA induced a  significant increment in liver Pgp expression. GST activity was augmented in  liver after exposure to LA or Endo. TBARS levels were lowered in liver and gills  after LA pre-treatment. Total antioxidant capacity was lowered in liver of Endo  exposed fish, a result that was reversed by LA pre-treatment. It is concluded  that LA induced the expected effects in terms of Pgp expression, GST activity and  reduced TBARS levels although favored α-Endo accumulation in brain. However, the  Endo metabolism to the more persistent endosulfan sulfate was not facilitated by  LA pre-treatment.

AU  - Lončar, Jovica

T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - Zebrafish Mate7 belongs to solute carrier protein superfamily and specifically to subfamily of multidrug and toxin extruders. It is co-orthologous to mammalian  Mates, and is ubiquitously expressed in zebrafish tissues with the highest  expression in kidney. It has been shown to interact with both endogenous (steroid  hormones) and xenobiotic compounds (pharmaceuticals), implying a role in efflux  of toxic compounds. The objective of our study was to analyse interaction of  environmental contaminants with zebrafish Mate7 using a newly developed high  throughput screening (HTS) Mate7 assay. A full-length zebrafish mate7 sequence  was obtained from zebrafish cDNA originating from male kidney, and a stable  expression of Mate7 in genetically engineered HEK293 Flp-In cells was achieved.  Stable Mate7 transfectants were then used for development and optimization of a  new HTS cellular uptake protocol, with DAPI and ASP + as model fluorescent  substrates. The developed assay was used for identifying zebrafish Mate 7  interactors and discerning the type of interaction. A series of 89 diverse  environmental contaminants, including industrial chemicals, pesticides, and  pharmaceuticals, was tested and highly effective Mate7 interactors were  identified in all of the aforementioned groups. Some of the inhibitors identified  could be of environmental concern because they may potentially impair Mate7  efflux function, lowering the fish defence capacity against environmental  contaminants, or interfering with transport of yet unidentified physiological  substrates. In addition, we found significant differences between zebrafish Mate7  and mammalian Mates' substrate preferences, a finding that should be taken into  consideration when using zebrafish as a model organism in toxicokinetic studies.

AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition protein 2 (PGRP2) is a Zn(2+)-dependent peptidase that plays important roles in binding to microbial components of the cell membrane,  inducing phagocytosis and antimicrobial activity. Rock bream (Oplegnathus  fasciatus) PGRP2 (RbPGRP2) was identified in the intestine by next generation  sequencing (NGS) analysis. The open reading frame (ORF) the RbPGRP2 cDNA (470  amino acid residues) contains a peptidoglycan recognition protein domain  (residues 300 to 446). Alignment analysis revealed that RbPGRP2 shares 37.6-53.5%  overall sequence identity with the PGRP2s of other species. Phylogenetic analysis  revealed that RbPGRP2 clustered together with PGRP2s from teleosts. In healthy  rock bream, RbPGRP2 was found to be ubiquitously expressed in all of the examined  tissues, especially in the liver. RbPGRP2 expression was significantly  upregulated in all of the examined tissues of rock bream after infection with  Edwardsiella piscicida, Streptococcus iniae and red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV)  compared with the control. Purified rRbPGRP2 interactions with bacteria and  inhibited the growth of bacteria in the presence of Zn(2+). These results  indicate that RbPGRP2 plays an important role in the innate immune response  against bacterial infection.

T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of cellular defense against oxidative stress and correlated with classical  toxicological endpoints. In vitro methods using fish cell lines for the  assessment of aquatic toxicity are needed for mechanistic studies and as an  alternative to in vivo. We describe an in vitro assay to study oxidative stress  using zebrafish cell lines. Transfection efficiency of twelve commercially  available transfection reagents were tested in the zebrafish cell lines ZFL, ZF4,  and Pac2. The most efficient reagent for each cell line was selected for further  experiments. Cells were transiently transfected with an Nrf2-responsive  luciferase plasmid. The assay was tested using the oxidative stress inducing  chemicals tertbutylhydroquinone, hydrogen peroxide, and sulforaphane. Of the  transfected cell lines, ZF4 and ZFL showed higher sensitivity. The latter were  used to study potential oxidative stress induced by pesticides (diazinon,  deltamethrin, atrazine, metazachlor, terbutylazine, diuron). Besides known  inducers, Nrf2 activity was also significantly induced by diazinon, deltametrin,  diuron, and metazachlor. Activation of Nrf2 by metazachlor is a novel finding.  The described assay could be a valuable tool for research in toxicology to study  the stress response of both pure chemicals and environmental water samples.

AB  - An acute exposure study of mancozeb (MAZ) fungicide was applied on Oreochromis niloticus for 96-h duration. Three hundred fish (20.50 ± 1.60 g) were assigned  into six groups (50 fish/ group; 10 fish/replicate) and exposed to different six  concentrations (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 mg L(-1)) of MAZ for 96-h. The Probit  analysis program was used to compute the 96-h lethal concentration 50 (96-h  LC(50)) of MAZ. During the exposure duration, the fish's behavior, clinical  symptoms, and mortalities were recorded daily. After the exposure period was  ended, the hematological, biochemical, immunological, and oxidant/antioxidant  parameters were evaluated. The results of this study recorded the 96-h LC(50) of  MAZ for O. niloticus to be 11.49 mg L(-1). Acute MAZ exposure badly affected the  fish's behavior in the form of increased the breath gasping and swimming activity  with aggressive mode. The exposed fish showed excessive body hemorrhages and fin  rot. The survival rate of the exposed fish to MAZ was 100, 80, 66, 50, 38, and  30% in 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 mg L(-1) MAZ, respectively. The hematological  indices (red blood cell count, hemoglobin, packed cell volume%, and white blood  cell count) were significantly decreased by increasing the MAZ exposure  concentration (8-20 mg L(-1)). The acetylcholine esterase activity and immune  indices (lysozyme, nitric oxide, immunoglobulin M, complement 3) were decreased  by MAZ exposure (4-20 mg L(-1)). Acute MAZ exposure induced hepato-renal  dysfunction and elevated stress-related parameter (cortisol) by increasing the  MAZ concentration. A significant reduction in the antioxidant parameters (total  antioxidant activity, catalase, and superoxide dismutase) with increasing the  lipid peroxidation marker (malondialdehyde) was noticed by acute MAZ exposure (4  -20 mg L(-1)) in O. niloticus. Based on these outcomes, the MAZ exposure induced  toxicity to the fish evident in changes in fish behavior, neurological activity,  hepato-renal functioning, and immune-antioxidant responses which suggest  physiological disruption.

AB  - Aquatic environments face frequent exposure to organophosphate pesticides, such as diazinon, which are frequently utilized in agriculture. The goal of this study  was to evaluate the effects of diazinon exposure on fish and to investigate the  potential of the HSP inducer (HSPi) in developing a defense mechanism. To achieve  this, several factors were analyzed, including the HSP70 gene expression, levels  of immunity markers (lysozyme, IgM, and C3), antioxidant status, and the activity  of acetylcholine esterase (AChE). Stellate sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus) fry,  was exposed to diazinon (25, 50, and 75% of 96h-LC50) for 6 days after  pre-treatment with an HSP inducer (HSPi), TEX-OE® (a prickly pear cactus  extract), for 4 hours. Two HSPi concentrations, 100 and 200 mg.L-1, were used.  Pre-treatment with HSPi significantly enhanced HSP70 gene expression in the gill  and liver, as well as immune markers in the blood of Acipenser stellatus.  Diazinon-treated groups exhibited higher antioxidant activities of SOD, CAT, and  T-AOC. Increased activity also observed in control fish pre-treated with HSPi.  However, stellate sturgeon receiving both diazinon and HSPi+diazinon experienced  a significant decrease in AChE activity in comparison with control group.  Cortisol levels were elevated in the fish that were subjected to diazinon. Those  subjected to diazinon after receiving HSPi showed a significant decrease in  cortisol levels. In conclusion, the study suggests that HSPi-mediated HSP70  induction may have a protective effect. The presence of an HSP inducer offers a  potential strategy to mitigate the consequences of diazinon exposure in stellate  sturgeon.

AB  - Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) is a Gram-negative fish pathogen with worldwide distribution and broad host specificity that causes heavy economic  losses in aquaculture. Although Phdp was first identified more than 50 years ago,  its pathogenicity mechanisms are not completely understood. In this work, we  report that Phdp secretes large amounts of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) when  cultured in vitro and during in vivo infection. These OMVs were morphologically  characterized and the most abundant vesicle-associated proteins were identified.  We also demonstrate that Phdp OMVs protect Phdp cells from the bactericidal  activity of fish antimicrobial peptides, suggesting that secretion of OMVs is  part of the strategy used by Phdp to evade host defense mechanisms. Importantly,  the vaccination of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) with adjuvant-free crude OMVs  induced the production of anti-Phdp antibodies and resulted in partial protection  against Phdp infection. These findings reveal new aspects of Phdp biology and may  provide a basis for developing new vaccines against this pathogen.

AB  - Quantitative proteins analysis was carried out in the hypothalamus of zebrafish following dietary exposure to the legacy pesticide dieldrin. Data were collected  using iTRAQ labeling methodology and data were acquired using a hybrid quadrupole  Orbitrap (Q Exactive) MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).  There were 3941 proteins identified in the hypothalamus of zebrafish, and these  proteins comprised 23 unique expression patterns for proteins based on the three  doses of dieldrin. There were 226 proteins that were regulated in one or more  doses of dieldrin and 3715 proteins that were not affected. Thus, 5.7% of the  proteins detected responded to the treatment. Many proteins that were  differentially expressed were those found in, or associated with, the  mitochondria. The proteomics data described in this article is associated with a  research article, "Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis implicates the immune  system and mitochondria as molecular targets of dieldrin in the zebrafish (Danio  rerio) central nervous system" (A.M.

AB  - The toxic potential of dithiocarbamates fungicides widely used in world agriculture is well known, among which Mancozeb is one of the most used. This  study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of Mancozeb, determining the LC50% of the  product and the behavioral and histological changes observed in fish of the  Pacamã species through acute and sublethal toxicity tests. The first experiment  was carried out on Pacamã fingerlings exposed to dosages of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and  8mg/L of Mancozeb under the form ManzateWG®, for a total period of 96 hours in  the acute experiment, and in the second experiment, fish were subjected to  concentrations of 1/10 of those used in the acute experiment (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4  and 0.8mg/L, respectively), for 15 days in total. The 50% lethal concentration of  ManzateWG® was calculated at the end of the acute experiment, presenting a value  of 2.29mg/L at 96h for Pacamã fingerlings. A behavioral assessment was carried  out through daily observation of the fish during both experiments, and an  increase in mucus production was observed, as well as atypical social behavior in  those exposed to the toxic agent. Histopathological evaluation was performed on  livers collected after the end of the sublethal experiment, and the main hepatic  alterations observed were cytoplasmic vacuolization, inflammatory infiltrate, and  necrosis. Mancozeb has toxic potential and is capable of generating behavioral  changes, as well as increasing the risk of liver damage in Pacamãs exposed to  this compound.

AB  - Fish consumption is hypothesized to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Nonetheless, consuming sport fish from the Great Lakes increases exposure to  certain persistent organic pollutants, namely polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)  and organochlorine insecticides, which may increase the risk of cancer. Evidence  that exposure to persistent organic pollutants is associated with colorectal  cancer is sparse. We examined colorectal cancer incidence in the New York State  Angler Cohort Study (NYSACS), a prospective cohort of 17,110 anglers and spouses  age 18-40 years at enrollment. In 1991, participants completed a mailed  self-administered questionnaire that ascertained the number of years that fish  from Lake Ontario were consumed, as well as potential confounders. Forty-one  histologically confirmed first primary incident colorectal cancers diagnosed as  of December 31, 2008 were identified via the New York State Cancer Registry.  Vital status was ascertained by linkage with the Social Security Administration  Death File. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated  with Poisson regression, adjusting for age, pack-years of smoking, and sex.  Compared with never consumers, colorectal cancer incidence was statistically  non-significantly lower among consumers of Lake Ontario sport fish (RR=0.66; 95%  CI: 0.35; 1.24). Incidence of colon cancer was lower among Lake Ontario sport  fish consumers (RR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.20; 1.00). We did not observe any evidence of  effect measure modification by sex or age. Although consumption of Lake Ontario  sport fish may have an inverse association with colorectal cancer risk,  inferences are complicated by a small number of cases and a lack of information  regarding potential confounders including other dietary factors. However, our  results do not provide support for the hypothesis that consumption of  contaminated sport fish increases the risk of colorectal cancer.

AB  - Reproductive behaviour of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) from an anadromous stock was studied in a large stream water aquarium. Four adult males and two ovulated  females were placed in the aquarium together with eight mature male parr. Four of  the parr were exposed during the previous 4 days to two concentrations (0.1 or  1.0 microgl(-1)) of the pyrethroid pesticide cypermethrin (a disrupter of  olfactory receptor function) and four of the parr to the solvent ethanol. The  behaviour of all fish was followed for 24h and then blood and milt was collected.  Exposure to the higher concentration of cypermethrin disturbed the reproductive  behaviour of the parr. They displayed fewer courting events, spent less time near  the nesting females and had lower volumes of strippable milt. They also had  significantly lower amounts of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) in the blood plasma  than the control group. The higher cypermethrin group also had significantly  lower levels of all these variables than the lower cypermethrin group, apart from  strippable milt that showed no significant differences between two groups. No  significant differences in non-reproductive behaviours were observed between any  of the groups. In the control fish, there were significant positive correlations  between (a) the number of courting events and the amount of time spent near the  female, (b) blood plasma levels of 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one  (17,20beta-P) and time spent near the female and (c) plasma levels of 17,20beta-P  and the number of courting events. Further, in control fish, higher plasma levels  of 17,20beta-P were observed in parr interacting with a female compared to those  with no female contacts. A priming experiment confirmed a previous study that  cypermethrin damages olfactory reception. Parr exposed to cypermethrin had  significantly lower blood plasma levels of 17,20beta-P and 11-KT than control  males after exposure to ovarian fluid and urine (known to contain reproductive  priming pheromones). When ethanol-exposed males were exposed to ovarian fluid and  urine they had significantly higher plasma levels of 17,20beta-P compared to  those exposed to water only.

AB  - Organochlorine (OC) plasma levels and their dietary and reproductive determinants were investigated in 64 pregnant women from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Prenatal  exposure of newborns was evaluated in a subset of these women in which umbilical  cord blood was analyzed. To assess the influence of dietary factors on OC levels,  a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was completed by participants.  Nondietary determinants were investigated through a general questionnaire that  addressed reproductive history, lifestyle, and social-demographic  characteristics. Both women and their newborns had detectable but low levels of  OCs. The most frequently detected compound was p,p'-DDE, the main metabolite of  p,p'-DDT. This compound was found in 97% of the women who participated in the  study and in 67% of the umbilical cord blood samples, with levels ranging from  0.161 to 8.03ppb and from 0.320 to 1.06ppb, respectively. Among the OCs detected,  only p,p'-DDE showed any correlation with dietary and nondietary factors. There  was a positive correlation between maternal p,p'-DDE and the consumption of fish  (Pearson r=0.38,P=0.002) and chicken (Pearson r=0.26, P=0.042). The correlation  between pork consumption and p,p'-DDE exhibited an inverse relationship (Pearson  r=-0.25,P=0.052). Parity was the only nondietary factor that showed a significant  correlation (Pearson r=-0.36,P=0.004). The main determinants of p,p'-DDE levels  in this group of women were fish consumption and parity, together explaining 28%  of the variance (P<001), in a multivariate model.

AB  - Organic pollutants in aquatic environment could have important implications on pollution stress on aquatic organisms and even on the risk of human exposure.  Thus, revealing their occurrence in aquatic environment is essential for water  quality monitoring and ecological risk purposes. In this study, a comprehensive  two-dimensional gas chromatography connected with time-of-flight mass  spectrometry (GC × GC-TOF-MS) was applied, to enable non-target and target  analysis of pollutants in the Yongding River Basin. Based on the isotopic  patterns, accurate masses and standard substances, certain environmental  contaminants were tentatively identified which including polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbon (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), phenols, amines, etc. The  compounds with the highest concentration were naphthalene (109.0 ng/L),  2,3-benzofuran (51.5 ng/L) and 1,4-dichlorobenzene (35.9 ng/L) in Guishui River.  Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) discharges were a main source of pollutants  in Yongding River Basin, as the types of compounds screened in the downstream  river were relatively similar to those from WWTPs. According to the target  analysis, a number of pollutants were selected due to the acute toxicity and  cumulative discharge from WWTPs and downstream rivers. Three PAHs (naphthalene,  Benzo(b)fluoranthene and pyrene) homologues showed moderate risk to fish and H.  Azteca in Yongding River Basin, while the rest of the measured chemicals showed  low ecological impact across the entire study area based on the risk assessment.  The results are helpful for understanding the necessity of high-throughput  screening analysis for assessing water quality of rivers and the discharge  emissions of pollutants from WWTPs to the river environment.

AB  - Pendimethalin, an herbicide active substance frequently used in terrestrial systems, has detected in European aquatic ecosystems. Reliable indicators still  need to be found in order to properly assess the impact of pesticides in fish.  After an in vivo chronic exposure to pendimethalin, the detoxification process  and the antioxidant defense system were assessed in 120 adult rainbow trout,  Oncorhynchus mykiss. Four nominal exposure conditions were tested: control (C),  500 ng L(-1) (P500), 800 ng L(-1) (P800) and the commercial formulation Prowl(®)  at 500 ng L(-1) (Pw500). Fish samples were made after a 28 day exposure period  (D28) and after a fifteen day recovery period in clean fresh water (D43). At D28,  ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was not activated in liver in spite  of the pendimethalin uptake in fish. At D43, EROD activity in fish exposed to the  commercial product was lower than in control fish, which may be explained by the  high presence of herbicide in fish (613±163 ng g bile(-1)). Furthermore,  antioxidant defense responses were set up by trout in gills and liver following  chronic exposure to 800 ng L(-1) of pendimethalin concentration. While the  glutathione content (GSH) decreased in gills, it increased in liver associated  with higher activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase  (SOD). These disturbances could lead to reactive oxygen species production and  oxidative stress in the vital organs in fish. After fifteen days in clean water,  while the SOD activity was restored, the GSH content and GPx activity were still  significantly disturbed in fish exposed to pendimethalin in comparison with  control. These significant differences between treatments in antioxidant defenses  parameters measured, attesting to the irreversibility of the effects.

AB  - In fish, the first line of defense is represented by the innate immune system and the lysozyme is one of the molecules involved in this mechanism of protection.  Three types of lysozymes have been identified in metazoan, the c-type (chicken or  conventional), the g-type (goose-type) and the i-type (invertebrate type). They  are all involved in the hydrolysation of the bacterial cell wall. Our work has  been focused on the molecular characterization, expression analysis by real-time  PCR, both at basal condition and after in vivo challenges, and 3D structural  studies on the g-type lysozyme from sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.). Moreover,  a recombinant sea bass lysozyme has been produced in Escherichia coli and used to  investigate the activity of the enzyme at different pH and temperatures and to  perform antibacterial assays against typical fish pathogens. The cloned sea bass  cDNA for g-type lysozyme (accession number FN667957) consists of 742 bp and  translates for a putative protein of 188 amino acids. The molecular weight is  20.251, 41Da with a theoretical pI of 8.53, two cysteine residues along the  sequence and no putative signal peptide. These features of the enzyme are in  agreement with the expected characteristics of a proper g-type lysozyme, except  for the cysteine residues that in fish are quite variable in number. An alignment  between known g-type lysozyme sequences evidences that the amino acid residues  thought to be involved in the enzyme catalysis (Glu(71), Asp(84) and Asp(95) in  sea bass) are quite well conserved between mammalian, avian and fish sequences.  The sea bass g-type lysozyme gene is composed of four exons and three introns and  this gene structure is more compact compared to other known fish lysozyme  homologues. Modeling of 3D structure has been performed on the template structure  of g-type lysozyme from Atlantic cod. The catalytic site appears well conserved  when compared with known structures of fish g-type lysozymes (cod and salmon).  The basal expression of lysozyme transcripts is highest in gills, followed by  head kidney and peripheral blood leukocytes. The lysozyme expression is up  regulated in head kidney leukocytes both after challenge with the fish bacterial  pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. The lytic activity, determined  using as substrate Micrococcus lysodeikticus, was optimal at pH 5.5 and at a  temperature of 30°C. In conclusion, these results suggest that the identified  g-type lysozyme should be involved in the innate immune responses of sea bass.

AB  - Vibrio harveyi is the dominant pathogen in mariculture, and biocontrol of this pathogen using antagonistic probiotics is a long-standing biological challenge.  Here, Pseudoalteromonas piscicida WCPW15003 as a probiotic effectively  antagonized dominant pathogenic V. harveyi in a mariculture, with a  growth-of-inhibition ratio of 6.3 h(-1). The antagonistic activities of cells and  intracellular components of WCPW15003 made a greater contribution to the  antagonistic process than did extracellular metabolites and caused the dominance  of WCPW15003 during the antagonistic process in vitro. WCPW15003 was safe for the  pearl gentian grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ Epinephelus lanceolatus)  and, as a consequence of the antagonistic effect on V. harveyi, protected the  fish from an immune response in vivo. A comprehensive combined proteomics and  metabolomics analysis of antagonistic WCPW15003 and pathogenic V. harveyi in a  coculture compared to a monoculture was performed to investigate the antagonistic  molecular mechanisms. The results showed that during the antagonistic process,  WCPW15003 in a coculture had significantly downregulated metabolic pathways for  histidine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism, and  upregulated glycerophospholipid metabolism, leading to a competitive advantage  against the co-occurring species, V. harveyi. This defined a mechanism by which  multi-costimulatory pathways drove P. piscicida WCPW15003 against V. harveyi.  IMPORTANCE V. harveyi as a dominant pathogen has become a major hazard in  mariculture development and seafood safety, and biocontrol of this pathogen using  antagonistic probiotic agents is a long-standing biological challenge. P.  piscicida WCPW15003 has promise as a novel, safe, and effective bioagent for  specifically inhibiting dominant pathogenic V. harveyi and protects mariculture  animals from infection by this pathogen by moderating the host immune response,  which is heavily driven by multi-costimulatory pathways in a coculture of  WCPW15003 and V. harveyi. This work identified a direction for comprehensively  elucidating the molecular mechanism of WCPW15003 antagonism against the dominant  pathogen in mariculture using modern molecular biology techniques and provided  deep insights into the advantages and potential of this antagonistic probiotic  against V. harveyi for the construction of an environmentally friendly,  recirculating mariculture system.

T2  - Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience
AB  - Livestock and aquaculture production is under political and social pressure, especially in the European Union (EU), to decrease pollution and environmental  damage arising due to animal agriculture. The EU has banned the use of  antibiotics and other chemicals, which have been shown to be effective in  promoting growth and reducing environment pollutants because of the risk caused  to humans by chemical residues in food and by antibiotic resistance being passed  on to human pathogens. As a result of this, scientists have intensified efforts  in exploiting plants, plant extracts or natural plant compounds as potential  natural alternatives for enhancing the livestock productivity. This paper  discusses work on the effects of various phytochemicals and plant secondary  metabolites in ruminant and fish species. The focus is on (i) plants such as  Ananas comosus (pine apple), Momordica charantia (bitter gourd) and Azadirachta  indica (neem) containing anthelmintic compounds and for their use for controlling  internal parasites; (ii) plants containing polyphenols and their applications for  protecting proteins from degradation in the rumen, increasing efficiency of  microbial protein synthesis in rumen and decreasing methane emission; for using  as antioxidants, antibacterial and antihelmintic agents; and for changing meat  colour and for increasing n-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid in meat;  (iii) saponin-rich plants such as quillaja, yucca and Sapindus saponaria for  increasing the efficiency of rumen fermentation, decreasing methane emission and  enhancing growth; for producing desired nutritional attributes such as lowering  of cholesterol in monogastric animals; for increasing growth of fish (common carp  and Nile tilapia) and for changing male to female ratio in tilapia; and for use  as molluscicidal agents; (iv) Moringa oleifera leaves as a source of plant growth  factor(s), antioxidants, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and various glucosinolates and  their degraded products for possible use as antibacterial, antioxidant,  anticarcinogenic and antipest agents; (v) Jatropha curcas toxic variety with high  levels of various phytochemicals such as trypsin inhibitor, lectin, phytate and  phorbol esters in seeds limiting the use of seed meal in fish and livestock  diets; and the use of phorbol esters as bio-pesticidal agent; and (vi)  lesser-known legumes such as Entada phaseoloides seeds containing high levels of  trypsin inhibitor and saponins, Sesbania aculeate seeds rich in non-starch  polysaccharides and Mucuna pruriens var. utilis seeds rich in  l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and their potential as fish feed; Cassia fistula  seeds as a source of antioxidants; and the use of Canavalia ensiformis, C.  gladiata and C. virosa seeds containing high levels of trypsin inhinitor, lectins  and canavanine. The paper also presents some challenges and future areas of work  in this field.

AB  - Specimens of medaka (Oryzias latipes) were observed continuously through an automatic image recognition system before and after treatments of an  anti-cholinesterase insecticide, diazinon (0.1 mg/l), for 4 days in semi-natural  conditions (2 days before treatment and 2 days after treatment). The "smooth"  pattern was typically shown as a normal movement behavior, while the "shaking"  pattern was frequently observed after treatments of diazinon. These smooth and  shaking patterns were selected for training with an artificial neural network.  Parameters characterizing the movement tracks, such as speed, degree of backward  movements, stop duration, turning rate, meander, and maximum distance movements  in the y-axis of 1-min duration, were given as input (six nodes) to a multi-layer  perceptron with the back propagation algorithm. Binary information for the smooth  and shaking patterns was separately given as the matching output (one node),  while eight nodes were assigned to a single hidden layer. As new input data were  given to the trained network, it was possible to recognize the smooth and shaking  patterns of the new input data. Average recognition rates of the smooth pattern  decreased significantly while those for the shaking pattern increased to a higher  degree after treatments of diazinon. The trained network was able to reveal the  difference in the shaking pattern in different light phases before treatments of  diazinon. This study demonstrated that artificial neural networks could be useful  for detecting the presence of toxic chemicals in the environment by serving as  in-situ behavioral monitoring tools.

AB  - Organophosphate herbicides are among the most dangerous agrochemicals for the aquatic environment. In this context, Roundup(®), a glyphosate-based herbicide,  has been widely detected in natural water bodies, representing a potential threat  to non-target organisms, namely fish. Thus, the main goal of the present study  was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of Roundup(®) in the teleost fish  Anguilla anguilla, addressing the possible causative involvement of oxidative  stress. Fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of this  herbicide (58 and 116 μgL(-1)) during one or three days. The standard procedure  of the comet assay was applied to gill and liver cells in order to determine  organ-specific genetic damage. Since liver is a central organ in xenobiotic  metabolism, nucleoids of hepatic cells were also incubated with a lesion-specific  repair enzyme (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase - FPG), in order to recognise  oxidised purines. Antioxidants were determined in both organs as indicators of  pro-oxidant state. In general, both organs displayed an increase in DNA damage  for the two Roundup(®) concentrations and exposure times, although liver showed  to be less susceptible to the lower concentration. The enzyme-modified comet  assay showed the occurrence of FPG-sensitive sites in liver only after a 3-day  exposure to the higher Roundup(®) concentration. The antioxidant defences were in  general unresponsive, despite a single increment of catalase activity in gills  (116 μgL(-1), 3-day) and a decrease of superoxide dismutase activity in liver (58  μgL(-1), 3-day). Overall, the mechanisms involved in Roundup(®)-induced DNA  strand-breaks showed to be similar in both organs. Nevertheless, it was  demonstrated that the type of DNA damage varies with the concentration and  exposure duration. Hence, after 1-day exposure, an increase on pro-oxidant state  is not a necessary condition for the induction of DNA-damaging effects of  Roundup(®). By increasing the duration of exposure to three days, ROS-dependent  processes gained preponderance as a mechanism of DNA-damage induction in the  higher concentration.

AB  - Environmental pollutants, found in aquatic ecosystems, have been shown to have an effect on olfactory-mediated behaviors including feeding, mate attraction, and  other important social behaviors. Crayfish are polytrophic, meaning that they  feed on and become prey for all levels of the aquatic food web as well as are  also important for the transfer of energy between benthic and terrestrial food  webs. Because crayfish are a keystone species, it is important to investigate any  factors that may affect their population size. Crayfish are active at night and  rely heavily on their sensory appendages (e.g., antennulues, maxillipeds, and  pereopods) to localize food sources. In this experiment, we investigated the  effects of atrazine (ATR) exposure on the chemosensory responses of male and  female crayfish to food odors. We exposed crayfish to environmentally relevant,  sublethal levels of ATR [80 ppb (µg/L)] for 72 h and then examined the behavioral  responses of both ATR-treated and control crayfish to food odor delivered from  one end of a test arena. We used Noldus Ethovision XT software to measure odor  localization and locomotory behaviors of crayfish in response to food (fish)  odor. We found that control crayfish spent more time in the proximal region of  the test arena and at the odor source compared with ATR-treated crayfish.  Furthermore, there were no differences in the time spent moving and not moving,  total distance travelled in the tank, and walking speed (cm/s) when control and  ATR-treated crayfish were compared. Overall, this indicates that acute ATR  exposure alters chemosensory abilities of crayfish, whereas overall motor  function remains unchanged.

AB  - The flavonoid metal-insecticide [Mg(hesp)(2)(phen)], denominated MgHP, has high potential for controlling agricultural pests. If applied in large scale, it may  reach aquatic ecosystems and be harmful to the biota. This study evaluated the  effects of MgHP in the gills of the Neotropical fish, Prochilodus lineatus by  determining the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT),  glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione s-transferase (GST), and the levels  of glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) after 24 and 96 h exposure to  0, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 μg L(-1). The histopathological changes with emphases to  mitochondria-rich cells (MRC) were evaluated as well. After 24 h exposure the  enzyme activities and the GSH and LPO levels were unchanged however, after 96 h  exposure to high MgHP concentration (1000 μg L(-1)), the GST activity and GSH  levels increased. Oxidative stress measured as LPO levels did not occur after  MgHP exposure in both periods. Gill tissue alterations increased after MgHP  exposure to 10, 100 and 1000 μg L(-1). Cellular atrophy, pillar cells changes,  filament epithelium hyperplasia and hypertrophy, lamellar epithelium hyperplasia  were the most frequent histopathology. MRC in the filament epithelium decreased  after exposure to 24 h and increased after 96 h indicating possible transitory  osmo-ionic disruption. P. lineatus exhibited high tolerance to MgHP. The  increased GST activity and GSH levels after 96 h exposure suggested possible MgHP  accumulation and concentration- and time-dependent response. Histopathology in  the gills of exposed fish occurred at high MgHP concentrations. These results  suggested that the MgHP into water, at high concentrations, affect the gills by  changing GST activity, GSH levels and histology being useful biomarkers for MgHP  water contamination.

AB  - Fipronil, which targets GABAA receptors (GABAARs), is the first phenylpyrazole insecticide widely used in crop protection and public hygiene. However, its high  toxicity on fishes greatly limited its applications. In the present study, a  series of computational methods including homology modeling, docking, and  molecular dynamics simulation studies were integrated to explore the binding  difference of fipronil with GABAARs from fruitfly and zebrafish systems. It was  found that, in the zebrafish system, the H-bond between 6'Thr and fipronil  exerted key effects on the recognition of fipronil, which was absent in the  fruitfly system. On the other hand, in the fruitfly system, strong electrostatic  interaction between 2'Ala and fipronil was favorable to the binding of fipronil  but detrimental to the binding in the zebrafish system. These findings marked the  binding difference of fipronil with different GABAARs, which might be helpful in  designing selective insecticides against pests instead of fishes.

AB  - A diverse range of chemicals are used in agriculture to increase food production on a large scale, and among them is the use of pesticides such as chlorothalonil,  a broad-spectrum fungicide used in the control of foliar fungal diseases. This  study aimed to elucidate the effects of chlorothalonil on biochemical biomarkers  of oxidative stress in tissues of the fish Danio rerio. To achieve this, animals  were exposed for 4 and 7 days, to nominal concentrations of chlorothalonil at 0  μg/L (DMSO, 0.001%), 0.1 μg/L and 10 μg/L, and after the exposure period, the  tissues (gills and liver) were removed for biochemical analysis. Antioxidant  capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and enzyme activities, such as  superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and  glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), were evaluated in both tissues. In addition, the  concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced glutathione (GSH) and  lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were also analysed. A significant increase in ROS  concentration, ACAP levels, GST and GCL activities and a significant reduction of  LPO levels in gills exposed to the highest concentration were observed after 4  days. However, there was a significant reduction of ACAP and CAT activity, as  well as a significant increase of GST activity and LPO levels in gills exposed to  the lower concentration after 7 days. The liver was less affected, presenting a  significant reduction in CAT activity and LPO levels after 4 days. However, a  significant increase in SOD activity and LPO levels occurred after 7 days. These  results indicate that chlorothalonil, after 4 days, caused activation of the  antioxidant defence system in gills of animals exposed to the highest  concentration. However, after 7 days, the lowest concentration of this compound  caused oxidative stress in this same organ. Also, the results show that gills  were more affected than the liver, probably because gills can be involved in  chlorothalonil metabolisation. Therefore, it is possible that the liver could be  exposed to lower chlorothalonil concentrations or less toxic metabolites due to  the metabolism taking place in the gills.

AB  - Apoptosis-inducing protein of 56 kDa (AIP56) is a major virulence factor of Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida, a gram-negative pathogen that infects  warm water fish species worldwide and causes serious economic losses in  aquacultures. AIP56 is a single-chain AB toxin composed by two domains connected  by an unstructured linker peptide flanked by two cysteine residues that form a  disulphide bond. The A domain comprises a zinc-metalloprotease moiety that  cleaves the NF-kB p65, and the B domain is involved in binding and  internalisation of the toxin into susceptible cells. Previous experiments  suggested that disruption of AIP56 disulphide bond partially compromised  toxicity, but conclusive evidences supporting the importance of that bond in  intoxication were lacking. Here, we show that although the disulphide bond of  AIP56 is dispensable for receptor recognition, endocytosis, and membrane  interaction, it needs to be intact for efficient translocation of the toxin into  the cytosol. We also show that the host cell thioredoxin reductase-thioredoxin  system is involved in AIP56 intoxication by reducing the disulphide bond of the  toxin at the cytosol. The present study contributes to a better understanding of  the molecular mechanisms operating during AIP56 intoxication and reveals common  features shared with other AB toxins.

AB  - Edwardsiella piscicida is an important pathogen that infects a wide range of hosts from fish to human. Recent studies demonstrated that E. piscicida can  invade and survive within multiple nonphagocytic cells, but the internalization  mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we used HeLa cells as a nonphagocytic  cell model to investigate the endocytic strategy used by the pathogenic E.  piscicida isolate EIB202. Using a combination of optical and electron microscopy,  we observed obvious membrane ruffles and F-actin rearrangements in HeLa cells  after EIB202 infection. We also revealed that EIB202 internalization  significantly depended on the activity of Na(+)/H(+) exchangers and multiple  intracellular signaling events related to macropinocytosis, suggesting that E.  piscicida utilizes the host macropinocytosis pathway to enter HeLa cells.  Further, using inhibitory drugs and shRNAs to block specific endocytic pathways,  we found that a caveolin-dependent but not clathrin-dependent pathway is involved  in E. piscicida entry and that its entry requires dynamin and membrane  cholesterol. Together, these data suggest that E. piscicida enters nonphagocytic  cells via macropinocytosis and caveolin-dependent endocytosis involving  cholesterol and dynamin, improving the understanding of how E. piscicida  interacts with nonphagocytic cells.IMPORTANCE Bacterial internalization is the  first step in breaking through the host cell defense. Therefore, studying the  mechanism of bacterial internalization improves the understanding of the  pathogenic mechanism of bacteria. In this study, the internalization process on  nonphagocytic cells by Edwardsiella piscicida was evaluated. Our results showed  that E. piscicida can be internalized into nonphagocytic cells via  macropinocytosis and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and that cholesterol and  dynamin are involved in this process. These results reveal a new method for  inhibiting E. piscicida infection, providing a foundation for further studies of  bacterial pathogenicity.

AB  - Cyprodinil, one of the main pyrimidinamine fungicides, has been used to control fungal diseases in plants and vegetables worldwide. Previous studies have  investigated the influences of cyprodinil on the developmental and reproductive  toxicity of fish. However, it remains unknown whether it affects fish behaviors  and the underlying mechanisms. In our current study, zebrafish, an ideal model  animal for behavioral studies, were exposed to cyprodinil from fertilization to  240 days postfertilization at 0.1 μg/L (environmentally relevant concentration)  and 1, 10 μg/L. Firstly, we observed that aggressive behavior of zebrafish was  significantly enhanced after exposure to 0.1-10 μg/L cyprodinil and antipredator  behavior was decreased after exposure. Cyprodinil exposure altered the  adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels, which regulate cortisol  homeostasis and were significantly reduced in all exposure groups (0.1-10 μg/L).  In addition, most of the key genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal gland  axis, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone and melanocortin 2 receptor, were  downregulated significantly in all exposure groups, which was consistent with the  hormone levels. In addition, in the hypothalamus, the number of apoptotic cells  increased in a dose-dependent manner in the cyprodinil exposure groups. Moreover,  these changes were potentially responsible for the increased aggression of  zebrafish during the mirror-like aggressive test and for the reduced antipredator  behavior during the predator avoidance test. Overall, the data provided herein  further our understanding of cyprodinil toxicity and can be used to assess the  ecological effects of cyprodinil on the induction of abnormal behaviors at the  environmental level.

AB  - A wide range of pollutants in the aquatic environment have the capacity to induce toxic effects expressed as cellular oxidative stress. In the current study, the  potential of an in vitro toxicity testing system was therefore investigated using  rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatocytes to assess different endpoints of  oxidative stress. The pro-oxidants CuSO(4) and paraquat were used as models for  comparison to a complex environmental sample. Results following 6, 24, 48 and 96h  exposure to different concentrations of these substances show cellular effects on  intracellular ROS formation, glutathione levels and redox status, expression of  the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase,  glutathione reductase, gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (GCS) and thioredoxin,  as well as cytotoxicity parameters. The most consistent effects (maximum values  within brackets), observed in dose and time parameters for both model compounds  and environmental sample, were the depletion of total glutathione (9.4% of  control), induced levels of oxidized glutathione (695% of control), and gene  expression regulation depicted relative to the control gene beta-actin of GCS  mRNA (239% of control) and catalase (29% of control). In conclusion, the  responses on several antioxidant defence system parameters demonstrated the  validity of the in vitro toxicity testing system. Not only could multiple effects  be detected at sub-lethal exposure concentrations, but these effects also gave  valuable insight to the toxic mechanisms at the molecular level.

AB  - A crucial component for agricultural productivity is pesticide application. Increased usage of pesticides has significantly increased agricultural output,  reduced grain losses in storage, and overall enhanced human wellbeing. Globally,  every year approximately 3 billion kg of pesticides are used which budgets around  40 billion USD. Pesticide use can leave behind unwanted residues that can  contaminate food, the environment, and living tissues. They are known to spread  from agricultural regions that have been treated into the wider environment,  where they affect non-target creatures. All tiers of biological organisms,  directly impacted by this exposure. Pesticides at sub-lethal levels alter every  aspect of a fish's physiology, including histology, haematology, defence  mechanisms, and behaviour. The same topic of pesticide toxicology is the emphasis  of this article, which also addresses some important induced chronic  toxicological effects of pesticides in fish and the extent of their  bioaccumulation in fish tissues. The data represents the largest bodies of water,  such as rivers and lakes, that have been contaminated by pesticides, notably due  to pesticide drift. It has been discussed how readily pesticides are absorbed  into fish bodies and how this enters the food chain inducing harmful impacts on  human health when consumed.

AB  - As endophytes are widely distributed in the plant's internal compartments and despite having enormous potential as a biocontrol agent against postharvest  diseases of fruits, the fruit-endophyte-pathogen interactions have not been  studied detail. Therefore, this review aims to briefly discuss the colonization  patterns of endophytes and pathogens in the host tissue, the diversity and  distribution patterns of endophytes in the carposphere of fruits, and  host-endophyte-pathogen interactions and the molecular mechanism of the  endophytic microbiome in postharvest disease management in fruits. Postharvest  loss management is one of the major concerns of the current century. It is  considered a critical challenge to food security for the rising global  population. However, to manage the postharvest loss, still, a large population  relies on chemical fungicides, which affect food quality and are hazardous to  health and the surrounding environment. However, the scientific community has  searched for alternatives for the last two decades. In this context, endophytic  microorganisms have emerged as an economical, sustainable, and viable option to  manage postharvest pathogens with integral colonization properties and eliciting  a defense response against pathogens. This review extensively summarizes recent  developments in endophytic interactions with harvested fruits and pathogens-the  multiple biocontrol traits of endophytes and colonization and diversity patterns  of endophytes. In addition, the upscale commercial production of endophytes for  postharvest disease treatment is discussed.

AB  - The indiscriminate use of pesticides is a worldwide concern due to the environment contamination since it can cause deleterious effects to non-target  organisms including the fishes. The effects of abamectin, a pesticide from the  avermectin family, were evaluated in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) after exposure  to a commercial formula commonly used in Brazil. The animals were submitted to  acute (96 h) and to a short-term chronic exposure (15 days) of distinct  concentrations of abamectin. LC50 was determined and a histological study  followed by an immunohistochemistry analysis for P-gp and HSP70 identification  were performed on livers of the animals submitted to the acute and chronic  treatment, respectively. Moreover, behavior patterns were observed daily in both  trials. A LC50 value of 105.68 μg/L was determined. The histological analysis  revealed a morphological alteration of the hepatocytes, glycogen accumulation,  degeneration, and disorganization of the cytoplasm, and a pyknotic, irregular,  and laterally located nuclei. The immunohistochemistry for HSP70 and P-gp showed  strong staining in the hepatocytes of the control groups and progressive decrease  as the concentration of abamectin increased. Changes were observed in body  posture, movement around the aquarium, opercular activity, body color and search  for food in the groups treated with abamectin. The results presented suggest that  abamectin can affect the behavioral pattern of the animals, promote morphological  changes, and decrease the expression of HSP70 and P-gp in zebrafish liver.

AB  - Deltamethrin (DLM) is a synthetic pyrethroid used for agricultural purposes to control insects and has been found to pollute the aquatic environment and leads  to serious health problems. Lactobacillus plantaruml-137 (L-137) has gained more  popularity as functional supplement for its immunomodulatory effects and  antioxidant potential. This study was designed to examine the potential of l-137  on liver function, histopathology, immune and antioxidant related gene  expressions in Nile tilapia exposed to subacute DLM for 30 days. Fish (mean  weight of 28.18 ± 1.34 g) was distributed into four groups (triplicates): the  first and second groups fed the control diet, while the third and fourth groups  fed l-137 at 50 mg/kg and the second and fourth groups were exposed to DLM  (15 μg/L) in rearing water (control, DLM, l-137 and DLM + L-137, respectively).  DLM-treated fish groups showed a significant increase in blood biochemical  parameters (creatinine, urea and bilirubin) as well as hepatic enzymes (ALP, AST  and ALT) (P < 0.05). Blood total protein, globulin, albumin, WBCs, RBCs, Hb,  phagocytic index, phagocytic and lysozyme activities were significantly decreased  in fish exposed to DLM (P < 0.05). Additionally, DLM toxicity downregulated the  transcription of immune genes (IL-1β and IL-8), while upregulated the stress  related genes (HSP70 and CASP3). The histopathological images of Nile tilapia  exposed to DLM revealed damage in gills, intestine, spleen and liver which  confirmed the toxic effects. Conversely, l-137 presented protective effects and  restored the aforementioned parameters when fish exposed to DLM and fed l-137.  Further, l-137 restored the antioxidative capacity (CAT and GPx). Thus, l-137  supplementation exhibited defensive effects against DLM toxicity in Nile tilapia  through improving blood biochemical responses, immune, and antioxidant related  gene expressions as well as histopathological effects.

AB  - Cytokines are a family of proteins derived from macrophages, lymphocytes, granulocytes, mast cells and epithelial cells and can be divided into interferons  (IFNs), Interleukins (ILs) and Tumor Necrosis factors (TNFs) among others. The  presence of cytokines in a wide number of fish species has been proved and  several molecules types have been already cloned and sequenced. In this work some  proinflamatory molecules and Mx gene were detected in the liver of vaccinated sea  bream juveniles with an average body weight of 5 g. The method of immunization  was by short bath and three different bacterins against the marine pathogen  Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida were designed and used to immunize fish.  Five genes encoding for five different molecules were analyzed by real time PCR:  IL-1β, IL Ir-2, Cox-2, Mx and TNFα. Gene expression was quantified along four  days after fish immunization and results were compared among groups. Results show  that the heat-inactivated vaccine stimulates the up-regulation of IL-1β, IL Ir-2,  Cox-2 and TNFα genes whereas the UV-light inactivated vaccine was the unique  vaccine which stimulates the expression of Mx gene. The present is a novel study  that shows by the first time the effect of the inactivation process of vaccines  on the expression levels of genes involved in the defense against Photobacterium  damselae subsp piscicida.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate population-related peculiarities of the adaptive responses of Carassius auratus gibelio. In order to do this, male  specimens from polluted (B) and clean (Z) sites were exposed to commercial  pesticides thiocarbamate Tatoo (9.1 μg·L(-1)and 91 μg·L(-1)) or tetrazine Apollo  (2 μg·L(-1) and 10 μg·L(-1)) during fourteen days. The control fish from site B  was distinguished by weakness of antioxidant defence (measured from superoxide  dismutase and catalase activities, redox index of glutathione (GSH), superoxide  anion (O(2)) and lipid peroxidation levels), imbalance of the concentrations of  protein metallothionein (MT-SH) and MT-related metals (MT-Me) and neurotoxicity.  Differences in glutathione-S-transferase activity in the liver and  vitellogenin-like proteins in the serum were also showed between B and Z control  groups. Common effects of pesticides were related to a decrease in GSH, an  increase in O(2) production, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity and  hepatosomatic index. Apollo provoked particular elevation of MT-SH/MT-Me ratio.  Population-related difference in the response was the activation of antioxidant  defence in fish from site B and its inhibition in fish from site Z. The genotoxic  effect of exposures was more expressed in fish from site B. Principal component  analysis combine all exposed groups from site Z and control group from site B in  one set, and separated each exposed group from site B. The main distinguishing  index of each population selected by classification and regression tree analysis  was MT-SH.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the value of the children's version of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test as a screening test in a population exposed to  different mixtures of neurotoxicants. Copy and Immediate Recall scores were  evaluated through the test. Children were recruited from three sites; an area  with natural contamination by fluoride and arsenic (F-As), a mining-metallurgical  area with lead and arsenic contamination (Pb-As) and a malaria zone with the  evidence of fish contaminated with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Children aged 6-11 years old, living in one of  the three polluted sites since birth were recruited (n=166). The exposure was  evaluated as follows: fluoride and arsenic in urine, lead in blood and DDT,  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and PCBs in serum. To evaluate the test  performance, z-scores for Copy and Immediate Recall were calculated. The  proportion of children by residence area with performance lower than expected by  age (below -1 SD) for Copy and Immediate Recall was in the F-As area (88.7% and  59%) and in the DDT-PCBs area (73% and 43.8%), respectively. In the Pb-As area,  the proportion was 62% for both tests. After adjustment, Copy correlated  inversely with fluoride in urine (r=-0.29; p<0.001) and Immediate Recall  correlated inversely with fluoride in urine (r=-0.27; p<0.05), lead in blood  (r=-0.72; p<0.01), arsenic in urine (r=-0.63; p<0.05) and DDE (r=-0.25; p<0.05).  This study provided evidence that children included in this research are living  in high risk areas and were exposed to neurotoxicants. Poor performance in the  test could be explained in some way by F, Pb, As or DDE exposure, however social  factors or the low quality of school education prevalent in the areas could be  playing an important role.

AB  - Over the course of an approximately 11-month period, an outdoor, freshwater, mixed species, recirculating, display system at a public aquarium experienced  intermittent mortalities of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and blue  catfish (I. furcatus). Catfish acutely presented for abnormal buoyancy, coelomic  distention, and protein-rich coelomic effusion. Gross lesions typically involved  massive coelomic distension with protein-rich effusion, generalized edema, and  gastric hemorrhage and edema. Microscopically, primary lesions included renal  tubular necrosis, gastric edema with mucosal hemorrhages, and generalized edema.  Aerobic culture and virus isolation could not recover a consistent infectious  agent. Intracoelomic injection of coelomic effusion and aspirated retrobulbar  fluid from a catfish into naïve zebrafish (bioassay) produced peracute mortality  in 3 of 4 fish and nervous signs in the fourth compared with 2 saline-injected  control zebrafish that had - no mortality or clinical signs. Kidney tissue and  coelomic effusion were submitted for gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  by multiple reaction monitoring against laboratory standards, which detected the  presence of multiple pyrethroid toxins, including bioallethrin, bifenthrin,  trans-permethrin, phenothrin, and deltamethrin. Detection of multiple pyrethroids  presumably reflects multiple exposures with several products. As such, the  contributions of each pyrethroid toward clinical presentation, lesion  development, and disease pathogenesis cannot be determined, but they are  suspected to have collectively resulted in disrupted osmoregulation and fluid  overload due to renal injury. Pesticide-induced toxicoses involving aquarium fish  are rarely reported with this being the first description of pyrethroid-induced  lesions and mortality in public aquarium-held fish.

AB  - Herbicides and their metabolites are often detected in water bodies where they may cause adverse effects to non-target organisms. Their effects at  environmentally relevant concentrations are often unclear, especially concerning  mixtures of pesticides. This study thus investigated the impacts of one of the  most used herbicides: S-metolachlor and its two metabolites, metolachlor oxanilic  acid (MOA) and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (MESA) on the development of  zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to the individual  substances and their environmentally relevant mixture until 120 hpf (hours  post-fertilization). The focus was set on sublethal endpoints such as  malformations, hatching success, length of fish larvae, spontaneous movements,  heart rate and locomotion. Moreover, expression levels of eight genes linked to  the thyroid system disruption, oxidative stress defense, mitochondrial  metabolism, regulation of cell cycle and retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway  were analyzed. Exposure to S-metolachlor (1 μg/L) and the pesticide mixture  (1 μg/L of each substance) significantly reduced spontaneous tail movements of  21 hpf embryos. Few rare developmental malformations were observed, but only in  larvae exposed to more than 100 μg/L of individual substances (craniofacial  deformation, non-inflated gas bladder, yolk sac malabsorption) and to 30 μg/L of  each substance in the pesticide mixture (spine deformation). No effect on  hatching success, length of larvae, heart rate or larvae locomotion were found.  Strong responses were detected at the molecular level including induction of p53  gene regulating the cell cycle (the pesticide mixture - 1 μg/L of each substance;  MESA 30 μg/L; and MOA 100 μg/L), as induction of cyp26a1 gene encoding cytochrome  P450 (pesticide mixture - 1 μg/L of each substance). Genes implicated in the  thyroid system regulation (dio2, thra, thrb) were all overexpressed by the  environmentally relevant concentrations of the pesticide mixture (1 μg/L of each  substance) and MESA metabolite (1 μg/L). Zebrafish thyroid system disruption was  revealed by the overexpressed genes, as well as by some related developmental  malformations (mainly gas bladder and yolk sac abnormalities), and reduced  spontaneous tail movements. Thus, the thyroid system disruption represents a  likely hypothesis behind the effects caused by the low environmental  concentrations of S-metolachlor, its two metabolites and their mixture.

AB  - The increased rice production in the Mekong Delta during the last two decades has improved agricultural income and reduced poverty, but it has also had negative  impacts on the environment and human health. This study shows that integrated  rice-fish farming and integrated pest management strategies provide sustainable  options to intensive rice farming, because of a more balanced use of multiple  ecosystem services that benefit the farmers' health, economy and the environment.  The study investigates and compares farming strategies among 40 rice and 20  rice-fish farmers in two locations in the Mekong Delta. Production costs and  income are used to compare the systems' financial sustainability. The farmers'  perception on how their farming practices influence on ecosystem services and  their livelihoods are used as an indication of the systems' ecological and social  sustainability. Although rice-fish farmers used lower amount of pesticides and  fertilisers than rice farmers, there were no statistical differences in their  rice yields or net income. Rice was seen as the most important ecosystem service  from rice fields and related wetlands, but also several other ecosystem services,  such as water quality, aquatic animals, plants, habitats, and natural enemies to  pests, were seen as important to the farmers' livelihoods and wellbeing. All  farmers perceived that there had been a general reduction in all these other  ecosystem services, due to intensive rice farming during the last 15 years, and  that they will continue to decline. The majority of the farmers were willing to  reduce their rice yields slightly for an improved quality of the other ecosystem  services.

AB  - Cysteamine bitartrate is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for nephropathic cystinosis also postulated to enhance glutathione biosynthesis. We  hypothesized this antioxidant effect may reduce oxidative stress in primary  mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) disease, improving cellular viability and  organismal health. Here, we systematically evaluated the therapeutic potential of  cysteamine bitartrate in RC disease models spanning three evolutionarily distinct  species. These pre-clinical studies demonstrated the narrow therapeutic window of  cysteamine bitartrate, with toxicity at millimolar levels directly correlating  with marked induction of hydrogen peroxide production. Micromolar range  cysteamine bitartrate treatment in Caenorhabditis elegans gas-1(fc21) RC complex  I (NDUFS2-/-) disease invertebrate worms significantly improved mitochondrial  membrane potential and oxidative stress, with corresponding modest improvement in  fecundity but not lifespan. At 10 to 100 μm concentrations, cysteamine bitartrate  improved multiple RC complex disease FBXL4 human fibroblast survival, and  protected both complex I (rotenone) and complex IV (azide) Danio rerio vertebrate  zebrafish disease models from brain death. Mechanistic profiling of cysteamine  bitartrate effects showed it increases aspartate levels and flux, without  increasing total glutathione levels. Transcriptional normalization of broadly  dysregulated intermediary metabolic, glutathione, cell defense, DNA, and immune  pathways was greater in RC disease human cells than in C. elegans, with similar  rescue in both models of downregulated ribosomal and proteasomal pathway  expression. Overall, these data suggest cysteamine bitartrate may hold  therapeutic potential in RC disease, although not through obvious modulation of  total glutathione levels. Careful consideration is required to determine safe and  effective cysteamine bitartrate concentrations to further evaluate in clinical  trials of human subjects with primary mitochondrial RC disease.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acute glyphosate (active ingredient) exposure on the oxidative stress biomarkers and antioxidant defenses  of a hybrid surubim (Pseudoplatystoma sp). The fish were exposed to different  herbicide concentrations for 96 h. The thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances  (TBARS), protein carbonyls and antioxidant responses were verified. The 15 mg  a.pL(-1) of herbicide resulted in the death of 50% of the fish after 96 h. An  increase in liver and muscle TBARS levels was observed when fish were exposed to  the herbicide. The protein carbonyl content was also increased in the liver  (4.5mg a.pL(-1) concentration) and brain (2.25 mg a.pL(-1) concentration). The  antioxidant activities decreased in the liver and brain after exposure to  herbicide. Levels of ascorbic acid in the liver (2.25 mg a.pL(-1) and 4.5 mg  a.pL(-1) concentrations) and brain (2.25 mg a.pL(-1) concentration) were  increased post-treatment. Levels of total thiols were increased in the liver and  brain (2.25 mg L(-1) and 7.5mg a.pL(-1), respectively). Glyphosate exposure, at  the tested concentrations affects surubim health by promoting changes that can  affect their survival in natural environment. Some parameters as TBARS and  protein carbonyl could be early biomarkers for Roundup exposure in this fish  species.

T2  - Toxicology and applied pharmacology
AB  - The role of antioxidants in maintaining the functional integrity of adrenocortical cells during in vitro exposure to endosulfan, an organochlorine  pesticide, was investigated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Aminotriazole  (ATA), an inhibitor of catalase (CAT), L-buthionine sulfoximine (L-BSO), an  inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a  glutathione precursor, were used to investigate the role of CAT and GSH redox  cycle in protection against the adrenal toxicity of endosulfan, a pesticide that  impairs cell viability (LC50 366 microM) and cortisol secretion (EC50 19 microM)  in a concentration-related manner. Pretreatment with ATA and L-BSO enhanced the  toxicity of endosulfan (LC50 and EC50, respectively, 302 and 2.6 microM with ATA,  346 and 3.1 microM with L-BSO), while pretreatment with NAC had no significant  effect on cell viability and increased the EC50 of endosulfan to 51 microM. CAT  activity was significantly reduced following exposure to endosulfan when cells  were pretreated with ATA. Pretreatment with L-BSO significantly decreased  glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in a  concentration-related manner following exposure to endosulfan, while GSH levels  were significantly higher in NAC pretreated cells compared to untreated cells.  Finally, pretreatment with ATA and L-BSO increased, while pretreatment with NAC  decreased, lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) levels. CAT, GPx, and GSH were identified  as important antioxidants in maintaining the function and integrity of rainbow  trout adrenocortical cells and ATA, L-BSO, and NAC were identified as effective  modulators of CAT and GSH redox cycle. Moreover, this study suggests that the  glutathione redox cycle may be more efficient than catalase in protecting  adrenocortical cells against endosulfan-induced oxidative stress.

AB  - Piscibactin (Pcb) is a labile siderophore widespread among Vibrionaceae. Its production is a major virulence factor of some fish pathogens such as  Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida and Vibrio anguillarum. Although FrpA  was previously suggested as the putative outer membrane transporter (OMT) for  ferri-piscibactin, its role in piscibactin uptake was never demonstrated. In this  work, we generated mutants of V. anguillarum defective in FrpA and analyzed their  ability to use piscibactin as iron source. The results showed that inactivation  of frpA completely disables piscibactin utilization, and the original phenotype  could be restored by gene complementation, confirming that FrpA is the OMT that  mediates ferri-Pcb uptake. Additionally, the ability of several Pcb thiazole  analogues, with different configurations at positions 9, 10, and 13, to be  internalized through FrpA, was evaluated measuring their ability to promote  growth under iron deficiency of several indicator strains. The results showed  that while those analogues with a thiazole ring maintain almost the same activity  as Pcb, the maintenance of the hydroxyl group present in natural piscibactin  configuration at position C-13 is crucial for Fe(3+) chelation and, in  consequence, for the recognition of the ferri-siderophore by the cognate OMT. All  these findings allowed us to propose a Pcb analogue as a good candidate to  vectorize antimicrobial compounds, through the Trojan horse strategy, to develop  novel compounds against bacterial fish diseases.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - The search for new methods in the toxicology field has increased the use of early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a versatile organism model. Here, we  use early stages of zebrafish to evaluate glyphosate as pure active ingredient  and within a commercial formulation in terms of oxidative stress. Biomarkers  involved in the oxidative status were evaluated along with other markers of  neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, energy balance and motor performance,  and the selected tools were evaluated by its sensitivity in determining  early-warning events. Zebrafish embryos exposed to glyphosate active ingredient  and glyphosate-based formulation were under oxidative stress, but only the  commercial formulation delayed the embryogenesis, affected the cholinergic  neurotransmission and induced DNA damage. Both altered the motor performance of  larvae at very low concentrations, becoming larvae hypoactive. The energy balance  was also impaired, as embryos under oxidative stress had lower lipids reserves.  Although data suggest that glyphosate-based formulation has higher toxicity than  the active ingredient itself, the most sensitive biomarkers detected  early-warning effects at very low concentrations of the active ingredient.  Biochemical biomarkers of defense system and oxidative damage were the most  sensitive tools, detecting pro-oxidant responses at very low concentrations,  along with markers of motor performance that showed high sensitivity and high  throughput, suitable for detecting early effects linked to neurotoxicity.  Alterations on morphology during embryogenesis showed the lowest sensitivity,  thus morphological alterations appeared after several alterations at biochemical  levels. Tools evaluating DNA damage and cell proliferation showed  mid-sensitivity, but low throughput, thus they could be used as complementary  markers.

T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
AB  - Conventional agriculture has been widely used to overcome food scarcity in Egypt, but in turn created new environmental, social, and economic problems. Aquaponics  has a huge potential as a sustainable solution since it demonstrates promising  results for urban food development while providing new entrepreneurship and  start-up opportunities. Although it presents a big opportunity especially for  developing countries like Egypt, it still requires further studies and researches  to fully overcome foreseen challenges. This study discusses the possibility of  implementing aquaponics as an alternative to conventional agriculture in Egypt  through a comparison between aquaponics and conventional agriculture. The first  section of this investigation analyzes the economic feasibility of aquaponics in  terms of capital and operational expenditure costs. Then, an experimental  comparative study is carried out examining two pilot-scale aquaponics systems  (Deep water Culture system and Integrated Aqua-Vegaculture system), where crop  quality (vitamins, heavy metals, and pesticides residues) of the two systems has  been compared among each other, as well as to that of the commercially available  organic food available in supermarkets. Results indicated that both systems  produce high-quality safe organic food. The economic feasibility analysis  indicated that Integrated Aqua-Vegaculture System is producing more crops with a  wider variety of almost 20% less capital expenditure and operational expenditure  costs. Fish production for both systems was close, yet slightly higher in Deep  Water Culture. Although, on the short term, aquaponics entails relatively high  capital and operational expenditure costs compared with conventional agriculture;  yet, on the long term, it is more profitable, while saving up to 85% of the water  wasted by conventional farming techniques. Finally, the study discusses the main  limitations, drawbacks, and future of aquaponics in Egypt where public awareness  and a new mindset are needed to highlight the link between agriculture and  sustainability.

AB  - The protective role of β-glucan (BG) on liver function, histopathology, immune and antioxidant related gene expressions in Nile tilapia exposed to subacute  deltamethrin (DLM) was investigated for 30 days. Fish (28.18 ± 1.34 g) of the 1st  and 2nd groups fed the control diet, while the 3rd and 4th groups fed BG at  0.5 g/kg and the 2nd and 4th groups were exposed to DLM (15 μg/L) in rearing  water. DLM-treated fish displayed a considerable increase in blood biochemical  parameters (creatinine, urea and bilirubin) as well as hepatic enzymes (ALP, AST  and ALT) (P < 0.05). Blood total protein, globulin, albumin, WBCs, RBCs, Hb,  phagocytic index, phagocytic and lysozyme activities were significantly decreased  in fish subjected to DLM (P < 0.05). Fish fed BG showed significantly the lowest  cortisol and glucose levels, while fish exposed to DLM without feeding BG showed  the highest cortisol and glucose levels (P < 0.05) after 15 and 30 days.  Additionally, DLM toxicity caused downregulation in antioxidant (CAT and GPx) and  immune (IL-1β and IL-8) related gene expressions, while and IFN-γ, HSP70 and  CASP3 were upregulated. The histopathological examination of Nile tilapia exposed  to DLM revealed damage in gills, intestine, spleen and liver which confirmed the  toxic effects. Conversely, BG presented protective effects and restored the  above-mentioned parameters when fish exposed to DLM and fed BG. Thus, BG  supplementation exhibited defensive effects against DLM toxicity in Nile tilapia  through improving blood biochemical responses, immune, and antioxidant related  gene expressions as well as histopathological effects.

AB  - Many microbiotests that have been proposed for use in the risk assessment of environmental pollutants have the drawback of lacking relevant published data on  various aspects of their test application possibilities and therefore do not  receive the regulatory recognition which they may deserve. The MARA bioassay  lacks published data for many relevant environmental pollutants, particularly  pesticides and this may limit its use in regulatory framework. The present study  has assessed the sensitivity of the MARA bioassay relative to other established  bioassays (Daphnia magna and Oreochromis niloticus) to two widely used herbicide  formulations: Roundup (having glyphosate as active ingredient) and Herbextra  (with the active ingredient being 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-2,4-D). Roundup  was found to be more toxic than Herbextra in all three bioassays. The D. magna  EC50 s obtained for Roundup and Herbextra were respectively 5.55 and 356.61 mg/l  while the LC50 s for O. niloticus were 11.30 and 222,28 mg/l respectively. In the  case of the MARA bioassay microbial toxic concentrations (MTCs) for individual  species ranged from 6.85 to 468 mg/l with an overall mean MTC of 101.82 mg/l for  glyphosate and from 74.67 to 13,333 mg/l for 2,4-D giving an overall mean MTC of  2855.88 mg/l. Although the overall MTCs from the MARA bioassay were much higher  than the LC50 s and EC50 s from the fish and daphnia bioassays respectively, the  most sensitive MARA organism for each of the herbicides had MTCs that were  comparable to or lower than the corresponding endpoints from the other bioassays  implying that the MARA assay is a potentially useful bioassay for risk assessment  of pesticides.

AB  - As the older class of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are phased out of commercial use because of findings of neurotoxicity with developmental exposure,  a newer class of flame retardants have been introduced, the organophosphate flame  retardants (OPFRs). Presently, little is known about the potential for  developmental neurotoxicity or the behavioral consequences of OPFR exposure. Our  aim was to characterize the life-long neurobehavioral effects of 4 widely used  OPFRs using the zebrafish model. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.1% DMSO  (vehicle control); or one of the following treatments; isopropylated phenyl  phosphate (IPP) (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 µM); butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate (BPDP)  (0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 3 µM); 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDP) (0.03, 0.3,  1 µM); isodecyl diphenyl phosphate (IDDP) (0.1, 0.3, 1, 10 µM) from 0- to 5-days  postfertilization. On Day 6, the larvae were tested for motility under  alternating dark and light conditions. Finally, at 5-7 months of age the exposed  fish and controls were tested on a battery of behavioral tests to assess  emotional function, sensorimotor response, social interaction and predator  evasion. These tests showed chemical-specific short-term effects of altered  motility in larvae in all of the tested compounds, and long-term impairment of  anxiety-related behavior in adults following IPP, BPDP, or EHDP exposures. Our  results show that OPFRs may not be a safe alternative to the phased-out BFRs and  may cause behavioral impacts throughout the lifespan. Further research should  evaluate the risk to mammalian experimental models and humans.

AB  - Acute toxicity of Roundup, a commercial glyphosate--based herbicide, was evaluated in a teleost marine fish, the European sea bass, after 96 h of  exposure. The LC50 96-h value of Roundup was 529 mg/L. Juveniles (Dicentrarchus  labrax L.) were exposed to a sublethal concentration (35% of the LC50, i.e. 193  mg/L) of Roundup for 96-h. The study of heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) gene expression  was performed in four tissues (liver, gills, brain and gonads) and highlighted  the disruption of antioxidant defence system. Results showed that ho-1 mRNA  levels in liver and gills significantly decreased (p<0.001 and p<0.01  respectively) in fish exposed to 193 mg/L of Roundup, whereas in brain and  gonads, ho-1 mRNA level was not altered. The analysis of acetylcholinesterase  expression was used to evaluate the overall neurotoxicity of the herbicide and  aromatase genes to assess the alteration of the endocrine system. Results showed  that AChE and cyp19b gene transcriptions significantly increased (p<0.01) in  brain of sea bass, whereas aromatase gene expression (cyp19a) in gonads was not  significantly altered. Our results showed complex tissue-specific transcriptional  responses after 96 h of exposure to a sublethal concentration. All these  disruptions confirmed the deleterious effects of this glyphosate-based herbicide  in a marine species.

AB  - Edwardsiella spp. are responsible for significant losses in important wild and cultured fish species worldwide. Recent phylogenomic investigations have  determined that bacteria historically classified as Edwardsiella tarda actually  represent three genetically distinct yet phenotypically ambiguous taxa with  various degrees of pathogenicity in different hosts. Previous recognition of  these taxa was hampered by the lack of a distinguishing phenotypic character.  Commercial test panel configurations are relatively constant over time, and as  new species are defined, appropriate discriminatory tests may not be present in  current test panel arrangements. While phenobiochemical tests fail to  discriminate between these taxa, data presented here revealed discriminatory  peaks for each Edwardsiella species using matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) methodology, suggesting that MALDI-TOF can  offer rapid, reliable identification in line with current systematic  classifications. Furthermore, a multiplex PCR assay was validated for rapid  molecular differentiation of the Edwardsiella spp. affecting fish. Moreover, the  limitations of relying on partial 16S rRNA for discrimination of Edwardsiella  spp. and advantages of employing alternative single-copy genes gyrB and sodB for  molecular identification and classification of Edwardsiella were demonstrated.  Last, sodB sequencing confirmed that isolates previously defined as typical  motile fish-pathogenic E. tarda are synonymous with Edwardsiella piscicida, while  atypical nonmotile fish-pathogenic E. tarda isolates are equivalent to  Edwardsiella anguillarum Fish-nonpathogenic E. tarda isolates are consistent with  E. tarda as it is currently defined. These analyses help deconvolute the  scientific literature regarding these organisms and provide baseline information  to better facilitate proper taxonomic assignment and minimize erroneous  identifications of Edwardsiella isolates in clinical and research settings.

TI  - Effects of diazinon on antioxidant defense system and lipid peroxidation in the liver of Cyprinus carpio (L.).
AU  - Oruc, Elif
T2  - Environmental toxicology
AB  - Diazinon is a widely used organophosphorus pesticide in agriculture and environmental health, hence its adverse effects on nontarget animals, especially  on fish is to be determined. The present study therefore aimed at detecting the  biochemical changes caused by diazinon. To accomplish this aim, we studied the  effects of sublethal concentrations (0.0036, 0.018, and 0.036 ppb) of diazinon on  acetylcholine esterase activity, antioxidant enzyme activities, and lipid  peroxidation in the liver of Cyprinus carpio on days 5, 15, and 30 after the  exposure. The results revealed that the antioxidant enzyme activities such as  superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase were induced by  diazinon exposure. In addition, the highest catalytic activity of glutathione  S-transferase (GST) was obtained with 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). GST  activity toward 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB) was also observed in the  liver, yet it was relatively low as opposed to the other substrates tested. On  the other hand, hepatic malondialdehyde level did not show any significant  alteration except after the exposure on day 15. The exposure of low  concentrations of diazinon to C. carpio can induce oxidative stress in liver; yet  restoring susceptibility and adapting to oxidative stress are likely to occur  when low level of oxidative stress is administered. Furthermore, no significant  change was observed in hepatic lipid peroxidation after diazinon treatment  indicating that liver tissue resisted to oxidative stress by enhancing their  antioxidant mechanisms. The level of lipid peroxidation was assumed to be  associated with the concentrations of diazinon and experimentation periods. The  induction of glutathione S-transferase and antioxidant enzyme activities were  also assumed to have resulted from the defense against the toxicity of diazinon.

AB  - Pendimethalin is a herbicide active substance commonly used in terrestrial agricultural systems and is thus detected at high concentrations in the surface  water of several European countries. Previous studies reported several  histopathological changes, enzymatic antioxidant modulation and immunity  disturbance in fish exposed to this pesticide. The objective of this work was to  investigate the direct effects of long-term exposure to environmental  concentrations of pendimethalin over a period of 18 months in rainbow trout  (Oncorhynchus mykiss) genitors. To do so, an experimental system consisting of  eight similar 400 L tanks with a flow-through of fresh river water was used to  perform daily chemical contamination. Fish were exposed to 850 ng/L for one hour  and the pendimethalin concentration was then gradually diluted during the day to  maintain optimal conditions for the fish throughout the experiment and to achieve  a mean theoretical exposure level of around 100 ng L(-1) per day. Every November,  males and females were stripped to collect eggs and sperm and two new first  generations of offspring were obtained. Kinetic sampling revealed differences in  immune system parameters and antioxidative defences in the contaminated trout  compared to the controls, due to pesticide exposure combined with seasonal  changes related to gamete maturation. Moreover, reproductive capacity was  significantly affected by exposure to the herbicide; a time lag of more than five  weeks was observed for egg maturation in contaminated females and high  bioconcentrations of pendimethalin were measured in eggs and sperm. Chemical  transfer from genitors to offspring via gametes may affect embryo development and  negatively impact the early stages of development.

AB  - Currently diverse biocidal agents can be used for distinct applications, such as personal hygiene, disinfection, antiparasitic activity, and antifouling effects.  Zinc pyrithione is an organometallic biocide, with bactericidal, algicidal and  fungicidal activities. It has been recently incorporated in antifouling formulas,  such as paints, which prevent the establishment of a biofilm on surfaces exposed  to the aquatic environment. It has also been used in cosmetics, such as  anti-dandruff shampoos and soaps. Previously reported data has shown the presence  of this substance in the aquatic compartment, a factor contributing to the  potential exertion of toxic effects, and there is also evidence that  photodegradation products of zinc pyrithione were involved in neurotoxic effects,  namely by inhibiting cholinesterases in fish species. Additional evidence points  to the involvement of zinc pyrithione in alterations of metal homeostasis and  oxidative stress, in both aquatic organisms and human cell models. The present  work assesses the potential ecotoxicity elicited by zinc pyrithione in the  freshwater fish Gambusia holbrooki after an acute (96 h) exposure. The oxidative  stress was assessed by the quantification of the activities of specific enzymes  from the antioxidant defense system, such as catalase, and  glutathione-S-transferases; and the extent of peroxidative damage was quantified  by measuring the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels. Neurotoxicity  was assessed through measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity; and a  standardized method for the description and assessment of histological changes in  liver and gills of was also used. Zinc pyrithione caused non-specific and  reversible tissue alterations, both in liver and gills of exposed organisms.  However, histopathological indices were not significantly different from the  control group. In terms of oxidative stress biomarkers, none of the tested  biomarkers indicated the occurrence of pro-oxidative effects, suggesting that the  oxidative pathway is not the major toxicological outcome of exposure to zinc  pyrithione.

T2  - Critical reviews in toxicology
AB  - Irgarol 1051 is an algaecide used in copper-based antifoulant paints for controlling fouling organisms on the hulls of recreational and commercial  watercraft. Paints containing this algaecide have been used in Europe since the  mid-1980s. In 1998, the first antifouling paints containing Irgarol 1051 were  registered for use in the U. S. To examine the risk that Irgarol may pose to  aquatic ecosystems, a probabilistic ecological risk assessment was conducted  using distributions of exposure and toxicity data. Exposure data for this  assessment were derived from 11 monitoring studies (146 stations) conducted in  marinas, estuaries, and coastal waters from 1992 to 1997 in six European  countries. A comparison of 90th percentile concentrations pooled by station types  across all regions showed that concentrations in marinas (316 ng/l) were higher  than in estuaries and coastal waters (41 and 19 ng/l, respectively). A 90th  percentile of 133 ng/l was reported for all pooled stations. Temporal trends  showed that Irgarol concentrations typically peaked in early summer after  launching of small boats with much lower concentrations occurring during the  spring, fall, and winter. Toxicity data used for this risk assessment were  derived primarily from unpublished studies submitted to regulatory agencies.  Because Irgarol is a photosynthesis-inhibiting herbicide, it is much more toxic  to plants than animals. Toxicity values for animals (fish and invertebrates) were  much greater than concentrations of Irgarol reported in the environment.  Therefore, a conservative approach using a distribution of only plant toxicity  data (EC50s for plant growth) was used to derive a 10th percentile of 136 ng/l.  This plant toxicity benchmark of 136 ng/l was used for risk characterization.  Results from probabilistic analysis showed that ecological risk from Irgarol  exposure was low in estuaries, coastal areas, and various open-type marinas.  However, 10% or more of the plant species in enclosed marinas with low flushing  rates may be exposed to Irgarol concentrations that would reduce photosynthesis  activity and growth during the summer. Ecological risk to these sensitive plant  species in enclosed marinas will likely be moderated because of the reversibility  of Irgarol's inhibition of photosynthesis and the rapid recovery potential of  plant communities. The ecological significance of marinas that generally contain  numerous stressors such as trace metals, tributyltin, petroleum hydrocarbons,  high nutrient concentrations, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations is a  management issue that needs to be addressed.

TI  - Prenatal exposure to low doses of atrazine affects mating behaviors in male guppies.
AU  - Shenoy, Kausalya
T2  - Hormones and behavior
AB  - Performing appropriate mating behaviors is crucial to male reproductive success, especially in species where mating is predominantly via female mate choice.  Mating behaviors are hormonally regulated and may be sexually selected traits:  courtship displays are selected via mate choice, while forced copulations and  aggressive behaviors are selected for via intrasexual competition. Endocrine  disrupting compounds interfere with proper hormonal functioning in exposed  animals. Exposures during developmentally crucial life stages can have  irreversible effects lasting through adulthood. I tested the effects of prenatal  exposure to environmentally relevant doses of a commonly used herbicide, atrazine  (1 and 13.5μg/L) on mating behaviors in male guppies. Guppies were used as a  model organism to test the effects of atrazine exposure on wildlife reproductive  health. Adult female guppies were mated and exposed to the treatments throughout  the gestation period, and offspring born to them were raised without further  treatment. At adulthood, the males were tested for the effects of prenatal  exposure on their mating behaviors such as courtship displays, gonopodium swings,  forced copulatory attempts, and competitive and aggressive behaviors towards  rivals who were not exposed to atrazine. I also tested female preference for  treated males compared to control males. Atrazine-exposed males were less likely  to perform the mating behaviors, and performed them less frequently, than control  males. Atrazine exposure also made males less aggressive towards rivals. Females  preferred untreated males over atrazine-treated males. In all cases, a  non-monotonic pattern was seen, highlighting the significance of low-dose  exposures.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Abamectin (ABA) toxicity in fish, amphibian and mammals was already proven, but its effect on birds is almost unknown. Thus, the aim of our study is to assess  the impact of exposure to water with ABA for 40 days at predicted environmentally  relevant concentrations on the behavior of female Japanese quails (Coturnix  coturnix japonica). The three following experimental groups (n = 10 each) were  set: "control", quails exposed to drinking water, without ABA, "EC1x" and  "EC1000x" (0.31 mg a.i./L and 310.0 a.i./L, respectively; via commercial  formulation Kraft® 36EC). The open field test showed anxiolytic response in birds  exposed to ABA. These birds did not show locomotor changes or aggressive behavior  in the aggressiveness test. Quails exposed to the pesticide did not react to the  introduction of an object in the experimental box during the object recognition  test, and it suggested perception deficit due to ABA. Moreover, these birds did  not recognize the cat (Felix catus) and the vocalization of a hawk (Rupornis  magnirostris) as potential predatory threats. These responses also suggest  anti-predatory behavior deficit due to the pesticide. Thus, our study is pioneer  in showing that water with ABA, at tested concentrations, influences the behavior  of C. coturnix japonica, as well as in highlighting the potential impacts of this  pesticide on this group of birds.

AB  - Toxic effects of penoxsulam herbicide on acetylcholinesterase, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and protein carbonyl were studied in silver catfish  (Rhamdia sp.) and carp (Cyprinus carpio). Acetylcholinesterase activity was  inhibited in both brain and muscle tissue, with the inhibition being greater in  carp than in silver catfish. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), an indicator of  lipid peroxidation, decreased in silver catfish brain tissue, but increased in  the carp brain. MDA also increased significantly in muscle tissue of silver  catfish. The levels of protein carbonyl, another measure of oxidative damage,  increased in the brain of both fish species, and in the muscle of carp. However,  silver catfish exhibited a decrease in muscle protein carbonyl. It appears that  silver catfish may possess better mechanisms of defense against penoxsulam  toxicity than carp.

TI  - Endoparasite control strategies: implications for biodiversity of native fauna.
AU  - Spratt, D. M.
T2  - International journal for parasitology
AB  - Efforts to control the spectrum of diseases that affect humans, our crops and our animals pose problems which need to be debated openly. Widespread use of  chemicals in such a broad sphere raises important concerns not only about safety  for the users, consumers and target species, but especially about the not so  obvious effects upon the ecosystems in which they are used. Some undetermined  level of biological diversity is necessary to maintain ecological function and  resilience. These, in turn, are necessary for generating the biological resources  (trees, fish, wildlife, crops) and ecological services (watershed protection, air  cleansing, climate stabilisation, erosion control) on which economic activity and  human welfare depend. The driving forces behind decline of biodiversity stem  entirely from human activities. Underlying causes are those resulting from the  cultural and social factors associated with economic activities and lead to  direct depletion of species, and degradation or destruction of habitats. The  broad spectrum and high efficacy of the macrocyclic lactones against nematode and  arthropod parasites of livestock and companion animals are unprecedented. Cattle,  horses, sheep, swine, dogs--to varying degrees all are utilised by humans for  economic gain. Detrimental impact upon non-target animals is considered  acceptable in eradicating parasites because of their economic importance to  commercial livestock production. Production will increase when these parasites  are eliminated, but we remain oblivious to the long-term consequences of our  actions. What are the ecological limits to rural economic activities? Decomposing  animal faeces help to maintain our ecosystem by returning valuable nutrients to  the soil. Dung fauna-fungi, yeast, bacteria, nematodes, insects and  earthworms--play a non-conspicuous but important and varied role in this  decomposition process, a role dependent upon many factors, especially  environmental ones. Anthelmintics and pesticides are of considerable value in  agriculture, but largely at an unevaluated cost to the greater environment. We  have insufficient knowledge of the extent to which a spectrum of anthelmintics  and pesticides affect ecological function and ecosystem resilience in our  commercial plant and animal production systems. It is time we developed a genuine  interest in avoiding "the dialogue of the deal" that in the past has minimised  interdisciplinary research between environmental ecology and commercial plant and  animal production.

AB  - Edwardsiella piscicida causes edwardsiellosis in a variety of fish species and leads to tremendous economic losses in the global aquaculture industries. Thus,  effective and safe prevention and control of this bacterium are urgently needed  to combat the related infections. Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) effectively  prevent infectious diseases. However, most of the existing E. piscicida LAVs are  based on the deletion of genes encoding the translocon components of the type III  secretion system (T3SS), the core virulence system, which is the most prominent  protective bacterial antigen with the strongest immunogenicity. In this study, we  systematically deleted all of the 9 established T3SS effectors in E. piscicida  (aka 9Δ) and the rpoS gene encoding the alternative sigma factor, the esrB  repressor (10Δ), then we overexpressed esrB and T3SS in E. piscicida to obtain  the recombinant strain 10Δ/esrB(OE). The modified strains 10Δ and 10Δ/esrB(OE)  exhibited severe attenuation and in vivo colonization defects. Additionally,  vaccination by intraperitoneal injection with 10Δ and 10Δ/esrB(OE) could  significantly upregulate the expression of the antigen recognition related gene  (TLR5) and the adaptive immune response-related gene (MHC II) in the  spleen/kidney of turbot fish, and it also enhanced the hosts' serum bactericidal  capacity. Finally, vaccination with 10Δ/esrB(OE) led to increased immune  protection against the challenge of wild type E. piscicida EIB202 in turbot fish.  Collectively, these findings demonstrated that 10Δ/esrB(OE) was a novel LAV  strain and therefore a potential novel strategy for the construction of LAVs  against bacterial pathogens.

Eighteen dogs were evenly and randomly allocated to the following treatments: 1)  65% permethrin, 2) selamectin, 3) untreated control. Dogs were treated by topical  application of the assigned product in accordance with product label directions  on Day 0. At 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days after treatment, each dog was exposed for  2 hours to 50 unfed, adult ticks in a cage with a carpet that covered  approximately 70% of the floor area. After the exposure period, dogs were removed  from the cages and live and dead ticks were counted on the dogs and in the cages.  The number of live ticks recovered was reduced by 90.3% to 99.5% for dogs treated  with 65% permethrin (P <.0001 versus controls and selamectin), compared with  10.9% to 31.1% for dogs treated with selamectin (P >.05 versus controls). The  repellency of 65% permethrin was 63.4% to 80.2% against I. ricinus ticks (P  <.0001 versus controls, P <.0007 versus selamectin), compared with 0% to 10.9%  repellency for selamectin (P >.05 versus controls).

T2  - Frontiers in physiology
AB  - Harness(®) is a commercial herbicide that contains acetochlor at a concentration of 84% as an active ingredient. Ubiquitous, persistent, and substantial uses of  Harness(®) in agricultural processes have resulted in the pollution of nearby  water sources, posing a threat to various aquatic biotas, including fish. The  effects of Harness(®) toxicity on fish health are little known. So, this study  aimed to describe the impact of herbicide Harness(®) on the oxidative stress and  reproductive and thyroid performance of male and female tilapia (Oreochromis  niloticus) and also investigate the prospective role of the natural antioxidant  lycopene supplementation in dismissing the adverse properties of Harness(®).  Antioxidant enzyme (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and total antioxidant  capacity) and hormone measurements (T, E2, T3, and T4) were carried out, and  gonadal and thyroid follicle histological sections were examined as a method to  investigate the effects of Harness(®) toxicity on fish. Male and female tilapia  were exposed to 10 μmol/L and 100 μmol/L of Harness(®) and treated with 10 mg  lycopene/kg for 15 days of exposure. Our results demonstrated that the  antioxidant enzyme activity was altered by Harness exposure and serum T for both  males and females dropped; also, female E2 levels decreased, but male E2  increased. Exposure to higher dose of Harness(®) induced elevation in both T3 and  T4 levels, although the low exposure dose stimulated T4 levels. Harness(®)  exposure prompted histological variations and degenerative changes in testicular,  ovarian, and thyroid follicle tissues. Lycopene supplement administration  diminished oxidative stress induced by Harness(®), alleviating its endocrine  disparaging effects by neutralizing T3, T4, T, and E2 and ameliorating the  histological structure of gonadal and thyroid tissues. In conclusion, lycopene  supplementation was preformed to normalize the alterations and oxidative damage  caused by Harness(®) in Nile tilapia, suggesting that lycopene-supplemented diet  functioned as potent antioxidants and had the ability to alleviate oxidative  stress and thyroid and reproductive toxicity caused by herbicide Harness(®).  Moreover, it is crucial to take appropriate care when consuming herbicides to  defend the aquatic environment.

AB  - Specific molecularly imprinted membranes (MIMs) for pyrethroid insecticides were developed and characterized for the first time in this study by cold  plasma-induced grafting polymerization using methacrylic acid as a functional  monomer and cypermethrin (CYP) as a template. The nonimprinted membranes (NIMs)  were also synthesized using the same procedure without the template. Meanwhile,  AFM, XPS, ATR-FTIR, contact angle, and permselectivity experiments were conducted  to elucidate the imprinting and recognition properties of MIMs. Results  demonstrated that MIMs exhibited excellent imprinting effect and high  permselectivity. A molecularly imprinted-membrane-assisted solvent extraction  (MI-MASE) method based on the MIMs was established. The operating conditions were  optimized for group-selective extraction of the five pyrethroid insecticides.  Compared with NIMs, higher extraction recoveries (83.8% to 100.6%) of the five  pyrethroid insecticides by gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD)  were obtained using MIMs at three spiked levels in fish samples; the RSD values  were lower than 8.3%. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ)  defined as the concentrations at which the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is 3:1 and  10:1, respectively, were in the range of 0.26 to 0.42 μg/kg and 0.77 to 1.27  μg/kg, respectively. No matrix effect of the developed MI-MASE was observed by  gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS). These results  demonstrated a highly selective, efficient, and environment-friendly MI-MASE  technique for preconcentration and purification of pyrethroid insecticides from  seafood, followed by GC-ECD and GC/MS/MS. The excellent applicability and  potential of MI-MASE for routine monitoring of pyrethroid pesticides in food  samples has also been confirmed.

T2  - Mutation research
AB  - Albendazole (ABZ), a benzimidazole carbamate used for the treatment of several human helminthiases has high affinity for tubulin, which results in an inhibition  of microtubule polymerization, blocking several vital processes in the parasites,  such as motility and nutrient uptake. The ability of ABZ to act as mitotic  spindle poison leads to a potential risk for aneuploidy induction in exposed  human beings. ABZ, as well as albendazole sulphoxide (ABZSO), its main  metabolite, induce micronuclei in human cells in a dose-dependent manner. Despite  recognition that ABZ and ABZSO increase micronucleus frequency, their potential  as inducers of non-disjunction in human cells, an event considered more frequent  than chromosome loss, and one of the main mechanisms involved in aneuploidy  induction, has not been evaluated. In the present work, we investigated the  ability of ABZ and ABZSO to induce non-disjunction in cultured human lymphocytes.  Non-disjunction was scored by chromosome-specific FISH using a classical or alpha  satellite probe for chromosomes 1 and 7, respectively. Significant increase in  non-disjunction events that involved either chromosome were observed in cells  treated with ABZ or ABZSO. Both ABZ and ABZSO induced non-disjunction at lower  concentrations than those at which MN were observed.

AB  - The main toxicity mechanism of organophosphate insecticides such as malathion is the acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition. However, fish responses to  organophosphates may vary depending on the activation of different defense  mechanisms as well as the length of exposure. As such, the evaluation of  acetylcholinesterase activity, in combination with the evaluation of  biotransformation and antioxidants enzymes levels, is useful for indicating  damage in fish exposed to this insecticide. Moreover, evaluating mitochondrial  activity might evidence how the hierarchic responses occur in relation to the  length of time that the fish is exposed. Therefore, the aim of our study is to  evaluate whether the length of exposure to malathion differentially affects the  biochemical responses of tambaqui. Our hypothesis is that the physiological  alterations due to exposure are time dependent. Fish were exposed to sublethal  concentrations of the insecticide during 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Contrary to  expectations, there was no acetylcholinesterase activity inhibition during the  experiment, which indicates an absence of neurotoxicity. Phase II  biotransformation mechanism was activated early, especially in the liver.  Oxidative damage was evident in the first hours of exposure and was concurrent  with the activation of antioxidant enzymes. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were  differentially affected by the length of exposure. The data suggest that the  tambaqui regulates mitochondrial respiration differently over time, seeking to  maintain homeostasis and ATP demand, and ensures the activation of response  mechanisms, thus minimizing oxidative damage and avoiding the neurotoxicity of  malathion.

AB  - Imazapyr (IMY) and imazapic (IMI) are imidazolinone herbicides which have been associated in a commercial formulation (Kifix(®)). To date, there are no studies  on the toxicity of an IMY+IMI herbicide in fish. This work aimed to assess the  acute toxicity (24 and 96 h) of IMY+IMI (0, 0.488 and 4.88 µg/L) towards Rhamdia  quelen through hematological, biochemical, immunological, ionoregulatory and  enzymatic indexes. Red blood cell count was lower at 4.88 than at 0.488 µg/L (24  and 96 h); mean corpuscular volume was lower than control at both concentrations  (24 h) and at 0.488 µg/L (96 h); lymphocytes declined at 4.88 µg/L comparing to  control (96 h); and monocytes increased at 4.88 µg/L (96 h) in comparison with  the respective control and with 4.88 µg/L at 24h. Aspartate aminotransferase was  higher at 0.488 µg/L (96 h) than the respective control and the respective  concentration at 24 h; uric acid reduced at 4.88 µg/L comparing with 0.488 µg/L  (96 h); and cortisol was lower at 4.88 µg/L compared to 0.488 µg/L and control  (96 h). Herbicide exposure lowered plasma bactericidal activity at both  concentrations (24 h) and at 0.488 µg/L (96 h); and plasma complement activity  declined at 4.88 µg/L comparing with 0.488 µg/L and control (96 h), and was lower  at all concentrations at 96 h than at 24 h. Plasma K(+) levels were higher at  4.88µg/L than in the remaining groups (24 and 96h); and Na(+) levels decreased at  4.88 µg/L compared to control (96 h). Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and H(+)-ATPase  activities in gills were lower at 4.88 µg/L comparing with control (24 h) and  with the respective concentration at 96 h; and AChE activity in brain was higher  at 0.488 and 4.88 µg/L than control (24 h) and the respective concentrations at  96 h, while in muscle it was higher at 0.488 and 4.88 µg/L than control (96 h)  and the respective concentrations at 24 h. The present findings demonstrate that,  despite IMY+IMI targets the animal-absent AHAS enzyme, such formulation displayed  an acute toxic effect upon R. quelen homeostasis by impacting on vital functions  such as immune defense, metabolism, ionoregulation and neurotransmission.

AB  - Triazole fungicides are extensively applied in general agriculture for fungal control and have negative impacts on aquatic organisms. Prothioconazole, a widely  used triazole fungicide, is toxic to zebrafish, but systematic research on the  negative effects caused by prothioconazole in zebrafish embryos is limited. In  this study, we studied the developmental toxicology, oxidative stress and  apoptosis caused by prothioconazole in zebrafish embryos. Exposure to 0.850 mg/L  prothioconazole impacts embryo survival and hatching. Prothioconazole exposure  caused embryo malformation, especially yolk-sac and pericardial edemas, and  prothioconazole-induced apoptosis was observed. Additionally, exposure to a high  prothioconazole concentration up-regulated the expression levels of oxidative  stress defense-related genes and p53. The bax to bcl2 ratio increased along with  exposure time and prothioconazole concentration. Prothioconazole induced  apoptosis during the early life stages of zebrafish and may trigger  oxidative-stress and p53-dependent pathway responses. Our findings increase our  understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress and cell death  caused by prothioconazole.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Atrazine and its chloro-s-triazine metabolites are found in surface water and groundwater of the Czech Republic, although their use has been banned  since 2005. The objective of the study was to determine the toxic effects of  atrazine at an environmentally relevant concentration of atrazine, 0.3 μg.L-1 and  at concentrations of 30, 100, and 300 μg.L-1 on morphometric and condition  characteristics, development of early life stages, and antioxidant defense  enzymes of common carp. METHODS: The embryo-larval toxicity test was performed  according to the OECD Guidelines 210 (Fish, Early-life Stage Toxicity Test).  RESULTS: Atrazine exposure showed no effect on morphometric and condition  characteristics or histology. Exposure at 0.3 μg.L-1 was associated with  significantly increased activity of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione  S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase compared to control. Activity  of glutathione reductase was slightly higher at a concentration of 0.3 μg.L-1,  with significantly lower (p<0.05) activity observed in groups exposed to 30, 100,  and 300 μg.L-1 compared to the group exposed to 0.3 μg.L-1. The level of oxidized  lipids was slightly higher in groups exposed to atrazine at 100 and 300 μg.L-1  compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Atrazine has a significant influence on the  biotransformation enzyme and oxidative defense enzymes of early life stages of  common carp. The lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) was 0.3 μg.L-1.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review research findings on the effects of DDT on body functions in vertebrates. METHODS: The research was based on retrieval and critical review of  relevant articles and abstracts cited in international and regional journals. The  literature search was done on MedLine from the year 1975 to 2010. The analyses of  published data on various vertebrates (birds, fish, mice, human, among others)  were considered. RESULTS: The effect of DDT on body functions is purely dependent  on the degree of exposure. Whereas mild exposure (1-5mg/kg) may not have  significant effects, very high concentrations (>100mg/kg) of DDT generally  adversely affect the reproductive functions of animals. Eggshell quality, egg  hatch-ability and health of chicks are affected by high DDT exposure. Very high  DDT levels may increase the chances of spontaneous abortion and preterm birth,  which is one of the main causes of infant mortality in humans. The health of a  growing foetus and infant may also be compromised by DDT transfer from an exposed  mother through the placenta and breast milk. The DDT affects the estrous cycle of  exposed animals by altering the hormonal functions. In male rats, DDT has been  observed to alter spermatogenesis and reduce aggression behaviour. However the  effect in higher male animals has not been clearly elucidated. CONCLUSION: DDT  exposure has drastic effects on reproductive functions in vertebrates, and safer  alternatives should be considered rather than re-introducing DDT as a control  agent for mosquitoes as has been suggested recently.

AB  - During an avian mass mortality event investigation at the National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory in Ashland, OR, imidacloprid became an insecticide  of concern. A qualitative analytical toxicology screen of seeds, plucks (tongue,  esophagus, and trachea), and ventricular contents was requested. A method for the  extraction and qualitative analysis of the insecticide in animal tissues was  therefore developed. The procedure relies on a combined Food Emergency Response  Network (FERN) and QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe)  approach to sample extraction followed by qualitative analysis by gas  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Since imidacloprid is not amenable to  the conditions of gas chromatography, a trimethylsilyl derivative was created and  characterized. Proposed mechanisms for the creation of this derivative and its  mass spectrum are described. The imidacloprid-trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivative was  detected in all samples submitted.

AB  - Penconazole is a systemic fungicide commonly used in agriculture as the commercial preparation Topas. Although triazole fungicides are widely found in  the aquatic environment, little is known about their acute toxicity on fish. In  this study we assessed the effects of short-term exposure to Topas on some  parameters of homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the levels of  markers of oxidative stress and parameters of the antioxidant defense system of  goldfish (Carassius auratus L.). Gills appeared to be the main target organ of  Topas toxicity, showing the greatest number of parameters affected. Gills of  Topas-treated fish showed a higher content of low (L-SH) and high (H-SH)  molecular mass thiols and higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD),  catalase, glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) as well as reduced carbonyl protein  content (CP), as compared with those in the control group. In the liver, goldfish  exposure to 15-25mgL(-1) Topas resulted in a higher L-SH and H-SH content, but  lower CP levels and activity of GST. In kidney, Topas exposure resulted in higher  activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and G6PDH, but lower L-SH content and  activity of GST. The results of this study indicate that acute goldfish exposure  to the triazole fungicide Topas increased efficiency of the antioxidant system in  fish gills, liver, and kidney. This could indicate the development of low  intensity oxidative stress which up-regulates defense mechanisms responsible for  protection of goldfish against deleterious ROS effects.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is proposed, based on the fish communities and populations in streams of the Hondo River basin, Mexico-Belize. Freshwater  environments in this area are threatened by exotic fishes, eutrophication, and  pesticide pollution, among other problems. This IBI should allow to identify the  most vulnerable sites and eventually guide rehabilitation efforts. Data on  composition, structure, and function of fish communities were evaluated.  Twenty-three sites in the Mexican part of the basin were explored; a stratified  sample of 13 sites was used to design the IBI, and the rest were used to test and  refine the index. Thirty-four candidate indicator metrics were scanned for their  correlation with an index of water and habitat quality (IWHQ), as well as for the  possible influence of stream width and altitude or distance to the Hondo River  mainstem. Twelve variables were selected to constitute the IBI: relative  abundances of Astyanax aeneus, 'Cichlasoma' urophthalmus, Poecilia mexicana,  Poecilia sp. (a new species, probably endemic to the upper Hondo River basin),  Xiphophorus hellerii, and X. maculatus; relative abundances of bentholimnetic,  herbivore, and sensitive species; percentage of native and tolerant species; and  Pielou's evenness index. Most of the sites have a low-medium quality and  integrity, showing impact due to partial channelization or to suboptimal water  quality, reflected in scarcity or absence of sensitive species, frequent excess  of tolerant species, occasional presence of exotics, dominance of herbivores  (perhaps due to proliferation of filamentous algae), or dominance of the  opportunistic species P. mexicana. The streams with better water and habitat  quality are those farthest away from the river mainstem, probably because of  lower human population and economical production.

AB  - Fenitrothion (FN) is a widely used organophosphorous pesticide that has structural similarities with the clinical anti-androgen flutamide. The potential  for FN to act as an anti-androgen (at exposures of 1, 50, and 200 microg FN/l  over a 26-day period) was assessed in male three-spined sticklebacks,  Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring kidney spiggin concentration, nest-building,  and courtship behavior. Spiggin is the glue protein that male sticklebacks use to  build their nests and is directly controlled by androgens. FN exposure  significantly reduced spiggin production as well as nest-building activity. It  also adversely affected courtship--especially the 'zigzag dance' and biting  behavior of the males. FN thus appears to have anti-androgenic effects on both  the physiology and behavior of the male stickleback.

AB  - N-Acetyl-L-cysteine, a low-molecular weight thiol compound, with two different doses was used to prevent fenthion, an organophosphorus insecticide and  acaricide, related oxidative stress in the brain of a model organism, Cyprinus  carpio. Fish were exposed to sub-lethal and nominal concentration of fenthion  after intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 or 400 mg/kg NAC. Brain tissues were then  dissected and homogenized to analyse GSH, GSSG, TBARS, and protein contents.  Enzymes that constitute the first line antioxidant defence, namely SOD and CAT,  GSH-related enzymes, GR and GST, together with AChE activities were also  determined spectrophotometrically. Fenthion did not cause any alteration in SOD  and CAT activities while increasing GSH content, GSH/GSSG ratio and GST specific  enzyme activity and decreasing GSSG, TBARS, and protein contents. Although, the  highest induction in SOD and GST enzymes activities and the highest increase in  GSH content were observed in the 0.5 mg/kg NAC-injected fish, their protein  contents showed a decrease. 400 mg/kg NAC impeded the activation of the GST  enzyme and a higher decrease in lipid peroxidation was observed. Fish were also  protected against protein depletion by the higher dose NAC application. AChE  activity was not influenced by fenthion exposure. Xenobiotic and GSH transporters  may cause mild oxidative stress conditions in brain. Cellular redox status could  trigger a series of reactions that result in an increase in SOD activity and a  decrease in protein content. Based on the present results, it was suggested that  the usefulness of NAC against fenthion depends on applied dose and tissue  characteristics. Species-specifity and concentration selection should be taken  into consideration in studies dealing with anticholinesterases.

AB  - An efficient magnetic dummy template molecularly imprinted polymer nanocomposite was prepared using multi-walled carbon nanotubes as a support and metolachlor  deschloro as a dummy template. The obtained nanocomposites were characterized  using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry,  scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The  adsorption performance of the obtained nanocomposites was evaluated through  binding experiments, including static adsorption, kinetic adsorption, and  selective recognition studies. The obtained nanocomposites were successfully  applied as selective sorbents for the magnetic solid-phase extraction of seven  amide herbicides (alachlor, acetochlor, pretilachlor, butachlor, metolachlor,  diethatyl ethyl, and dimethachlor) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry from fish samples. Under the optimized conditions, the limit of  detection was 0.01-0.1 μg/kg. The obtained recoveries of the amide herbicides  from the fish samples were in the range of 88.0 to 102.1% with a relative  standard deviation of less than 7.5%. This method, which eliminated the effect of  template leakage on qualitative and quantitative analysis was found to be  superior to the methods reported in the literature. The results indicated that it  could be successfully applied to analyze amide herbicides in fish samples with  satisfactory recoveries.

AB  - As part of the Great Lakes International Surveillance Plan, 1978-83, egg contaminant levels and reproductive output were determined for Herring Gull  colonies on Lake Superior in 1983. Since 1974, the Herring Gull has been widely  used in the Great Lakes as a spatial and temporal monitor of organochlorine (OC)  contaminant levels and associated biological effects. Most eggs contained a wide  range of OCs, the main compounds being DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),  dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane, hexachlorobenzene and mirex. Levels  of an additional ten OCs and five polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD)  congeners were also determined for some sites. Overall, levels varied  significantly among colonies, but there was no obvious relationship to spatial  distribution of contaminants in sediments or fish species. OC levels in eggs had  declined by up to 84% since 1974. Eggshells were only 8% thinner than before the  introduction of DDT, and shell thinning was not a cause of breeding failure.  Average reproductive output varied from 0.15 to 1.57 young per apparently  occupied nest in 1983: at 56% of colonies the value was below that thought  necessary to maintain stable populations. The main causes of failure were egg  disappearence and cannibalism of chicks. Despite this, the population appeared to  have been increasing at about 4% per annum. Reduced availability of forage fish  during the early 1980s was the most likely reason for the poor reproductive  output in 1983.

AB  - Wild and farmed mussels, Mytilus edulis, coexist with salmon farms in Scottish sea lochs. A synthetic pyrethroid, cypermethrin, is licensed for use on fish  farms to control sea lice infestations as a formulation called Excis. In this  study, uptake of cypermethrin from Excis exposure is investigated through the use  of gas chromatography with mass-spectrometry. The effects of Excis on mussels are  also examined by measuring the neutral red retention time of lysosomes, aerial  survival and shell closure. The isomeric ratios of cis:trans cypermethrin  measured in mussels are around 80:20; a marked increase from 40:60 to which the  mussels were exposed. This is most likely due to preferential metabolism of  trans-isomers, as the same response is seen in vertebrates. There is a pronounced  behavioural effect of shell closure, where mussels exposed to 1000 microg/l  cypermethrin shut their shells within an hour of exposure. Arguments are  presented for this effect being either a voluntary response on recognition of  cypermethrin, or an effect arising from an involuntary action of cypermethrin on  the adductor muscle. Even at 1000 microg/l cypermethrin, neutral red retention  time and aerial survival are not affected. The data suggest that the responses of  mussels shown here are unlikely to occur in the field, even at the concentrations  of cypermethrin used in fish cages, for the treatment of sea lice.

AU  - Bayley, Mark

T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - It has been thoroughly established that the fungicide vinclozolin and the persistent DDT metabolite p,p'-DDE, can function as antiandrogens in mammals in a  manner similar to the therapeutic antiandrogen flutamide. In mammals, these  chemicals bind the androgen receptor and prevent the transcription of the  associated genes causing abnormal sexual development and demasculinization. There  are few similar studies in fish and so far it has not been demonstrated that  these chemicals have any antiandrogenic effects in this group. In the present  study, juvenile guppies (Poecilia reticulata) were fed sublethal doses of  vinclozolin, p,p'-DDE or flutamide from birth to adulthood. At sexual maturity,  we measured a suite of male sexual characteristics that are known to be under  androgen control. All three chemicals caused a reduction in the orange display  coloration, inhibited gonopodium development, reduced the sperm count and  suppressed courtship behaviour, in a manner consistent with antiandrogen action.  Only the gonodosomatic index was unaffected by the treatments. In addition, the  three chemicals skewed the sex ratio at adulthood and caused delayed maturation.  The altered characters are all considered to be important for male mating success  and their impairment indicates that antiandrogens may seriously compromise male  reproductive fitness.

AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are vectors of important parasites and pathogens causing death, poverty and social disability worldwide, with special reference to  tropical and subtropical countries. The overuse of synthetic insecticides to  control mosquito vectors lead to resistance, adverse environmental effects and  high operational costs. Therefore, the development of eco-friendly control tools  is an important public health challenge. In this study, the mosquito larvicidal  activity of Pinus kesiya leaf essential oil (EO) was evaluated against the  malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and the  lymphatic filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The chemical composition of  the EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. GC-MS revealed that  the P. kesiya EO contained 18 compounds. Major constituents were α-pinene,  β-pinene, myrcene and germacrene D. In acute toxicity assays, the EO showed  significant toxicity against early third-stage larvae of An. stephensi, Ae.  aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, with LC50 values of 52, 57, and 62µg/ml,  respectively. Notably, the EO was safer towards several aquatic non-target  organisms Anisops bouvieri, Diplonychus indicus and Gambusia affinis, with LC50  values ranging from 4135 to 8390µg/ml. Overall, this research adds basic  knowledge to develop newer and safer natural larvicides from Pinaceae plants  against malaria, dengue and filariasis mosquito vectors.

TI  - Exposure to pesticides impairs the expression of fish ornaments reducing the availability of attractive males.
AU  - Arellano-Aguilar, Omar
AU  - Macías Garcia, Constantino
T2  - Proceedings. Biological sciences
AB  - Ornament magnitude often reflects a local balance between sexual selection and other sources of natural selection opposing their elaboration. Human activity may  disrupt this balance if it modifies the costs of producing, maintaining or  displaying the ornaments. When costs are increased, a shortage of acceptable  partners may ensue, with consequences commensurate with how stringent (and  effective) the process of mate choice is. Here, we show that the expression of  ornaments in the viviparous amarillo fish (Girardinichthys multiradiatus) is  influenced by embryonic exposure to low concentrations of an organophosphorus  insecticide. Male ornamental fin size, dimorphic yellow coloration and display  rates were all compromised in exposed fish, but unaffected in their paternal  half-sibling controls and in their sisters (morphology and colour). Exposure  resulted in smaller fish of both sexes, thus the differential effect by sex was  restricted to attributes such as fin size only above the naturally selected  magnitude shown by females. Father phenotype predicted offspring morphology of  controls, but not of exposed males, which were discriminated against by both  control and exposed females. Since stringent female mate choice can result in  females refusing to mate with suboptimal mates, this sub-lethal developmental  effect can reduce the effective population size of amarillo fish populations.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of four autochthonous bacteria isolated from juvenile sole (Solea senegalensis) intestine as dietary  probiotic supplement against bacterial pathogen infection and handling/transport  stressors. Growth performance and immune responses were evaluated after 85 days  of feeding trial. Sole (IBW = 16.07 ± 0.11 g) were fed six experimental diets, a  control diet (CTRL, without the dietary probiotic supplementation), and five  diets supplemented with probiotic bacteria: PB1 (Shewanella hafniensis), PB2  (Enterococcus raffinosus), PB3 (Shewanella hafniensis + Arthrobacter soli), PB4  (Pseudomonas protegens + Arthrobacter soli) and PB5 (Shewanella  hafniensis + Arthrobacter soli + Enterococcus raffinosus). All bacteria were  selected based on their in vitro antimicrobial activity. After the growth trial,  fish were submitted to a stress factor (transport) and then each dietary group  was divided in two additional groups: non-infected (placebo) and infected with  Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. Immune and antioxidant responses were  evaluated at day 10 post-infection. In infection trial A, fish were infected on  the same day of transport, whereas in trial B fish were infected after a 7-day  recovery from the transport stress. At the end of the feeding trial, fish fed  with PB2 and PB4 showed lower final body weight when compared with the other  dietary groups. Respiratory burst activity and nitric oxide production were not  affected by probiotic supplementation. Fish fed with PB5 presented lower  peroxidase activity compared to CTRL. Lysozyme and alternative complement pathway  activity (ACH50) showed no significant differences between treatments. The innate  immune responses were significantly affected after handling stress and bacterial  infection. In trial A, the ACH50 levels of infected fish were significantly lower  than the placebo groups. On the other hand, in trial B fish infected with Pdp  demonstrated higher ACH50 levels when compared to placebos. Peroxidase levels  were strongly modulated by bacterial infection and handling stress. In trials A  and B, infection had a clear downgrade effect in peroxidase levels. Lipid  peroxidation, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase were  altered by both bacterial infection and transport. Overall, dietary probiotic  supplementation did not influence growth performance of sole. The immune and  oxidative defenses of sole responded differently to infection depending on the  probiotic and the synergy between pathogen infection and transport.

AU  - Matson, Cole W.
T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Few studies in developmental toxicology have focused on whether early life contaminant exposure affects future susceptibility. Investigations in frogs  suggested that early life exposure to a pesticide resulted in higher tolerance to  a subsequent challenge. This led to the hypothesis that early-life stage  exposures can alter phenotypically plastic traits during development, resulting  in induced tolerance. Here, we used Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) to test the  role of detoxification pathway priming in this inducible tolerance. In frogs, the  induced tolerance is present five days after the end of the pre-exposure, but  absent after a month. We show that a pre-exposure early in life with carbaryl,  induces the activity of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and increases the ability of  pre-exposed groups to metabolize carbaryl, likely because of activation of the  aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. Embryos pre-exposed to carbaryl had a  350-500% increase in CYP1A activity, threefold greater capacity to metabolize  carbaryl and were more tolerant to a lethal challenge five days after the end of  pre-exposure. However, ten days later the differences in CYP1A activity,  metabolic capacity and tolerance between pre-exposed and control groups were no  longer present. Thus, we conclude that the increase in tolerance observed in  pre-exposed fish embryos was due to the activation of the AHR and other metabolic  pathways, resulting in a prolonged increase in biotransformation capacity. This  allowed individuals to more efficiently deal with subsequent chemical challenges  for a short period after the initial pre-exposure. However, this induced  tolerance was only short-lived due to the recycling of biotransformation enzymes  in the cells as part of general cellular protein maintenance. These findings  suggest that induced tolerance was likely due to induction of defense mechanisms  during the duration of response to the original stressor, rather than a more  permanent change in their ability to respond to future challenges.

AB  - Data on persistent organochlorines (OCs) in sharks are scarce. Concentrations of OCs such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)  were determined in the muscle tissue of 13 shark species (n=105) collected from  offshore (Indian and Pacific Oceans) and coastal waters of Korea, to investigate  species-specific accumulation of OCs and to assess the potential health risks  associated with consumption of shark meat. Overall OC concentrations were highly  variable not only among species but also within the same species of shark. The  concentrations of PCBs, DDTs, chlordanes, hexachlorobenzene, and heptachlor in  all shark species ranged from <LOQ (limit of quantification) to 184 (mean: 35.0),  <LOQ to 1135 (58.2), <LOQ to 56.2 (4.31), <LOQ to 18.8 (1.64) and <LOQ to 77.5  (1.37)ng/g lipid weight, respectively. The determined concentrations of PCBs and  DDTs in shark in our study were relatively lower than those reported in other  studies. Aggressive shark species and species inhabiting the Indian Ocean had the  highest levels of OCs. Inter-species differences in the concentrations and  accumulation profiles of OCs among shark species could be explained by  differences in feeding habit and sampling locations. Several confounding factors  such as growth velocity, trophic position, and regional contamination status may  affect the bioaccumulation of OCs in sharks. Hazard ratios of non-cancer risk for  all the OCs were below one, whereas the hazard ratios of lifetime cancer risks of  PCBs and DDTs exceeded one, implying potential carcinogenic effects in the  general population in Korea. This is the first report to document the occurrence  of OCs in sharks from Korea.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the ameliorative properties of lycopene against the toxic effects of cypermethrin (CYP) by examining oxidative damage  markers such as lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant defense system components  in carp (Cyprinus carpio). The fish were divided into seven groups of 10 fish  each and received the following treatments: group 1, no treatment; group 2,  orally administered corn oil; group 3, oral lycopene (10 mg/kg body weight);  group 4, exposure to 0.202 μg/L CYP; group 5, exposure to 0.202 μg/L CYP plus  oral administration of 10 mg/kg lycopene; group 6, exposure to 0.404 μg/L CYP;  and group 7, exposure to 0.404 μg/L CYP plus oral administration of 10 mg/kg  lycopene. Treatment was continued for 28 days, and at the end of this period,  blood and tissue (liver, kidney, and gill) samples were collected. Levels of  malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as superoxide  dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities  were determined in blood and tissues for measurement of oxidant-antioxidant  status. MDA level, as an index of lipid peroxidation, increased in blood and  tissues. Antioxidant enzyme activities in blood and tissues were modified in CYP  groups compared with controls. Administration of lycopene ameliorated these  parameters. The present results suggest that administration of lycopene might  alleviate CYP-induced oxidative stress.

AB  - The effects of concentration (5, 50, and 500 microg/L) and duration (24, 48 h) of exposure to carbofuran, a carbamate insecticide, were assessed on brain  catecholamine (norepinephrine [NE] and dopamine), plasma glucose, and hepatic  glycogen contents and behavioral activities of goldfish (Carassius auratus).  After 24 h of exposure to 50 and 500 microg/L, the level of NE was increased in  the olfactory bulbs. The same effect was observed after a 48-h exposure to 500  and 50 microg/L in the telencephalic hemispheres and in the hypothalamus,  respectively. An increase in the level of dopamine was also found in hypothalamus  after 48 h of exposure to 500 microg/L carbofuran. Plasma glucose increased in  concentration after both periods of exposure to carbofuran at 50 and 500  microg/L. Hepatic glycogen concentration decreased after a 48-h exposure to the  highest concentration. Behavioral endpoints related to swimming pattern and  social interactions were affected after a 24-h exposure to the lowest  concentration tested (5 microg/L). The relative sensitivities of these different  types of responses to exposure to carbofuran are discussed in light of data on  the neurotoxic effects of carbamate and organophosphate insecticides in fish.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the toxicity of the aqueous extract of neem leaves, a product extensively used in fish-farms as alternative for the  control of fish parasites and fish fry predators, for the neotropical fish  Prochilodus lineatus. The 24 h LC(50) of neem leaf extract for juveniles P.  lineatus was estimated as 4.8 g L(-1); the fish were then exposed for 24 h to  2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 g L(-1) or only clean water (control). Plasma glucose levels  were higher in fish exposed to 2.5 g L(-1) and 5.0 g L(-1) neem extract, relative  to control, indicating a typical stress response. Neem extract did not interfere  with the osmoregulating capacity of the fish, as their plasma sodium, chloride,  total protein and osmolarity did not change. The presence of the biopesticide  interfered with the antioxidant defense system of P. lineatus, as there was a  decrease in liver catalase activity at all neem concentrations and the  detoxifying enzyme glutathione-S-transferase was activated in fish exposed to 5.0  g L(-1). Fish exposed to all neem extract concentrations exhibited damaged gill  and kidney tissue. These results indicate that although neem extract is less  toxic to P. lineatus than other synthetic insecticides used in fish-farming it  does cause functional and morphological changes in this fish species.

AB  - Immunomodulation is a commonly used method of prophylaxis in humans and animals. Lysozyme dimer (KLP-602) was used at a dose of 50 ug/kg b.w. in order to correct  the immunosuppression caused by the action of herbicide glyphosate (Roundup-  Monsanto), which was used in a single bath for 10 minutes in a concentration of  100 mg/l of water. The investigations were carried out on 2 species of fish: the  carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) and european catfish (Silurus glanis L.). Herbicide  glyphosate caused a decrease in metabolic and phagocytic activity (RBA and PKA)  and in proliferative response stimulated by Con A and LPS in carp and european  catfish. The immunosuppression sustained for about 2 weeks. The results obtained  indicate the possibility of correction of immunosuppression applying lysozyme  dimmer (KLP-602) after use of which, the level of the studied indexes increased.

AB  - Propiconazole (PCZ), a triazole fungicide, is widely present in the aquatic environment, but little is known regarding its chronic toxicity in the fish  brain. This study assessed the effects of long-term exposure to PCZ on the  antioxidant defense system and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity of rainbow trout brain.  Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of PCZ (0.2, 50, and 500 microg/l)  for 7, 20, and 30 days, respectively. Oxidative stress indices (reactive oxygen  species, lipid peroxidation, and carbonyl protein) and antioxidant parameters  (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase,  and reduced glutathione) were measured, as well as Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity.  Adaptive responses to PCZ-induced stress were observed at 7 days. With prolonged  exposure, significantly higher levels of oxidative indices were indicative of  oxidative stress, as also were the significant inhibition of antioxidant enzyme  activity and reduced glutathione content. Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was  significantly inhibited after prolonged exposure. Chemometrics of all parameters  by principal component analysis, enabled the separation of sampled individuals  into four groups with 93.39% of total accumulated variance. A low level of  oxidative stress can induce the adaptive responses of the antioxidant defense  system, while prolonged exposure to PCZ may lead to serious oxidative damage in  fish brain. We suggest that selected biochemical markers in fish brain could be  used as potential biomarkers for monitoring residual fungicides present in the  aquatic environments.

AB  - Triazines are an important group of herbicides, which have been used extensively or selectively both in agricultural and non-agricultural areas worldwide for more  than fifty years to control broadleaf and some grassy weeds. As a consequence of  their massive application, they have become and remain significant environmental  pollutants, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Fish are an integral part of the  aquatic environment and are, therefore, suitable models for the study of the  behavioral, biological, and biochemical effects of triazine exposure. We have  summarized and evaluated the effects of triazine herbicides on fish in order to  provide an overview of current information on triazines. The overall effects of  triazine herbicide exposure on the physiology of fish were evaluated by  considering a variety of parameters in a number of reports. Haematological and  biochemical profiles of blood provide important information about the internal  environment of the organism and the general physiology and health status of  triazine exposed fish. According to studies using biotransformation and  bioaccumulation indices to estimate the effects of triazines on fish, changes in  fish metabolism reflect the pollution of the environment by these herbicides. The  responses of antioxidant defence systems in fish to triazine exposure could be an  adaptive mechanism to protect the fish from triazine-induced oxidative stress.  Acute exposure to triazines affects reproduction or reproductive development in  fish; however, some triazines did not affect fish behavior during long-term  exposure to low concentrations. Nevertheless, an impact on the overall behavioral  response of fish cannot be excluded.

AB  - In this work we have evaluated the potential carcinogenic and acutely toxic risks associated to the exposure to highly prevalent organic and inorganic contaminants  through the consumption of fishery products by the Spanish population. The  concentrations of 8 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 18 polychlorinated  biphenils (PCBs), 7 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (expressed as benzo[a]pyrene  toxic equivalents (B[a]Peq)), and three inorganic toxic elements [arsenic (As),  cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg)] were determined in 93 samples of the most  consumed species of white fish, blue fish, cephalopods and seafood species, which  were acquired directly in markets and supermarkets in the Canary Islands, Spain.  The chemical concentration data were combined with the pattern of consumption of  these foodstuffs in order to calculate the daily intake of these contaminants,  and on this basis the risk quotients for carcinogenicity and acute toxicity were  determined for Spanish adults and children. Our results showed that the daily  intake of OCPs, PCBs and B[a]Peq, which is associated to blue fish consumption  was the highest within the fish group. The estimated intake of pollutants can be  considered low or very low for the individual contaminants, when compared to  reference values, except in the case of HCB and As. All the estimated intakes  were below the reported Tolerable Daily Intakes. Considering the additive effects  of multiple contaminants, the risk of acute toxic effects can also be considered  as low or very low. However, our results reflect that the current consumption of  white fish in adults and children, and also the blue fish in the case of adults,  poses a moderate carcinogenic risk to Spanish consumers, mainly related to their  concentrations of As. The conclusions of this research may be useful for the  design of appropriate risk communication campaigns.

AB  - Monitoring of pesticides based on acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) inhibition in vitro avoids interference of detoxification defenses and  bioactivation of some of those compounds in non-target tissues. Moreover,  environmental temperature, age and stress are able to affect specific enzyme  activities when performing in vivo studies. Few comparative studies have  investigated the inter-specific differences in AChE activity in fish. Screening  studies allow choosing the suitable species as source of AChE to detect  pesticides in a given situation. Brain AChE from the tropical fish: pirarucu  (Arapaima gigas), cobia (Rachycentron canadum) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis  niloticus) were characterized and their activities were assayed in the presence  of pesticides (the organophosphates: dichlorvos, diazinon, chlorpyrifos,  temephos, tetraethyl pyrophosphate- TEPP and the carbamates: carbaryl and  carbofuran). Inhibition parameters (IC₅₀ and Ki) for each species were found and  compared with commercial AChE from electric eel (Electrophorus electricus).  Optimal pH and temperature were found to be 8.0 and 35-45 °C, respectively. A.  gigas AChE retained 81% of the activity after incubation at 50 °C for 30 min. The  electric eel enzyme was more sensitive to the compounds (mainly carbofuran, IC₅₀  of 5 nM), excepting the one from A. gigas (IC₅₀ of 9 nM) under TEPP inhibition.  These results show comparable sensitivity between purified and non-purified  enzymes suggesting them as biomarkers for organophosphorus and carbamate  detection in routine environmental and food monitoring programs for pesticides.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are a class of small noncoding RNAs, can modulate the expression of many protein-coding genes when an organism is exposed to an  environmental chemical. We previously demonstrated that miR-155 was significantly  downregulated in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in response to fipronil  (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl)  sulphinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile) exposure. However, the regulation of this  miRNA's predicted target gene cyb561d2, which is a member of the cytochrome b561  (cyt b561) family involved in electron transfer, cell defence, and chemical  stress, has not been experimentally validated to date. In this study, we  evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR-155 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish. The  expression of miR-155 was downregulated, whereas cyb561d2 was upregulated in both  mRNA and protein level in a dose-dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil.  The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR-155 interacted with  cyb561d2 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR). The expression of cyb561d2 was reduced  in both mRNA and protein levels when ZF4 cells were transfected with an miR-155  mimic, whereas its expression levels of both mRNA and protein were increased when  endogenous miR-155 was inhibited by transfection with an miR-155 inhibitor. The  results improved our understanding of molecular mechanism of toxicity upon  fipronil exposure, and presents miR-155 as a potential novel toxicological  biomarker for chemical exposure. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - CONTEXT: Male infertility is one of the leading causes of social frustration and marginalization, mainly in the developing world. It is attributed to many factors  including exposure to agropesticides such as manganese ethylenebis  (dithiocarbamate) (maneb), which is one of the most frequently used fungicides in  Cameroon. Previous reports support efficiency of some medicinal plants commonly  used in Cameroonian folk medicine for the treatment of this disorder. OBJECTIVE:  The present study was aimed at assessing the protective effect of extracts from  selected plant species, namely Basella alba L. (Basellaceae) (MEBa) and  Carpolobia alba G. Don (Polygalaceae) (AECa), in alleviating the maneb-induced  impairment of male reproductive function in Wistar albino rats. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: The rats were treated with vehicle, plant extract (MEBa or AECa), maneb  and maneb plus plant extract, respectively, and their fertility was assessed.  Animals were thereafter sacrificed and organs (liver, kidneys and reproductive  organs) were dissected out and weighed. Serum androgens together with alanine  aminotransferase, liver glutathione and thiobarbituric acid reactive species  (TBARS) were also measured. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From this study, both plant  extracts stimulated testosterone and improved fertility. Administration of MEBa  plus maneb prevented fertility reduction by maneb and minimized the inhibitory  effect of maneb on testosterone levels. AECa also improved fertility of the  maneb-exposed rats, though without restoring testosterone levels, and other  investigated parameters remained unaffected by different treatments. CONCLUSION:  These findings emphasized the beneficial effects of B. alba and C. alba extracts  on male fertility, and suggest their protective effect against maneb-induced  toxicity in male reproductive function.

AB  - Little is known regarding the impact of penoxsulam, a fluorinated benzenesulfonamid rice herbicide, on Oreochromis niloticus (O. niloticus).  Therefore, the current study was undertaken to highlight the effects of  penoxsulam exposure on O. niloticus and to evaluate the advantages of Chlorella  vulgaris (CV) dietary supplementation against the induced effects. The 96-h  lethal concentration 50 (LC(50)) penoxsulam value for O. niloticus was estimated  at 8.948 mg/L by probit analysis in a static bioassay experiment. Next, 360  healthy fish were randomly allocated into 6 treatment groups. The T1 group served  as the negative control and was fed a basal diet. The T2 group served as the  positive control and was fed a basal diet supplemented with 10% CV. The fish in  the T3 and T4 groups were exposed to 1/10 the 96-h LC(50) of penoxsulam  (0.8948 mg/L) and were fed the basal diet alone or the basal diet supplemented  with 10% CV, respectively. The fish in the T5 and T6 groups were exposed to 1/5  the 96-h LC(50) of penoxsulam (1.7896 mg/L) and fed the basal diet alone or the  basal diet supplemented with 10% CV, respectively. Sub-acute penoxsulam exposure  significantly altered hematological indices, as well as compromised the fish's  immune defense mechanisms, including the phagocytic percentage, phagocytic index,  nitric oxide production, immunoglobulin M levels and lysozyme, anti-trypsin and  bactericidal activities subsequently decreasing O. niloticus's resistance to the  Aeromonus sobria challenge and increasing disease symptoms and the mortality  rate. Furthermore, sub-chronic penoxsulam exposure markedly altered growth  performance, oxidant/antioxidant status and liver status and down-regulated the  expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis-α (TNF-α). Interestingly,  incorporating 10% CV into the diet protects fish against sub-acute  penoxsulam-induced immunotoxicity via improvement of immune responses that  increases the resistance against bacterial infection. Further, it improved the  growth performance, oxidant/antioxidant status, liver status and markedly  up-regulated immune-related gene expression, IL-1β and TNF-α, in the spleens of  fish sub-chronically exposed to penoxsulam. These outcomes showed that dietary CV  supplementation can protect the commercially valuable freshwater fish O.  niloticus against penoxsulam toxicity and may be a potential feed supplement for  Nile tilapia in aquaculture.

T2  - Environmental toxicology and pharmacology
AB  - With the known facts of deltamethrin toxicity in aquaculture, efforts have been made to ameliorate its toxicity with supplementation of Silybum marianum plant  extract in Cyprinus carpio. For validating its efficacy, standard techniques of  histopathology, anti-oxidant profile and RAPD-PCR were used. By performing acute  toxicity bioassay, 96 h LC(50) of the pesticide to C. carpio was determined and  was found to be 2 μg/L. Histopathological alterations were comprised of nuclear  alterations, vacuolisation and oedema in the hepatocytes. Chronic exposure to the  toxicant induced significant changes in antioxidant defense system (CAT, SOD, GSH  and GST levels), lipid peroxidation being prominent. Diet supplementation with  silymarin appeared to modulate the oxidative stress, histopathological  alterations and genotoxic damage caused by the pesticide in the fish. RAPD-PCR  studies revealed deltamethrin induced toxicity and its effective amelioration in  form of restoration of bands which were lost in toxicant exposed DNA profile.

T2  - Neurotoxicology and teratology
AB  - BACKGROUND: Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have grown in usage since concerns about the health effects of the previously used polybrominated flame  retardants led to their being phased out. The potential for OPFRs to cause  adverse health effects of their own is still unexamined. Because of their  structural similarities to organophosphate pesticides, which have themselves been  heavily researched and shown to be neurobehavioral teratogens, we investigated  the possibility that developmental exposure to two OPFRs, triphenyl phosphate  (TPHP), and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) might lead to  behavioral impairment across the lifespan, as has been observed with the  organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos. METHODS: Zebrafish were exposed to 0.03  or 0.3 μM of TPHP, TDCIPP, or chlorpyrifos from 0 to 5 days post fertilization.  Vehicle control consisted of 0.03% solution of DMSO. At 6 days post  fertilization, larvae were tested on a locomotor assay. Separate cohorts of 6 day  old larvae that were not tested on the larval assay were allowed to grow to  adulthood. At 12 weeks post fertilization, these adult zebrafish were tested on a  battery of behavioral assays that included tests of novel environment  exploration, startle habituation, social affiliation, and predator escape.  RESULTS: Developmental exposure altered zebrafish behavior across the lifespan.  Larval zebrafish exposed to the 0.03 μM doses of chlorpyrifos or TDCIPP exhibited  significant (p<0.05) hyperactivity in the locomotor assay. Organophosphate  exposure significantly (p<0.05) altered the time course of adult zebrafish  behavior in the novel environment, startle habituation, and social affiliation  assays. Predator escape behavior was significantly (p<0.05) reduced in fish  exposed to the 0.3 μM dose of TDCIPP. Exposure also caused hyperactivity in adult  fish, with fish exposed to the 0.3 μM dose of TDCIPP exhibiting significantly  (p<0.05) elevated locomotor behavior in the novel environment assay. DISCUSSION:  Early developmental exposure to OPFRs produced behavioral impairment that  persisted into adulthood. These findings support broader research investigating  the role of organophosphate compounds, including the OPFRs used here, in  developmental neurotoxicity.

TI  - Antiandrogenic pesticides disrupt sexual characteristics in the adult male guppy Poecilia reticulata.
AU  - Baatrup, E.

T2  - Environmental health perspectives
AB  - Environmental contaminants have been identified as endocrine disruptors through their antiandrogenic activity. Thus, as androgen receptor antagonists, the  fungicide vinclozolin and the principal DDT metabolite p,p'-DDE have been  demonstrated to induce demasculinization in rats. Whether this is also the case  in fish remains to be demonstrated. For a period of 30 days, groups of adult male  guppies were exposed to vinclozolin, p,p'-DDE, or the therapeutic antiandrogen  flutamide (used as positive control) applied to the fodder at concentrations  between 0.1 and 100 microg/g fodder. Subsequently, sexual characteristics of  relevance to the male reproductive capacity were measured and compared with  untreated control fish. All three chemicals caused profound alterations at  increasing levels of biological organization, even in these fully matured males.  At the cellular level, the three compounds induced a significant reduction in the  number of ejaculated sperm cells. At the organ level, the sexually attractive  orange-yellow coloration was reduced in area and discolored, and treated fish  also had smaller testes. Further, at the organismal level, computer-aided  behavior analyses demonstrated a severe disruption in male courtship behavior. We  conclude that this demasculinization is consistent with an antiandrogenic action  of vinclozolin and p,p'-DDE and is likely to compromise reproductive capability  in this fish.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of pesticide Fury 10 EW, containing zeta-cypermethrin 100 g.l-1, on common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.).  DESIGN: The toxicity tests were performed on common carp according to OECD 203  methodologies. The common carp were exposed to Fury 10 EW at concentrations, 5,  7, 10, 50 and 100 μg.l-1 for 96 h and compared to common carp in a non-treated  control group. Acute toxicity tests were detected value 96hLC50=13.8 µg.l-1. On  the basis of the results was assessed the effect on the hematological profile,  oxidative stress parameters, and antioxidants biomarkers in tissues, in another  acute test. RESULTS: The observed 96hLC50 value of Fury 10 EW was 13.8 μg.l-1. A  significantly lower large lymphocyte and monocyte count, and a significantly  greater number of segmented eosinophil granulocyte and higher hematocrit was  found in the pesticide-exposed common carp compared to controls. Oxidative damage  was not detected in the experimental common carp, however there were significant  differences from control in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and  glutathione reductase (GR) in tissue after acute exposure to 13.8 μg.l-1 Fury 10  EW. CONCLUSIONS: Zeta-cypermethrin as Fury 10 EW was classified as a substance  highly toxic to fish. The hematological profile well oxidative stress parameters  and antioxidant defensive systems provide important information about the  internal environment of organisms. There is a lack of experimental results about  the effects of zeta-cypermethrin on fish in the literature.

T2  - Evolutionary applications
AB  - Pests often evolve resistance to pest controls used in agriculture and aquaculture. The rate of pest adaptation is influenced by the type of control,  the selective pressure it imposes, and the gene flow between farms. By  understanding how these factors influence evolution at the metapopulation level,  pest management strategies that prevent resistance from evolving can be  developed. We developed a model for the metapopulation and evolutionary dynamics  of the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which is a major parasite  affecting salmon aquaculture. Different management scenarios were simulated  across a network of salmon farms covering half of Norway, and their effects on  louse epidemiology and evolution were investigated. We compared louse controls  that differed in how they were deployed through time (discrete vs. continuous),  how they impacted the louse life cycle, and in their overall efficacy. We  adjusted the strength of selection imposed by treatments, the dominance effect of  the resistant allele, and the geographic location at which resistance originated.  Continuously acting strategies (e.g., louse-resistant salmon) were generally more  effective than discrete strategies at controlling lice, especially when they  increased louse mortality during early developmental stages. However, effective  strategies also risked imposing frequent and/or strong selection on lice, thus  driving rapid adaptation. Resistant alleles were more likely to be lost through  genetic drift when they were recessive, had a low-fitness advantage, or  originated in low-farm-density areas. The north-flowing current along the  Norwegian coastline dispersed resistant genes from south to north, and limited  gene flow in the opposite direction. We demonstrate how evolutionary models can  produce quantitative predictions over large spatial and temporal scales and for a  range of pest control scenarios. Quantitative outputs can be translated into  practical management decisions applied at a regional level to minimise the risk  of resistance developing.

AB  - The effects of exposure to the widely used herbicide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), at environmentally permitted (1 mg L(-1)), slightly toxic (10 mg  L(-1)), and highly toxic (100 mg L(-1)) concentrations were analyzed in gills of  goldfish, Carassius auratus, a popular fish model for ecotoxicological research.  Fish were exposed to the pesticide in water for 96 h and an additional group of  fish were treated by the highest 2,4-D concentration and then allowed to recover  for further 96 h. Among markers of oxidative stress, goldfish exposure to 2,4-D  did not affect carbonyl protein levels in the gills, but fish exposure to 100 mg  L(-1) of 2,4-D enhanced lipid peroxide concentrations (by 58 %) and oxidized  glutathione levels (by 49 %), the latter also significantly increasing (by 33 %)  oxidized/total glutathione ratio. Activities of three enzymes of antioxidant  defence also increased under 2,4-D exposure: superoxide dismutase (by 29-35 %),  catalase (by 41 %), and glutathione peroxidase (by 19-33 %). Activities of other  antioxidant associated enzymes as well as other potential markers of stress (e.g.  aminotransferase enzymes, acetylcholinesterase, lactate metabolism) showed little  or no response in gills to 2,4-D exposure. However, virtually all affected  parameters returned to control values during recovery period. A combination of  selected indices of oxidative stress and antioxidant defence, measured in fish  gills, may provide to be effective biomarkers to assess environmental hazards of  2,4-D to freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Ultrastructural and histopathological reponses in the organs of living organisms are important and useful tools to determine the health condition and the effects  of pollutants, such as pesticides, on the organisms. The aim of this study is to  determine possible histopathological, cytopathological and ultrastructural  alterations in gills of Oreochromis niloticus individuals exposed to 850 μg/L  carbaryl standart at 7th, 14th and 21st days with light and electron microscopes.  The fish were exposed to carbaryl for 21 days and the histopatological,  ultrastructural and cytopathological alterations occuring in the gill tissues of  organisms were determined by light, Scanning and Transmission Electron  Microscopes (SEM and TEM). At the end of the study, it was observed that carbaryl  caused both histopathological and cytopathological changes in the gills of O.  niloticus. It has been determined that the most of the pathological changes in  the exposed organisms are the metabolic defence reactions.

AB  - Until 2012, the genus Edwardsiella was composed by three species Edwardsiella tarda, Edwardsiella hoshinae and Edwardsiella ictaluri. In 2013, Edwardsiella  piscicida, compiling fish pathogenic strains previously identified as E. tarda  was described, and more recently a new species isolated from diseased eel was  reported, namely Edwardsiella anguillarum. The incorporation of these species  into the genus makes necessary a revision of the taxonomic position of the  isolates previously identified as E. tarda. Using AFLP technique, MLSA studies  and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization, 46 of 49 E. tarda isolates were re-assigned  as E. piscicida and 2 as E. anguillarum, whereas it was confirmed previous  classification of the Edwardsiella types and reference strains used. The study of  the taxonomic resolution of the genes 16S rRNA, adk, atpD, dnaJ, glnA, hsp60, tuf  as well as the possible combinations among housekeeping genes, showed that the  gene dnaJ was the more resolutive. In conclusion, the use of molecular techniques  is necessary to accurately identify Edwardsiella isolates, especially when  differentiating new species from E. tarda.

AB  - Molecularly imprinted silica layers appended to quantum dots (MIP-QDs) with customized selective artificial recognition sites were fabricated in this study  by optimizing the ratio of the functional monomer to the template. Scanning  electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer–emmett–teller,  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and selectivity assay analyses were also  performed. Results demonstrated that the selective fluorescence quenching  properties of MIP-QDs toward cypermethrin (CYP) are due to strong interactions  between these molecules. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-like method  based on the MIP-QDs was established under optimal conditions. The fluorescence  quenching observed from this method showed a linear relationship with CYP  concentration over the range of 0.05–60.0 mg/kg with a correlation coefficient of  0.9838. Good recovery (82.7–92.4%) and a relative standard deviation of less than  10.1% were obtained from fish samples spiked with three levels of CYP. This  method also demonstrated a low detection limit of 1.2 μg/kg. The ELISA-like  method based on MIP-QDs can be successfully employed to detect residual of CYP in  fish samples.

AB  - Serum amyloid A (SAA) predominantly synthesized by hepatocytes is a classical acute phase protein and has been extensively studied in mammals. However, the  studies on the structure and properties of fish SAA are limited although SAA  genes have been cloned and identified from various fishes. In the present study,  a cDNA of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) SAA (gcSAA) was cloned and  characterized, displaying a high homology with its counterparts in vertebrates.  gcSAA mRNA was expressed with highest abundance in the liver and its levels were  increased by a 24-hour infection of Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) for more  than 5 folds in the intestine, 15 folds in the spleen, 75 folds in the head  kidney and 100 folds in the liver, implying that it is an acute phase protein in  grass carp. Subsequently, recombinant gcSAA protein (rgcSAA) was prepared from a  prokaryotic expression system after codon optimization of its coding sequence.  The direct antibacterial activity assay and the plate count assay disclosed that  gcSAA inhibited the growth and survival of A. hydrophila but not Edwardsiella  piscicida (E. piscicida) which both are common bacterial pathogens in  aquaculture. The propidium iodide (PI) uptake assay confirmed the bactericidal  property of gcSAA, showing that it is able to enhance the uptake of PI in A.  hydrophila but not E. piscicida. These findings revealed the molecular features  of gcSAA and its roles in host defense against bacterial infection.

AB  - Jundiá (Rhamdia quelen, Quoy and Gaimard), a South American teleostean fish, was exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of cypermethrin (30% and 45% of the 48-h  LC(50) value of 0.265 ppm) for 2, 4 or 8 days. Serum biochemical and  hematological values and behavioral changes were studied. The 30% LC(50), 0.08  ppm, produced significant increases in Mg(2+), P, K(+), creatinine, urea,  glucose, cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels,  and reduction in total proteins and triglycerides in serum. The 45% LC(50), 0.12  ppm, produced significant increase in Na(+), Mg(2+), P, K(+), creatinine, urea,  glucose, cholesterol, and alkaline phosphatase, and reduction in triglycerides  and alanine aminotransferase levels in serum. At this concentration, the fish  showed behavior changes such as hyper-excitability, asphyxia, and widening of  mouth and operculum. The hematological values remained normal, except for  hemoglobin concentrations and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration,  which increased with exposure to 0.08 ppm and 0.12 ppm cypermethrin. Results of  the present work show that biochemical analysis of serum can be useful to detect  incipient cypermethrin intoxication of the shoal.

AB  - The behavioral effects of short periods (2, 4, 6, 8 h) of static exposure to prochloraz (imidazole fungicide) and nicosulfuron (sulfonylurea herbicide) were  recorded in goldfish (Carassius auratus). Observations were also made in an  olfactometer to assess the effects of 8-h exposures to these two pesticides and  to carbofuran (carbamate insecticide) on the behavioral responses to the flow of  a solution of four L-amino acids (glycine, alanine, valine, taurine), mixed in  the same relative proportions as in the urine of conspecifics. Each pesticide was  tested at three sublethal concentrations (25, 50, 100 microg/L), and the  behaviors recorded were related to swimming pattern, social interactions, and  comfort movements. Static exposures to prochloraz affected horizontal  displacements, burst swimming, grouping, and buccal movements. Static exposures  to nicosulfuron affected burst swimming and grouping. In pesticide-unexposed fish  (control), the flow of the amino acid solution induced attraction, decreased  sheltering, and increased horizontal displacements, burst swimming, buccal  movements, and antagonistic interactions. Compared to the controls, some of the  behavioral responses to the solution of amino acids were significantly different  after 8 h of subacute exposure to prochloraz and carbofuran. Both pesticides  decreased attraction and increased sheltering. In addition, carbofuran decreased  buccal movements and antagonistic interactions. Contrastingly, exposure to  nicosulfuron showed no significant effect. This study further confirms the great  vulnerability of fish behavior and chemocommunication processes to exposure to  waterborne pesticides.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In the present study, an attempt was made to find reasons of ineffectiveness of indoor residual spray to interrupt malaria  transmission by investigating the behaviour of two variants of Anopheles  stepnesi, viz. type form and mysorensis in rural areas of Rajasthan, India.  METHODS: Both low malarious (DDT spray from 1958 to 1976) and high malarious (DDT  spray from 1958 to April 2006) villages were selected for the study in Arid zone  district Jodhpur, Rajasthan during March-April 2006. Resting behaviour of the  species during all its movement rhythms covering 24 h period related to: (i)  swarming/ mating; (ii) pre- and post-biting rest; (iii) after feed resting  between hoping movements; (iv) night and day time resting and; (v) diel activity  movements in response to temperature changes, were carried out. RESULTS: The  results showed that household objects like cupboards, furnitures, hanging  clothes, goods stacked on loft, stored clothes, cobwebs and floor were the  dominant resting sites both in sprayed and unsprayed villages. About 95 and 97%  of An. stephensi preferred to rest on household objects of unsprayed and sprayed  villages respectively. There was no significant difference in resting behaviour  of the species in both groups of villages (p >0.05). The pre-biting resting time  was recorded as 5 to 15 min whereas post-biting resting time lasted for 15 to 25  min. After biting outdoor (in courtyard--open to sky) species starts entering the  rooms at around 2330 hrs. It was observed that during III quarter (0100 to 0400  hrs) maximum species entered into the room were 56% in unsprayed and 62% in  sprayed villages. Statistically there was no significant difference in the entry  of mosquitoes (p >0.05) in both the groups of villages. CONCLUSION: Before DDT  era, An. stephensi was found resting at all heights of the walls inside the human  dwellings. Present study revealed that An. stephensi is trying to avoid sprayable  surfaces and tend to rest on unsprayable surfaces during all its movement rhythms  starting from swarming, pre-/post-biting and during hopping movements in the  courtyard and thereafter household objects inside the room as final day time  resting. It was concluded that changed behaviour of resting of An. stephensi on  unsprayable objects in sprayed rooms largely accounted for failure of malaria  control. Control of An. stephensi, thus requires an integrated vector control  strategy based upon interesectoral, environmental, larviciding with  chemical/biolarvicide and use of larvivorous fish wherever feasible. Such a  control strategy offers cost-effective and sustainable option than indoor  residual spray.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are known to play a role as a first line of defence against microbial invasion. Liver Expressed Antimicrobial Peptides-2 (LEAP-2) is  one of the AMPs. LEAP-2 includes four highly conserved cysteine residues and  belongs to a cysteine-rich peptides group. We identified and characterized the  molecular properties of LEAP-2 in rock bream. The expression levels of rock bream  LEAP-2 (RbLEAP-2) in the 12 different tissues of healthy fish and the RbLEAP-2  expression pattern after infections with Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida),  Streptococcus iniae (S. iniae) and red seabream iridovirus (RSIV) were examined.  This data provide that RbLEAP-2 plays an important role in innate immunity when  rock bream is infected with a pathogen.

AB  - Specimens of two endemic cyprinids, Squalius laietanus (Catalan chub) and Barbus meridionalis (Mediterranean barbel), were sampled from a reference site in a  small stream of the Ripoll River (NW Mediterranean) outside of their reproductive  season. Biomarkers involved in xenobiotic-mediated responses were individually  contrasted in fish of both species and 17 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)  analysed in muscle to reveal bioaccumulation trends. The parameters were in  muscle: cholinesterases, metabolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and citrate  synthase (CS); and in liver: cytochrome P450 dependent activities (EROD and  BFCOD), carboxylesterase (CE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione  reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT). All markers are  considered adaptive defence mechanism to face stress. Sensitivity to a model  pesticide: dichlorvos was also contrasted in vitro in muscular  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and hepatic CE to reveal species sensitivity to  neurotoxic chemicals. Enzymatic activities related to protective mechanisms such  as butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), CE and CAT were higher in chub whereas the  antioxidant defences GR and GPX were higher in barbel. Aerobic CS was also higher  in barbel while anaerobic LDH was so in chub. EROD activity did not differ  between the two species but BFCOD activity was higher in barbel. Levels of PFAS  were higher in barbel likely due to its benthic habitat. The in vitro tests  revealed higher sensitivity to dichlorvos of muscular AChE in chub (lower IC50)  which was probably compensated by a higher catalytic efficiency of CE. All these  former biochemical particularities are discussed in terms of fish ecological  performance in front of anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - Paraquat (PQ) administration consists in a chemical model that mimics phenotypes observed in Parkinson's disease (PD), due to its ability to induce changes in  dopaminergic system and oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate  the actions of PQ in behavioral functions of adult zebrafish and its influence on  oxidative stress biomarkers in brain samples. PQ (20 mg/kg) was administered  intraperitoneally with six injections for 16 days (one injection every 3 days).  PQ-treated group showed a significant decrease in the time spent in the bottom  section and a shorter latency to enter the top area in the novel tank test.  Moreover, PQ-exposed fish showed a significant decrease in the number and  duration of risk assessment episodes in the light-dark test, as well as an  increase in the agonistic behavior in the mirror-induced aggression (MIA) test.  PQ induced brain damage by decreasing mitochondrial viability. Concerning the  antioxidant defense system, PQ increased catalase (CAT) and glutathione  peroxidase (GPx) activities, as well as the non-protein sulfhydryl content  (NPSH), but did not change ROS formation and decreased lipid peroxidation. We  demonstrate, for the first time, that PQ induces an increase in aggressive  behavior, alters non-motor patterns associated to defensive behaviors, and  changes redox parameters in zebrafish brain. Overall, our findings may serve as  useful tools to investigate the interaction between behavioral and neurochemical  impairments triggered by PQ administration in zebrafish.

T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - The present study examined the impacts of carbofuran on endocrinology of the catfish, Clarias gariepinus, for the first time and evaluated cortisol (CRT),  triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), 17β-estradiol (E2) and testosterone (TST)  and the oxidative stress markers including SOD, CAT, GSTs, GSH. The toxic effects  on the metabolic enzymes, G6PDH and LDH, in addition to lipid peroxidation (LPO)  and DNA damage as biomarkers in Nile catfish, to sublethal exposures of  carbofuran (0.16 and 0.49mg/L, for 35 days) were studied. Statistically  significant differences between selected parameters between control and  carbofuran-treated fish were recorded. Carbofuran caused a significant (p<0.05)  increase in CRT and T3 levels; the mean levels of T4, TST, E2 exhibited  significant decreases (p<0.05) in carbofuran-treated fish. Toxicity of carbofuran  on liver, kidney, gills, gonads and muscles after 35 days of exposure was found.  Glycogen levels showed a highly significant decrease in liver and gills (p<  0.001), a significant decrease (p< 0.05) in kidney and muscles, and insignificant  changes (p>0.05) in gonads of treated fish. The two metabolic enzymes G6PDH and  LDH in all tissues exhibited significant decreases (p<0.05) in treated fish. SOD,  CAT, GSH and GST levels showed significant decreases (p<0.05) in all tissues of  fish after exposure to carbofuran. LPO levels increased significantly (p<0.05) in  all tissues except gonads after 5 weeks of exposure to carbofuran. There was a  significant (p<0.05) increase in DNA fragmentation percentage in treated fish.  Our results provide a clear evidence on the response of C. gariepinus to  sublethal doses of carbofuran and allow us to consider catfish as a good  bioindicator to reflect the endocrine disrupting impacts of carbofuran, and  reflect the potential of this pesticide to cause disturbance in antioxidant  defense system as well as metabolism and induction of lipid peroxidation (LPO)  and DNA damage in contaminated ecosystems.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - Thiamethoxam (THM) is a commercial neonicotinoid insecticide with broad-spectrum insecticidal activity. It has been widely detected in the aquatic environment,  but its behavioral toxicity on aquatic organisms received limited attention. In  this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to THM at three levels (0.1, 10, and  1000 μg/L) for 45 days to investigate its effect on their ecological behavior,  histopathology, bioaccumulation, and stress response. The bioconcentration factor  in zebrafish brain was significantly higher (p < 0.05) at low concentration of  THM (0.1 μg/L) than in other treatment groups. In terms of individual behavior,  the locomotor activity, aggregation, and social activity of fish were enhanced  after THM exposure, but the memory of the food zone was disturbed and abnormal  swimming behavior was observed. THM exposure caused brain tissue necrosis,  erythrocyte infiltration, cloudy swelling, and other pathological changes in  brain tissue and affected the concentrations of acetylcholinesterase and cortisol  related to neurotoxicity. The condition factor and organ coefficients (brain,  heart, and intestine) of zebrafish were markedly impacted by THM treatment at 0.1  and 1000 μg/L, respectively. This finding showed that THM was more harmful to  fish behavior than lethality, reproduction, and growth, and a behavioral study  can be a useful tool for ecological risk assessment.

AB  - Coral and rocky reef fish populations are widely used as model systems for the experimental exploration of density-dependent vital rates, but patterns of  density-dependent mortality in these systems are not yet fully understood. In  particular, the paradigm for strong, directly density-dependent (DDD)  postsettlement mortality stands in contrast to recent evidence for inversely  density-dependent (IDD) mortality. We review the processes responsible for DDD  and IDD per capita mortality in reef fishes, noting that the pattern observed  depends on predator and prey behavior, the spatial configuration of the reef  habitat, and the spatial and temporal scales of observation. Specifically,  predators tend to produce DDD prey mortality at their characteristic spatial  scale of foraging, but prey mortality is IDD at smaller spatial scales due to  attack-abatement effects (e.g., risk dilution). As a result, DDD mortality may be  more common than IDD mortality on patch reefs, which tend to constrain predator  foraging to the same scale as prey aggregation, eliminating attack-abatement  effects. Additionally, adjacent groups of prey on continuous reefs may share a  subset of refuges, increasing per capita refuge availability and relaxing DDD  mortality relative to prey on patch reefs, where the patch edge could prevent  such refuge sharing. These hypotheses lead to a synthetic framework to predict  expected mortality patterns for a variety of scenarios. For nonsocial,  nonaggregating species and species that aggregate in order to take advantage of  spatially clumped refuges, IDD mortality is possible but likely superseded by DDD  refuge competition, especially on patch reefs. By contrast, for species that  aggregate socially, mortality should be IDD at the scale of individual  aggregations but DDD at larger scales. The results of nearly all prior reef fish  studies fit within this framework, although additional work is needed to test  many of the predicted outcomes. This synthesis reconciles some apparent  contradictions in the recent reef fish literature and suggests the importance of  accounting for the scale-sensitive details of predator and prey behavior in any  study system.

AB  - Pyrethroids prallethrin (P-BI) and transfluthrin (T-BI) are among the most commonly used molecules with insecticide action. These molecules comprise  different formulations of insecticides largely used in household, agricultural,  and animal production fields. However, the increased use of these molecules has  led to concerns regarding their safety in animals and humans. Oxidative stress  (OS) is believed to be easily established by xenobiotic contacts, such as  pyrethroids. We aimed to evaluate and understand the impact of two household  insecticides and two doses applied to different tissues of the antioxidant system  of zebrafish (Danio rerio). We observed that the effect on the antioxidant system  differed between tissues. The muscle was the most affected tissue in the body,  the antioxidant enzymes were activated, and a mechanism of non-enzymatic  antioxidants was activated; however, it could still cause cellular damage. The  observed effect on muscle may be related to the progression of neurodegenerative  conditions. In addition, in the brain, these compounds can inactivate the first  line of enzymatic antioxidant defense, which is compensated for by the second  line, avoiding cellular damage. Ultimately, the gill tissue did not appear to  suffer lipid damage, but heme group formation was largely affected by the  compounds.

In some groups, the  effects of alpha-permethrin on non-specific defences and serum enzymes of carp  were investigated after challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila. Several nonspecific  immune responses and serum enzymes were reduced after exposure of  alpha-permethrin. Bactericidal activity of rohu serum was reduced significantly  in pesticide and bacteria treated fish. The Glutamic Oxaloacetate Transaminase  (GOT) and Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (GPT) activity were increased in  immunosuppressed fish. Blood glucose level was elevated significantly and Hb% was  reduced significantly in pesticide and bacteria treated fishes as compared to the  negative control.

AB  - The world's oceans are a global reservoir of persistent organic pollutants to which humans and other animals are exposed. Although it is well known that these  pollutants are potentially hazardous to human and environmental health, their  impacts remain incompletely understood. We examined how persistent organic  pollutants interact with the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an  evolutionarily conserved defense protein that is essential for protection against  environmental toxicants. We identified specific congeners of organochlorine  pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers that  inhibit mouse and human P-gp, and determined their environmental levels in  yellowfin tuna from the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we solved the cocrystal  structure of P-gp bound to one of these inhibitory pollutants, PBDE  (polybrominated diphenyl ether)-100, providing the first view of pollutant  binding to a drug transporter. The results demonstrate the potential for specific  binding and inhibition of mammalian P-gp by ubiquitous congeners of persistent  organic pollutants present in fish and other foods, and argue for further  consideration of transporter inhibition in the assessment of the risk of exposure  to these chemicals.

AB  - In this study, we report the antioxidant and antitoxic potential of chemically synthesized 4-oxo-2-phenyl-4H-chromene-7,8-diyl  bis((1-amino-2-hydroxypropyl)carbamate) (DHF-BAHPC) compound using in vitro and  in vivo assays. The DHF-BAHPC was synthesized by linking 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone  (DHF) with two molecules of Fmoc-threonine and characterized by  Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), Fourier-transform infrared  spectroscopy (FT-IR), (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and Mass spectrometry (MS). In vitro,  antioxidant assay results revealed that DHF-BAHPC has a dose-dependent radical  scavenging potential towards DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and H(2)O(2) radicals with an  IC(50) range of 15.45, 66.27, 25.71, 4.375 μg/mL, respectively. Furthermore  DHF-BAHPC treatment significantly altered cadmium (Cd) intoxicated zebrafish  embryos by rescuing the developmental changes associated with severe histological  and reduced the level of defensive antioxidant activities (SOD, CAT, GPx and  GST). The overall results of the present study represented that DHF-BAHPC may be  used as a potential drug in redox-based therapeutics.

AB  - The effects of chemicals on biotic interactions, such as competition and predation, have rarely been investigated in aquatic ecotoxicology. This study  presents a new approach for the investigation of predator-prey interactions  between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) impaired  by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic insecticide. With a simple experimental  design including four different treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed,  (3) prey exposed and (4) both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect  by visual observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on  exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 μg/l CHP. Previously, a  decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid larvae was observed.  However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both predators and prey, no significant  differences in the feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. This suggests an  impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP  concentration (1 μg/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were  observed. We therefore propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in  higher tier studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk  assessment.

T2  - Environmental research
AB  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) produce changes in physiology and behavior via diverse mechanisms including acting as hormone mimics or antagonists,  affecting intracellular signaling pathways, and altering hormone production  pathways. The fungicide vinclozolin acts as an anti-androgen and is known to  affect affiliative behaviors in rodents, fish and amphibians. To investigate the  possible effects of exposure to EDCs on reproductive behavior in a wild  population of songbirds, we examined the effects of vinclozolin in wild-caught  Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis). For this and many other temperate songbird  species, testosterone has powerful activational effects on affiliative behaviors  in adulthood. We hypothesized that vinclozolin would affect male behaviors  associated with female preference. Male juncos received daily oral gavage for 10  weeks with 2mM vinclozolin in vehicle or vehicle alone. Juncos were  photostimulated (16L:8D) to induce breeding behavior. Each pair of a treated and  non-treated male was presented to an estrogen-primed female to assess female  preference. Seven of eight females exhibited a strong preference for a male  exposed to vinclozolin over a control male (p=0.01). The only significant  difference in measured male behaviors was increased beak wiping in controls  (p=0.006) and there was no difference in gonad size or brain weight (p>0.05 for  each). Our data suggest that estrogen-primed female juncos prefer to associate  with male juncos exposed to this anti-androgen. This finding demonstrates that  environmentally occurring anti-androgens can affect the social behavior of this  species. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that vinclozolin has  effects on the social behavior of songbirds.

TI  - Environmentally realistic exposure to the herbicide atrazine alters some sexually selected traits in male guppies.
AU  - Shenoy, Kausalya
T2  - PloS one
AB  - Male mating signals, including ornaments and courtship displays, and other sexually selected traits, like male-male aggression, are largely controlled by  sex hormones. Environmental pollutants, notably endocrine disrupting compounds,  can interfere with the proper functioning of hormones, thereby impacting the  expression of hormonally regulated traits. Atrazine, one of the most widely used  herbicides, can alter sex hormone levels in exposed animals. I tested the effects  of environmentally relevant atrazine exposures on mating signals and behaviors in  male guppies, a sexually dimorphic freshwater fish. Prolonged atrazine exposure  reduced the expression of two honest signals: the area of orange spots  (ornaments) and the number of courtship displays performed. Atrazine exposure  also reduced aggression towards competing males in the context of mate  competition. In the wild, exposure levels vary among individuals because of  differential distribution of the pollutants across habitats; hence, differently  impacted males often compete for the same mates. Disrupted mating signals can  reduce reproductive success as females avoid mating with perceptibly suboptimal  males. Less aggressive males are at a competitive disadvantage and lose access to  females. This study highlights the effects of atrazine on ecologically relevant  mating signals and behaviors in exposed wildlife. Altered reproductive traits  have important implications for population dynamics, evolutionary patterns, and  conservation of wildlife species.

AB  - Effects of the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin (LCH) were investigated in matrinxa Brycon amazonicus, a non-target freshwater teleost. The fish were submitted to a  single-pulse exposure (10% of LC50; 96 h, 0.65 μg L(-1)), followed by 7 days of  recovery in clean water. Hematologic parameters indicated impairments in oxygen  transport, which were not recovered. Plasma [Na(+)], [Cl(-)], and protein were  diminished, and only [Na(+)] remained low after recovery. Gill Na(+)/K(+)ATPase  activity was increased and recovered to basal values. Brain acetylcholinesterase  activity was not responsive to LCH. Liver ascorbic acid concentration was not  altered, and reduced glutathione levels remained augmented even after recovery.  LCH inhibited hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione  peroxidase (GPx) activities, while glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activities were steady. After recovery,  SOD remained low, and GPx was augmented. Liver depicted lipid peroxidation, which  was not observed after recovery. Hepatic morphology was affected by LCH and was  not completely recovered. These responses, combined with the persistence of  changes even after recovery span, clearly show the feasibility of these  biomarkers in evaluating LCH toxic potential to non-target organisms,  highlighting the importance of pyrethroids' responsible use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypospadias represents the most frequent male congenital malformation in children, with a prevalence of 1 in 200-300 new born or 4-6 in 1000 male new  born. Genetic and environmental factors play a strong role on developing this  virilization defect acting as endocrinal disruptors (ED). The objective of the  present study was to evaluate the environmental factors that may have influenced  the development oh hypospadias in children treated at the Maternal and Child  University Hospital od Las Palmas of Gran Canaria Island during the years  2012-2015. METHODS: The present study represents a retrospective analysis of  patients treated for hypospadias in the Maternal-Paediatric University Hospital  of Las Palmas of Gran Canaria during 4 years (2012 -2015) by the use of medical  records and telephone survey to families' patients. To perform the statistical  analysis of the data, the SPSS program was used in version 15.0. The level of  statistical significance was established for an error α = 0.05. The chi-square  test and Fisher's correction were applied if necessary to test the associations  between the qualitative variables. RESULTS: From 2012 to 2015, 128 patients were  treated; we could only follow 116 patients. If we analyse patients' distribution  throught those years we can resume that 33% of them were treated in 2012, 23% in  2013, 24% in 2014 and 20% in 2015. We analyse the study background of both  parents: 45.5% of mothers had primary studies, 37.5% had secundary studies, 15.2%  had university studies and 1.8% were students; 54.3% of fathers had primary  studies, 32.4% had secundary studies and 13.3% had university studies. We did not  found any statistically significant diference between the place of residence and  the study background both in mothers (p=0,262) and fathers (p=0,052). Within all  the patients followed, 78 had a clinical history of exposition to ED as a direct  family background. CONCLUSIONS: The chronical exposure to ED, very frequent in  our society, is a very important risk factor in the development of urologic  pathologies as hypospadias; for this reason, awareness measures and prevention in  social areas and workplace must be carried out to avoid unnecessary exposures.

AB  - Declines in 6 organochlorine (OC) contaminant groups; chlordane (CHL), DDT, HCH, toxaphene (CHB), PCB and chlorinated benzenes (CBz) were measured in biota of a  sub-Arctic lake (Lake Laberge, YT) following the closure of a commercial fishery  in 1991. This study examined morphological (length, weight, age), biochemical  (lipid content, δ(13)C, δ(15)N), population and OC data for 9 fishes and  zooplankton between 1993 and 2003 (2010 for lake trout) to investigate causes for  the OC declines. Growth dilution was a major factor influencing the decrease of  OCs in lake trout, round whitefish and possibly zooplankton most notably in the  early 2000s. A decline in lipids of most fish species also contributed to OC  declines, although no such change was evident for zooplankton. It is suspected  that increases in fish populations or climate variations over the 1990s, may have  contributed towards a shift in plankton community composition. From 1991 to 1999,  CPUE increased for 7 of the fish species and declined for 2 others. Concurrently,  the zooplankton community shifted from an abundance of C. scutifer in 1993 to  dominance by D. pribilofensis in 2001. Nitrogen and carbon stable isotope data  suggested that food web interactions for most fish species have not changed over  time. Although concentrations of OCs have declined in many fishes, the "rate" of  OC transfer (using slopes of log OC vs. nitrogen isotope ratios) through the food  web was greater in 2001 than in 1993. Overall, the declines in OC concentrations  in the fish from Lake Laberge occurred concurrently with changes in their growth,  lipid, and abundance, suggesting that ecosystem responses to the closure of the  fishery were in part responsible for the lower contaminants in these fishes. As a  result of this study, the Yukon government rescinded the health advisory for  limiting the consumption of fish from Lake Laberge.

AB  - Lambda-cyhalothrin (LC), a pyrethroid insecticide widely used in agriculture, causes immunotoxicity to aquatic organisms in the aquatic environment. Microalgal  astaxanthin (MA) is a natural carotenoid that enhances viability of a variety of  fish. To investigate the immunotoxicity of LC and the improvement effect of MA in  lymphocytes (Cyprinus carpio), lymphocytes were treated with LC (80 M) and/or MA  (50 M) for 24 h. Firstly, CCK8 combined with PI staining results showed that MA  significantly attenuated the LC-induced lymphocyte death rate. Secondly, LC  exposure resulted in excessively damaged mitochondrial and mtROS, diminished  mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, which could be improved by MA.  Thirdly, MA upregulated the levels of mitophagy-related regulatory factors  (Beclin1, LC3, ATG5, Tom20 and Lamp2) induced by LC. Importantly, MA decreased  the levels of pyroptosis-related genes treated with LC, including NLRP3, Cas-4,  GSDMD and active Cas-1. Further study indicated that LC treatment caused  excessive miRNA-194-5p and reduced levels of FoxO1, PINK1 and Parkin, which was  inhibited by MA treatment. Overall, we concluded that MA could enhance damaged  mitochondrial elimination by promoting the  miRNA-194-5p-FoxO1-PINK1/Parkin-mitophagy in lymphocytes, which reduced mtROS  accumulation and alleviated pyroptosis. It offers insights into the importance of  MA application in aquaculture as well as the defense of farmed fish against  agrobiological hazards in fish under LC.

AB  - Edwardsiella tarda (ET) and Edwardsiella anguillarum (EA) are the most harmful bacterial fish pathogens in Taiwan. However, there is confusion regarding the  genotypic identification of E. tarda and E. piscicida (EP). Therefore, we used a  novel Nanopore MinION MK1C platform to sequence and compare the complete genomes  of E. piscicida and E. anguillarum. The number of coding genes, rRNA, and tRNA  recorded for E. anguillarum and E. piscicida were 8322, 25, and 98, and 5458, 25,  and 98, respectively. Ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST) for  E. piscicida indicated 35 rps. The shared clusters between E. anguillarum and  E. piscicida indicated several unique clusters for the individual genomes. The  phylogenetic tree analysis for all complete genomes indicated that E. anguillarum  and E. piscicida were placed into two species-specific genotypes. Distribution of  subsystems for annotated genomes found that genes related to virulence, defence,  and disease for E. anguillarum were 103 and those for E. piscicida were 60 and  pathogenic islands (PI) were 498 and 225, respectively. Vaccine candidates were  identified in silico from the core genes using high antigenic, solubility, and  secretion probabilities. Altogether, the genome data revealed distinctive  features between E. anguillarum and E. piscicida, which suggest different  pathogenicity and thus the need for separate preventive strategies.

AB  - DNA mismatch repair (MMR) of simple base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops in eukaryotes is initiated by the binding of the MutS homolog 2 (MSH2)-MSH6  heterodimer to mismatched DNA. Cadmium (Cd) is a genotoxic heavy metal that has  been recognized as a human carcinogen. Oxidant stress and inhibition of DNA  repair have been proposed as major factors underlying Cd genotoxicity. Our  previous studies indicated the ability of Cd to disturb the gene expression of  MSH6 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. This study was undertaken to explore if  Cd-induced oxidative stress down-regulated MSH gene activities. Following the  exposure of zebrafish embryos at 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to sublethal  concentrations of Cd at 3-5 μM for 4 or 9 h, a parallel down-regulation of MSH2,  MSH6 and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) gene expression was detected by  real-time RT-PCR and the expression levels were 40-50% of control after a 9-h  exposure. Cd exposure also induced oxidative stress, yet no inhibition of  catalase gene activity was observed. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed a  wide distribution of msh6 mRNA in the head regions of 10 hpf embryos and  pretreatment of embryos with antioxidants butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), d-mannitol  or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 1-10 μM restored Cd-suppressed msh6 expression. QPCR  confirmed the protective effects of antioxidants on Cd-suppressed msh2/msh6 mRNA  production. Down-regulated MSH gene activities reaching about 50% of control were  also induced in embryos exposed to paraquat, a reactive oxygen species  (ROS)-generating herbicide, or hydrogen peroxide at 200 μM. Hence, Cd at  sublethal levels down-regulates msh2/msh6 expression primarily via ROS as  signaling molecules. The transcriptional activation of human msh6 is known to be  fully dependent on the specificity factor 1 (Sp1). Cd failed to inhibit the DNA  binding activity of zebrafish Sp1 unless at lethal concentrations based on band  shift assay, therefore excluding the involvement of Sp1 inactivation in  Cd-induced MSH gene inhibition in zebrafish embryos.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are widespread in the environment, human food and breast milk. Seafood is known to contain nutrients beneficial for  the normal development and function of the brain, but also contaminants such as  PCBs which are neurotoxic. Exposure to non-coplanar PCBs during brain development  can disrupt spontaneous behaviour in mice and lead to hyperactive behaviour.  Humans are chronically exposed to the highest relative levels of organochlorines  in early childhood during brain development, though usually at doses which do not  give clinical symptoms of toxicity. This study aimed to elucidate the  developmental and behavioural effects of 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexachlorobiphenyl  (PCB153) in mice, mimicking human exposure during gestation and lactation.  METHODS: Environmentally relevant doses of PCB153 were added to the experimental  diets. Feed concentrations were approximately 0.5, 6.5, and 1500 μg PCB153/kg  feed, representing a realistic and a worst case scenario of frequent consumption  of contaminated fish. The study also investigated the effects of maternal  nutrition, i.e. a standard rodent diet versus a high inclusion of salmon. Mice  pups were examined for physical- and reflex development, sensorimotor function  and spontaneous behaviour from five days after birth until weaning. A selection  of pups were followed until 16 weeks of age and tested for open field behaviour  and the acoustic startle response (ASR) with prepulse inhibition (PPI). Blood  thyroid hormones and liver enzymes, blood lipids and PCB153 content in fat were  examined at 16 weeks. Statistical analyses modelled the three way interactions of  diet, PCB exposure and litter size on behaviour, using generalized linear models  (GLM) and linear mixed effect models (LME). The litter was used as a random  variable. Non-parametric tests were used for pair wise comparisons of biochemical  analyses. RESULTS: Litter size consistently influenced pup development and  behaviour. Few lasting PCB153 related changes were observed, but results  indicated effects on synchronization of physical development. Perinatal PCB153  exposure appeared to reduce habituation and cause aggression in males, though not  statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Litter size and maternal diet influenced  physical development and function more than PCB153 in perinatally exposed mouse  pups and supports the developmental importance of maternal care and the social  environment.

Fish were collected between March 2010 and January 2012 at two different sites of  the Madre River, one site receiving residual water (contaminated site) from rice  culture (n=49) and another that do not receive residual water (reference site)  (n=48). The herbicide clomazone analysis detected 3.40±1.70 μg/L in the  contaminated site and 1.1±0.33 μg/L in the reference site. Fish from contaminated  site showed increased (P<0.05) number of monocytes suggesting the possible  defense response as a result of chronic exposure to clomazone. On the other hand,  no difference was found in the hematocrit percentage, red blood cell count, total  thrombocyte number, white blood cell count, lymphocytes, and neutrophils number.  Fish from both sites showed histopathological changes in gills and liver,  possibly caused by chronic exposure to contamination. The influence of herbicide  sub doses on fish health is also discussed.

AB  - In order to identify the phagocytic cells of sea bass, the peritoneal leucocyte population of fish injected intraperitoneally with Photobacterium damselae  subspecies piscicida was studied by light microscopy using cytocentrifuge  preparations stained by the Antonow technique for peroxidase detection. Among the  leucocytes present in the peritoneal exudate of the infected fish (macrophages,  neutrophils, eosinophilic granular cells, lymphocytes and thrombocytes),  macrophages and neutrophils were the only phagocytic cells. Neutrophils were  easily distinguished from macrophages in Antonow stained preparations by the  pattern of peroxidase positivity. Using ultrastructural cytochemistry,  neutrophils were found to have abundant cytoplasmic granules positive for  peroxidase and arylsulphatase and were negative for alpha-naphthyl butyrate (ANB)  esterase. In contrast, ANB esterase activity was detected in macrophages. These  leucocytes were typically negative for peroxidase, but ocasionally, some  macrophages with peroxidase or arylsulphatase-positive vacuoles were observed.  Both phagocytes had cytoplasmic granules positive for acid phosphatase. Glycogen  particles were found in the cytoplasm of the two phagocytic cells, but they were  much more abundant in neutrophils. Macrophages were much more abundant than  neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity of non-injected sea bass but early after the  intraperitoneal injection of bacteria, the number of neutrophils increased  quickly and extensively. Higher numbers of intraperitoneally injected bacteria  were found inside macrophages as compared to neutrophils because macrophages  strongly predominated in the peritoneal population at the time of injection.  However, when the bacteria were injected into peritoneal cavities with high  numbers of neutrophils (attracted by a previous injection of 12% casein), the  percentage of neutrophils with phagocytosed bacteria increased, approaching that  of infected macrophages. Taken together, these results show that in sea bass, as  in many other organisms, in addition to macrophages, neutrophils are important  phagocytic cells, the relative participation of each of the two phagocytes in  defense mechanisms against infection depending on the opportunity to encounter  the invading infectious agents.

AB  - The occurrence of pollutants in the aquatic environment can produce severe toxic effects on non-target organisms, including fish. These sources of contamination  are numerous and include herbicides, which represent a large group of toxic  chemicals. Quinclorac, an herbicide widely applied in agriculture, induces  oxidative stress due to free radical generation and changes in the antioxidant  defense system. The aim of this study was to assess if dietary diphenyl  diselenide (PhSe)₂ has a protective effect in tissues of fish species Cyprinus  carpio exposed to the quinclorac herbicide. The fish were fed with either a  standard or a diet containing 3.0 mg/Kg of diphenyl diselenide for 60 d. After  were exposed to 1 mg/L of Facet® (quinclorac commercial formulation) for 192 h.  At the end of the experimental period, parameters as thiobarbituric acid-reactive  substance levels (TBARS), protein carbonyl, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase  (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), nonprotein thiols (NPSH) and ascorbic  acid in the liver, gills, brain and muscle were evaluated in Cyprinus carpio. In  fish exposed to quinclorac and feeding with standard diet TBARS levels increased  in liver and gills. However, SOD activity decreases in liver whereas no  alterations were observed in catalase activity in this tissue. Quinclorac also  decrease GST activity in liver and brain, NPSH in brain and muscle and ascorbic  acid in muscle. Concerning protein carbonyl exposed to herbicide the fish did not  show any alterations. The diphenyl diselenide supplemented diet reversed these  effects, preventing increases in TBARS levels in liver and gills. GST activity  was recovered to control values in liver. NPSH levels in brain and muscle  increased remain near to control values. These results indicated that dietary  diphenyl diselenide protects tissues against quinclorac induced oxidative stress  ameliorating the antioxidant properties.

AB  - Fish eggs are released and embryos hatch into a pathogenically hostile environment, at a time when their immunological capacity is severely limited.  Although the eggs are initially protected by the envelope as well as by several  innate and adaptive immune substances, which are transferred to eggs during fish  vitellogenesis, it seems that young specimens depend fundamentally on their  innate defence mechanisms. Here we show in the gilthead seabream, an  immunologically tractable teleost fish model, that the first lymphocyte marker  genes, those coding for the two subunits for the recombination activating gene,  were detected by RT-PCR around 21-27 days post-hatching (dph). In addition, the  transcripts coding for the alpha and beta subunits of the T-cell receptor and the  light and heavy chains of immunoglobulin M were detected at 27-48 dph. However,  most innate immune genes analyzed were already expressed at hatching, including  those coding for the toll-like receptors, pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules,  antiviral and antibacterial factors, and phagocyte markers. Using the information  from the gene expression study, we also examined the achievement of  immunocompetence by analyzing the protection induced by a bacterin against the  pathogenic bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. The results show  that vaccination of young larvae of this species by either immersion or oral  routes resulted in increased susceptibility to infection of the specimens, and  point to the lack of correlation between the achievement of immunocompetence and  detection of the adaptive immunity markers.

AB  - The immediate behavioral responses of goldfish (Carassius auratus) to pesticide-contaminated flows were recorded in a countercurrent olfactometer. In  addition, electro-olfactograms were recorded from the epithelial surface of the  olfactory rosette as a preliminary check for the olfactory sensitivity of the  fish to the pesticides tested. All tests were run on prochloraz (imidazole  fungicide), bentazone (diazine herbicide), and nicosulfuron (sulfonylurea  herbicide). Behavioral effects were assessed, at four concentrations (10  microg/L, 100 microg/L, 1 mg/L, 10 mg/L), on endpoints related to swimming  pattern (preference-avoidance responses, burst swimming reactions), comfort  activities (buccal movements, feeding attempts), and social relations  (antagonistic acts, grouping). The behavior of the fish appeared particularly  sensitive to prochloraz exposure. As a whole, prochloraz-contaminated flows  showed significant effects on the six behaviors studied; bentazone and  nicosulfuron affected three and five, respectively. At the lowest concentration,  prochloraz also showed more effects than the two other pesticides. Some of the  behavioral endpoints were found particularly sensitive to a given chemical.  Pesticide-contaminated flows also induced significant changes in swimming  orientation of the fish. Attraction was observed in response to flowing solutions  of prochloraz (1 mg/L, 10 mg/L), bentazone (10 microg/L, 10 mg/L), and  nicosulfuron (1 mg/L, 10 mg/L). At a concentration of 1 mg/L, none of the  pesticides induced a noticeable depolarization of the olfactory epithelium,  suggesting that these chemicals are not detected by the olfactory sense of the  fish. These results are discussed in the light of the data concerning effects of  pesticides on behavior and chemical communication in fish.

T2  - Journal of environmental biology
AB  - Impact of alphamethrin (synthetic pyrethroid) on profiles of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), catalase (CAT), DNA, RNA and protein in liver, brain, gill  and skeletal muscle of the freshwater food fish Channa punctatus were  investigated. Exposure of sublethal concentration of alphamethrin (0.018 ppm for  14 days) increased the activity of LDH in liver (1.8 fold), brain (1.4 fold),  gill(1.6 fold), and skeletal muscle (2.2 fold) of the fish. However, it  significantly decreased the activity of CAT in the tissues of liver (54%),  skeletal muscle (52%), gill (51%) and brain (49%) of the fish. Similarly, DNA  (skeletal muscle (36%), liver (30%), brain (28%) and gill (25%)) RNA (liver  (42%), brain (32%), gill (35%) and skeletal muscle (45%)) and protein content  (45%), brain (42%), gill (36%), and skeletal muscle (27%)) declined in different  tissues of the fish exposed to alphamethrin. Maximum increase in the level of LDH  was in skeletal muscle (2.2 fold) and minimum in brain (1.4 fold). Maximum  reduction in CAT profile was in liver (54%), and minimum in brain (49%). Declines  in DNA was maximum in skeletal muscle (36%) and minimum in gill (25%) whereas RNA  and protein content were maximum in liver (42% and 45% respectively) and minimum  in skeletal muscle (45% and 27% respectively). Alphamethrin was toxic to the  freshwater fish due to its inducing effect on anaerobic enzyme (LDH) and  inhibitory effect on antioxidant enzyme (CAT), DNA, RNA and protein. This  reflected alphamethrin associated increase in anaerobiosis and decrease in  oxidative defense and impairment in protein synthesizing capacity of C.  punctatus. Further, induction in LDH and reduction in CAT and protein profile may  be used as biomarker of alphamethrin toxicity in fish.

T2  - Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP
AB  - In fish, as in other aerobic organisms, glutathione and glutathione-related enzymes are important components in the defences against oxidative stress. To  study if hepatic glutathione levels and/or activities of glutathione-related  enzymes can act as indicators of oxidative stress in fish, we injected rainbow  trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) intraperitoneally with paraquat (PQ), menadione (MD),  naphthazarin (DHNQ), or beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF), all known to cause a rise  in reactive oxygen species (ROS). After 2 and 5 days of exposure, we measured the  activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase (GPox), glutathione S-transferase  (GST), gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS), and glutathione reductase (GR).  We also measured total glutathione (tGSH) and oxidised glutathione (GSSG) in the  liver of fish treated with PQ and MD. All chemicals caused an increase in GR  activity after 5 days, which ranged from 160% in fish treated with beta-NF to  1,500% in fish treated with PQ. All chemicals except beta-NF caused moderate  elevation in GST activity; GPox activity was lower in fish treated with DHNQ and  MD, while GCS activity increased twofold in the fish treated with DHNQ, without  being affected by beta-NF, PQ or MD. After 5 days of treatment with PQ or MD,  tGSH content was elevated. Our findings demonstrated that of the parameters  included in the study, GR activity was the most responsive to treatment with  redox cycling compounds, indicating that GR activity is a promising biomarker of  such compounds and possibly indicating oxidative stress in rainbow trout.

AB  - Risk assessment of toxic substances under ecologically-relevant scenarios which include the presence of natural stressors is essential to understand their  indirect toxic effects and to improve prediction of the impacts of contamination  on community structure and ecosystem function. Here, we study the effects of the  pesticide imidacloprid on the responses of Daphnia magna to a combination of  predator-release kairomones from trout and alarm cues from conspecifics,  simulating different levels of perceived predation risk. The joint effects of  simultaneous exposure to both types of stressors were assessed both by  traditional analysis of variance and by employing conceptual models for the  evaluation of contaminant mixture exposures. Results demonstrated that pesticide  exposure can significantly increase the costs of inducible antipredator defences  and impair life-history responses of daphnids to fish predation pressure. Since  trait-mediated effects are well-known to play a key role in population dynamics,  the combined direct and indirect effects of sub-lethal concentrations of  pesticides could induce maladaptive responses in zooplankton populations in the  field, reducing their long-term viability.

AB  - The aim of the current work was to investigate the effects of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and monomethyl mercury (MeHg) on  hepatocytes from tropical fish Hypostomus commersoni (cascudo). In order to  verify DDT and MeHg impacts on the redox milieu, cells were exposed for 4 days to  50 nM of DDT, 0.25 and 2.5 microM of MeHg and to a combination of 50 nM of DDT  and 0.25 microM of MeHg. These concentrations were compared with those previously  published (Filipak Neto et al., 2008) for the predator fish Hoplias malabaricus  (traíra). The effects were mostly noticeable on reduced glutathione concentration  and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and glutathione S-transferase activity.  Catalase activity increased in the group exposed to 2.5 microM of MeHg and  hydrogen peroxide levels decreased in all exposed groups. Also, superoxide anion  levels decreased in the groups exposed to 2.5 microM of MeHg and DDT *MeHg group.  Cell viability decreased only in the DDT exposed group, demonstrating that the  antioxidant defense mechanism of H. commersoni hepatocytes is more efficient than  H. malabaricus. These results corroborate the resistance of H. commersoni to  polluted areas and support the hypothesis that this species is more resistant to  DDT and MeHg than H. malabaricus species.

AB  - In recent years, a variety of low molecular weight antibiotics have been isolated from diverse animal species. These agents, which include peptides, lipids, and  alkaloids, exhibit antibiotic activity against environmental microbes and are  thought to play a role in innate immunity. We report here the discovery of a  broad-spectrum steroidal antibiotic isolated from tissues of the dogfish shark  Squalus acanthias. This water-soluble antibiotic, which we have named squalamine,  exhibits potent bactericidal activity against both Gram-negative and  Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, squalamine is fungicidal and induces osmotic  lysis of protozoa. The chemical structure of the antibiotic 3  beta-N-1-(N-[3-(4-aminobutyl)]- 1,3-diaminopropane)-7 alpha,24 zeta-dihydroxy-5  alpha-cholestane 24-sulfate has been determined by fast atom bombardment mass  spectroscopy and NMR. Squalamine is a cationic steroid characterized by a  condensation of an anionic bile salt intermediate with spermidine. The discovery  of squalamine in the shark implicates a steroid as a potential host-defense agent  in vertebrates and provides insights into the chemical design of a family of  broad-spectrum antibiotics.

T2  - Journal of toxicology and environmental health. Part A
AB  - Methylmercury (MeHg) has been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease in some but not all epidemiology studies. These inconsistent results may  stem from the fact that exposure typically occurs in the context of fish  consumption, which is also associated with cardioprotective factors such as  omega-3 fatty acids. Mechanistic information may help to understand whether MeHg  represents a risk to cardiovascular health. MeHg is a pro-oxidant that  inactivates protein sulfhydryls. These biochemical effects may diminish critical  antioxidant defense mechanism(s) involved in protecting against atherosclerosis.  One such defense mechanism is paraoxonase-1 (PON1), an enzyme present on  high-density lipoproteins and that prevents the oxidation of blood lipids and  their deposition in vascular endothelium. PON1 is potentially useful as a  clinical biomarker of cardiovascular risk, as well as a critical enzyme in the  detoxification of certain organophosphate oxons. MeHg and other metals are known  to inhibit PON1 activity in vitro. MeHg is associated with lowered serum PON1  activity in a fish-eating population. The implications of lowering PON1 are  evaluated by predicting the shift in PON1 population distribution induced by  various doses of MeHg. An MeHg dose of 0.3 μg/kg/d is estimated to decrease the  population average PON1 level by 6.1% and to increase population risk of acute  cardiovascular events by 9.7%. This evaluation provides a plausible mechanism for  MeHg-induced cardiovascular risk and suggests means to quantify the risk. This  case study exemplifies the use of upstream disease biomarkers to evaluate the  additive effect of chemical toxicity with background disease processes in  assessing human risk.

T2  - Ecotoxicology (London, England)
AB  - : The availability and use of ED point and NOEL values in ecotoxicological data submitted to the UK Pesticides Safety Directorate is explored. In first tier data  normally submitted for pesticide registration, ED points such as EC/LC/LD50s are  commonly available from acute laboratory toxicity studies conducted using birds,  small mammals, fish, aquatic invertebrates, plants, honeybees and earthworms.  These ED points are subsequently used for hazard classification of the pesticide  and in toxicity: exposure ratio (TER) calculations required during the acute risk  assessment. Although NOELs can often be available from the same first tier data,  they are generally not used. However, NOELs commonly available from higher tier  chronic toxicity studies such as chronic fish, Daphnia reproduction and avian  reproduction studies, are used in TER calculations to assess chronic risk. The  statistical limitations of the NOEL are recognized and the regulatory  implications of replacing the NOEL with an alternative ED point are discussed.

AB  - The cell adhesion molecule CD44 has been implicated in diverse biological functions including the pathological responses to infections and inflammatory  diseases. The variable forms of CD44 contribute to functional variations, which  are not yet defined in teleost. Here, we show that zebrafish CD44a plays a  protective role in the host defense against Edwardsiella piscicida infection.  Zebrafish CD44a deficiency inhibits cell growth and proliferation, impairs cell  growth and death pathways, and regulates the expression levels of many genes  involved in p53 signaling, apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, CD44a gene  disruption in zebrafish leads to inhibition of apoptosis and induction of  autophagy, with the increased susceptibility to E. piscicida infection.  Furthermore, we show that zebrafish CD44a variants including CD44a_tv1 and  CD44a_tv2 promote the translocation of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and  interact with p53 in the cytoplasm. Mechanistically, zebrafish CD44a_tv1 mediates  the beneficial effect for larvae survival infected with E. piscicida is depending  on the CASP8-mediated apoptosis. However, the antibacterial effect of zebrafish  CD44a_tv2 depends on the cytoplasmic p53-mediated inhibition of autophagy.  Collectively, our results identify that different mechanisms regulate CD44a  variants-mediated antibacterial responses.

AB  - Exposure to environmental contaminants, including various pesticides and trace metals, can disrupt critical olfactory-driven behaviors of fish such as homing to  natal streams, mate selection, and an ability to detect predators and prey. These  neurobehavioral injuries have been linked to reduced survival and population  declines. Despite the importance of maintaining proper olfactory signaling  processes in the presence of chemical exposures, little is known regarding  chemical detoxification in the salmon olfactory system, and in particular, the  antioxidant defenses that maintain olfactory function. An understudied, yet  critical component of cellular antioxidant defense is phospholipid hydroperoxide  glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx/GPx4), an isoform within the family of  selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzymes that can directly reduce  lipid peroxides and other membrane-bound complex hydroperoxides. In this study,  we cloned two gpx4 isoforms (gpx4a and gpx4b) from Coho salmon olfactory tissues  and compared their modulation in olfactory and liver tissues by cadmium, an  environmental pollutant and olfactory toxicant that cause oxidative damage as a  mechanism of toxicity. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the two gpx4 isoforms  shared 71% identity, and also relatively high sequence identities when compared  with other fish GPx4 isoforms. Sequence comparisons with human GPx4 indicated  conservation of three important active sites at selenocysteine (U46), glutamine  (Q81), and tryptophan (W136), suggesting similar catalytic activity between fish  and mammalian GPx4 isoforms. Tissue profiling confirmed the expression of gpx4a  and gpx4b in all ten Coho tissues examined. The expression of gpx4 mRNAs in the  Coho olfactory system was accompanied by comparably high initial rates of GPx4  enzymatic activity in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. Exposure to low (3.7  ppb) and high (347 ppb) environmental Cd concentrations for 24-48 h significantly  decreased gpx4a expression in Coho olfactory rosettes, whereas olfactory gpx4b  mRNA expression was not modulated by exposures at these concentrations. In  summary, Coho salmon express two paralogs of gpx4, a key enzyme in the  maintenance of signal transduction processes that protect against cellular  oxidative damage. The Cd-associated downregulation of salmon olfactory gpx4a  expression in particular, may be associated with the loss of olfactory signal  transduction that accompanies metal-associated loss of olfaction in salmonids.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria mortality is mainly a direct consequence of inadequate and/or delayed diagnosis and case management. Some important control interventions (e.g.  long-lasting insecticidal nests) have contributed to reduce malaria morbidity and  mortality in different parts of the world. Moreover, the development and  effective use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) hold promise to further enhance  the control and elimination of malaria, particularly in areas where health  services are deficient. The aim of this study was to determine knowledge,  attitudes, practices and beliefs in relation to RDTs for malaria in rural Côte  d'Ivoire. METHODS: One hundred individuals from Bozi and Yoho who sought care at  the health centre in Bozi and were offered an RDT for malaria were interviewed in  April 2010 using a pre-tested questionnaire on practice and perceptions in  relation to RDTs for malaria. The relationships between acceptance of RDTs and  factors related to opinions were identified, using generalized linear mixed  models. Qualitative data from open-ended questions complemented the quantitative  analysis. RESULTS: Only 34 out of 100 patients who were offered an RDT for  malaria were willing to undergo the test. People who perceived blood as a sacred  body fluid were less likely to comply with an RDT. The concurrent availability  and use of RDTs for HIV and malaria was associated with an unwilling attitude  towards RDTs for malaria (Fisher's exact test, p <0.001). The initial willingness  of patients to accept malaria testing with RDTs was significantly related to  general fear and wanting to know malaria infection status. For further and  regular use of RDTs, a strong relationship was observed between acceptance and  the idea that an RDT is a pretext used by health worker to know HIV status (odds  ratio (OR) = 16.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-268.5). Those thinking  that blood samples were useful for medical diagnoses were 8.31-times (95% CI =  2.22-31.1) more likely to undergo an RDT compared to those rejecting blood  sampling as a diagnostic strategy. CONCLUSION: Socio-cultural factors might be  barriers for accepting RDTs in general health services. There are social  representations of malaria and HIV/AIDS, symbolic for blood or experiences in  relation to blood taking and blood-related diseases in relation to the  introduction and routine use of RDTs. Special attention should be given to these  barriers as otherwise the promotion of RDTs for prompt and effective diagnosis  and subsequent management of malaria is hampered.

AB  - Goldfish (Carassius auratus) were exposed to a mixture of herbicides, namely atrazine, simazine, diuron, and isoproturon (ASDI) at a cumulative concentration  of 50microg/l for 12 weeks. Control fish and exposed fish were sampled at 4, 8  and 12 weeks of exposure to observe the combined impact of herbicides on  non-specific and specific mechanisms of immunity and antioxidant defenses. The  antioxidant defenses were evaluated in haemopoietic organs and liver.  ASDI-induced stress was reflected as a significant induction of superoxide  (O(2)(-)) production in phagocytic cells of head kidney and spleen. In addition,  plasma lysozyme activity was consistently high in the treatment group. Specific  immunity was assessed by antibody titre responses following immunization of the  fish with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs). Antibody titre was reduced throughout  the period of observation in ASDI-treated fish. This reduction was found to be  significant at week 4 (p<0.05). Herbicide-exposed fish showed reduced resistance  against pathogen invasion but remarkable enhancement in lysozyme activity. The  ASDI-induced oxidative stress in spleen, kidney and liver was reflected as a  change in the antioxidant enzyme activities in these vital organs of fish. Our  data indicate that herbicides at concentrations present in water bodies in Europe  cause immune suppression in goldfish.

AB  - Antibacterial factors in the epidermal mucus of fish have a potential importance in the first line of the host defense response to bacterial pathogens. We  previously isolated a novel antibacterial protein termed SSAP (Sebastes schlegeli  antibacterial protein) from the skin mucus of the rockfish S. schlegeli and  identified it as a new member of the L-amino acid oxidase (LAO) family. In the  present study, the localization of SSAP in S. schlegeli was investigated by  reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, quantitative real time RT-PCR, Western blotting  and measurements of LAO and antibacterial activities. SSAP mRNA was expressed  dominantly in skin and gill and weakly in ovary or kidney as shown by RT-PCR and  real time RT-PCR. The quantity of SSAP mRNA in skin varied among the individuals,  ranging from 1.1 to 13.9 ng microg(-1) total RNA, although no relationship was  found between the size of fish and gene expression. SSAP was exclusively detected  in skin and gill by Western blotting using a specific anti-SSAP antiserum. In  addition, the extracts of both tissues apparently showed LAO activity and  antibacterial activity against Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. This  study demonstrates that SSAP is predominantly synthesized in skin and gill and  probably functions as an antibacterial LAO in both tissues.

AB  - Sulfated polysaccharides derived from green seaweeds exhibit many beneficial biological activities and have great potential to be used as nutraceutical in  aquaculture. In this work, we evaluated the effects of the sulfated  polysaccharide ulvan from Ulva ohnoi on Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis)  juveniles at the transcriptomic level. Cytotoxicity assay performed in liver  primary cell cultures from sole determined that the different ulvan  concentrations assayed did not impair cell viability. Juveniles were  intraperitoneally (IP) injected with ulvan (0.5 mg/fish) followed by a challenge  with Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) at 7 days. RNASeq analyses  at 2 days post injection (dpi) revealed that 402 transcripts were differentially  expressed in liver between ulvan IP injected and control groups before the  challenge. Genes related to bacterial and antiviral defence, complement system,  chemokines, proteasomes and antigen presentation were upregulated in ulvan  treated groups. A detailed expression analysis of sixteen genes related to innate  and adaptive immune system was performed in two systemic tissues: liver and  spleen. Ulvan injection provoked the upregulation of tlr22 and a transient  inflammatory response was initiated in both liver and spleen at 2 dpi. As  consequence, expression of acute phase proteins, antimicrobial peptides and  complement genes was induced. Moreover, expression of mhcI, mhcII, psmb10 and  bcl6 was also induced 2 dpi. At 2 dpi with Phdp, inflammatory cytokines and genes  related to bacterial and antiviral defense, iron metabolism, complement system  and antigen presentation were differentially modulated in survival juveniles  previously IP injected with ulvan. Moreover, mortality was retarded in ulvan  treated juveniles. These results provide new evidence about the role of ulvan as  a bioactive compound with immunomodulatory activity in Senegalese sole as well as  its possible use as vaccine adjuvant against Phdp. This is the first published  study that evaluates the transcriptomic response of Senegalese sole IP injected  with ulvan.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the toxic effects of Roundup Transorb® on the endangered Neotropical annual killifish Austrolebias charrua through the  assessment of molecular and biochemical biomarkers. The fish were collected in  temporary ponds and exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of the  herbicide (5 mg.L(-1) for 96 h). The production of ROS, lipid peroxidation, DNA  damage, and membrane fluidity were evaluated in the blood cells by flow  cytometry. The mRNA expression of the antioxidant-related genes sod2, cat, gstα,  atp1a1, gclc, and ucp1 across the brain, liver, and gills was quantified. The  acute exposure of annual killifish to Roundup significantly increased ROS  production, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage in their erythrocytes. Likewise,  Roundup Transorb® decreased membrane fluidity in the blood cells of the exposed  fish. Gene expression analysis revealed that Roundup exposure alters the relative  expression of genes associated with oxidative stress and antioxidant defense. Our  results give rise to new insights into adaptive mechanisms of A. charrua in  response to Roundup. Since Brazilian annual killifishes strongly risk extinction,  this study paves the way for developing novel biotechnologies applied to  environmental monitoring and aquatic toxicology assessment.

AB  - The flavonoid metal-insecticide magnesium-hesperidin complex (MgHP) has recently been considered as a novel insecticide to replace some persistent pesticides.  However, it is important to evaluate its action on non-target species, mainly  those living in an aquatic environment, as these ecosystems are the final  receptors of most chemicals. Reactive oxygen species, antioxidant and oxidative  stress biomarkers, genotoxicity as well as cell cycle was evaluated in the liver  cell line from zebrafish (Danio rerio; ZF-L) exposed to 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and  1000 ng mL(-1) MgHP. MgHP affected cell stability by increasing reactive oxygen  species (ROS) in both exposure times (24 and 96 h) at high concentrations.  Catalase (CAT) activity decreased after 24 h exposure, and glutathione and  metallothionein values increased, avoiding the lipid peroxidation. Genotoxicity  increased as MgHP concentration increased, after 24 h exposure, exhibiting  nuclear abnormalities; it was recovered after 96 h exposure, evidencing possible  stimulation of DNA repair mechanisms. The alteration in the cell cycle  (increasing in the Sub-G1 phase and decreasing in the S-phase) was associated  with chromosomal instability. In conclusion, the responses of ROS and the  antioxidant defense system depended on MgHP concentration and time exposure,  while DNA exhibited some instability after 24 h exposure, which was recovered  after 96 h.

T2  - Journal of environmental biology
AB  - Synthetic pyrethroids are the recent major class of broad spectrum, photostable, organic insecticides used in agricultural, domestic and veterinary applications  and now account for more than 30% of global insecticide use. Cypermethrin is  metabolized and eliminated significantly more slowly by fish than by mammals or  birds, which may explain this compound's high toxicity in fish compared to other  organisms. The present communication deals with histoanatomical alterations in  the gonads of a local fresh water food fish, Channa punctatus exposed to 0.033  ppm (96 hr LC50 X 1/10) concentration of a synthetic pyrethroid, devicyprin  (cypermethrin 25%) in aquatic medium of aged tap water for 15, 30 and 45 days  respectively. In testis, exposure dependent histological damage has been observed  in terms of vacuolization, condensation of spermatogonic cells, distortion of  tubular epithelium, shrinkage of interstitial cells and general inflammatory  responses. Longest exposure of 45 days has resulted in peculiar starry-sky  appearance of the testicular tissue. Gross histo-anatomy of ovarian tissue  reveals epithelial lesions, inflammatory responses, stromal hemorrhage, increased  interstitium and shrinkage of yolk vesicles towards periphery These findings are  quite suggestive of reproductive impairments leading to delayed gonadal maturity  and adversely affecting processes of sperm production and ovulation and thus, the  fish production.

AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been the subject of intense scientific and regulatory scrutiny during recent years. Of the three commercial  forms (Penta, Octa and Deca) of PBDEs that have been widely used as flame  retardants in textiles, furniture upholstery, plastics, and electronics, only  Deca-BDE remains on the general market in North America, while a recent ruling of  the European Court spells an impending end to its use in Europe. We review here  highlights of aquatic research documenting the rapid emergence of PBDEs as a high  priority environmental concern in Canada. PBDEs are being introduced in large  quantities to the aquatic environment through sewage discharge and atmospheric  deposition. In certain environmental compartments, the single congener BDE-209,  the main ingredient in the Deca-BDE formulation, has surpassed the legacy PCBs  and DDT as the top contaminant by concentration. Limited biomagnification of  BDE-209 in aquatic food webs reflects its high log K(ow) and preferential  partitioning into the particle phase. As a result, large environmental reservoirs  of BDE-209 are being created in sediments, and these may present a long-term  threat to biota: BDE-209 breaks down into more persistent, more bioaccumulative,  more toxic, and more mobile PBDE congeners in the environment.

AB  - Dust samples collected by researchers and study participants from 43 U.S. urban homes were analyzed and compared to evaluate the feasibility of using  participant-collected samples to assess indoor environmental exposures. The  microbial and chemical composition of participant-collected (and shipped) samples  were compared to researcher-collected samples from the same household, using dust  recovered from each home's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)  filter. The bacterial and fungal communities present in all dust samples were  determined via MiSeq 16S and ITS sequencing, and the concentrations of 27  semi-volatile organic compounds (7 orthophosphates, 6 phthalates, and 14  brominated flame retardants) were determined via GC-MS. Self-report data on the  home environment was collected via an online survey of study participants. While  the researcher-collected samples (RCS) yielded greater mass than the  participant-collected samples (PCS), the alpha and beta diversities of the  bacterial and fungal communities recovered in the RCS and PCS were not  significantly different, indicating that PCS is a viable option for indoor  microbiome studies of residential homes. The microbial communities recovered in  both cases reflected the dominance of human-associated bacterial taxa and  outdoor-associated fungal taxa with similar pathogen-associated taxa present in  each sample type. In both PCS and RCS, the amount of carpet in the home and the  frequency of bleach use had a significant effect on the composition of fungal  communities. Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) of potential human health  concern, were commonly detected in the homes. Organophosphates and phthalates  were recovered at a similar frequency in both PCS and RCS. Measured SVOC  concentration levels were consistent with previous indoor studies although  differences were observed between PCS and RCS for several SVOCs. This study  demonstrates the potential and challenges associated with participant-collected  dust samples for indoor environment studies.

T2  - Royal Society open science
AB  - Insecticide-treated net (ITN) is the most applicable and cost-effective malaria intervention measure in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. Although ITNs have been  widely distributed to malaria-endemic regions in the past, their success has been  threatened by misuses (in fishing, agriculture etc.) and decay in ITN efficacy.  Decision-making in using the ITNs depends on multiple coevolving factors: malaria  prevalence, mosquito density, ITN availability and its efficacy, and other  socio-economic determinants. While ITN misuse increases as the efficacy of ITNs  declines, high efficacy also impedes proper use due to free-riding. This  irrational usage leads to increased malaria prevalence, thereby worsening malaria  control efforts. It also remains unclear if the optimum ITN use for malaria  elimination can be achieved under such an adaptive social learning process. Here,  we incorporate evolutionary game theory into a disease transmission model to  demonstrate these behavioural interactions and their impact on malaria  prevalence. We show that social optimum usage is a function of transmission  potential, ITN efficacy and mosquito demography. Under specific parameter  regimes, our model exhibits patterns of ITN usage similar to observed data from  parts of Africa. Our study suggests that the provision of financial incentives as  prompt feedback to improper ITN use can reduce misuse and contribute positively  towards malaria elimination efforts in Africa and elsewhere.

AB  - AIP56 (apoptosis-inducing protein of 56 kDa) is a key virulence factor of Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp), the causative agent of a  septicaemia affecting warm water marine fish species. Phdp-associated pathology  is triggered by AIP56, a short trip AB toxin with a metalloprotease A domain that  cleaves the p65 subunit of NF-κB, an evolutionarily conserved transcription  factor that regulates the expression of inflammatory and anti-apoptotic genes and  plays a central role in host responses to infection. During infection by Phdp,  AIP56 is systemically disseminated and induces apoptosis of macrophages and  neutrophils, compromising the host phagocytic defence and contributing to the  genesis of pathology. Although it is well established that the secretion of AIP56  is crucial for Phdp pathogenicity, the protein secretion systems operating in  Phdp and the mechanism responsible for the extracellular release of the toxin  remain unknown. Here, we report that Phdp encodes a type II secretion system  (T2SS) and show that mutation of the EpsL component of this system impairs AIP56  secretion. This work demonstrates that Phdp has a functional T2SS that mediates  secretion of its key virulence factor AIP56.

AB  - Dory, the animated surgeonfish created by the Pixar Animation studios, famously suffered from short-term memory loss leading to many adventures. In reality, many  fishes have excellent cognitive abilities and are able to learn and retain  important information such as the identity of predators. However, if and how  cognition can be affected by anthropogenically altered oceanic conditions is  poorly understood. Here, we examine the effect of a widely used pesticide,  chlorpyrifos, on the retention of acquired predator recognition in post-larval  stage of the surgeonfish Acanthurus triostegus. Through associative learning,  post-larvae of A. triostegus were first observed to forage significantly less in  the presence of conspecific alarm cues and alarm cues associated to a predator's  odor. The retention of this anti-predator behavior was estimated to last between  2 and 5 days in the absence of pesticide. However, environmentally-relevant  concentrations of chlorpyrifos (1 μg.L(-1)) induced the loss of this acquired  predator recognition. This reduced ability to recognize learned predators is  discussed as it may lead to more vulnerable fish communities in coastal areas  subjected to organophosphate pesticide pollution.

T2  - Fish physiology and biochemistry
AB  - Lake Yuriria, located in the heavily populated and polluted Mexican Central Plateau, receives domestic sewage, industrial effluents, and municipal  wastewaters that are still directly discharged without treatment into the  tributaries and the lake. Pollutants in water and sediments include heavy metals,  aromatic hydrocarbons, and organochlorine pesticides. Activities of the  antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione  peroxidase (GPx), as well as Na⁺/K⁺-adenosine triphosphatase (Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase)  activity, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were evaluated in the livers of the fish  Goodea atripinnis after 96 h of exposure to water collected in March and June  2005 from three sites: Y (limnetic zone), L (Lerma tributary), and C (la Cinta  tributary). Physical and chemical parameters of the lake water were also  analyzed. Increases in CAT activity and LPO levels at all three sites were  detected compared with control fish (P < 0.05), while GPx and SOD activities  decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activities were similar to the  control in fish exposed to limnetic water from both March and June but were  higher than control at the two tributary sites in March (P < 0.05); fish exposed  to water from the Lerma tributary in June exhibited lower Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase than the  control (P < 0.05). During March, CAT and Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activities were  increasing more than in June in Y and L, respectively, while in June, SOD and GPx  were depleted more than March in L and Y and L, respectively. Despite the  antioxidant defenses of the fish liver, exposure to all water samples from Lake  Yuriria exerted alterations in hepatic LPO levels, antioxidant enzymes, and  Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activities that could substantially impair the mechanisms of fish  defenses against oxidative stress.

T2  - Mutation research
AB  - The 8-oxodG content has been measured in chromosomal DNA of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) by HPLC-EC. Susceptibility of different tissues to oxidative DNA  damage was studied by exposing fish to model pollutants. Cu(II), paraquat (PQ)  and malathion failed to promote DNA oxidation in liver, while dieldrin  significantly increased the 8-oxodG content in this organ, but not in gills or  blood. After PQ exposure, fish liver showed high levels of glucose-6-P  dehydrogenase (G-6PDH) and GSSG reductase activities. The increased antioxidant  status and the lack of a specific transport system could explain the lack of  susceptibility of liver to DNA oxidative damage induced by PQ. Increased levels  of 8-oxodG were detected in the gills of PQ-exposed fish after 8 and 24 h. In  contrast, after 48 h exposed fish contained lower 8-oxodG levels than controls.  The existence of a PQ transport system in this O2-rich organ and the lack of a  significant increase in antioxidant defenses would explain the sensitivity of  gills to DNA damage promoted by PQ. Elimination of this soluble chemical and the  putative induction of DNA-repair enzymes specific for oxidative damages could  explain the drop of 8-oxodG levels at longer times. Fish exposed to moderate  levels of urban and industrial pollution showed significantly high 8-oxodG  content in hepatic DNA. We conclude that 8-oxodG determination in chromosomal DNA  by HPLC-EC is a potentially useful biomarker of environmental pollution, although  its response is still somewhat lower than that of other well-established  biomarkers of oxidative stress.

T2  - Environmental research
AB  - In recent years, Solea senegalensis has increasingly been used in pollution monitoring studies. In order to assess its response to some particular widespread  pollutants, juveniles of S. senegalensis were administered an intraperitoneal  injection of the model aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist β-naphtoflavone (βNF)  and chemicals of environmental concern, such as the fungicide ketoconazole  (KETO), the lipid regulator gemfibrozil (GEM), the surfactant nonylphenol (NP)  and the synthetic hormone ethinylestradiol (EE2). Two days after injection, the  effect of these chemicals was followed up as alterations of hepatic microsomal  activities of the cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and associated reductases,  carboxylesterases (CbEs) and the conjugation enzyme uridine diphosphate  glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT). In the cytosolic fraction of the liver, the effect  on CbEs, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and antioxidant activities was also  considered. Alterations on the endocrine reproductive system were evaluated by  plasma levels of vitellogenin (VTG) and the sex steroids estradiol (E2),  testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) and the progestin  17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20β-P). Injection with the model compound  βNF induced the hydrolysis rate of the seven CYP substrates assayed. The  xenobiotic GEM induced three CYP-related activities (e.g. ECOD) and UDPGT, but  depressed antioxidant defenses. EE2 induced four CYPs, more significantly ECOD  and BFCOD activities. The xenoestrogens NP and EE2 altered the activities of CbE  in microsomes and catalase, and were the only treatments that induced de novo VTG  synthesis. In addition, the progestin 17,20β-P, was induced in NP-injected fish.  None of the treatments caused statistically significant effects on steroid plasma  levels. In conclusion, the CYP substrates assayed responded specifically to  treatments and juveniles of S. senegalensis appear good candidates for assessing  xenobiotics exposure.

AB  - Certain populations of killer whales (Orcinus orca) have been extensively studied over the past 30 years, including populations that use Puget Sound, WA, the  inside waters of British Columbia, Southeastern Alaska and Kenai Fjords/Prince  William Sound, Alaska. Two eco-types of killer whales, 'transient' and  'resident', occur in all of these regions. These eco-types are genetically  distinct and differ in various aspects of morphology, vocalization patterns, diet  and habitat use. Various genetic and photo-identification studies of eastern  North Pacific killer whales have provided information on the male-female  composition of most of these resident pods and transient groups, as well as the  approximate ages, reproductive status and putative recruitment order (birth  order) of the individual whales. Biopsy blubber samples of free-ranging resident  and transient killer whales from the Kenai Fjords/Prince William Sound, AK region  were acquired during the 1994-1999 field seasons and analyzed for selected  organochlorines (OCs), including dioxin-like CB congeners and DDTs.  Concentrations of OCs in transient killer whales (marine mammal-eating) were much  higher than those found in resident animals (fish-eating) apparently due to  differences in diets of these two killer whale eco-types. Certain life-history  parameters such as sex, age and reproductive status also influenced the  concentrations of OCs in the Alaskan killer whales. Reproductive female whales  contained much lower levels of OCs than sexually immature whales or mature male  animals in the same age class likely due to transfer of OCs from the female to  her offspring during gestation and lactation. Recruitment order also influenced  the concentrations of OCs in the Alaskan killer whales. In adult male residents,  first-recruited whales contained much higher OC concentrations than those  measured in non-first-recruited (e.g. second recruited, third recruited) resident  animals in the same age group. This study provides baseline OC data for free  ranging Alaskan killer whales for which there is little contaminant information.

AB  - Currently, mosquito vector control is facing a number of key challenges, including the rapid development of resistance to synthetic pesticides and the  recent spread of aggressive arbovirus outbreaks. The biosynthesis of silver  nanoparticles (AgNPs) is currently considered an environmental friendly  alternative to the employ of pyrethroids, carbamates and microbial agents (e.g.  Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis), since AgNPs are easy to produce,  effective and stable in the aquatic environment. However, their biophysical  features showed wide variations according to the botanical agent using for the  green synthesis, outlining the importance of screening local floral resources  used as reducing and stabilizing agents. In this study, we focused on the  biophysical properties and the mosquitocidal action of Quisqualis  indica-fabricated AgNPs. AgNPs were characterized using spectroscopic (UV, FTIR,  XRD) and microscopic (AFM, SEM, TEM and EDX) techniques. AFM, SEM and TEM  confirmed the synthesis of poly-dispersed AgNPs with spherical shape and size  ranging from 1 to 30nm. XRD shed light on the crystalline structure of these  AgNPs. The acute toxicity of Quisqualis indica extract and AgNPs was evaluated  against malaria, arbovirus, and filariasis vectors, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes  aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, as well as on three important non-target  aquatic organisms. The Q. indica leaf extract showed moderate larvicidal  effectiveness on Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50=220.42), Ae. aegypti (LC50=203.63)  and An. stephensi (LC50=185.98). Q. indica-fabricated AgNPs showed high toxicity  against Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50=14.63), Ae. aegypti (LC50=13.55) and An.  stephensi (LC50=12.52), respectively. Notably, Q. indica-synthesized AgNPs were  moderately toxic to non-target aquatic mosquito predators Anisops bouvieri  (LC50=653.05μg/mL), Diplonychus indicus (LC50=860.94μg/mL) and Gambusia affinis  (LC50=2183.16μg/mL), if compared to the targeted mosquitoes. Overall, the  proposed one-pot biogenic fabrication of AgNPs using Q. indica is a low-cost and  eco-friendly tool in the fight against Zika virus, malaria and filariasis  vectors, with little impact against non-target aquatic mosquito predators.

AB  - Insecticidal Bt crops and seed treatments represent additional pest management tools for growers, prompting ecological studies comparing their impact on farm  system inputs and effects to nontarget organisms compared with conventional  practices. Using high taxonomic and temporal resolution, we contrast the  dominance structure of carabids and dynamics of the most abundant species in  maize (both sweet and field corn) agroecosystems using pest management tactics  determined by the purchase of seed and application of pyrethroid insecticides. In  the seed-based treatments, sweet corn contained Cry1Ab/c proteins, whereas field  corn contained the coupled technology of Cry3Bb1 proteins for control of corn  rootworm and neonicotinoid seed treatments aimed at secondary soil-borne pests.  The insecticide treatments involved foliar pyrethroids in sweet corn and  at-planting pyrethroids in field corn. The carabid community, comprised of 49  species, was dominated by four species, Scarites quadriceps Chaudoir, Poecilus  chalcites Say, Pterostichus melanarius Illiger, and Harpalus pensylvanicus  DeGeer, that each occupied a distinct temporal niche during the growing season.  Two species, Pt. melanarius and H. pensylvanicus, exhibited differences between  treatments over time. Only H. pensylvanicus had consistent results in both years,  in which activity densities in field corn were significantly higher in the  control in July and/or August. These results, along with laboratory bioassays,  led us to hypothesize that lower adult captures resulted from decrease in prey  availability or exposure of H. pensylvanicus larvae to soil-directed  insecticides-either the neonicotinoid seed treatment in the transgenic field corn  or an at-planting soil insecticide in the conventional field corn.

AB  - Constant exposure to a variety of environmental factors has become increasingly problematic. A variety of illnesses are initiated or aided by the presence of  certain perturbing factors. In the case of autism spectrum disorder, the  environmental component plays an important part in determining the overall  picture. Moreover, the lack of therapies to relieve existing symptoms complicates  the fight against this condition. As a result, animal models have been used to  make biomedical research easier and more suited for disease investigations. The  current study used zebrafish as an animal model to mimic a real-life scenario:  acute exposure to an increased dose of pesticides, followed by prospective  intervention-based therapy with vitamin B(12) (vit. B(12)). It is known that vit.  B(12) is involved in brain function nerve tissue, and red blood cell formation.  Aside from this, the role of vit. B(12) in the redox processes is recognized for  its help against free radicals. To investigate the effect of vit. B(12), fish  were divided into four different groups and exposed to a pesticide mixture (600  μg L(-1) fipronil + 600 μg L(-1) pyriproxyfen) and 0.24 μg L(-1) vit. B(12) for  14 days. The impact of the compounds was assessed daily with EthoVision XT 11.5  software for behavioral observations, especially for sociability, quantified by  the social interaction test. In addition, at the end of the study, the activities  of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde  (MDA) were measured. The results showed significant improvements in locomotor  activity parameters and a positive influence of the vitamin on sociability.  Regarding the state of oxidative stress, high activity was found for SOD and GPx  in the case of vit. B(12), while fish exposed to the mixture of pesticides and  vit. B(12) had a lower level of MDA. In conclusion, the study provides new data  about the effect of vit. B(12) in zebrafish, highlighting the potential use of  vitamin supplementation to maintain and support the function of the organism.

AB  - The effects of diflubenzuron (DFB), an insecticide to control ectoparasites in fish farms, on muscle acetylcholinesterase (AChE), detoxifying and antioxidant  enzymes, hematological and physiological parameters, and liver histopathology  were evaluated in Prochilodus lineatus after 6, 24 and 96 h of exposure to 25 mg  L(-1) of DFB. The insecticide caused a reduction in the number of erythrocytes  and hemoglobin content after 96 h exposure, probably due to hemolysis.  Hyperglycemic response indicated energy mobilization, and may have contributed to  the increase in osmolarity after 96 h exposure to DFB. The induction of  glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase activities in liver pointed to the  activation of xenobiotic metabolic pathways and antioxidant defenses. The  decrease in muscle AChE at all experimental times showed that DFB is an AChE  inhibitor. In addition, DFB induced hepatic alterations that might impair normal  liver functions. These results show that DFB can cause health disorders in fish  and further studies are required to better define its safe use in aquaculture.

AB  - An ecotoxicological test battery based on a mode-of-action approach was designed and applied to the hazard identification and classification of modes of action of  six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ethinyl estradiol, ibuprofen,  propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole). The rationale behind the design of the  battery was to cover the relevant interactions that a compound may have with  biological targets. It is thus not comprehensive but contains representative  examples of each category of mode of toxic action including nonspecific,  specific, and reactive toxicity. The test battery consists of one test system for  nonspecific toxicity (baseline toxicity or narcosis), two test systems for  specific effects, and two test systems for reactive toxicity. The baseline  toxicity was quantified with the Kinspec test, which detects membrane leakage via  measurements of membrane potential. This test system may also be used to detect  the specific effects on energy transduction, although this was not relevant to  any compound investigated in this study. As examples of specific  receptor-mediated toxicity, we chose the yeast estrogen screen (YES) as a  specific test for estrogenicity, and the inhibition of chlorophyll fluorescence  in algae to assess specific effects on photosynthesis. Reactive modes of action  were assessed indirectly by measuring the relevance of cellular defense systems.  Differences in growth inhibition curves between a mutant of Escherichia coli that  could not synthesize glutathione and its parent strain indicate the relevance of  conjugation with glutathione as a defense mechanism, which is an indirect  indicator of protein damage. DNA damage was assessed by comparing the growth  inhibition in a strain that lacks various DNA repair systems with that in its  competent parent strain. Most compounds acted merely as baseline toxicants in all  test systems. As expected, ethinylestradiol was the only compound showing  estrogenic activity. Propranolol was baseline-toxic in all test systems  exceptforthe photosynthesis inhibition assay, where it surprisingly showed a  100-fold excess toxicity over the predicted baseline effect. The exact mode of  toxic action could not be confirmed, but additional chlorophyll fluorescence  induction experiments excluded the possibility of direct interference with  photosynthesis through photosystem II inhibition. Mixture experiments were  performed as a diagnostic tool to analyze the mode of toxic action. Compounds  with the same mode of toxic action showed the expected concentration addition. In  the photosynthesis inhibition assay, agreement between experimental results and  prediction was best for two-stage predictions considering the assigned modes of  action. In a two-stage prediction, concentration addition was used as a model to  predict the mixture effect of the baseline toxicants followed by their  independent action as a single component combined with the specifically acting  compound propranolol and the reference compound diuron. A comparison with acute  toxicity data for algae, daphnia, and fish showed generally good agreement for  the nonspecifically acting compounds but also that the proposed test battery  offered better diagnostic value in the case of the specifically acting compounds.

AB  - Trichlorfon (TCF) is an organophosphate compound used extensively as an anti-parasitic in aquaculture. In this study, we investigated the effects of TCF  on the antioxidant defense system, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and  stress responses in various tissues of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). C.carpio  L. were exposed to different concentrations of TCF (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and  4 mg L(-)(1)) at 25 and 15 °C for two weeks (measurements were taken after week 1  and 2). TCF exposure induced significant alterations in antioxidant responses in  the gills and the liver. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and  glutathione S-transferase (GST) increased considerably after TCF exposure,  depending on water temperature, whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH)  levels decreased notably after one and two weeks. Remarkable antioxidant  responses were observed in the gills, suggesting the gills were more sensitive to  oxidative stress than the liver based on CAT, GST, and GSH levels. Notable  increases in MDA levels were observed in the gills and the liver. AChE activity  was significantly inhibited in the brain and muscles even at the lowest TCF  concentration of 0.5 mg L(-)(1), indicating neurotoxicity following TCF exposure.  As a stress indicator, plasma cortisol was significantly elevated following  exposure to TCF depending on water temperature, thereby enhancing stress. These  results suggest that TCF exposure can induce considerable alterations in  antioxidant responses, neurotoxicity, and stress reaction depending on water  temperature. The assayed enzymes are potential biomarkers of organophosphate  contamination.

AB  - The halophilic bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) represents a substantial health problem for several fish species in aquaculture.  Bacteria that reside free and inside phagocytes cause acute and chronic forms of  photobacteriosis. Infections of juveniles rapidly kill up to 90-100% fish.  Factors underlying failure of the immune protection against bacteria remain  largely unknown. The reported study used a transcriptomic approach to address  this issue. Juvenile sea breams (0.5 g) were challenged by immersion in salt  water containing 2.89 × 10(8) CFU of a virulent Phdp and the head kidney was  sampled after 24- and 48-h. Analyses were performed using the second version of a  44 k oligonucleotide DNA microarray that represents 19,734 sea bream unique  transcripts and covers diverse immune pathways. Expression changes of selected  immune genes were validated with qPCR. Results suggested rapid recognition of the  pathogen, as testified by up-regulation of lectins and antibacterial proteins  (bactericidal permeability-increasing protein lectins, lysozyme, intracellular  and extracellular proteases), chemokines and chemokine receptors. Increased  expression of proteins involved in iron and heme metabolism also could be a  response against bacteria that are dependent on iron. However, negative  regulators of immune/inflammatory response were preponderant among the  up-regulated genes. A remarkable finding was the increased expression of IL-10 in  concert with up-regulation of arginase I and II and proteins of the polyamine  biosynthesis pathway that diverts the arginine flux from the production of  reactive nitrogen species. Such expression changes are characteristic for  alternatively activated macrophages that do not develop acute inflammatory  responses. Immune suppression can be induced by the host to reduce tissue damages  or by the pathogen to evade host response.

AB  - Effects of pesticide exposure on the European flounder, Platichthys flesus, were investigated using a suppression subtractive hybridization method (SSH) to  identify up- and down-regulated genes after a 30-day exposure to herbicides (a  cocktail of atrazine, diuron, and isoproturon, and a single herbicide,  glyphosate). A total of 256 expressed gene sequences were identified as having  the potential for being differentially expressed, of which 116 could be  identified by homology with databased sequences. The metabolic functions with  which they are associated include energy production, general metabolism,  signaling, transport, immune system, and structure. Expression of 14 of these  genes was analyzed in liver, muscle, and gills by reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) under experimental conditions  (0, 15, and 30 days of exposure) and under field conditions (sampling in two  estuaries displaying different levels of pesticide contamination). This study  provides a first basis for studying the response of fish to pesticide exposure  and allows the characterization of new potential genetic markers of pesticide  contamination in the field.

AB  - Fish skin mucus contains a variety of antimicrobial proteins and peptides that seem to play a role in self defense. We previously reported an antibacterial  protein in the skin secretion of the rockfish, Sebastes schlegeli, which showed  selective antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. This study aimed  to isolate and structurally and functionally characterize this protein. The  antibacterial protein, termed SSAP (S. schlegeli antibacterial protein), was  purified to homogeneity by lectin affinity column chromatography, anion-exchange  HPLC and hydroxyapatite HPLC. It was found to be a glycoprotein containing  N-linked glycochains and FAD. Its molecular mass was estimated to be 120 kDa by  gel filtration HPLC and 53 kDa by SDS/PAGE, suggesting that it is a homodimer. On  the basis of the partial amino-acid sequence determined, a full-length cDNA of  2037 bp including an ORF of 1662 bp that encodes 554 amino-acid residues was  cloned by 3' RACE, 5' RACE and RT-PCR. A blast search showed that a mature  protein (496 residues) is homologous to l-amino acid oxidase (LAO) family  proteins. SSAP was determined to have LAO activity by the H(2)O(2)-generation  assay and substrate specificity for only l-Lys with a K(m) of 0.19 mm. It showed  potent antibacterial activity against fish pathogens such as Aeromonas  hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida and Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida. The  antibacterial activity was completely lost on the addition of catalase,  confirming that H(2)O(2) is responsible for the growth inhibition. This study  identifies SSAP as a new member of the LAO family and reveals LAO involvement in  the innate immunity of fish skin.

AB  - Species- and tissue-specific defenses against the possibility of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation were compared in adult fish, Oreochromis niloticus and  Cyprinus carpio, exposed to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D),  azinphosmethyl and their combination for 96 h. Superoxide dismutase (SOD),  glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase activities were monitored in kidney,  brain and gill. In all exposure groups there was a marked increase in SOD  activity in gill tissues in both fish species, while it was at the control level  in other tissues. The highest elevation of SOD activity by combined treatment was  observed in C. carpio. Individual and combined treatments caused an elevation in  catalase and GPx activities in kidney of C. carpio. Catalase activity was  unaffected in brain of O. niloticus, while GPx activity was decreased after all  treatments. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was higher than the control  levels in kidney of both fish exposed to pesticides. No significant changes were  observed in malondialdehyde level in kidney and brain of C. carpio. Our results  indicate that the toxicities of azinphosmethyl and 2,4-D may be related to  oxidative stress. Also, the results show that SOD activity in gill and GST  activity in kidney may be used as biomarkers for pollution monitoring and  indicate that the activities of certain biomarkers in C. carpio are more  sensitive to pesticides than those in O. niloticus.

AB  - Female individuals of Hyphessobrycon eques were exposed to Diflubenzuron (Dimilin(®)) in order to determine whether exposure to sublethal levels of this  insecticide causes changes in gill morphology. Fish were exposed to 0.01, 0.1 and  1.0mgL(-1) for 96h and 17 days and then submitted to pathological and histometric  evaluation. Pathological lesions, such as hyperplasia, lamellar fusion, vascular  congestion, secondary lamellar disarray, vasodilatation, hemorrhage and increased  lamellar epithelium, were significantly more common in the gills of fish exposed  to Dimilin(®) than the control. Histometric analysis documented significant  changes in blood vessel diameter, primary lamellae width and secondary lamellae  length, and the appearance of hemorrhage foci in all concentrations tested. Even  at low Dimilin(®) concentrations, the histopathological alteration index was mild  to moderate, thereby indicating that the function of this tissue was compromised.  These findings indicate that indiscriminate use of Dimilin(®) can adversely  affect the structural integrity of the gills of H. eques, which can cause  numerous problems for fish farming systems.

AB  - St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, is the largest island in the Bering Sea, located 60 km from Siberia. The island is home to approximately 1600 St. Lawrence Island  Yupik residents who live a subsistence way of life. Two formerly used defense  sites (FUDS) exist on the island, one of which, Northeast Cape, has been the  subject of a $123 million cleanup effort. Environmental monitoring demonstrates  localized soil and watershed contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB),  organochlorine (OC) pesticides, mercury, and arsenic. This study examined whether  the Northeast Cape FUDS is a source of exposure to OC pesticides. In total, 71  serum samples were collected during site remediation from volunteers who  represented three geographic regions of the island. In addition, ninespine  stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) and Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) were  collected from Northeast Cape after remediation to assess continuing presence of  OC pesticides. Chlordane compounds, DDT compounds, mirex, and hexachlorobenzene  (HCB) were the most prevalent and present at the highest concentrations in both  fish tissues and human serum samples. After controlling for age and gender,  activities near the Northeast Cape FUDS were associated with an increase in serum  HCB as compared to residents of the farthest village from the site. Positive but  nonsignificant relationships for sum-chlordane and sum-DDT were also found.  Organochlorine concentrations in fish samples did not show clear geographic  trends, but appear elevated compared to other sites in Alaska. Taken together,  data suggest that contamination of the local environment at the Northeast Cape  FUDS may increase exposure to select persistent OC pesticides.

AB  - Transgenic crops expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins have been widely and successfully deployed for the control of target pests, while allowing a  substantial reduction in insecticide use. The evolution of resistance (a  heritable decrease in susceptibility to Bt toxins) can pose a threat to sustained  control of target pests, but a high-dose refuge (HDR) management strategy has  been key to delaying countervailing evolution of Bt resistance. The HDR strategy  relies on the mating frequency between susceptible and resistant individuals, so  either partial dominance of resistant alleles or nonrandom mating in the pest  population itself could elevate the pace of resistance evolution. Using classic  Wright-Fisher genetic models, we investigated the impact of deviations from  standard refuge model assumptions on resistance evolution in the pest  populations. We show that when Bt selection is strong, even deviations from  random mating and/or strictly recessive resistance that are below the threshold  of detection can yield dramatic increases in the pace of resistance evolution.  Resistance evolution is hastened whenever the order of magnitude of model  violations exceeds the initial frequency of resistant alleles. We also show that  the existence of a fitness cost for resistant individuals on the refuge crop  cannot easily overcome the effect of violated HDR assumptions. We propose a  parametrically explicit framework that enables both comparison of various field  situations and model inference. Using this model, we propose novel empiric  estimators of the pace of resistance evolution (and time to loss of control),  whose simple calculation relies on the observed change in resistance allele  frequency.

T2  - Journal of environmental science and health. Part. B, Pesticides, food contaminants, and agricultural wastes
AB  - The pesticides originally designed to kill target organisms are dangerous for many other wild species. Since they are applied directly to the environment, they  can easily reach the water basins and the topsoil. A dataset of 125 aromatic  pesticides with well-expressed aquatic toxicity towards trout was subjected to  quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) analysis aimed to establish  the relationship between their molecular structure and biological activity. A  literature data for LC50 concentration killing 50% of fish was used. In addition  to the standard 2D-QSAR analysis, a comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA)  analysis considering the electrostatic and steric properties of the molecules was  also performed. The CoMFA analysis helped the recognition of the steric  interactions as playing an important role for aquatic toxicity. In addition, the  transport properties and the stability of the compounds studied were also  identified as important for their biological activity.

AB  - Paclobutrazol (PBZ), a trazole-containing fungicide, is widely used on food crops. Frequent usage of PBZ may contaminate water, but its toxicity to aquatic  organisms is understudied. Although the chronic effects of PBZ exposure on  reproductive, antioxidant defense, and liver metabolism systems in rockfish have  been reported, the toxic effects of PBZ on aquatic embryos are unknown. Here, we  report that PBZ disrupts the development of heart and craniofacial cartilage in  zebrafish embryos, and decreases their survival and hatching rates. PBZ affects  the normal process of cardiac looping, which may lead to a slower heart beat  accompanied by pericardia edema and apoptotic myocytes. PBZ also decreases the  population of migratory neural crest cells, which give rise to craniofacial  cartilage. Our results reveal high embryonic toxicity of PBZ on aquatic  organisms, and thus hold significance for the impact of fungicides on public  health and ecology.

AB  - Complement C1q domain containing protein (C1qDC) is a vital recognition molecule and has an important effect on immunity. The C1qDCs exhibit opsonic activity in  fish, while the mechanisms of C1qDCs in activation complement still remain  unclear. This study explored immunological characteristics of a C1qDC from  Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) (PoC1qDC). PoC1qDC consists of 296  amino acid residues, possessing a collagen domain and a C1q domain. According to  our results, PoC1qDC was expressed in 9 diverse tissue samples and showed  up-regulation after bacterial challenge. Recombinant PoC1qDC (rPoC1qDC) activated  normal serum bactericidal and hemolytic activities by interaction with Japanese  flounder IgM, but not enhanced the complement activity of C3-depeleted serum.  rPoC1qDC was significantly bound to various bacterial species and agglutination  activity against Edwardsiella piscicida and Streptococcus iniae. Furthermore,  rPoC1qDC showed direct interaction with peripheral blood leucocytes while  enhancing phagocytic and chemotactic activity. When PoC1qDC was overexpressed in  Japanese flounder before E. piscicida infection, bacterial replication was  significantly inhibited in fish tissues. Consistently, when PoC1qDC expression in  Japanese flounder was knocked down, bacterial replication was significantly  enhanced. The above findings first suggested the role of PoC1qDC in teleost in  mediating complement activation by interaction with IgM, which can positively  influence bacterial infection.

AB  - The salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), an ectoparasitic copepod of salmonid fish, is a major threat to aquaculture in Norway, Ireland, Scotland and Canada.  Due to rise in resistance against existing pesticides, development of novel drugs  or vaccines is necessary. Posttranscriptional gene silencing by RNA interference  (RNAi), when established in a high throughput system is a potential method for  evaluation of molecular targets for new medical compounds or vaccine antigens.  Successful use of RNAi has been reported in several stages of salmon lice.  However, when we employed a previously described protocol for planktonic stages,  no reproducible down-regulation of target genes was gained. In the present study,  we describe a robust method for RNAi, where nauplius larvae are soaked in  seawater added double stranded RNA (dsRNA). In order to test for when dsRNA may  be introduced, and for the efficacy and duration of RNAi, we performed a series  of experiments on accurately age determined larvae, ranging from the hatching egg  to the copepodid with a salmon louse coatomer and a putative prostaglandin E  synthase gene. Presumptive knock-down was monitored by real time PCR. Significant  gene silencing was obtained only when nauplius I larvae were exposed to dsRNA  during the period in which they molted to nauplius II. A knock down effect could  be detected 2days after soaking, and it remained stable until the last  measurement, on day 12. Soaking nauplius I larvae, knock-down was verified for  six additional genes with a putative role in molting. For one chitinase, a  loss-of-function phenotype with abnormal swimming was obtained. Hence, RNAi,  induced in the nauplius, may facilitate studies of the molecular biology of the  louse, such as the function of specific genes in developmental processes and  physiology, host recognition, host-parasite interaction, and, in extension, the  engineering of novel medicines.

AB  - The present study aims to assess the effects of 2,4-D herbicide on biotransformation and oxidative stress status of zebrafish larvae. Animals were  exposed to a range of sublethal concentrations (0.02-0.8 mg/L) and biomarkers at  transcriptomic level and biochemical level were assessed. Chemical analysis with  showed that the bioaccumulation of 2,4-D in 96 hpf zebrafish larvae were  increased in a concentration-dependent manner. This herbicide induced significant  effects at both gene expression and enzymatic activities levels after at 96 hpf.  Results of mRNA expression showed a differential transcription regulation with  all target genes depending on the tested concentrations. The mRNA level of gsr  and cyp1a were up regulated at the highest dose of herbicide (0.8 mg/L). The gene  expression of gstp1 showed an up regulation at lower dose (0.02 mg/L) and a down  regulation at the highest dose (0.8 mg/L) of 2,4-D. A significant induction of  EROD activity and inhibition of GST activity were noted in groups exposed to  0.8 mg/L of 2,4-D. Considering the antioxidant defenses, the activity of CAT was  increased in larvae exposed to 0.8 mg/L of herbicide and GPx activity was induced  at lower doses of 2,4-D (0.02 and 0.051 mg/L). Moreover, peroxidative damage,  assessed as MDA content, was markedly increased in larvae exposed to high 2,4-D  concentration. Overall, the present study data indicate that bioaccumulation of  2,4-D in 96 hpf zebrafish larvae and alterations in detoxification and oxidative  stress related parameters, likely associated with ROS production, which may  endanger the embryo-larval stages development of fish.

AB  - One hundred and twenty bacterial isolates were obtained from the intestinal mucus of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and screened for antagonistic activity  and adherence abilities. Based on in vitro antagonism against two pathogens  (Streptococcus iniae and Edwardsiella piscicida), five isolates were selected and  identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. All antagonistic isolates were  affiliated to the genus Bacillus, which showed inhibitory activity against S.  iniae. Only the isolate B191 (closely related to Bacillus mojavensis) inhibited  the growth of both pathogens. Moreover, isolate B191 adhered significantly better  to fish intestinal mucus than other antagonistic isolates. According to our  results, these bacterial isolates, particularly isolate B191, should be further  studied to explore their probiotic effects under in vivo conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of exposure to presistent organochlorine compounds through the consumption of fatty fish from  the Baltic Sea on human fertility. METHODS: Information on time to pregnancy,  miscarriages, and subfertility was collected retrospectively by self-administered  questionnaires in two cohorts of fishermen's sisters from the Swedish east coast,  by the Baltic Sea, and the west coast, where fish are less contaminated. Along  with cohort affiliation, fish consumption and growing up in a fishing village or  fisherman's family were used as measures of exposure within the eastcoast cohort  (ie, the exposed cohort). RESULTS: There was no support for a negative effect of  the consumption of fatty Baltic Sea fish on time to pregnancy, miscarriages, or  subfertility. On the contrary, some evidence pointed towards a protective effect  of fatty fish consumption within both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of  reduced fertility was found for women who could be assumed to have a high  lifetime consumption of fatty fish contaminated by persistent organochlorine  compounds. A possible explanation for this finding is that a positive effect of  some of the constituents in fatty fish could be strong enough to disguise the  hazardous effects of exposure to persistent organochlorine compounds.

AB  - This assessment summarises the current state of knowledge on the interactive effects of ozone depletion and climate change on aquatic ecosystems, focusing on  how these affect exposures to UV radiation in both inland and oceanic waters. The  ways in which stratospheric ozone depletion is directly altering climate in the  southern hemisphere and the consequent extensive effects on aquatic ecosystems  are also addressed. The primary objective is to synthesise novel findings over  the past four years in the context of the existing understanding of ecosystem  response to UV radiation and the interactive effects of climate change. If it  were not for the Montreal Protocol, stratospheric ozone depletion would have led  to high levels of exposure to solar UV radiation with much stronger negative  effects on all trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems than currently experienced in  both inland and oceanic waters. This "world avoided" scenario that has curtailed  ozone depletion, means that climate change and other environmental variables will  play the primary role in regulating the exposure of aquatic organisms to solar UV  radiation. Reductions in the thickness and duration of snow and ice cover are  increasing the levels of exposure of aquatic organisms to UV radiation. Climate  change was also expected to increase exposure by causing shallow mixed layers,  but new data show deepening in some regions and shoaling in others. In contrast,  climate-change related increases in heavy precipitation and melting of glaciers  and permafrost are increasing the concentration and colour of UV-absorbing  dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulates. This is leading to the  "browning" of many inland and coastal waters, with consequent loss of the  valuable ecosystem service in which solar UV radiation disinfects surface waters  of parasites and pathogens. Many organisms can reduce damage due to exposure to  UV radiation through behavioural avoidance, photoprotection, and photoenzymatic  repair, but meta-analyses continue to confirm negative effects of UV radiation  across all trophic levels. Modeling studies estimating photoinhibition of primary  production in parts of the Pacific Ocean have demonstrated that the UV radiation  component of sunlight leads to a 20% decrease in estimates of primary  productivity. Exposure to UV radiation can also lead to positive effects on some  organisms by damaging less UV-tolerant predators, competitors, and pathogens. UV  radiation also contributes to the formation of microplastic pollutants and  interacts with artificial sunscreens and other pollutants with adverse effects on  aquatic ecosystems. Exposure to UV-B radiation can decrease the toxicity of some  pollutants such as methyl mercury (due to its role in demethylation) but increase  the toxicity of other pollutants such as some pesticides and polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons. Feeding on microplastics by zooplankton can lead to bioaccumulation  in fish. Microplastics are found in up to 20% of fish marketed for human  consumption, potentially threatening food security. Depletion of stratospheric  ozone has altered climate in the southern hemisphere in ways that have increased  oceanic productivity and consequently the growth, survival and reproduction of  many sea birds and mammals. In contrast, warmer sea surface temperatures related  to these climate shifts are also correlated with declines in both kelp beds in  Tasmania and corals in Brazil. This assessment demonstrates that knowledge of the  interactive effects of ozone depletion, UV radiation, and climate change factors  on aquatic ecosystems has advanced considerably over the past four years and  confirms the importance of considering synergies between environmental factors.

AB  - Arctic communities are disproportionately exposed to pollutants from sources including global atmospheric transport and formerly used defense sites (FUDS).  The effects of climate change and increasing development in the Arctic have the  potential to exacerbate this problem. Yupik People of Sivuqaq, or St Lawrence  Island, Alaska are one such community with documented exposures to pollutants  from FUDS, and their traditional lipid-rich foods such as blubber and rendered  oils of marine mammals. Troutman Lake, adjacent to the Yupik community of  Gambell, Alaska, was used as a disposal site during the decommission of the  adjacent FUDS, leading to community concern about exposure to military pollution  and intrusion from historic local dump sites. In collaboration with a local  community group, this study utilized passive sampling devices deployed in  Troutman Lake. Air, water and sediment deployed samplers were analyzed for  unsubstituted and alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), brominated  and organophosphate flame retardants and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). PAH  concentrations were low and comparable to other remote/rural locations. PAHs were  generally in deposition from the overlying atmosphere into Troutman Lake. Of the  flame retardants, brominated diphenyl ether-47 was detected in all surface water  samplers while triphenyl phosphate was detected in all environmental  compartments. Both were at concentrations equivalent or lower than other remote  locations. Of particular interest, we measured higher atmospheric concentrations  of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) (0.75-2.8 ng/m(3)) than previously  reported in the literature for remote Arctic sites (<0.017-0.56 ng/m(3)). TCEP  was found to be in deposition to Troutman Lake at magnitudes from 290 to  1300 ng/m(2)/day. No PCBs were detected in this study. Our findings demonstrate  the relevance of both modern and legacy chemicals from local and global sources.  These results help us to understand the fate of anthropogenic contaminants in  dynamic Arctic systems providing valuable data for communities, policy makers and  scientists.

AB  - Malaria has reemerged in tropical regions with rapid population growth and deforestation. The dynamics of malaria transmission in agricultural settlements  of the Amazon have been poorly defined. We studied the spatial distribution of  malaria incidence in Roraima, Brazil, using multi regression analysis on 12  parameters that described social, housing, and behavioral variables. Malaria  cases were associated with the proximity of Anopheles darlingi breeding sites,  the main vector in these areas. During the dry season, transmission was enhanced  near a temporary river. Cases occurred throughout the year near fish-farming  dams. Epidemiological models derived from urban or riverine malaria are probably  inadequate for describing disease transmission in agricultural settlements, where  cases are clustered near breeding sites, while the majority of the population  remains unaffected. Identification of these areas, associated with residual  insecticide spraying or surveillance, may considerably decrease the costs of  control efforts.

T2  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
AB  - P-glycoproteins (P-gps) encoded by multidrug resistance 1 (mdr1) genes are ATP-dependent transporters located in the cytoplasmic membrane which mediate the  efflux of a broad spectrum of hydrophobic compounds from the cell. The tissue  distribution of P-gps suggests their role in the organismal defense against  xenobiotics by effecting xenobiotic excretion and reducing xenobiotic uptake. In  the present work, the interaction of P-gp(s) in the liver and in primary cultured  hepatocytes of rainbow trout with two model pollutants was studied - the  imidazole fungicide prochloraz and the alkylphenolic surfactant nonylphenol  diethoxylate (NP2EO). Using a monoclonal antibody (mAB C219) directed against a  conserved P-gp epitope, an immunoreactive protein of 160 kDa was detected in  immunoblots of liver extracts from control trout. In sections of control trout  livers, immunohistochemistry with the mAB C219 resulted in specific staining of  bile canaliculi. In juvenile trout exposed for 7 days to sublethal concentrations  of prochloraz (0.027 microM; 0.27 microM) or NP2EO (0.32 microM; 1.30 microM), no  changes in levels of hepatic P-gp(s) were found in immunoblot and immunochemical  investigations. The efflux of the fluorescent mdr 1 substrate rhodamine 123  (Rh123) from cultured isolated trout hepatocytes was partly inhibited by  verapamil and vinblastine, compounds known to interfere with mdr 1-dependent  transport. This demonstrates the presence of a mdr1-like mechanism in trout liver  which is probably involved in the biliary excretion of hydrophobic xenobiotics.  Non-cytotoxic concentrations of prochloraz and NP2EO were tested for effects on  the efflux of Rh123 from trout hepatocytes. Prochloraz was a potent inhibitor of  the mdr1-like mechanism, being effective at 0.3 microM and above. NP2EO inhibited  Rh123 efflux only at the highest concentration tested (31.6 microM). The  accumulation and elimination of 14C-prochloraz by cultured trout hepatocytes was  not affected by mdr 1-type substrates (Rh123, vinblastine) and a mdr 1 inhibitor  (verapamil). This shows that prochloraz is, despite its inhibitory potency, not a  substrate of the mdr1-like mechanism in trout liver. The inhibition by prochloraz  and NP2EO of the md r1-like mechanism in trout hepatocytes suggests that water  pollutants can interfere with P-gp-function in fish and thus may impair the  organismal defense against xenobiotics.

AB  - The application of potentially beneficial microorganisms to increase host defense is a new trend to increase health benefits. In this paper the first specific host  probiotics for goats from a mixture isolated from healthy animals (Lactobacillus  reuteri DDL 19, Lactobacillus alimentarius DDL 48, Enterococcus faecium DDE 39  and Bifidobacterium bifidum DDBA) was assayed. The effect of probiotic oral  administration on goats' weight, gut microbiota, as well as on the production of  mutagen compounds and their indicator (putrescine), were evaluated. The probiotic  supplement was able to modify microflora balance by reducing Enterobacteria like  Salmonella/Shigella (1.09 and 1.21 log CFU/g feces, respectively) and increasing  lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacteria (1.67 and 2.34 log CFU/g feces,  respectively). The probiotics administration was correlated with a ten time  diminution of fecal putrescine (cancer and bacterial disease marker) and a  decrease of 60% mutagen fecal concentration, indicating the protective effect of  the treatment. Additionally, a significant increase in ruminant weight was  observed after probiotic administration. These results are encouraging towards  the use of probiotic mixtures as functional food for goats.

AB  - Squalamine is a novel aminosterol recently isolated from the dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias. This water-soluble steroid exhibits potent antibacterial  activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. In addition,  squalamine is fungicidal and induces osmotic lysis of protozoa. We report here  the structural determination of squalamine, 3 beta-N-1-[N(3-[4-aminobutyl])-1,3  diaminopropane]-7 alpha,24 zeta-dihydroxy-5 alpha-cholestane 24-sulfate, which  was deduced from the analysis of fast atom bombardment spectra and a series of  two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Squalamine is a  cationic steroid characterized by a condensation of an anionic bile salt  intermediate with the polyamine, spermidine. This molecule is a potential  host-defense agent in the shark, and provides insight into a new class of  vertebrate antimicrobial molecules.

AB  - Pesticides such as malathion, commonly used in agriculture and households, are toxic substances that lead to reactive oxygen species generation, which harms  organisms. Ecotoxicological consequences of malathion, particularly its effects  on antioxidants in fish, are not well understood. Thus, we investigated the  effects of malathion (0.05 mg/L) on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant systems in  Carassius auratus gibelio kidney, intestine, and gills following exposure times  of 1, 2, 3, and 6 days. The lipid peroxidation and antioxidative defense  mechanisms display different responses in investigated tissues. The lipid  peroxidation was increased in all investigated tissues, especially after 1 day of  malathion administration. Changes in reduced glutathione levels have been  registered, mainly after 6 days of pesticide exposure. The modulation in the  activities of antioxidant enzymes, catalase, gluthatione peroxidase, glutathione  reductase, and glutathione-S-transferase was time and tissue specific. The  investigated parameters can be used as biomarkers of fish exposure to malathion.

AB  - We thank Dr Rahman Shiri (1) for his careful reading of our systematic review and meta-analysis on suicide among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers (2).  Our paper had the objective of providing a pooled effect size of suicide for this  occupational group. Suicide is a crucial issue in public and occupational health.  Suicide has a multifactorial etiology and recent systematic reviews and  meta-analyses have pointed out the role of occupational exposures, mainly  psychosocial work stressors, as risk factors for suicide (3, 4). Suicide is a  very rare event in the general population and still more seldom in the working  population. Indeed, unemployed and economically inactive people have a higher  risk of suicide compared to employed people (5, 6). However, the total number of  suicides is greater in the employed population than among the economically  inactive or unemployed (6). Shiri's letter (1) questioned several aspects of our  review and meta-analysis. One comment related to the single reference database  used in our review and a suggestion that our review could not be considered to be  systematic. The review was based on Medline because our main interest was in  quantitative epidemiologic studies. This is the largest database for biomedical  literature and we would argue the most pertinent. Furthermore, we checked the  reference lists of the most recent papers and literature reviews, and Shiri did  not report any paper that was missing. No review, whether searching one or more  databases, can expect to be totally exhaustive. There may always be missing  studies, especially if we consider grey literature. Thus we assert that our  review was systematic, while acknowledging that it may not be perfectly  comprehensive. Shiri suggested an absence of quality assessment of the studies  included in our meta-analysis. First, quality was considered in the context of  our comments in the discussion section. Second, as suggested by Rothman et al  (7), quality assessment was replaced by regression analyses of the effect of each  quality item (study characteristics, ie, study design, effect measure, reference  group, and adjustment). Third, because most studies included in this review were  based on objective data (census, administrative, or register data), they were  free of many of the sources of bias that exist in studies where information on  exposure and outcome must be collected from participants. Consequently, many of  the items related to quality were not pertinent, such as response and follow-up  rates, coverage and representativeness of the sample, selection, etc. Contrary to  what Shiri suggested, all study designs can be informative in this topic because  all of them are able to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect size. In  addition, the prospective and case-control studies may have shortcomings. For  example, we excluded five studies including three prospective and case-control  studies in the sensibility analysis because the group of interest was defined on  the basis of the exposure to chemicals (pesticides) rather than job title. Our  choice to retain the least adjusted models was justified because aggregated data  were used for the meta-analysis. Therefore, unless all included studies adjusted  for the same covariates measured in the same way, adjusted estimates cannot be  meaningfully provided in an aggregate data meta-analysis. In addition, as the  objective was above all descriptive and not etiological or explanatory, and as it  is the norm in the exploration of social inequalities in health (8), the results  from the least (gender- and age-) adjusted models were in line with the  objective. Indeed, including more adjustment variables could lead to  overadjustment as they may be intermediate variables on the causal pathways  between occupation and suicide. Our strategy was in line with previous  meta-analyses on similar topics (9-11). Consequently, we would argue that our  results are not likely to be largely due to confounding, contrary to the comment  by Shiri. Indeed, the study of the contribution of underlying factors in  explaining social inequalities in health outcomes is a fully-fledged topic of  research (12-15), but this is relevant research to conduct after demonstrating  that inequalities exist between social or occupational groups. Several of Shiri's  comments were about statistical aspects of our analyses. First, it was suggested  that we did not correctly extract the confidence intervals for the estimates of  several studies. We disagree. We used the STATA metan suite of commands using  log-transformed effect sizes and standard errors. Our figure 1 and the values of  effect sizes and confidence intervals were provided by STATA, this explains why  there may be small differences in these values compared with the results  published in some studies. Using log-transformed effect sizes and confidence  intervals, the analysis provided the same results. Second, our subgroup  comparison was based on subsamples that were independent. As not all studies  provided information for these subgroups, each subgroup was treated as a unit of  analysis. This strategy allows the use of all relevant subgroups and comparisons  between them (16). Third, we were also criticized for the use of random-effects  models. Random-effects models are generally more plausible for meta-analysis  based on studies from the published literature, because the fixed-effect model  assumed that the entire corpus of literature has been obtained, ie, that every  study has been or ever will be written on the topic has been included, which is  an implausible assumption. We also assumed differences in effect size between  studies and between subgroups, and the use of random-effects models was  consistent with such an assumption. However, random-effects models produce wider  confidence intervals compared to fixed-effect models (16). These models are thus  more conservative, making our results all the more robust. One of Shiri's  comments related to the reference group used in the studies for the comparison of  agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers. Although we reported that the  studies using a specific occupational group as reference group provided a higher  effect size than the studies using other reference groups, we did not explicitly  recognize and state in the paper that the results for Japan were based on two  studies using a specific occupational group as reference; we concede that this  may explain why we found a much more elevated effect size for Japan. Shiri's  results (1) allow to conclude that the difference between Japan and the other  geographic areas could be explained by the choice of reference group-we are  grateful to him for raising this point. However, we would note that the effect  size of suicide was still elevated and significant for agricultural, forestry,  and fishery workers even after this change in the reference group for these two  studies. Nevertheless, the choice of the optimal reference group is not obvious.  If we consider the general population as the reference group, as unemployed  people and economically inactive people (including people who may not be working  due to illness or disability) are part of it and have a higher risk of suicide  than employed people, the effect size provided by the nine studies using the  general population as the reference is likely to be underestimated, which may  contribute to an underestimation of the observed effect size of suicide among  agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers in our study. The comparison was made  in our paper with the other occupational groups (ie, the working population  except the group of interest) as the reference, which was used by nine other  studies, but this did not allow to determine the exact rank of the group of  interest in the occupational hierarchy. Another relevant choice would have been  to retain the group with the lowest suicide risk (for example, the high-skilled  occupational group) as the reference, which would have led to a much higher  effect size of suicide for agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers. To  conclude, as statistical power in detecting differences between subgroups may be  low in subgroup analyses and meta-regression, the absence of significant results  according to subgroups found in our results cannot be interpreted as evidence  that the effect size is the same across subgroups. Consequently, our  meta-analysis reporting a significant excess of risk of suicide among  agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers may also be a good incentive for more  research among this group of workers to (i) confirm this observed excess of risk  using differing methodological approaches to meta-analysis and (ii) explore the  potential differences within this group and the underlying factors that may  explain this excess of risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The widespread use of chemical insecticides, resistance in vectors and environmental problems, all have led to an increased interest in the use of  biological agents in malaria control programs. The most important functional  elements are the native fish. The aim of this study was to identify the native  species of lavivorous fish in Rudan County, southern Iran, to introduce an  effective species and to propose its' implementation in the national malaria  control program. METHODS: This ecologically descriptive study was conducted  during 2011-2012 using random sampling from different fish habitats of Rudan  County. The shoals of fish were caught using fishing net. Fish samples were then  identified in the Ichthyology lab, Department of Fisheries and the Environment,  Hormozgan University. RESULTS: Three species of larvivorous fish were identified  as follows: Gambusia holbrooki, Aphaniusdispar dispar and Aphanius sp. The latter  species has the most distribution in the study area and needs more morphological  and molecular studies for identification at the species level. CONCLUSION: Two  species of native fish, i.e., A. dispar and A. sp. with larvivorous potential  live in the area. Further studies on their predatory property are recommended in  order to apply this local potential against malaria vectors in the area.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A World War II defense site at Northway, Alaska, was remediated in the 1990s, leaving complex questions regarding historic exposures to toxic waste.  This article describes the context, methods, limitations and findings of the  Northway Wild Food and Health Project (NWFHP). OBJECTIVE: The NWFHP comprised 2  pilot studies: the Northway Wild Food Study (NWFS), which investigated  contaminants in locally prioritized traditional foods over time, and the Northway  Health Study (NHS), which investigated locally suspected links between resource  uses and health problems. DESIGN: This research employed mixed methods. The NWFS  reviewed remedial documents and existing data. The NHS collected household  information regarding resource uses and health conditions by questionnaire and  interview. NHS data represent general (yes or no) personal knowledge that was  often second hand. Retrospective cohort comparisons were made of the reported  prevalence of 7 general health problems between groups based on their reported  (yes or no) consumption of particular resources, for 3 data sets (existing,  historic and combined) with a two-tailed Fisher's Exact Test in SAS (n = 325  individuals in 83 households, 24 of which no longer exist). RESULTS: The NWFS  identified historic pathways of exposure to petroleum, pesticides, herbicides,  chlorinated byproducts of disinfection and lead from resources that were consumed  more frequently decades ago and are not retrospectively quantifiable. The NHS  found complex patterns of association between reported resource uses and cancer  and thyroid-, reproductive-, metabolic- and cardiac problems. CONCLUSION: Lack of  detail regarding medical conditions, undocumented histories of exposure, time  lapsed since the release of pollution and changes to health and health care over  the same period make this exploratory research. Rather than demonstrate  causation, these results document the legitimacy of local suspicions and warrant  additional investigation. This article presents our findings, with discussion of  limitations related to study design and limitations that are inherent to such  research.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine serum levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Siberian Yupik adults from St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, and to determine the  relative contribution of atmospheric transport of PCBs and local contamination to  body burdens. STUDY DESIGN: Siberian Yupiks of various ages were recruited from  three populations: residents of the village of Gambell, residents of the village  of Savoonga who did not have family hunting camps near the Northeast Cape (NEC),  a Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS) known to be contaminated with PCBs, and  residents of Savoonga whose families had a hunting camp at the NEC. METHODS:  Levels of PCBs were measured in serum samples from 130 people, ages 19-76. These  Alaska Natives follow a traditional diet high in marine mammals and fish, which  bioconcentrate organochlorine compounds that migrate to the Arctic via global air  transport and ocean currents. RESULTS: The lipid-adjusted serum PCB levels of  those members of families with hunting camps at the NEC had a mean lipid-adjusted  PCB concentration of 1,143 ppb, whereas other residents of Savoonga had values of  847 ppb and residents of Gambell had values of 785 ppb. CONCLUSIONS: Our  observations suggest that atmospheric transport of PCBs contributes to levels in  the Yupik people, but that the abandoned military site at the NEC may also  contribute to the human body burden in those individuals who have either spent  substantial time or consumed food from there.

AB  - Damaging effects of diazinon, an organophosphorus insecticide, on the gills of bluegills, Lepomis macrochirus, are many. Adult bluegills were exposed to 15, 30,  45, 60, and 75 micrograms/L of diazinon and their gills were microscopically  examined. Compared to the gill structure of the control fish, all the diazinon  concentrations caused various types of changes, such as lifting of the epithelial  layer, hyperplasia and necrosis, shortening of the lamellae and frequent  epithelial rupture, lamellar fusion, severe hyperplasia and mucous cells  hypertrophy, extensive fusion, and clavate lamellae. Some of the structural  changes may serve as a defense mechanism in protecting the fish from the  diazinon-contaminated water by increasing the diffusion distance. Increase in the  diffusion distance and mucus secretion can adversely affect the respiration of  the fish, ultimately leading to its death.

AU  - Browne, Amanda M.

T2  - Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology
AB  - The widespread use of herbicides across the globe has increased the probability of synthetic chemicals entering freshwater habitats. On entering aquatic  habitats, these chemicals target and disrupt both physiological and behavioral  functioning in various aquatic organisms. Herbicides, such as  2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), can have negative impacts on  chemoreception because these receptor cells are in direct contact with  water-soluble chemicals in the environment. Studies focusing on lethal  concentration (LC50) levels may understate the impact of herbicides within  aquatic habitats because damage to the chemoreceptors can result in modified  behaviors or lack of appropriate responses to environmental or social cues. The  purpose of this experiment was to determine whether exposure to sublethal levels  of 2,4-D alters the foraging behaviors of crayfish Orconectes rusticus. We  hypothesized that crayfish exposed to greater concentrations of 2,4-D would be  less successful in locating food or on locating food would consume smaller  amounts possibly due to an inability to recognize the food odors in the  contaminated waters. Crayfish were exposed to three sublethal levels of 2,4-D for  96 h and placed into a Y-maze system with a fish gelatin food source placed  randomly in the right or left arm. Average walking speed, average time spent in  the correct arm, and percent consumption were analyzed. Our data show that  crayfish were impaired in their ability to forage effectively. These inabilities  to locate and consume adequate amounts of food could result in lower body weights  and decreased fitness in populations of crayfish exposed to 2,4-D in natural  habitats.

T2  - Journal of environmental sciences (China)
AB  - While the spatial distribution pattern of fish is increasingly used for toxicological test of chemicals or wastewater, no ideal parameter is available  for quantitative assessment of spatial distribution, especially uneven  distribution with multiple hotspots. Here, to develop a quantitative assessment  parameter for spatial distribution, the zebrafish were exposed to ethanol,  pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), paraquat dichloride (paraquat) and wastewater, followed  by a behavioral test in a narrow tank. Behavioral data was acquired and analyzed  by idTracker and MATLAB. By comparing the effects of all treatments on behavior  parameters, we confirmed that the spatial distribution was more easily altered  rather than general locomotor parameters, e.g. 0.7-70 mg/L PTZ and 5-20 mg/L  paraquat being effective for altering spatial distribution but having little  effects on general locomotor parameters. Based on the heatmap, i.e., the  cumulative proportion of grids and that of frequency in grids, we calculated the  behavioral Gini coefficient (G(b)) for quantitative assessment of fish spatial  distribution. The Gini coefficient ranged from zero to 1, with larger values  meaning poorer evenness of spatial distribution. Of note, G(b) showed smaller  coefficient of variations (CV) with 3%-19% between replicate tanks in all  treatments than the highest frequency (4%-79%), displaying well robustness.  Especially, G(b) addressed the challenge of the complicated heatmap with multiple  hotspots. Overall, the behavioral Gini coefficient we established is an ideal  parameter to quantitatively assess spatial distribution of fish shoal, which is  expected to be applied in toxicity testing for chemicals and wastewater and  automatic quality monitoring for surface water and aquaculture water.

T2  - Oecologia
AB  - In aquatic environments, externally developing eggs are in constant contact with the surrounding water, highlighting the significance of water parameters and  pathogens for egg survival. In this study we tested the impact of water salinity,  egg density and infection potential of the environment on egg viability in the  sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus), a small fish that exhibits paternal egg care  and has a marine origin, but which in the Baltic Sea lives in brackish water. To  manipulate the infection potential of the environment, we added either a  Saprolegnia infection vector into UV-filtered water or a fungicide into natural  Baltic Sea water. Saprolegnia are widely spread water moulds that are a key cause  of egg mortality in aquatic organisms in fresh- and brackish water. We found that  increased water salinity indeed decreased the egg infection rate and had a  positive effect on egg viability, while high egg density tended to have the  opposite effect. However, the different factors influenced egg viability  interactively, with a higher egg density having negative effects at low, but not  in high, salinity. Thus, the challenges facing marine organisms adapting to lower  salinity levels can be amplified by Saprolegnia infections that reduce egg  survival in interaction with other environmental factors. Our results support the  hypothesis that suppressing egg infections is an important aspect of parental  care that can select for filial cannibalism, a common but poorly understood  behaviour, especially in fish with parental care.

AB  - The study investigated the capacity of diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)2] (3.0mg/kg), on reduce the oxidative damage in liver, gills and muscle of carp and silver  catfish exposed to clomazone (192h). Silver catfish exposed to clomazone showed  increased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) in liver and muscle and  protein carbonyl in liver and gills. Furthermore, clomazone in silver catfish  decrease non-protein thiols (NPSH) in liver and gills and glutathione peroxidase  and ascorbic acid in liver. (PhSe)2 reversed the effects caused by clomazone in  silver catfish, preventing increases in TBARS and protein carbonyl. Moreover,  NPSH and ascorbic acid were increased by values near control. The results suggest  that (PhSe)2 attenuated the oxidative damage induced by clomazone in silver  catfish. The clomazone no caused an apparent situation of oxidative stress in  carp, showing that this species is more resistant to this toxicant. Altogether,  the containing (PhSe)2 diet helps fish to increase antioxidants defenses.

AB  - Dicamba (DIC) is one of the most applied auxin herbicides worldwide. Sublethal effects in the South American native fish Jenynsia lineata exposed to DIC  concentrations close to environmental concentrations (0.03-30 µg/L) during 48 h  were analysed thorough the evaluation of catalase (CAT), glutathione  S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and malondialdehyde  (MDA) and H(2)O(2) levels for detecting potential oxidative stress. In gills MDA  increased showing oxidative damage probably because of an inefficient antioxidant  defense. This response evidenced the important role of gills as an organ of  direct contact with waterborne contaminants. In addition, other changes in the  biomarkers of oxidative stress were observed such as the inhibition of SOD  activities in brain and the inhibition of GST in liver. These results show that  short- term exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations of DIC could  induce sublethal effects in native fish.

T2  - Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
AB  - Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is an organophosphate ester (OPE) used as a flame retardant (FR) and plasticizer. TPHP has previously been shown to disrupt  behaviour in fish and mammals, but to our knowledge, this is the first study on  the behavioural effects of TPHP in birds. Early life stage Japanese quail  (Coturnix japonica) were exposed to nominal doses of 0 ng/g (vehicle-control),  5 ng/g (low dose), 50 ng/g (mid dose), and 100 ng/g (high dose) TPHP, both as  embryos (via air cell injection prior to incubation) and as chicks (via daily  gavage until 5 days post-hatch). The low dose reflects TPHP levels recorded in  wild avian eggs, but actual environmental exposure levels may be higher given  that TPHP is known to be rapidly metabolized in birds. We previously reported  that the chicks exposed to TPHP in this study experienced reduced growth and  resting metabolic rate, and sex-specific changes in thyroid function. The current  study focuses on behavioural endpoints. We found that high-TPHP chicks exhibited  less neophobia than vehicle-controls, and low-TPHP chicks exhibited more  aggression towards conspecifics. No differences were observed in the responses of  Japanese quail chicks to activity or tonic immobility (fear response) tests.  These data add weight of evidence to previous findings suggesting that TPHP,  among other OPEs, can disrupt ecologically-relevant behaviours in exposed  vertebrates.

AB  - This study describes the use of a panel of immune assays, originally developed by the National Toxicology Program for assessing xenobiotic-induced immunotoxicity  in mice, to quantify the effects of sublethal malathion exposure on the immune  responses of fish. For this study, Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed  subchronically to the organophosphate pesticide malathion in a series of two  experiments. In the first set of studies, fish were exposed for 7 or 14 d to  untreated well water (i.e., controls) or to waterborne malathion at 0.2 or 0.8  mg/L. Following exposure, fish from each group were sacrificed and their kidneys  (primary organ of leukopoiesis in fish and equivalent to mammalian bone marrow)  were used to provide cells for assessing any malathion-induced effects upon  nonspecific and acquired immune defense mechanisms. Effects upon humoral-mediated  immunity were determined by enumerating antibody plaque-forming cell (PFC)  numbers from a subset of fish exposed to malathion for 14 d and then injected  intraperitoneally (ip) with sheep erythrocytes (sRBC). Results of these studies  demonstrated that while malathion exposure had no significant effect upon  hematocrit/leukocrit values or upon mitogen-stimulated T-cell  lymphoproliferation, PFC numbers in the kidney of exposed fish were significantly  reduced (compared to control fish) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, total  recoverable kidney cell numbers and viability, as well as superoxide anion  production by kidney phagocytes, were reduced slightly (compared to control  values) in fish exposed for 14 d to the highest malathion concentration tested.  In the second set of experiments, medaka exposed for up to 21 d to either 0.1 or  0.3 mg malathion/L were challenged ip with an LD50 dose of the bacterial fish  pathogen Yersinia ruckeri. Results from these infectivity studies demonstrated  that exposure to either malathion concentration, for 14 or 21 d reduced host  resistance against Yersinia infection. Taken together, these findings demonstrate  the applicability of mammalian immune assays for predicting malathion-induced  immunosuppression in a teleost fish, as well as the potential utility of a small  laboratory fish to serve as an alternate model for mammals in immunotoxicological  studies.

T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - The present communication deals with the effects of fenitrothion (0.02 mg/liter) on the energy metabolism of the European eel, Anguilla anguilla, and its recovery  from intoxication. Various parameters such as glycogen, lactate, proteins, and  glucose levels were measured in different eel tissues after 2, 8, 12, 24, 32, 48,  56, 72, and 96 hr of fenitrothion exposure. Subsequently, the fish were allowed  recovery periods of 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 144, and 192 hr in clean water, and  the same parameters were evaluated. Liver glycogen content showed no significant  changes during the exposure time, while blood glucose levels increased markedly.  Gill, liver, and blood lactate values increased during pesticide exposure, while  proteins decreased in comparison to unexposed controls. Most of the metabolic  disorders did not persist after eels were allowed to recover in clean water for  less than a week. The observed effects of fenitrothion on fish metabolism are  discussed in relation to a stress syndrome, as are probable reasons for  alterations.

AB  - Benzoxazinones (BAs) are natural products that are present in Gramineae and represent part of the plant defence system against pests. In recent years,  sprouts of maize, wheat and rye have been used for the production of dietary  supplements. We have investigated the potential genotoxic activities of a diverse  range of synthetic derivatives of the most abundant natural BA, namely DIBOA  (2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one), proposed for use as a potential herbicide.  We have tested 18 synthetic BAs for potential effects in cultured HeLa cells. We  found significantly higher micronucleus (MN) induction over the background level,  with the solvent DMSO used as an internal control. Concentration-dependent  effects were found between 1nM and 20nM for all the synthetic compounds studied.  Immunostaining with an anticentromere antibody showed that >80% of MN induced  gave a centromere-positive signal. Similarly, fluorescence in situ hybridization  (FISH) analysis with alphoid centromere probes showed a positive hybridization  signal, indicating that all compounds analyzed are aneugenic. Chemical  modification of the N in the heterocyclic aromatic amine served us to suggest a  relationship between the structure and the aneugenic effects of the compounds  analyzed. Our findings indicate that benzoxazinoids could be potential genotoxins  for human cells.

AB  - Tattoo belongs to the group of carbamate fungicides and contains Mancozeb (ethylene(bis)dithiocarbamate) as its main constituent. The toxicity of Mancozeb  to living organisms, particularly fish, is not resolved. This work investigated  the effects of 96 h of exposure to 3, 5, or 10 mg L(-1) of Tattoo (corresponding  to 0.9, 1.5, or 3 mg L(-1) of Mancozeb) on the levels of oxidative stress markers  and the antioxidant enzyme system of brain, liver, and kidney of goldfish,  Carassius auratus). In liver, Tattoo exposure resulted in increased activities of  superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 70%-79%, catalase by 23%-52% and glutathione  peroxidase (GPx) by 49%. The content of protein carbonyls (CP) in liver was also  enhanced by 92%-125% indicating extensive damage to proteins. Similar increases  in CP levels (by 98%-111%) accompanied by reduced glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase activity (by 13%-15%) was observed in kidney of fish exposed to  Tattoo; however, SOD activity increased by 37% in this tissue after treatment  with 10 mg L(-1) Tattoo. In brain, a rise in lipid peroxide level (by 29%) took  place after exposure to 10 mg L(-1) Tattoo and was accompanied by elevation of  high-molecular mass thiols (by 14%). Tattoo exposure also resulted in a  concentration-dependent decrease in glutathione reductase activity (by 26%-37%)  in brain. The data collectively show that exposure of goldfish to 3-10 mg L(-1)  of the carbamate fungicide Tattoo resulted in the development of mild oxidative  stress and activation of antioxidant defense systems in goldfish tissues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the advances in medical therapy and technology, the prognosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains poor and the need for disease  prevention based on identifying the risk factors becomes mandatory. Occupational  and environmental exposures were studied in several countries and found to play  important role in the disease development. However, in Egypt, a little attention  has been paid to study the effect of these factors in the disease development.  OBJECTIVE: To identify the occupational and environmental risk factors associated  with the development of IPF in Egypt. METHODS: A multicenter hospital-based  case-control study was carried out in chest hospitals affiliated to three  Egyptian cities-Cairo, Tanta and Mansoura. Subjects were 201 patients with  confirmed IPF (cases) and 205 age-, sex- and residence-matched controls. Data on  occupational and environmental factors were obtained from a questionnaire.  Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent risk  factors of IPF in both sexes for single factors with adjustment for age,  residence and smoking status. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the risk of  IPF in male workers was observed to increase significantly in chemical and  petrochemical industries and carpentry and wood working (OR = 2.56, 95% CI:  1.02-7.01), and with occupational exposures to wood dust and wood preservatives.  Among female workers, a significant increase was observed in farming (OR = 3.34,  95% CI: 1.17-10.12), raising birds and occupational exposures to animal feeds,  products and dusts and pesticides. Risk of IPF decreased significantly in male  workers and insignificantly among female workers in sales and clerical related  activities. The environmental exposures to birds and cats were significantly  associated with elevated risk of IPF development in both sexes. CONCLUSION: In  Egypt, farming, raising birds and wood working are important risk factors for the  development of IPF.

A structured and pre-tested questionnaire was applied to obtain the data. A  probabilistic sample was used. The prevalence of each of the outcomes of interest  by area was calculated. To verify the existence of an association between the  outcomes of interest and other variables (qualitative), by area, a descriptive  analysis and to compare percentages and a comparison test was used between two  proportions, a Chi-square test and/or a Fisher's exact test and a Kruska-wallis  and Dunn multiple comparison were used as well. The significance level was  5%.Results: Most residents (94%) reported the use of public health services at  least once a year (p < 0.001), mainly through the Basic Health Units (BHU)  (p < 0.001). Most of the studied population (65%) did not have private health  insurance and their schooling was basically restricted to primary education  (p < 0.001). The predominant family income (70%) in the three areas was between  one and five minimum wages (p < 0.001), with a higher incidence of people  receiving one to three minimum wages at the time. The demand for health services  was not associated with education or income.Conclusion: The population of the  regions analysed heavily rely on the Unified Health System - SUS, but there was  no association between income and frequency of health services and there was also  no association between education and use of health services.

AB  - High resistance to benzimidazole fungicides in Venturia carpophila is caused by the point mutation E198K of the β-tubulin (TUB2) gene. Traditional methods for  detection of fungicide resistance are time-consuming, which are routinely based  on tedious operation, reliance on expensive equipment, and specially trained  people. Therefore, it is important to establish efficient methods for field  detection of benzimidazole resistance in V. carpophila to make suitable  management strategies and ensure food safety. Based on recombinase polymerase  amplification (RPA) combined with CRISPR/Cas12a, a rapid one-pot assay  ORCas12a-BRVc (one-pot RPA-CRISPR/Cas12 platform) was established for the  detection of benzimidazole resistance in V. carpophila. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay  enabled one-pot detection by adding components at the bottom and wall of the tube  separately, solving the problems of aerosol contamination and decreased  sensitivity caused by competing DNA substrates between Cas12a cleavage and RPA  amplification. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay could accomplish the detection with a  minimum of 7.82 × 10(3) fg μL(-1) V. carpophila genomic DNA in 45 min at 37 °C.  Meanwhile, this assay showed excellent specificity due to the specific  recognition ability of the Cas12a-crRNA complex. Further, we combined a method  that could rapidly extract DNA from V. carpophila within 2 min with the  ORCas12a-BRVc to achieve more rapid and simple detection of V. carpophila with  benzimidazole resistance in fields. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay has the advantages of  simplicity, rapidity, high sensitivity, high specificity, and ease of operation  without the need for precision instruments and the need to isolate and culture  pathogens. This assay is the first application of the one-pot platform based on  the combination of RPA and CRISPR/Cas12a in fungicide resistance detection and  can be used for monitoring of resistant populations in fields, providing guidance  on making suitable management strategies for peach scab.

AB  - The effects of the triazine herbicide prometryne, commonly present in surface and ground waters, on oxidative stress and antioxidant status of common carp  (Cyprinus carpio) were investigated. Fish were exposed to sublethal  concentrations of prometryne (0.51, 8, and 80μg/l) for 14, 30, and 60 days.  Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase  (GR), as well as levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) were  assessed in brain, gill, intestine, liver, and muscle. After 14 days exposure,  decreased GR activity in brain was observed for all prometryne-exposed groups  compared with the controls. Changes were observed in SOD activity in brain and  gill after 30 days in all exposure groups. Changes in CAT activity were observed  only at the highest concentration (80μg/l) in liver and intestine after 60 days.  The observed effects on carp antioxidant systems may be a defense against  oxidative damage. The study demonstrated changes in antioxidant parameters and  the importance of evaluating the potential long-term risk to fish of prometryne,  at environmentally realistic concentrations (0.51μg/l). The results suggest that  antioxidant responses may have potential as biomarkers for monitoring residual  triazine herbicides in aquatic environments.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This work assessed the subchronic effects of the triazine compounds terbuthylazine and metribuzin on embryo-larval stages of common carp (Cyprinus  carpio L.) using biotransformation enzyme and selected oxidative stress  parameters. DESIGN: Early developmental stages of fish, from embryo to larvae,  were exposed to terbuthylazine at concentrations of 0.9, 160, 520, and 820 μg/L,  and metribuzin at concentrations of 0.9, 4, 14, and 32 mg/L for 30 days and  compared to the non-treated control group. For assessment of free radical defence  the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR)  were measured; the lipid peroxidation (TBARS) level was determined as a marker of  free radical damage. RESULTS: Terbuthylazine had no significant effect (p>0.05)  at any tested concentrations on GST activity. Terbuthylazine caused an increase  (p<0.05) in GR activity at the concentration of 520 μg/L. We found a  non-significant (p>0.05) effect of terbuthylazine exposure on TBARS level. In  metribuzin treated groups, the activity of GST was increased (p<0.05) in all  experimental groups, with the highest at the concentration of 32 mg/L. GR  activity was increased in the 0.9, 4, and 14 mg/L groups and the TBARS levels  were the highest in the 0.9 mg/L group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that  terbuthylazine and metribuzin induced oxidative stress in embryo-larval stages of  common carp. Increased activities of biotransformation enzymes or antioxidant  defence enzymes were markers of free radical attack. There was low lipid  peroxidation in early developed fish after triazine exposure.

AB  - The study was carried out for evaluation of various activities of malaria control programme in five different tribal and malaria endemic Primary Health Centres of  Dumka district (Jharkhand) during 2007-08. A total of 321 houses of 18 villages  were surveyed on use of indoor residual spray (IRS) and insecticide-treated bed  nets (ITN) and other activities as tool for vector control and interrupting the  transmission of malaria. Out of 690 living rooms and 343 verandahs examined, IRS  with Dichlorodiphenyl-trichloro-ethane (DDT) was done only in 16.23% living rooms  and 64.72% verandahs. Refusal rate of IRS in living rooms was 81.93% due to lack  of knowledge regarding the importance of IRS, no prior information to villagers,  houses locked, reluctance to remove domestic articles, dislike of smell of DDT  spray. Compliance rate of ITN uses was 71.66% during the night, which might be a  factor for decline in malaria cases in the study area. Various important  components of the programme, viz. surveillance and compliance to treatment  activities, use of rapid diagnostic test kits (RDKs), involvement of accredited  social health activist (ASHA's) and fever treatment depots (FTDs), laboratory  activities, adult mosquito collection, other activities like constitution of  village health sanitation committee, information education and communication  activities, capacity building, use of larvivorous fishes, supervision of IRS etc.  require much strengthening. However, 100% community acceptance was recorded for  ITN in the villages surveyed. In addition, an entomological study was carried out  for information on prevalence of mosquito species in this area to find out  effectiveness of IRS activities. Eleven anopheline species, including three  malaria vectors i.e., An. culicifacies, An. stephensi, An. fluviatilis, An.  annularis, An. subpictus, An. nigerrimus, An. pallidus, An. aconitus, An. vagus,  An. jamsii and An. splendidus were collected from cattle and human dwellings.

AB  - Nisin is an antimicrobial peptide with bacterial, fungicidal, virucidal properties, attacking bacteria and destroying the cell membranes. Thanks to its  stability to hard conditions, it is a candidate for the use as molecular  recognition elements in biosensing platform. In this work, the use of nisin as a  biological molecule for the development of a sensitive biosensor for bacteria  detection is reported: nisin molecules were immobilised on gold electrodes and  Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy was to investigate the electrochemical  responses after the exposure of the biosensor to different bacteria. The  biosensor was able to detect all bacterium tested with different impedimetric  responses; the singular impedimetric behaviours recorded after the exposure to  pathogenic and non - pathogenic Salmonella strains, highlighted the possibility  of the proposed biosensor to detect selectively Salmonella cells with a low limit  of detection of 1.5 * 10(1) CFU/mL. Finally, the developed biosensor was used to  detect Salmonella in milk.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of persistent organochlorine compounds through the dietary intake of fatty fish from the Baltic  Sea on human fertility. METHODS: Information on time to pregnancy, subfertility,  and infertility was collected retrospectively by self-administered questionnaires  in 2 cohorts of fishermen's wives from the Swedish east (by the Baltic Sea) and  west coasts. In addition to cohort affiliation, current fish consumption and  growing up in a fishing village were used as proxies for exposure within the  eastcoast cohort. RESULTS: A decreased success (ie, pregnancy) rate and a  tendency towards increased subfertility was found for heavy smokers (> or =10  cigarettes/day) in the eastcoast cohort as compared with the westcoast cohort  [success rate ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.49-.89; subfertility  odds ratio 1.64, 95% CI 0.91-2.91). However, internal analyses within the  eastcoast cohort did not show that growing up in a fishing village or high  current fish consumption decreased the success rate. Eastcoast cohort affiliation  showed an increased risk for infertility (odds ratio 2.49, 95% CI 1.05-5.92).  CONCLUSIONS: The present data give some support for a negative association  between exposure to persistent organochlorine compounds and fertility among heavy  smokers. However, when the proxy exposure measures are also considered, the  findings are not consistent. Better individual exposure assessments should be  used before more firm conclusions are drawn.

AB  - Salmonella encounters but survives host inflammatory response. To defend host-generated oxidants, Salmonella encodes primary antioxidants and protein  repair enzymes. Methionine (Met) residues are highly prone to oxidation and  convert into methionine sulfoxide (Met-SO) which compromises protein functions  and subsequently cellular survival. However, by reducing Met-SO to Met,  methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) enhance cellular survival under stress  conditions. Salmonella encodes five Msrs which are specific for particular Met-SO  (free/protein bound), and 'R'/'S' types. Earlier studies assessed the effect of  deletions of one or two msrs on the stress physiology of S. Typhimurium. We  generated a pan msr gene deletion (Δ5msr) strain in S. Typhimurium. The Δ5msr  mutant strain shows an initial lag in in vitro growth. However, the Δ5msr mutant  strain depicts very high sensitivity (p < 0.0001) to hypochlorous acid (HOCl),  chloramine T (ChT) and superoxide-generating oxidant paraquat. Further, the Δ5msr  mutant strain shows high levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls, and  protein aggregation. On the other side, the Δ5msr mutant strain exhibits lower  levels of free amines. Further, the Δ5msr mutant strain is highly susceptible to  neutrophils and shows defective fitness in the spleen and liver of mice. The  results of the current study suggest that the deletions of all msrs render S.  Typhimurium highly prone to oxidative stress and attenuate its virulence.

AB  - The multi-xenobiotics resistance (MXR) mechanisms are the first line of defense against toxic substances in aquatic organisms and present great importance in the  adaptation related to contaminated environments. Methyl parathion (MP) is a  widely used organophosphate pesticide, which has been associated to various toxic  effects in organisms. In the present work, we studied the main genes related to  efflux transporters in zebrafish liver (ZFL) cells exposed to MP with and without  an inhibitor of ABC transporters (verapamil). The results concerning transporters  activity showed that the MXR mechanism is activated to detoxify from methyl  parathion. The toxic effects of MP on ZFL cells were increased in the presence of  the efflux transporter inhibitor, once cell viability was significantly decreased  in co-exposure experiments. The combined exposure to MP and the inhibitor caused  an increase in gene expression of P-gp1 (Abcb1) and MRP4 (Abcc4), suggesting that  these transporters isoforms are associated with MP efflux. In general, the  expression of genes related to the antioxidant defense system (ADS) was  significantly increased in ZFL cells co-exposed to MP and verapamil. These data  provide useful insights for better understanding of MP detoxification mechanism  in fish hepatocytes.

AB  - Intensive use of pesticides, particularly dithiocarbamates, in agriculture often leads to contamination of freshwater ecosystems. To our knowledge, the mechanisms  of toxicity to fish by the carbamate fungicide Tattoo that contains mancozeb  [ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate)] have not been studied. The present study aimed to  evaluate the effects of Tattoo on goldfish gills and blood, tissues that would  have close early contact with the pollutant. Exposure of goldfish Carassius  auratus to 3, 5 or 10mgL(-1) of Tattoo for 96h resulted in moderate lymphopenia  (by 8 percent) with a concomitant increase in both stab (by 66-88 percent) and  segmented (by 166 percent) neutrophils. An increase in the content of protein  carbonyl groups in blood (by 137-184 percent) together with decreased levels of  protein thiols (by 23 percent) and an enhancement of lipid peroxide  concentrations (by 29 percent) in gills after exposure to 10mgL(-1) of Tattoo  demonstrated the induction of mild oxidative stress in response to Tattoo  exposure. At the same time, the activities of selected antioxidant enzymes were  enhanced in gills: superoxide dismutase by 18-25 percent and catalase by 27  percent. A 34 percent increment in low molecular mass thiol concentrations  (mainly represented by glutathione) also occurred in gills and could be related  to increased activity (by 13-30 percent) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.  The results indicate that Tattoo exposure perturbs free radical processes, i.e.  induces mild oxidative stress and enhances the activity of certain antioxidant  and associated enzymes in goldfish gills. It is clear that goldfish respond to  the presence of waterborne pesticide by adjusting antioxidant defenses through  upregulation of activities of antioxidant and associated enzymes.

T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - The euryhaline fish, Oreochromis mossambicus was exposed to sub-lethal concentration (30 microg/L) of profenofos (PF) for 28 days and allowed to recover  for 7 days. Responses were evaluated through antioxidant enzyme activities in  various tissues of fish. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase  (SOD) activities showed transient increases in gill, viscera and muscle, but  decreased in brain. However, catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) were  inhibited in gill and viscera. Reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were depleted in  all the tissues and a significant induction in lipid peroxidation (LPO) was  observed. Significant recovery in all the studied parameters was noticed at the  end of recuperation period. The enhanced LPO in the present study suggests that  reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative damage could be one of the main  toxic effect of PF. The increased LPO and alterations in the antioxidant defense  system can be used as biomarkers in the pesticide-contaminated aquatic streams.

AB  - Recently, residual fungicides are generally recognized as relevant sources of aquatic environmental pollutants. However, the toxicological effects of these  contaminants have not been adequately researched. In this study, the chronic  effect of PCZ, a triazole-containing fungicide commonly present in aquatic  environment, on GSH-related antioxidant system and oxidative stress indices of  rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were investigated. Fish were exposed at  sub-lethal concentrations of PCZ (0.2, 50 and 500 microg/L) for 7, 20 and 30  days. GSH levels and GSH-related enzyme activities, including GPx, GR and GST,  were quantified in three tissues-liver, gill and muscle. The levels of LPO and CP  were also measured as makers of oxidative damage. In addition, the correlations  of the measured parameters in various tissues were evaluated by using PCA. The  results of this study indicate that chronic exposure of PCZ has resulted in  different responses in various tissues and the gill was the most sensitive  tissue; however, before these parameters are used as potential biomarkers for  monitoring residual fungicides in aquatic environment, more detailed experiments  in laboratory need to be performed in the future.

AB  - Assessing toxicity of contaminated estuarine sediments poses a challenge to ecotoxicologists due to the complex geochemical nature of sediments and to the  combination of multiple classes of toxicants. Juvenile Senegalese soles were  exposed for 14 days in the laboratory and in situ (field) to sediments from three  sites (a reference plus two contaminated) of a Portuguese estuary. Sediment  characterization confirmed the combination of metals, polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons and organochlorines in the two contaminated sediments. Changes in  liver cytosolic protein regulation patterns were determined by a combination of  two-dimensional electrophoresis with de novo sequencing by tandem mass  spectrometry. From the forty-one cytosolic proteins found to be deregulated,  nineteen were able to be identified, taking part in multiple cellular processes  such as anti-oxidative defence, energy production, proteolysis and contaminant  catabolism (especially oxidoreductase enzymes). Besides a clear distinction  between animals exposed to the reference and contaminated sediments, differences  were also observed between laboratory- and in situ-tested fish. Soles exposed in  the laboratory to the contaminated sediments failed to induce, or even markedly  down-regulated, many proteins, with the exception of a peroxiredoxin (an  anti-oxidant enzyme) and a few others, when compared to reference fish. In situ  exposure to the contaminated sediments revealed significant up-regulation of  basal metabolism-related enzymes, comparatively to the reference condition.  Down-regulation of basal metabolism enzymes, related to energy production and  gene transcription, in fish exposed in the laboratory to the contaminated  sediments, may be linked to sediment-bound contaminants and likely compromised  the organisms' ability to deploy adequate responses against insult.

The TEP  values of several (CO)3Ni-NHC-X systems with five different ditopic NHC ligand  systems [triazolyldiylidene (A), bis(imidazolylidene) (B),  benzobis(imidazolylidene) (C), cyclopenta[f,g]acenaphthylenebis(imidazolylidene)  (D) and bis(imidazolidinylidene) (F)] were determined by means of DFT  calculations. Based on these values, the electron-withdrawing character of the X  metal fragments employed in this study was found to increase in the order  IrCp(CO) → RhCl(COD) → Ni(CO)3 → Cr(CO)5 → RhCl(CO)2. We found that the degree of  electronic interaction through the ditopic NHC ligands is the strongest in A,  followed by B and F, while being weak in B and C. The TEP values and the  quantitative analysis of the upper molecular orbitals of A and F and their  (CO)3Ni-NHC-Ni(CO)3 complexes strongly suggest that the principal electronic  interaction between the metal centres of the M-NHC-M' complexes is of σ-type, via  the delocalized HOMO and HOMO - 1 orbitals of the NHC ligands.

AB  - We have investigated the effect of free radicals on the electrical gap junctions between horizontal cells in the carp retina. In our previous study, L-buthionine  sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, caused uncoupling of  horizontal cells four days after injection. In the present study, we have used  paraquat, a generator of exogenous reactive oxygen species, to investigate  whether it was the depletion of glutathione or an increase in the level of  reactive oxygen species which resulted in horizontal cell uncoupling after  L-buthionine sulfoximine injection. Intracellular recordings were made from  L-type horizontal cells at various time-points after intravitreal injection of  paraquat. Injection of 25nmol paraquat caused an increase in response amplitude  to central spot light stimuli by two days after injection, which continued for a  further two to three days and had almost disappeared by seven days after  injection. There was also a sharp increase in reactive oxygen species production,  peaking at four days and disappearing by seven days after injection, and an  accompanying depletion and a restoration of glutathione levels with a similar  time-course. Marking cells with Lucifer Yellow clearly illustrated uncoupling of  horizontal cells after paraquat injection. If paraquat and L-buthionine  sulfoximine were injected simultaneously, the increase in response to central  spots was observed as early as one day after injection. This response amplitude  was not more enhanced than that observed after L-buthionine sulfoximine injection  alone, although a dramatic increase in the level of reactive oxygen species was  observed. From these results, we suggest that reactive oxygen species are  involved in uncoupling, while recovery from uncoupling is dependent on  glutathione. Furthermore, we conclude that a balance between glutathione and  reactive oxygen species levels is the most important factor controlling gap  junctional intercellular communication of L-type horizontal cells in the carp  retina.

T2  - Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe environmental health problems encountered in some Ontario family practices and to describe differences between the environmental concerns  of urban (small and large) and rural physicians. DESIGN: A self-completed  questionnaire was mailed to 536 family physicians with hospital affiliations in  three areas of Ontario. SETTING: Family practices (rural, small urban, and large  urban) in Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Of 521 eligible community family physicians with  hospital affiliations, 214 returned usable questionnaires for a 41% response  rate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Environmental health problems encountered in  practice were measured using questions about physician concerns, reported patient  questions, physician-identified high-risk groups, problems related to  environmental exposure, self-rated knowledge, and current and preferred sources  of information on environmental health effects. RESULTS: Physicians were highly  concerned and reported many patient questions about the health effects of  environmental exposures. Pregnant women, agricultural workers, and children were  considered important at-risk groups. Self-ratings of knowledge were generally  very low. Rural physicians were concerned about agricultural pesticide exposure  and their patients about moldy hay. Urban physicians had different concerns about  lead and reported patient concerns about exposure to Great Lakes fish. All groups  used similar sources of current environmental health information. CONCLUSIONS:  Family physicians who participated in this study identified important patient and  professional concerns about environmental health issues and reported a lack of  resources to meet those concerns. This study provides information to family  medicine residency programs and continuing medical education providers to help  them enhance their focus on environmental health.

T2  - Biochemical and biophysical research communications
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the SoxR regulon orchestrates genes for defense against certain types of oxidative stress through the SoxR-regulated synthesis of the  SoxS transcription activator. The Pseudomonas putida genome did not reveal a  clear soxS homolog. The P. putida SoxR protein appears to be functional: its  expression in an E. coli DeltasoxR strain restored the paraquat inducibility of  soxS. Of nine candidate P. putida oxidative stress genes, which are known to be  SoxR regulon in E. coli, tested for response to superoxide or nitric oxide,  fumC-1, sodA, zwf-1, and particularly fpr, encoding ferredoxin:NADP(+) reductase,  were induced, all independent of P. putida soxR. Disruption of the fpr and finR,  a regulatory protein that is required for paraquat-dependent expression of the  fpr, resulted in more oxidative stress sensitivity. However, a P. putida  soxR-deletion strain had normal resistance to the superoxide-generating agent  paraquat. The data presented here show that the genetic responses to superoxide  stress in P. putida differ markedly from those seen in E. coli and Salmonella,  and the role of P. putida soxR remains to be established.

TI  - Impact of low dose of organophosphate, monocrotophos on the epithelial cells of gills of Cyprinus carpio communis Linn.--SEM study.
AU  - Johal, M. S.

T2  - Journal of environmental biology
AB  - The paper deals with the deleterious changes at ultrastructural level of the epithelial cells of gills of Cyprinus carpio communis Linn. upon exposure to  1/10th of LC50 of monocrotophos which is considered to be insignificant  concentration from toxicological point of view. The gills of the fish are the  primary corridor formolecularexchange between the internal milieu of a fish and  its environment. Gills perform numerous functions such as oxygen uptake and CO2  excretion, osmoregulation, acid-basic balance, excretion of nitrogenous compounds  and taste. Hazardous chemicals present in water may alter the morphology of the  epithelial cells of gills of the fish, which may affect the process of diffusion  of gases and ultimately the overall health of the fish. To prove this fact  Cyprinus carpio communis Linn. was kept in water for 30 days having low  concentration of 0.038 ppm (1\10th of LC50) of monocrotophos and an attempt was  made to study the different types of degenerations produced in the epithelial  cells of gills as compared to the normal epithelial cells of gills of this  culturable fish using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) technique. The  ultrastructural changes due to the toxic exposure at finer scale were thinning of  microridges, upliftment of epithelial cells, development of hyperplasia, decrease  in the density of mucous cells which are considered to be the first line of  defence and total dystrophy of epithelial tissue. Thus, it is opined that a low  concentration of monocrotophos has the potential to bring different type of  degenerations at finer scale hence affecting the fish's health drastically and  altering the fitness of the fish in water even having insignificant amount of  this toxicant in the ambient water

AU  - Wolfe, Barrett W.

T2  - Marine environmental research
AB  - White croaker (Genyonemus lineatus family: Sciaenidae) are a schooling, benthic foraging fish historically associated with soft sediment and wastewater outfalls  in southern California. While they are often used as an indicator species due to  their high organochlorine contaminant loads, little is known of their movements  in relation to contaminated habitats. A Vemco Positioning System acoustic  telemetry array was used to collect fine-scale movement data and characterize the  site fidelity, area use, and dispersal of 83 white croaker on the Palos Verdes  Shelf Superfund Site, California over 27 months. White croaker generally  demonstrated low residency and recurrence to the Palos Verdes Shelf, and were  observed to be largely nomadic. However, individual behavior was highly variable.  Although the entire monitored shelf was visited by tagged white croaker, habitats  in 0-200 m proximity to wastewater outfalls and between 25 and 35 m depth were  used most frequently. Approximately half of white croaker migrated into Los  Angeles and Long Beach Harbors; areas where they may be targeted by subsistence  fishers. A model framework for incorporating fish movement data into contaminant  exposure estimates was developed to better understanding organochlorine  contaminant exposure for planning future remediation and monitoring.

AU  - Gutierrez, María Florencia
AU  - Paggi, Juan Cesar
AU  - Gagneten, Ana María
T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
AB  - Chemical communication is one of the most important ecological phenomena promoting the maintenance of ecosystem dynamics. In predator-prey interactions,  mediation signals allow prey to detect their predators and can be crucial in the  process of avoiding them. Since organisms in many natural waterbodies are often  subjected to anthropogenic stressors, it is hypothesised that low concentrations  of xenobiotic compounds can disturb this chemical communication, acting as  infodisruptors. This study analyzes whether two anthropogenic pollutants  (chromium and an insecticide) interfere in two freshwater predator-prey  interactions, by altering the behavioural responses of a cladoceran and a copepod  species to a fish chemical cue. The concentrations tested were lower than those  considered innocuous under international water quality guidelines, and two types  of behaviour were analysed: escape ability and depth selection in an artificial  water column. Both species tested demonstrated a higher escape ability when  exposed to the cue than when they were not exposed. Xenobiotics modified the  responses of the copepod in opposite ways: chromium inhibited this behaviour and  the insecticide prompted a higher than expected level of escape ability. The  depth selection patterns were different between N. conifer and C. dubia. Fish  kairomones did not modify them, however chromium and the insecticide caused  important alterations in both cases. Such disruptions would be detrimental to the  organisms' life cycle trajectories, which, in natural systems, would cause  longterm damage in trophic structure and in evolutionary processes.

AB  - A new Edwardsiella taxon was recently described from fishes of Europe and Asia. Phenotypically similar to E. tarda, extensive genetic and phenotypic  characterization determined this new strain does not belong to any established  Edwardsiella taxa, leading to the adoption of a new taxon, E. piscicida.  Concurrent research in the USA also identified 2 genetically distinct taxa within  the group of organisms traditionally classified as E. tarda. Comparisons of gyrB  sequences between US isolates and E. piscicida from Europe and Asia identified  several US isolates with >99.6% similarity to the gyrB sequence of the E.  piscicida type strain (ET883) but <87% similarity to the E. tarda type strain  (ATCC #15947). A discriminatory PCR was developed for the identification of E.  tarda and 2 genetic variants of E. piscicida (E. piscicida and E. piscicida-like  species). Using these PCR assays, a survey was conducted of 44 archived bacterial  specimens from disease case submissions to the Aquatic Research and Diagnostic  Laboratory (Stoneville, MS, USA) between 2007 and 2012. All 44 isolates,  originally identified phenotypically and biochemically as E. tarda, were  identified as E. piscicida by PCR. Repetitive sequence-mediated PCR (rep-PCR)  analysis of these archived specimens suggests they are largely homogenous,  similar to what has been observed for E. ictaluri. The gyrB sequence data,  coupled with the E. piscicida specific-PCR and rep-PCR data, confirms that E.  piscicida has been isolated from fish disease cases in the southeastern USA.  Moreover, our survey data suggests E. piscicida may be more prevalent in catfish  aquaculture than E. tarda.

T2  - Experientia
AB  - The mechanism by which the fertilization envelope (FE) is able to protect the embryo of fish until hatching is almost unknown, except for its function as a  physical barrier. FE extract from activated or fertilized eggs of the fish Salmo  gairdneri was demonstrated to contain enzyme activities using an agar plate  enzyme assay. The enzymes apparently active were carboxymethylcellulase  (cellulase; EC 3.2.1.4), laminaranase (endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase; EC 3.2.1.6),  carboxymethylchitinase (chitinase; EC 3.2.1.14), xylanase  (endo-1,4-beta-xylanase; EC 3.2.1.8), mannanase (mannan  1,2-(1,3)-alpha-mannosidase; EC 3.2.1.77), dextranase (EC 3.2.1.11), a protease  and lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17). The FE extract exerted an antifungal or fungicidal  action on the fungus Saprolegnia parasitica, whereas an extract from the  vitelline envelopes (VE) has no apparent enzyme activity nor antifungal or  fungicidal action. Enzymes acquired by the FE through the cortical reaction may  have an important defensive role, protecting the embryo against invaders or  pathogens.

AB  - The Cueva del Azufre in Tabasco, Mexico, is a nutrient-rich cave and its inhabitants need to cope with high levels of dissolved hydrogen sulfide and  extreme hypoxia. One of the successful colonizers of this cave is the poeciliid  fish Poecilia mexicana, which has received considerable attention as a model  organism to examine evolutionary adaptations to extreme environmental conditions.  Nonetheless, basic ecological data on the endemic cave molly population are still  missing; here we aim to provide data on population densities, size class  compositions and use of different microhabitats. We found high overall densities  in the cave and highest densities at the middle part of the cave with more than  200 individuals per square meter. These sites have lower H2S concentrations  compared to the inner parts where most large sulfide sources are located, but  they are annually exposed to a religious harvesting ceremony of local Zoque  people called La Pesca. We found a marked shift in size/age compositions towards  an overabundance of smaller, juvenile fish at those sites. We discuss these  findings in relation to several environmental gradients within the cave (i.e.,  differences in toxicity and lighting conditions), but we also tentatively argue  that the annual fish harvest during a religious ceremony (La Pesca) locally  diminishes competition (and possibly, cannibalism by large adults), which is  followed by a phase of overcompensation of fish densities.

AB  - Onchidal has been identified as the major lipid-soluble component of the defensive secretion of the mollusc Onchidella binneyi, and it has been proposed  as the compound responsible for the chemical protection of Onchidella [Bioorg.  Chem. 7:125-131 (1978)]. In support of this hypothesis, we now report that  onchidal can be found in several different species of Onchidella and that it is  toxic to fish. Because onchidal is an acetate ester similar to acetylcholine, its  ability to interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and  acetylcholinesterase was investigated. Although onchidal did not prevent the  binding of 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, it  inhibited acetylcholinesterase in a progressive, apparently irreversible, manner.  The apparent affinity of onchidal for the initial reversible binding to  acetylcholinesterase (Kd) was approximately 300 microM, and the apparent rate  constant for the subsequent irreversible inhibition of enzyme activity (kintact)  was approximately 0.1 min-1. Onchidal was a substrate for acetylcholinesterase,  and approximately 3250 mol of onchidal were hydrolyzed/mol of enzyme irreversibly  inhibited. The calculated kcat for onchidal was 325 min-1. Irreversible  inhibition resulted from either onchidal itself or a reactive intermediate in the  enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of onchidal, rather than from the hydrolysis products  of onchidal. Irreversible inhibition of enzyme activity was prevented by  coincubation with reversible agents that either sterically block (edrophonium and  decamethonium) or allosterically modify (propidium) the acetylcholine binding  site. Enzyme activity was not regenerated by incubation with oxime reactivators;  therefore, the mechanism of irreversible inhibition does not appear to involve  acylation of the active site serine. Because onchidal contains a potentially  reactive alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, irreversible inhibition of  acetylcholinesterase may result from formation of a novel covalent bond between  the toxin and the enzyme. Thus, this novel toxin could potentially be exploited  in the design of a new class of anticholinesterase insecticides and in the  identification of amino acids that contribute to the binding and hydrolysis of  acetylcholine.

TI  - Evaluation of malaria control programme in three selected districts of Assam, India.
AU  - Prasad, Hardev
T2  - Journal of vector borne diseases
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: To ensure that the activities of Malaria Control Programme were taking place in effective and judicious manner, an intensive  monitoring and supervision of various activities of the programme were carried  out in Karbi-Anglong, Cachar and Nagaon districts of Assam, India during  July-October 2007. METHODS: Questionnaire-based protocol prepared by the National  Vector Borne Disease Control Programme was used to evaluate the activities.  Sixteen villages belonging to five different Primary Health Centres (PHCs) of  three districts were selected for investigations. RESULTS: Results of monitoring  of indoor residual spraying (IRS) revealed inadequate spraying coverage. Although  recorded to be about 69-99%, but apparently it was 17-43% in the districts  investigated. Cross-examination of 180 blood smears (90 positive and negative  each) in the laboratories of the study PHCs, revealed discrepancy in the results  of 67 blood smears. Maximum (44%) discrepancy was observed in positive blood  smears and 30% in negative blood smears. Out of 22 Accredited Social Health  Activists (ASHA) interrogated, none was found involved in antimalaria activities.  However, out of 13 fever treatment depots monitored, one was found partially  functional. Criteria laid down for preparation of micro action plan were not  followed properly in any of the districts sruveyed. Various important components  of the programme like constitution of Village Health Sanitation Committee,  information education communication (IEC) activities, capacity building, use of  larvivorous fishes, supervision, etc. were not exercised properly. However, 100%  community acceptance was recorded for insecticide-treated bed nets in the  villages surveyed. Indiscriminate use of rapid diagnostic test kits yielded poor  and unsatisfactory response. Declining trend of malaria was observed during  2002-06 in Districts Nagaon and Karbi-Anglong (up to 2005). In District Cachar,  however, a little increasing trend was observed during 2002-04. CONCLUSION: The  results of this investigation revealed that the malaria control programme had  been jeopardized seriously due to improper implementation of vector control  measures, lack of adequate professional support and varied commitment on the part  of the State Government. It can be concluded that long-term malaria control  strategy should be based on generation of increased awareness on the disease and  various methods of its control, health care access and administrative commitment  for increased prosperity in resource-poor settings. The observation also  necessitates further in-depth evaluation with appropriate regular active  surveillance round the year with prompt detection and treatment facilities in  order to control malaria effectively in these districts.

AB  - A comparative enantioselective analysis using immobilized amylose tris-(3-chlorophenylcarbamate) as chiral stationary phase in conventional  high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with Chiralpak ID (4.6 mm ID × 250  mm, 5 µm silica gel) and micro-HPLC with Chiralpak ID-3 (0.30 mm ID × 150 mm, 3  µm silica gel) was conducted. Pharmaceutical racemates of 12 pharmacological  classes, namely, α- and β-blockers, anti-inflammatory drugs, antifungal drugs,  dopamine antagonists, norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors,  catecholamines, sedative hypnotics, diuretics, antihistaminics, anticancer drugs,  and antiarrhythmic drugs were screened under normal phase conditions. The effect  of an organic modifier on the analyte retentions and enantiomer recognition was  investigated. Baseline separation was achieved for 1-acenaphthenol, carprofen,  celiprolol, cizolirtine carbinol, miconazole, tebuconazole,  4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid, 1-indanol, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)ethanol,  1-phenyl-2-propanol, flavanone, 6-hydroxyflavanone, 4-bromogluthethimide, and  pentobarbital on the 4.6 mm ID packed with a 5 µm silica column using  conventional HPLC. Nonetheless, baseline separation was achieved for  aminoglutethimide, naftopidil, and thalidomide on the 0.3 mm ID packed with a 3  µm silica capillary column.

AB  - Spatial gradients of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides were examined in the young-of-the-year (YOY) bluefish (Pomatomus  saltatrix) in the vicinity of a PCB Superfund Site in New Bedford Harbor,  Massachusetts, and in the adjacent waters. PCB concentrations in bluefish varied  between different locations, and also among fish from a given location. A  generally decreasing gradient in PCB concentrations was evident as the bluefish  were collected away from the Superfund Site. The average sum of PCB  concentrations were highest for bluefish collected in the Upper Harbor between  Interstate-195 Bridge and Coggeshall Street Bridge (Upper Harbor), followed by  bluefish in Lower Harbor from north of Popes Island Bridge (Lower Harbor), and  bluefish from Outer Harbor south of Hurricane Barrier (Outer Harbor). The levels  of PCBs in bluefish from Clarks Cove and PCBs in bluefish from Buzzards Bay were  similar and lowest among all bluefish specimens analyzed in the present study.  Pesticide concentrations were about one order of magnitude or lower than the PCB  concentrations, and the gradient of pesticide concentrations generally followed  the gradient of PCB concentrations. Some of the commonly detected pesticides in  the order of decreasing concentrations included DDTs and metabolites, heptachlor  epoxide, endosulfan sulfate, and α-chlordane. Distribution of PCBs and  organochlorine pesticides were examined in the tissues of YOY bluefish from  Clarks Cove. PCBs and lipids in the brain samples of YOY bluefish were generally  numerically greater than PCBs in the liver samples, but these differences were  not statistically significant. PCBs and lipids in hypaxial muscle samples were  numerically greater than PCBs in epaxial muscle samples, although these two  groups of tissues were not statistically different. Despite the higher  susceptibility of lighter PCB homologs to geophysical and biogeochemical  weathering processes, the relative dominance of lighter homologs in the Upper  Harbor and Lower Harbor samples suggested ongoing or recent sources of these  lighter PCBs, particularly Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016 in this area. The  presence of heavier homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor bluefish  samples could be attributed to Aroclor 1252 and Aroclor 1254 that were being used  in relatively smaller quantities in the manufacture of electrical components in  addition to Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016. The concentration of heavier PCB  homologs appears to increase in YOY bluefish the further away from the PCB  Superfund Site in the Acushnet Estuary the samples were collected. Principal  component analyses of PCB 153 normalized concentrations of the individual PCB  congeners resulted in two general groupings; a relatively tight group comprised  of YOY bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor, and a rather  loose and more dispersed group comprised of Buzzards Bay bluefish and the tissue  samples of bluefish from Clarks Cove. Principal component analyses of major  pesticides suggested close groupings of bluefish from Clarks Cove and bluefish  from Buzzards Bay. Pesticides in bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and  Outer Harbor formed a loose group, with some bluefish from these locations  populating close to Clarks Cove and Buzzards Bay bluefish. Although PCBs have  been implicated in various behavioral and health effects in the experimental and  field studies, the deleterious effects of chronic exposure to high concentrations  of PCBs and the potential for recruitment of New Bedford Harbor YOY bluefish  population to the adult stock remains obscure. Adaptive or evolutionary  resistance to contaminants have been documented in resident species in some  highly contaminated estuaries, however similar responses have not been  investigated in the migratory species like bluefish. The results of the present  study provide a reference baseline for YOY bluefish for "before-and-after"  comparative studies and other toxicological studies for the New Bedford Harbor  Superfund Site that is currently being remediated.

AB  - All 209 congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in edible fish tissue from the central Red Sea coast (Jeddah region) of Saudi Arabia were analyzed by  isotope dilution high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The  upper-bound total PCB (ΣPCB) levels in nine commonly consumed fish species from  three areas were 0.2-82.5ng/g wet weight (17-8450ng/g lipid weight), which were  at the lower end of reported global range and far below international tolerance  limits (500-3000ng/g ww). Dioxin-like congeners contributed up to 12.8% (mean  6.5%) to ΣPCB in tissue samples, with the total PCB toxic equivalencies (TEQs) at  a tolerable range (0.05-2.6pgTEQ/g ww or 2-238pgTEQ/g lw) for all species. PCB  profiles were dominated by moderately chlorinated homologs, mainly  hexachlorobiphenyls, but less chlorinated congeners were also consistently  elevated, notably in Siganus rivulatus (Area III) and Mugil cephalus (Area I). It  remains to be ascertained if the latter were breakdown products or due to fresh  inputs. The top congeners based on dominance by both occurrence and abundance  were identified as potential markers of ΣPCB in fish tissue, which can be used  for future selective biomonitoring in case of reasonable constraints on full  congener approach.

AB  - Methyl parathion (MP), an organophosphate widely applied in agriculture and aquaculture, induces oxidative stress due to free radical generation and changes  in the antioxidant defense system. The antioxidant roles of selenium (Se) were  evaluated in Brycon cephalus exposed to 2 mg L(-1) of Folisuper 600 BR (MP  commercial formulation - MPc, 600 g L(-1)) for 96 h. Catalase (CAT), glutathione  peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST),  reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels in the gills, white  muscle and liver were evaluated in fish fed on diets containing 0 or 1.5 mg Se  kg(-1) for 8 weeks. In fish treated with a Se-free diet, the MPc exposure  increased SOD and CAT activities in all tissues. However, the GPx activity  decreased in white muscle and gills whereas no alterations were observed in the  liver. MPc also increased GST activity in all tissues with a concurrent decrease  in GSH levels. LPO values increased in white muscle and gills and did not change  in liver after MPc exposure. A Se-supplemented diet reversed these findings,  preventing increases in LPO levels and concurrent decreases in GPx activity in  gills and white muscle. Similarly, GSH levels were maintained in all tissue after  MPc exposure. These results suggest that dietary Se supplementation protects  cells against MPc-induced oxidative stress.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to assess reproductive outcomes, especially birthweight, and the consumption of fatty fish from the Baltic Sea,  contaminated with persistent organochlorine compounds, among women from the  Swedish east coast. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cohorts of fishermen's wives from the  Swedish east and west coasts were established and linked to the Swedish Medical  Birth Register for 1973-1991; 1501 children were born in the eastcoast cohort and  3553 in the westcoast cohort. Comparisons were made with regional populations and  between the cohorts. Dietary interviews were made with 69 randomly selected women  from the cohorts and 69 referents. RESULTS: The women interviewed from the east-  and westcoast cohorts ate locally caught fish more than twice as often as their  referents. Compared with the regional population, the women in the eastcoast  cohort gave birth to an increased number of infants with low birthweights (< 3000  g), whereas the opposite was seen in the westcoast cohort. Infants in the  eastcoast cohort had significantly lower birthweights than infants from the  westcoast cohort (median 3530 versus 3610 g, P < 0.001). Even after adjustment  for potential confounders, eastcoast affiliation showed an increased risk for low  birthweight (odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.18-1.76). The effect was  more conspicuous for boys (odds ratio 1.95) and heavy smokers (odds ratio 3.00).  CONCLUSIONS: The present data support, but do not prove, an association between a  high consumption of contaminated fish from the Baltic Sea and an increased risk  for low birthweight.

T2  - Oecologia
AB  - Biological control manipulations of natural enemies to reduce pest populations represent large-scale ecological experiments that have both benefited from and  contributed to various areas of modern ecology. Unfortunately, economic  expediency and the need for rapid implementation often require that biological  control programs be based more on trial and error than on sound ecological theory  and testing. This approach has led to some remarkable successes but it has also  produced dismal failures. This point is particularly well illustrated in the  historical development and use of entomopathogenic nematodes for the biological  control of insect pests. Intense effort has focused on developing these natural  enemies as alternatives to chemical insecticides, in part because laboratory  assays indicated that these nematodes possess a broad host range. This illusory  attribute launched hundreds of field releases, many of which failed due to  ecological barriers to infection that are not apparent from laboratory exposures,  where conditions are optimal and host-parasite contact assured. For example, the  entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae is a poor choice to control  scarab larvae because this nematode uses an ambusher foraging strategy near the  soil surface whereas the equally sedentary scarab remains within the soil  profile, shows a weak host recognition response to scarabs, has difficulty  overcoming the scarab immune response, and has low reproduction in this host.  Conversely, two other nematodes, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and S. glaseri,  are highly adapted to parasitize scarabs: they use a cruising foraging strategy,  respond strongly to scarabs, easily overcome the immune response, and reproduce  well in these hosts. Increased understanding of the ecology of entomopathogenic  nematodes has enabled better matches between parasites and hosts, and more  accurate predictions of field performance. These results underline the importance  of a strong partnership between basic and applied ecology in the area of  biological control.

T2  - Ecology of disease
AB  - The resurgence of malaria in India began in 1966 and the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were no exception to this phenomenon. In both states the peak  occurrence came in 1976. Malaria was largely confined to highly vulnerable and  receptive areas. The problem of increased incidence was particularly associated  with the development of several irrigation and hydro-electric schemes. Improperly  maintained irrigation systems and reservoirs provided ideal breeding grounds. The  present paper examines the scope and limitations of a major anti-malaria  activity, namely residual insecticide spraying as adopted and practised in rural  vector control programmes in irrigation development project areas. Past  experiences (as during the National Malaria Eradication programme, 1958-1965) and  current practices are reviewed on the basis of selected examples. Eradication  programme, 1958-1965) and current practices are reviewed on the basis of selected  examples. In view of the current re-emergence of the disease, the states are  faced with new obstacles to residual insecticide spraying such as (a) the  development of resistance of malaria vectors to DDT and other alternative  compounds like BHC (benzene hexachloride), changing vector behaviour with  avoidance of contact with indoor insecticide deposits on walls, (c) environmental  contamination (risks of chemicals), (d) extensive use of insecticides and  pesticides for crop protection under an expanding green revolution agricultural  technology, particularly in irrigated areas and (e) the existence of outdoor  resting populations of the major vector Anopheles culicifacies and their role in  extra-domiciliary transmission, making residual insecticide spray less effective.  Spraying operations are also hindered by the persistence of certain social and  cultural factors. The custom of mud plastering, white-washing and rethatching  rural houses, for example, results in the loss of insecticide-treated surfaces.  Other outdoor rural activities persist as obstacles in attempts to break the  transmission cycle; washing, bathing and sleeping outdoors; illegal fishing and  woodcutting at night; poorly constructed make-shift structures;housing project  labourers near water sources; cattle grazing in nearby forests and human  population movements related to seasonal migrants. The chain and extent of the  transmission is dependent upon the malaria parasite carriers in the community  (both indigenous and imported types) and the degree of contact of the community  with those sites where people carry on the above activities, and on the  effectiveness of surveillance operations.

AB  - The widespread use of cyproconazole (CPZ) enhances food security but may pose potential risks to non-target organisms. Therefore, we applied Multi-omics  techniques to reveal the response of the intestinal barrier to CPZ exposure and  explore whether the Bifidobacterium intervention experiment can repair the  damage. First, we found that exposure to CPZ at environmentally relevant  concentrations led to intestinal injury phenotype, significantly down-regulated  intestinal protein gene expression, and up-regulated pro-inflammatory gene  expression, further causing intestinal dysbacteriosis and metabolic disorders. In  particular, by combining analysis of gut microbiota and metabolites, we noticed  acetate, a key metabolite, which decreased sharply after exposure to high  concentration of CPZ. Expectedly, after supplementing with Bifidobacterium (a  core bacterium that produces acetate), we noticed that the acetate content was  quickly restored. Further, we also verified that the increase in acetate content  after Bifidobacterium supplementation at least partially promoted IL-22  secretion, which in turn stimulated the secretion of β-defensins (zfbd-1, zfbd-2,  zfbd-3), thereby repairing the intestinal damage. In conclusion, our work  confirms the potential of Bifidobacterium to improve intestinal damage and  metabolic dysbiosis caused by CPZ exposure. It provides directional  recommendations for the application of probiotics to repair the toxicological  risk of pesticide exposure.

AB  - Liver is very sensitive to environmental contaminants such as pesticides, it being the first target of toxicity of a substance. The objective of this study  was to investigate the possible effects of the insecticide imidacloprid (IMI) on  the liver of Oreochromis niloticus according concentrations used for growing  sugarcane. A semi-quantitative analysis of histopathological alterations of IMI  on liver was performed by light microscopy and cellular labeling of heat shock  proteins (HSP70) by immunohistochemistry. The most common changes in liver at all  concentrations of IMI were hydropic degeneration, pyknotic nuclei, and loss of  cell limits. Steatosis and increased levels of HSP70 were detected in hepatocytes  with the highest concentration of IMI. In conclusion, the tested concentrations  of IMI induced histopathological changes in the liver of O. niloticus and active  defence mechanisms to maintain the morphophysiological integrity of the liver.  This insecticide has a toxicity potential for these fish, which is a non-target  organism of its action.

AB  - CONTEXT: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a ubiquitous membrane detoxification pump involved in cellular defence against xenobiotics. Blood is a hub for the trade  and transport of physiological molecules and xenobiotics. Our recent studies have  highlighted the expression of a 140-kDa P-gp in brown trout erythrocytes in  primary cell culture and its dose-dependent response to Benzo[a]pyrene pollutant.  OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was focused on using P-gp expression in  brown trout erythrocytes as a biomarker for detecting the degree of river  pollution. METHODS: abcb1 gene and P-gp expression level were analysed by reverse  transcriptase-PCR and Western blot, in the erythrocytes of brown trouts. The  latter were collected in upstream and downstream of four rivers in which 17  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 348 varieties of pesticides micro-residues  were analysed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The abcb1  gene and the 140-kDa P-gp were not expressed in trout erythrocytes from  uncontaminated river. In contrast, they are clearly expressed in contaminated  rivers, in correlation with the river pollution degree and the nature of the  pollutants. CONCLUSIONS: This biological tool may offer considerable advantages  since it provides an effective response to the increasing need for an early  biomarker.

AB  - Sclerotinia homoeocarpa causes dollar spot disease, the predominate disease on highly-maintained turfgrass. Currently, there are major gaps in our understanding  of the molecular interactions between S. homoeocarpa and creeping bentgrass. In  this study, 454 sequencing technology was used in the de novo assembly of S.  homoeocarpa and creeping bentgrass transcriptomes. Transcript sequence data  obtained using Illumina's first generation sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) were  mapped to the transcriptome assemblies to estimate transcript representation in  different SBS libraries. SBS libraries included a S. homoeocarpa culture control,  a creeping bentgrass uninoculated control, and a library for creeping bentgrass  inoculated with S. homoeocarpa and incubated for 96 h. A Fisher's exact test was  performed to determine transcripts that were significantly different during  creeping bentgrass infection with S. homoeocarpa. Fungal transcripts of interest  included glycosyl hydrolases, proteases, and ABC transporters. Of particular  interest were the large number of glycosyl hydrolase transcripts that target a  wide range of plant cell wall compounds, corroborating the suggested wide host  range and saprophytic abilities of S. homoeocarpa. Several of the multidrug  resistance ABC transporters may be important for resistance to both fungicides  and plant defense compounds. Creeping bentgrass transcripts of interest included  germins, ubiquitin transcripts involved in proteasome degradation, and cinnamoyl  reductase, which is involved in lignin production. This analysis provides an  extensive overview of the S. homoeocarpa-turfgrass pathosystem and provides a  starting point for the characterization of potential virulence factors and host  defense responses. In particular, determination of important host defense  responses may assist in the development of highly resistant creeping bentgrass  varieties.

AB  - Binding sites for t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) were detected in well-washed membranes from the brain of trout; gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)  acted as an uncompetitive inhibitor of the binding of [35S]TBPS, decreasing both  the number of binding sites and the affinity of TBPS. Inhibition of the binding  of [35S]TBPS by deltamethrin, a Type II pyrethroid, was modulated by GABA; both  the affinity and the efficacy of this insecticide increased with incremental  concentrations of GABA. Deltamethrin also enhanced the potency of GABA as an  inhibitor of the binding of [35S]TBPS. The interaction of 4'-chlorodiazepam  (Ro5-4864) with [35S]TBPS was dependent on GABA: in the absence of GABA, Ro5-4864  inhibited up to 40% of the binding; in the presence of 10 microM GABA, Ro5-4864  enhanced binding to a maximum value of 170% of control. However, the same  absolute amount of binding was observed with both of these effects at micromolar  concentrations of Ro5-4864. Also, Ro5-4864 caused a rightward shift in GABA  dose-response curves, increasing the IC50 value for GABA more than 6 fold. These  results indicate the reciprocal allosteric interactions between a binding site  for pyrethroids, a binding site for Ro5-4864, the GABA recognition moiety and the  binding site for TBPS in the brain of trout. The similarity of these findings to  previous results in preparations of rodent brain highlight the conservation of  the modulation of GABAA receptor function during the evolution of vertebrates.

AB  - Changes in the gene transcription of stress response genes in resident fish can be powerful biomarkers for the identification of sublethal impacts of  environmental stressors on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we tested the  effects of two reference toxicants, copper (Cu) and the pyrethroid insecticide  esfenvalerate  [(S)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylbutyrate], on  lethal (mortality) and sublethal endpoints (growth, swimming behavior,  transcription levels of stress response genes) in juvenile (81-90-day-old)  striped bass (Morone saxatilis). We established cellular stress response markers  for proteotoxicity (HSP70, HSP90), phase I detoxification mechanism (CYP1A1),  metal-binding (metallothionein), as well as immune-function and pathogen-defense  (TGF-beta, Mx-protein, nRAMP). Quantitative real-time TaqMan PCR was used to  examine tissue-specific changes in the transcriptome of liver, spleen, white  muscle, anterior kidney and gills after 7-day Cu exposures and 24-h esfenvalerate  exposures. On the transcriptome level, exposure to Cu showed strongest effects on  the transcription of metallothionein in spleen tissue, causing a 4-fold increase  of mRNA at 42ppb total Cu and a 10-fold increase at 160 ppb Cu. Exposure to Cu  also caused significant tissue-specific changes in gene transcription for  immune-system related genes. Esfenvalerate exposure had tissue-specific effects  on the transcription of HSP70, HSP90 and CYP1A1. The most significant effects  were detected in liver tissue after exposure to 0.64 microg/L esfenvalerate. Our  results show that the stress response at the transcriptome level is a more  sensitive indicator for Cu and esfenvalerate exposures at low concentrations than  swimming behavior, growth or mortality. The accuracy of studies on quantitative  changes in the transcriptome can benefit from an initial evaluation or the  inclusion of several different tissues and the use of multiple housekeeping  genes.

AB  - Cortisol, the main glucocorticoid in fish, undertakes pleiotropic biological effects in response to stressors to maintain homeostasis. It can exert several  actions on the immune system, growth and cellular metabolism, establishing a  fine-tune regulation stress response and cross-talk interactions with other  regulatory pathways. In this study, we investigated a causal relationship between  high levels of glucocorticoids and susceptibility to pathogens and modification  of gene expression profiles in Senegalese sole. For this purpose, we carried out  two experiments using post-metamorphic individuals (21 days after hatching) that  were exposed to dexamethasone (DXM), a potent glucocorticoid, in order to mimic  cortisol effects. We quantified transcript levels of a wide set of genes involved  in innate immune system (g-type lysozyme and hepcidin (hamp1)), HPI axis (crf,  crfbp, pomcα, pomcβ, gr1 and gr2), HPT axis (tgb), cellular stress defense system  (hsp70 and hsp90aa), GH/IGF axis (igf-I and igf-Ir) and the neuropeptide trh.  Short-term exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 ppm DXM provoked a reduction of pomcβ  transcripts and an increase of crfbp mRNAs in a dose-dependent manner at 48 and  72 h after treatment. Moreover, g-type lysozyme transcript levels decreased  significantly at 72 h whereas hamp1 mRNA levels increased at 48 h after exposure.  Long-term DXM treatment (10 ppm DXM) affected negatively weight of soles (~20%  lower than controls). Moreover, reduced mRNA levels were observed for pomcβ after  1 week and igf-I and hamp1 after 2 weeks. In contrast, crfbp and crf increased  mRNA levels after 2 weeks. hsp70 exhibited a dual response increasing transcript  levels at 1 week after treatment and reducing thereafter. No significant changes  in gene expression were observed at any time during this study for tgb, trh,  hsp90aa, pomcα, gr1 and gr2. Finally, a challenge experiment using the pathogen  Photobacterium damselae subsp piscicida confirmed earlier and higher mortalities  in DXM-treated animals. Taken together, these data indicate that a prolonged  exposure to DXM increases the susceptibility to pathogens and reduces growth.  Moreover, DXM can trigger a wide cellular response modulating the expression of  genes involved in the innate immune system, HPI and GH/IGF axes as well as  cellular stress defense. These results are highly valuable to evaluate responses  associated to aquaculture stressful conditions and discriminate specific  glucocorticoid-mediated effects.

AB  - The present communication deals with the effect of fenitrothion (0.04 ppm) on the carbohydrate metabolism of the european eel Anguilla anguilla and its recovery  from intoxication. Analysis of various parameters such as glycogen, lactate and  glucose was made on different eel tissues after 2, 8, 12, 24, 32, 48, 56, 72 and  96 hr of fenitrothion exposure. Subsequently, the fish were allowed recovery  periods of 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 144 and 192 hr in clean water, and the same  parameters were evaluated. Muscle glycogen content decreased significantly during  the exposure time, while blood glucose levels increased markedly. Gill, muscle  and blood lactate values increased during pesticide exposure. Most of the  metabolic disorders did not persist after allowing recovery in clean water during  less than a week. The observed effects of fenitrothion on fish metabolism are  discussed in relation to a stress syndrome and probable reasons for alterations  have been exposed.

AB  - Skin is the first barrier of defense on fish, which is crucial to protection against different stressors, including pathogens. Skin samples obtained from  dorsal and ventral part of Sparus aurata specimens were incubated with  Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (a pathogen for this fish species), with  Shewanella putrefaciens Pdp11 (a probiotic bacteria isolated from healthy  gilthead seabream skin) or with both bacteria. The gene expression profile of  nine cytokines (il1b, tnfa, il6, il7, il8, il15, il18, il10 and tgfb) was studied  by qPCR in all the skin samples. The present findings revealed different patterns  of cytokine profile in dorsal and ventral skin of gilthead seabream, which could  be related to the influence and susceptibility to a possible infection.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the antimicrobic potential of mucus samples collected from Cyprinus carpio and identify the specific antimicrobial peptides responsible  for its activity. The crude extract was tested against various bacterial and  fungal pathogens, and its protein content and profile were analyzed. Purification  steps, including gel filtration chromatography, were employed to isolate the most  active fraction (peak IV), which was further identified via liquid chromatography  and mass spectroscopy. The results revealed varying degrees of antimicrobial  activity of the crude extract against different bacterial and fungal strains,  with Leclercia adecarboxylata, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis showing  the highest susceptibility. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated the existence of  multiple low molecular weight protein bands in the crude extract, while fraction  IV obtained from gel filtration chromatography exhibited the strongest  antimicrobial activity. Peak IV displayed a range of minimum inhibitory  concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimum  fungicidal concentration (MFC) values against the tested pathogens, spanning from  0.038 to 4.960 mg/mL. Further investigation identified the purified peptide  derived from peak IV as G-type lysozyme 2, characterized by a molecular weight of  21 kDa. These findings shed light on the existence of a highly effective  antimicrobial peptide, G-type lysozyme 2, within the mucus of Cyprinus carpio.  This peptide demonstrates notable activity against diverse bacterial and fungal  pathogens. The insights from this study enhance our understanding of the fish's  antimicrobial defense mechanisms and hold promise for developing novel  antimicrobial agents.

AB  - Exposure of marine animals to certain pollutants can enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production with subsequent damage to macromolecules and alterations  in oxidant defences levels. Aimed at correlating the tissue concentration of  certain contaminants (PCBs, DDT) with antioxidant defence levels and oxidative  damages, two fish species with different life strategies (mullet, Mugil cephalus,  and flounder, Platichthys flesus) were collected in the Douro Estuary (NW  Portugal). After capture, the fish were left to depurate for 1 month in clean  seawater. The levels of the two antioxidant enzyme activities revealed that they  are species-dependent with mullet's livers showing higher superoxide dismutase  (SOD) (13.2+/-0.5 U/mg protein) and catalase (CAT) (15.5+/-1.0 mmol/min/mg  protein) activities than flounder (SOD: 7.9+/-0.9 U/mg protein; CAT: 11.1+/-0.8  mmol/min/mg protein). After 1 month in captivity the antioxidant enzymes  activities in liver decreased in mullets, while for flounders the responses were  not consistent because during the experimental period flounders did not ate and  responses of antioxidant enzymes and oxidative damages were dependent on the  fasting condition. The liver oxidative damages were evaluated by estimating  oxidised lipids and proteins. Both species showed similar levels for these two  parameters. The hepatic lipid peroxidation in flounder increased after 1 month in  captivity, while in mullet an increase was observed only in summer and autumn.  The oxidised protein content increased for both species after the depuration  period. This study reveals differences between species under oxidative stress  when exposed to pollutants. In a clean environment, the mullet's primary  antioxidant defences decreased indicating that the animals living in Douro  estuary were facing an oxidative stress. The data indicate that, namely in  mullet, the presence of pollutants induce oxidative stress responses.

AB  - Neutral organochlorine pesticide and PCB residues were analyzed by GC-MS technique in 183 human milk samples obtained in 1984-1985 from 165 women living  in different parts of Finland. The effect of the donors' age, body mass, place of  residence, number of children, dietary habits, smoking habits, occupational  history, and weight loss on the organochlorine content of human milk were  studied. Of all the milk samples analyzed, p,p'-DDE concentrations were above the  detection limit in 99.5%, p,p'-DDD + p,p'-DDT in 57.9%, isomers of HCH in 30.0%,  cis-chlordane in 4.9%, oxychlordane in 3.3%, trans-nonachlor in 6.0%, heptachlor  in 12.0%, and heptachlor epoxide in 6.6%. Mirex was not found in any of the milk  samples, whereas the signals of chlorinated terpenes (toxaphenes) were detected  but could not be quantitatively determined. The mean fat adjusted residue levels  above the detection limit in Finnish human milk samples of primipara mothers were  0.66 ppm for total DDT compounds, 0.08 ppm for HCB, 0.93 ppm for PCBs, 0.41 ppm  for chlordane compounds, 0.20 ppm for isomers of HCH, and 0.10 ppm for heptachlor  epoxide. The geometric means were 0.46, 0.06, 0.57, 0.02, 0.02, and 0.01 ppm,  respectively. The age of the mothers positively correlated with the DDE  concentrations in human milk. The residues of OC compounds in human milk did not  differ in women living in plywood industry regions, those actually working in the  industry, and other mothers. Small differences were detected in the levels of  organochlorine compounds in different parts of Finland. No relation was found  between the OC content and the fish consumption, smoking habits, weight loss, or  social group of the donors.

AB  - Bacterial modulation of phagocyte cell death is an emerging theme in pathogenesis. Here we describe the systemic destruction of macrophages and  neutrophils by the Gram-negative Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida (Phdp) in  fish pasteurellosis, a deadly systemic infection. Following experimental  inoculation, Phdp spreads by bacteraemia and colonizes the organs, producing a  septicaemic infection, and secretes the apoptogenic exotoxin AIP56 which is  systemically disseminated. In experimental and natural pasteurellosis,  destruction of macrophages and neutrophils by secondary necrosis following  caspase-3-associated apoptosis was seen predominantly in the spleen, head kidney  and gut lamina propria. Identical phagocyte destruction occurred after injection  of rAIP56, but not of heat-inactivated rAIP56, or AIP56-negative Phdp strains,  indicating that AIP56 is responsible for phagocyte destruction occurring in  pasteurellosis. Active caspase-3 and active neutrophil elastase are present in  the blood in advanced infection, indicating that phagocyte lysis by secondary  necrosis is accompanied by release of tissue-damaging molecules. The  AIP56-induced lysis of phagocytes represents a very efficient, self-amplifying  etiopathogenic mechanism, because it results in two effects that operate in  concert against the host, namely, evasion of the pathogen from a crucial defence  mechanism through the destruction of both professional phagocytes, and release of  tissue-damaging molecules. The induction by a bacterial exotoxin of in vivo  systemic lysis of both professional phagocytes by secondary necrosis, now  described for the first time, may represent an overlooked etiopathogenic  mechanism operating in other infections of vertebrates.

AB  - Goldfish (Carassius auratus) bred in clean water were transferred into different stations in Taihu Lake for active biomonitoring exposures. The biotransformation  enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione-S-transferase  (GST), the antioxidant defense enzymes catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione  content (GSH), and lipoperoxidation (TBARS) and metallothionein (MT) in liver  were determined as biomarkers during the field exposure period. At the same time,  the contents of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and heavy metals in the  surface sediments of biomonitoring sites were measured. The total concentrations  of PAHs ranged 378.6-1047.8 μg kg(-1) dry weight, PCBs ranged 0.76-3.27 μg  kg(-1), OCPs ranged 1.12-3.08 μg kg(-1), and heavy metal Zn ranged 31.82-85.04 mg  kg(-1), Cu ranged 13.04-91.02 mg kg(-1), Ni ranged 4.96-28.66 mg kg(-1), and Pb  ranged 9.33-22.44 mg kg(-1). The results indicate that persistent organic  pollutants exist mainly in Meiliang Bay, while heavy metals are present mainly in  Gong Bay. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) was calculated by combining  multiple biomarkers to a single value and used to evaluate the toxically induced  stress level of populations in different areas. The results demonstrate that  Tuoshan and Mashan in Meiliang Bay as well as Dagongshan in Gong Bay showed  higher IBR values compared to the other sites. IBR values were in good agreement  with OCP concentrations.

AB  - The Suez Canal region is a small fertile area in Egypt that is placed under enormous pressure of existing resources. In these areas, intensive agricultural  practices are performed in combination with high population densities. The  described problem is that together with agricultural practices and urbanization,  Brown necked ravens (Corvus ruficollis) are in huge amounts attracted. The birds  are very aggressive and showed to be a serious pest. They spread germs and  diseases for human health and food production. Therefore, the birds need to be  controlled. Our research focuses on identifying food preferences of raven and on  the way raven control is most effective. Ravens are omnivorous birds. From our  laboratory study it was seen that most preferable foods were, in descending  order: fresh fishes, cow liver, crustacean, watermelons, tomatoes and yoghurt.  Under field conditions where stomach content was dissected, animal matters showed  to a more preferred food source than plant matters. Observations on olfactory  sensitivity showed that ravens could easily locate their food. Biological  observations in the field on reproduction of ravens showed that raven females lay  two to six eggs. Average number of babies per nest was between one and four.  Average number of raven flock before sun rise was more than 100, while it was  less than 100 before sun set. The impact of mechanical, biological and chemical  control was investigated. Without control, approximately flock numbers of more  than 100 ravens were recorded. The average number of raven flock was 60 before  mechanical control operation (nests destroyed and using net), while it was 40  after mechanical control. Results of the biological control showed that kestrel  (Falco tinnunculus rupicolaeformes) predated raven babies more effective than  barn owls (Tyto alba). Within the chemical control experiments, Brodifacoum  (0.0005%) was most effective against ravens, followed by Zink phosphide (19%) and  Methomyl (90%, carbamate compound).

AB  - The hazardous effects of pesticides on various metabolic pathways are a great problem for environmental health and should be well determined. In the present  study, the authors treated rainbow trout with 0.6 μg/L deltamethrin for 28 days  and 1.6 mg/L 2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate for 21 days. After this time  period, the authors observed alterations in mRNA expression levels of MT-A, MT-B  and CYP-1A. Chronic exposure to low levels of pesticides may have a more  significant effect on fish populations than acute poisoning. While both  pesticides caused a significant increase on mRNA levels of MT-A and CYP-1A, MT-B  mRNA levels were increased significantly only upon deltamethin administration.  The significant increase in mRNA levels of the corresponding genes may be  considered as a defence mechanism in addition to the antioxidants against  oxidative stress, as well as a detoxification mechanism against adverse effects  of pesticides.

AB  - The effects of vinclozolin (VIN), an anti-androgenic fungicide, on quality, oxidative stress, DNA integrity, and ATP level of sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus)  spermatozoa were investigated in vitro. Fish spermatozoa were incubated with  different concentrations of vinclozolin (0.5, 2, 10, 15, 20 and 50 μg/l) for 2 h.  A dose-dependent reduction in spermatozoa motility and velocity was observed at  concentrations of 2-50 μg/l. A dramatic increase in DNA fragmentation was  recorded at concentrations 10 μg/l and above. After 2 h exposure at higher test  concentrations (10-50 μg/l), oxidative stress was apparent, as reflected by  significantly higher levels of protein and lipid oxidation and significantly  greater superoxide dismutase activity. Intracellular ATP content of spermatozoa  decreased with increasing concentrations of VIN. The results demonstrated that  VIN can induce reactive oxygen species stress in fish spermatozoa, which could  impair the sperm quality, DNA integrity, ATP content, and the antioxidant defense  system.

AB  - The biological activity of many nitrosubstituted compounds, many of which are produced commercially or have been identified as environmental contaminants, is  dependent on metabolic activation catalyzed by nitroreductases. In the current  study, we have cloned a nitroreductase gene, Salmonella typhimurium  nitroreductase A (snrA), from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA1535, and  characterized the purified gene product. SnrA is 240 amino acids in length and  shares 87% sequence identity to the Escherichia coli homolog, E. coli  nitroreductase A (NfsA). SnrA is the major nitroreductase in S. enterica serovar  Typhimurium strain TA1535 and catalyzes nitroreduction through a ping-pong bi-bi  mechanism in a NADPH and flavine mononucleotide (FMN) dependent manner. SnrA  exhibits extremely low levels of FMN reductase activity but the nitroreductase  activity of SnrA is competitively inhibited by exogenously added FMN. Treatment  of TA1535 with paraquat resulted in induction of nitroreductase activity,  suggesting that SnrA is a member of the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SoxRS  regulon associated with cellular defense against oxidative damage. Examination of  the microbial genomes databases shows that SnrA homologs are widely distributed  in the microbial world, being present in isolates of both Archea and Eubacteria.  Southern hybridization and PCR failed to detect the snrA gene in the closely  related S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA1538. S. enterica serovar  Typhimurium strains TA1535 and TA1538 and their derivatives are commonly used in  mutagenicity testing. Differences in metabolic capacity between these two strains  may have implications for the interpretation of mutagenicity data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), and the viruses it transmits, are a major constraint to growing vegetable crops  worldwide. Although the whitefly is often controlled using chemical pesticides,  biological control agents constitute an important component in integrated pest  management programs, especially in protected agriculture. One of these agents is  the wasp Eretmocerus mundus (Mercet) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae). E. mundus lays  its egg on the leaf underneath the second-third instar nymph of B. tabaci. First  instars of the wasp hatch and penetrate the whitefly nymphs. Initiation of  parasitization induces the host to form a capsule composed of epidermal cells  around the parasitoid. The physiological and molecular processes underlying B.  tabaci-E. mundus interactions have never been investigated. RESULTS: We used a  cDNA microarray containing 6,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the whitefly  genome to study the parasitoid-whitefly interaction. We compared RNA samples  collected at two time points of the parasitization process: when the parasitoid  first instar starts the penetration process and once it has fully penetrated the  host. The results clearly indicated that genes known to be part of the defense  pathways described in other insects are also involved in the response of B.  tabaci to parasitization by E. mundus. Some of these responses included  repression of a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) and induction of a  melanization cascade. A second set of genes that responded strongly to  parasitization were bacterial, encoded by whitefly symbionts. Quantitative  real-time PCR and FISH analyses showed that proliferation of Rickettsia, a  facultative secondary symbiont, is strongly induced upon initiation of the  parasitization process, a result that supported previous reports suggesting that  endosymbionts might be involved in the insect host's resistance to various  environmental stresses. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine the  transcriptional response of a hemipteran insect to attack by a biological control  agent (hymenopterous parasitoid), using a new genomic approach developed for this  insect pest. The defense response in B. tabaci involves genes related to the  immune response as described in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster.  Moreover, endosymbionts of B. tabaci appear to play a role in the response to  parasitization, as supported by previously published results from aphids.

AB  - In 2007, samples of treated effluent were collected at point of discharge to the environment from 39 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located across Victoria,  Australia grouped by treatment type. Sample genotoxicity was assessed with a  high-throughput luminescent umu test method using Salmonella typhimurium TL210  strain, with and without addition of a commercially available metabolic  activation system. Samples were also screened using a gas chromatographic-mass  spectrometric mass-structure database recognition method. A genotoxic response  was observed in half of the samples tested without metabolic activation system  (<LOR - 0.19 μg/L 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide equivalents). On addition of metabolic  activation system, 75% of samples elicited a genotoxic response, the majority of  responses were stronger than without metabolic activation (<LOR - 2.97 μg/L  benzo[a]pyrene equivalents). The type of WWTP had no effect on genotoxicity. A  large number of chemicals were identified in the effluents, although none could  be unambiguously tied to the genotoxicity observed. Chemicals observed in one or  more effluents included food additives (e.g. dibenzylether), various alkyl  phenols, tyre leachates (e.g. 2(3H)-benzothiazolone), antioxidants, flame  retardants (e.g. tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate), insect repellents (e.g.  diethyltoluamide), stimulants (e.g. caffeine) and anticonvulsants (e.g.  carbamazepine). Of the 451 pesticides screened, carbamate insecticides (e.g.  bendiocarb, propoxur), plant growth regulators (e.g. propham) and herbicides  (e.g. atrazine, metolachlor, simazine) were amongst the compounds observed.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - In order to quickly assess potential environmental hazards of forwardly deployed military bases, we have focussed our efforts on biochemical and molecular changes  in vertebrate cells following exposure to aqueous soil extracts. To this end, we  are designing a series of deployable transgenic fish. Fish exhibit many of the  same general defenses against toxic chemicals as do mammals, including enzyme  induction, and the generation of oxidative stress. In response to many foreign  compounds that generate oxidative stress, the transcription of certain protective  genes is induced via specific DNA motifs called electrophile response elements  (EPREs). We have made a plasmid construct containing a single murine EPRE fused  to a minimal promoter and the cDNA encoding firefly luciferase (EPRE-LUC). In  this paper, we have shown that the treatment of zebrafish cell line ZEM2S with a  variety of chemicals known to induce EPRE-dependent transcription in cultured  mammalian cells, results in dose-dependent induction of the  transiently-transfected EPRE-LUC reporter construct. Compounds tested include  aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and organophosphates. We observed similar  dose-dependent responses when we treated ZEM2S and human cells in vitro with  identical aqueous extracts of soil from hazardous waste sites. This suggests that  the mechanism by which these compounds activate transcription is well conserved  between mammals and zebrafish, and that transgenic zebrafish lines containing  EPRE-driven reporter constructs might be useful as sentinels for the early  detection of oxidative stress-inducing chemicals.

AU  - Erne, K.
AU  - Rutqvist, L.
T2  - Nordisk veterinaermedicin
AB  - The occurrence of pesticide residues was studied in samples of feed-stuffs produced in Sweden or imported to Sweden during the years 1972--1976. In all, 278  samples representing 37 types of feed-stuffs (components, as well as finished  feeds) and 18 countries were analyzed. Residues of chlorinated hydrocarbon  pesticides and PCBs were looked for in 224 samples, mostly feed components. The  analytical method used involved solvent extraction, florisil-column clean-up,  thinlayer chromatographic separation and gas-chromatographic determination.  Chlorinated hydrocarbons were found in several samples. DDT and its  transformation products were detected in 66 samples (29.5%), lindane in 44  (19.5%), PCBs in 25 (11.2%), alpha-BHC in 22 (9.8%), beta-BHC in 11 (4.9%) and  dieldrin in 9 (4.0%). The levels were usually low (Table I). The chloropesticides  occurred most frequently and at the highest levels in feed-stuffs of animal  origin and in imported oil-feeds. In 25 of the samples the contents of sigmaDDT  exceeded the maximum limit accepted by the National (Swedish) Food Administration  for grain and bran intended for human consumption (0.05 mg/kg, Talbe IV). The  highest residue level of sigmaDDT (0.66 mg/kg) was encountered in a sample of  fish meal. The PCB levels found did not exceed the temporary tolerance  established by FDA (1973) for finished animal feeds (0.2 mg/kg). One hundred and  seven samples were analyzed for phenoxy acid residues using a thin-layer  chromatographic and gas-chromatographic technique. Phenoxy acids were detected in  only 2 of 62 randomly selected feed samples (0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively).  The residue limit established by the National Food Administration for 2,4-D and  MCPA in grain and bran intended for human consumption is 0.1 mg/kg. Fortyfour  samples of feeds were submitted because of suspected phenoxy acid contamination.  In 12 of the samples phenoxy acid residues were found. The highest level (3.5  mg/kg, MCPA) was observed in a sample of accidentally contaminated molasses.  Considering the apparently low level of contamination of Swedish grain with  chloropesticides, PCBs and phenoxy acids and the dilution on compounding  feed-stuffs of animal origin and oil-feeds, only very low pesticide residue  levels can be expected in Swedish finished animal feeds.

AB  - This paper introduces the topic of Food Fraud with translations to Russian, Korean, and Chinese. The concepts provide a system-wide focus leading to  prevention. The goal is not to detect Food Fraud but to adjust entire food supply  chains to reduce fraud opportunities. Food Fraud is a recently defined area of  Food Protection between Food Safety (such as Salmonella or pesticide residue),  and Food Defense (malicious intent to harm such as terrorism). Food Fraud is  intentional with no intent to harm but only for economic gain. As with improving  Food Safety and Food Defense, preventing Food Fraud is good for society and the  economy. Society benefits through fewer public health threats from unauthorized  acts. Society also benefits from increased consumer satisfaction and harmony.  Food Security is increased through the production of more, higher-value products  for consumers, commerce, and exporting. Food Fraud can reduce economic output  because sickened citizens cannot work and it also reduces consumer confidence  leading to less commerce.

T2  - Molecular toxicology
AB  - The toxicity of selected organochlorine, organophosphate, and carbamate pesticides on the functions and cellular parameters of peritoneal macrophages was  examined in inbred C57Bl/6 mice. Effects of single, sublethal pesticide exposure  on macrophages were determined by analysis of the cell viability, cell adherence  capacity, generation of superoxide anion (O2-), antigen processing, phagocytosis  of Salmonella typhimurium, and resistance to in vitro virus-induced cytopathic  effects (cpe) after infection with mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3). Most of the  studies were done for the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin, which inhibited  several macrophage functions, such as phagocytosis of S. typhimurium, release of  the single processed protein antigen avidin, and resistance to MHV3 virus-induced  cpe. The virus-induced cytolysis in macrophage cultures was significantly  increased after in vivo exposure to single sublethal doses of other selected  pesticides, such as guthion, carbofuran, sevin, and matacil. However, none of the  selected pesticides, used in sublethal (0.4 less than or equal to LD50 less than  or equal to 0.6) doses appeared to be a factor impairing the O2- -generating  system in chemically elicited or immunologically activated peritoneal  macrophages. In conclusion, sublethal pesticide exposure can induce a significant  impairement of several macrophage functions, such as phagocytosis, antigen  processing, and resistance to virus-induced cytolysis. Inhibition of the O2-  -generating system by sublethal pesticide exposure, however, can be excluded as a  mechanism of potential suppressory action of these pesticides on antiviral and  antibacterial host defence systems in which macrophages play a primary role.

T2  - Forensic science international
AB  - The bioluminescence response of two genetically modified (lux-marked) bacteria to potentially toxic compounds (PTCs) in stomach contents was monitored using an in  vitro assay. Cells of Escherichia coli HB101 and Salmonella typhimurium both  carrying the lux light producing gene on a plasmid (pUDC607) were added to  stomach contents containing various concentrations of organic and inorganic  compounds. There was some variability in the response of the two biosensors, but  both were sensitive to the herbicides glyphosate, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid  (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T); pentachlorophenol (PCP),  and inorganic poisons arsenic and mercury at a concentration range likely to be  found in stomach contents samples submitted for toxicological analysis. This  study demonstrates that biosensor bioassays could be a useful preliminary  screening tool in forensic toxicology and that such a toxicological screening  should include more than one test organism to maximise the number of PTC's  detected. The probability of false positive results from samples containing  compounds that may interfere with the assay such as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs  and caffeine in tea and coffee was also investigated. Of the substances tested  only coffee has the potential to cause false positive results.

AB  - In Escherichia coli, the SoxRS regulon is required for resistance to redox-cycling agents which elevate cytosolic superoxide levels, as well as for  resistance to nitric oxide-dependent macrophage killing. In Salmonella  typhimurium, SoxS is also required for enhanced expression of Mn-superoxide  dismutase and resistance to paraquat, but not for resistance to nitric oxide  donor compounds in vitro, resistance to macrophage killing, or virulence in mice.  Differences in other antioxidant defense systems or compensation by homologous  regulons may account for species-specific differences in the role of SoxS.

T2  - Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology
AB  - The effects of concentration (1, 10, 100 microg/L) and duration (4, 8, 12 h) of exposure to carbofuran were assessed on the swimming activity, social  interactions, and behavioral responses of goldfish to a flow (0.1 L/min) of  water, with or without chironomids. Observations were also made on the behavioral  responses of unexposed goldfish to a flow (0.1 L/min) of carbofuran-contaminated  water. A 4-h exposure of goldfish 1 microg/L carbofuran produced a significant  increase in sheltering, burst swimming, and nipping. Responses were enhanced at  100 microg/L. After a 12-h exposure, the behavioral effects of 1 microg/L  carbofuran were less apparent. However, burst swimming at 10 microg/L, and  sheltering, nipping and burst swimming at 100 microg/L, were still significantly  increased after a 12-h exposure to carbofuran. Grouping was not consistently  affected by exposure conditions. Chemical attraction to a filtrate of chironomids  was significantly reduced after the 4-h exposure to 1 microg/L carbofuran.  Decreased attraction to the food extract was less apparent after the 12-h  exposure, except at 100 microg/L carbofuran. A significant decrease in attraction  to a flow of uncontaminated water was also observed after a 4-h exposure to 10  and 100 microg/L carbofuran. Unexposed goldfish did not show avoidance reaction  to a flow of carbofuran-contaminated water, even at a concentration (10 mg/L)  exceeding the mean 96-h LC-50 in cyprinids (0.5-1 mg/L). However, at all  concentrations tested (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L), goldfish quickly reacted to the  introduction of the solution of carbofuran by increased burst swimming and  nipping. These results are discussed in the light of the data concerning  behavioral and neurotoxic effects of carbamate and organophosphorous insecticides  in fish.

T2  - International archives of occupational and environmental health
AB  - Recognition of the fact that impairment of the tactile sense may occur independently of other disturbances in the vibration syndrome has rekindled an  interest in developing a diagnostic method for early detection of  vibration-induced neuropathy. There is also evidence suggesting that vibrotactile  measurements represent a valuable diagnostic tool in compressive neuropathies,  such as the carpal tunnel syndrome. The method may also become useful for  diagnosing sensory neuropathies caused by other factors, such as solvents,  pesticides, heavy metals, alcoholism, and diabetes. However, before vibrotactile  measurement can be accepted and established as a tool for clinical diagnostic  purposes, for screening, and in research, the level and the shape of the normal  threshold curve have to be specified. With the purpose of assembling normative  data, the vibrotactile perception thresholds (8-500 Hz) of the right index  fingertip were measured in 171 healthy males (19-75 years) not exposed to  vibration. A Békésy audiometer was modified to operate in combination with a  vibration exciter, instead of headphones, at frequencies lower than usual (8-500  Hz). The results showed that the perception thresholds increased from about 100  dB to about 140 dB (rel. 10(-6) m/s2rms) as a function of frequency and age. The  frequency-dependent changes were not linear, however, but displayed a peak in  sensitivity at 125 Hz. Threshold changes due to aging were most pronounced at the  highest frequencies. It is of the utmost importance that these natural changes  are taken into account when making comparisons between groups or individuals.

TI  - Knowledge and practice of malaria prevention methods among residents of arba minch town and arba minch zuria district, southern ethiopia.
AU  - Astatkie, Ayalew
T2  - Ethiopian journal of health sciences
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, there is no effective vaccine or no effective drug for mass chemoprophylaxis against malaria. Thus, proper know-how and use of prevention  methods is crucial. This study aims to assess the knowledge and practice of  malaria prevention methods among the residents of Arba Minch area, Southern  Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study that utilized a  two-stage sampling was conducted from January 22 to February 1, 2007 on a sample  of 454 household heads or their deputies. SPSS 16 for windows was used for data  analysis. Chi-square and Fisher's exact probability tests were used to assess the  association of selected variables with place of residence. RESULTS: Majority  (86.8%) of the respondents mentioned fever as a symptom of malaria, and 98.2% of  the respondents reported mosquito bite as the cause of malaria. Three hundred and  eighty four (84.6%) of the respondents mentioned mosquito nets as protective  measures against mosquito bites. The protective measure mostly used by the  respondents or other household members in the last 12 months was mosquito net  (73.3%) followed by aerosol insecticide (13%) with the former being used more in  rural areas and the latter in urban areas. CONCLUSION: The study subjects'  awareness regarding the cause, symptoms and preventive measures of malaria was  high. Use of mosquito net as protective measure against mosquito bites in the  last 12 months was high. However, use of other preventive measures was low.  Behavioral change communication is required to increase the use of other  preventive measures along with mosquito nets.

AB  - Concern has been raised that the increased use of pesticides in intensive aquaculture practices may cause adverse sublethal effects to non-target aquatic  species. Azamethiphos is an organophosphate (OP) pesticide used to combat sea  lice infestations in farmed salmonids. Here, the sublethal impact on the blue  mussel, Mytilus edulis, of short term exposure to azamethiphos was determined.  The testing regime included biomarkers of exposure (acetylcholinesterase  activity), cytotoxicity (neutral red retention), immune function (phagocytic  index) and physiological condition (feeding rate). The distribution and  sensitivity of M. edulis acetylcholinesterase to inhibition by azamethiphos was  first determined, yielding IC(50) values of 0.736 and 1.30 mg l(-1) for gill and  haemolymph, respectively. Exposure of mussels to 0.1 mg l(-1) azamethiphos for  periods of up to 24h caused a significant reduction in acetylcholinesterase  activity in both the haemolymph (P<0.0002) and the gill (P<0.002), alteration in  cell viability (P<0.02) and decrease in phagocytic index (P<0.03). The feeding  rate remained unaffected. The results support the hypothesis that, in addition to  its neurotoxic effects, azamethiphos can modulate haemocyte function and immune  defence in M. edulis at environmentally relevant concentrations after only a few  hours.

AB  - Glutathione-dependent defense against xenobiotic toxicity is a multifaceted phenomenon that has been well characterized in mammals. In the present study,  eels of species Anguilla anguilla were exposed to 15 ppm of the herbicide  thiobencarb (S-4-chlorobenzyl diethylthiocarbamate) for 96 h. Eels exposed to the  pesticide were grouped in 24-h intervals according to their time of death, while  surviving intoxicated eels constituted another group (live animals). Glutathione  content (GSx, GSH, GSSG) was determined in liver and muscle tissues of the dead  and live (intoxicated) animals and compared to control values (nonexposed eels).  The fish that died before 96 h of exposure were considered susceptible to  thiobencarb, while those dead after 96 h and the surviving ones were called  resistant. Hepatic glutathione (GSH) content in susceptible eels was lower than  that in the control fish, while resistant eels presented GSH levels threefold  higher than those of controls. Muscle glutathione levels in dead eels were  practically unaffected, but there was a significant decrease in GSH levels in the  surviving intoxicated eels. These results indicate that the eels that were able  to induce glutathione synthesis in the liver due to the presence of thiobencarb  in the medium demonstrated a greater longevity than those who lost glutathione  homeostasis.

AB  - The energetic parameters, such as glycogen, glucose, proteins, lactate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and lactate deshydrogenase (LDH) activity in  tissues and blood of carps from simazine  (2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine) contaminated waters were investigated.  In order to confirm the field results, a laboratory experiment was designed in  which carps were exposed to simazine at the concentration level of 45 micro g.  L(- 1) (10-fold of the amount found in natural waters) for 90 days. Fish from a  contaminated reservoir showed low glycogen concentrations in hepatopancreas and  muscle, while fish in another contaminated reservoir showed high LDH activity  together with an increase in lactate content in muscle. Laboratory findings did  not confirm field results, and fish exposed to simazine did not show alterations  in the parameters studied. The results suggest that carps were not stressed by  the presence of the simazine at the concentration levels found in both studies  and the mechanisms of defense covered the energetic demand.

AB  - A variety of stresses, hormones, glucocorticoids and cytokines are known to induce metallothioneins (MTs) in animals. The aim of this study was to  investigate the effects of chemical stress induced by the dicarboximide fungicide  procymidone on hepatic structure, MT content and antioxidative defences (catalase  and glutathione reductase activities and glutathione content) in the common fish  Rutilus rutilus. Catalase and glutathione reductase activities remained stable  throughout the experiment. Four days of exposure to 0.2 or 0.4 mg l(-1) of  procymidone induced an obvious increase in liver MT content, perturbation of  metal MT contents, and an increase in hepatic glutathione content. After 14 days'  exposure, obvious and large structural alterations of the hepatic parenchyma  occurred simultaneously with a decrease in MT and glutathione content. These  events were interpreted as degeneration of the liver. Fish exposed for 14 days to  procymidone and then placed for 14 days in clean water showed nearly complete  decontamination of the liver, but MT concentrations remained high. The  toxicological significance of these events is discussed.

AB  - A simplified method suitable for simultaneous analysis of chlorinated pesticide and phthalate ester residues in various foods was developed. Chemical residues  were quantitatively extracted from fatty and vegetable samples with acetonitrile  as follows: Chemical standard in 0.5 mL ethanol solution was added to 10 g  homogenized sample. After 3 hr, pork and beef were extracted 3 times with 20 mL  portions of acetonitrile. The acetonitrile layers were diluted with water and  extracted with n-hexane. Rice samples were combined with 10 mL water, 5 mL  acetonitrile and 1 mL ethanol and extracted 3 times with 20 mL portions of  n-hexane. The n-hexane concentrate from each sample was submitted to AgNO3-coated  Florisil column chromatography. The AgNO3 coating adequately adsorbed interfering  coextractives. Extracts of fish and vegetable samples were separated into 2  fractions by the above column chromatography. Supplemental cleanup procedures  were also developed to accurately determine phthalate esters eluted in the second  fraction. Satisfactory gas chromatograms were obtained for most samples.

AB  - The effluent stream from the industrial production of the herbicide trifluraline (amination water) was submitted to a combined treatment of a physical-chemical  process (coagulation) with an advanced oxidation process (Fenton). The recovering  of the residual sludge was performed. The combined  coagulation-Fenton-sedimentation process proved to be very suitable for  wastewater color reduction (91.6%), promoting considerable abatement of the  organic load (63.4% COD reduction). According to the fractionary factorial  design, the main effects of pH (A) and Fenton sludge (B) variables were  considered statistical fluctuations of the process (and not decisive), while the  main effects of Fe(3+) (C), Fe(2+) (D) and H(2)O(2) (E), as well as the  interactions between variables A and B, A and E, C and D and C and E were  considered significant. The obtained results suggest that the combined process  can be advantageous for the treatment of recalcitrant industrial effluents, such  as the amination water from the trifluraline production.

AB  - The killing of Candida albicans by a series of amphiphilic quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) with different hydrocarbon chain lengths was closely related to  the binding of the compounds to the cells and damage of the cell membranes. The  membrane damage was measured as the level of release of the UV-absorbing material  into the medium in which the cells were suspended and as the level of uptake of  propidium iodide in individual cells by flow cytometry. It was shown that of the  compounds tested, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (cetyltrimethylammonium  bromide [CTAB]) bound most efficiently. Tetradecyl betainate chloride (B14),  tetradecanoylcholine bromide (C14), tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB),  and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) followed and had declining degrees of  binding efficiency. The proportion of CTAB bound was almost total at  concentrations up to the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the compound,  whereas that of B14 was somewhat smaller. For the two remaining tetradecyl  compounds (C14 and TTAB), still smaller proportions were bound at low  concentrations, but the proportions rose disproportionally at increasing  concentrations to a distinct maximum at concentrations of 0.2 to 0.5 times the  CMC. We propose that interfacial micelle-like aggregates are formed at the cell  surface as a step in the binding process. An analogous, but less conspicuous,  maximum was seen for DTAB. Thus, great differences in the binding affinity of  QACs with different hydrocarbon chains at different concentrations to C. albicans  were observed. These differences were related to the CMC of the compound. In  contrast, the binding of TTAB to Salmonella typhimurium 395 MS was almost total  at low as well as high concentrations until saturation was attained, indicating  fundamental differences between binding to the yeast and binding to gram-negative  bacteria. The importance of lipid-type complexes or aggregates to the antifungal  effect of membrane-active substances are discussed.

T2  - Indian journal of experimental biology
AB  - The sublethal concentration 6 mg.l-1 of a piscicidal flavanoid, 'Quercetin glycoside', obtained from E. colebrookiana affected neuro-architecture in medulla  oblongata of freshwater fish, Barilius bendelisis (Ham.), at 32 days exposure.  Since medulla of fish is primary centre for the reception of several incoming  stimuli, the breakdown of neurons and their neuraxes in facial and vagal lobes  impaired the transmission of sensory informations to cerebellum. Consequently  fish became unconscious and could be caught easily with hands. The symptoms like  lack of schooling, lack of response to food and external stimuli, sluggishness,  incapability of maintaining body posture and uncoordinated functioning are  accounted for by the neurolysis in hind brain of fish.

AB  - Malaria has been existing in Armenia since antiquity. In the 1920"s to 1930s, thousands of people suffered from this disease in the country. Enormous efforts  were required to prevent further spread of the disease. A network was set up,  which consisted of a research institute and stations. A total of 200,000 cases of  malaria were still notified in 1934. Rapid development of the health  infrastructure and better socioeconomic conditions improved the malaria situation  and reduced the number of cases in 1946. Malaria was completely eradicated in  Armenia in 1963, and the malaria-free situation retained till 1994. During that  period, comprehensive activities were undertaken in the country to prevent and  control malaria. Since 1990, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the  situation became critical in many newly independent states. Economic crisis,  human migration, worsening levels of health services, and the lack of necessary  medicines, equipment, and insecticides significantly affected the malaria  epidemiological situation in the country. Malaria cases started to penetrate into  Armenia from neighboring countries. In 1994, a hundred ninety six military men  contacted malaria in Karabakh, which was unfavorable in terms of malaria, as well  on as the border with Iran and along the Araks river. The first cases recorded in  Armenia were imported, afterwards they led to the incidence of indigenous cases,  given the fact that all the prerequisites for malaria mosquito breeding and  development were encountered in 17 regions and 3 towns of the country. In 1995,  there were 502 imported cases and in 1996 the situation changed: out of 347  registered cases, 149 were indigenous. The Ministry of Health undertook a range  of preventive measures. In 1997 versus 1996, the total number of malaria cases  increased 2.3-fold: 841 registered cases of which 567 were indigenous (a 3.8-fold  increase). The overwhelming majority of cases were recorded in the Ararat and  Armavir marzes. In 1998, there were a total of 1156 cases, of them 542 being  locally contacted. The situation became stable thanks to joint efforts of WHO,  IFRX, the Armenian Red Cross Society, UNICEF, the Ministry of Health of Armenia  and its Government. Under Minister's Decree No. 292 of May 17, 1999, a malaria  project implementation office was established in the Masis Sanitary and  Epidemiological Surveillance Center of Hygienic and Antiepidemic Surveillance to  improve progress of the malaria control programme in Armenia. WHO allocated some  7,700 USD for 5-month maintenance and work of the office. Thus, analyzing the  malaria cases registered in 1999 and 1998 indicates a 1.9-fold decrease (616/77).  The setting up the malaria programme field office under the Minister's decree was  instrumental in planning and implementing activities in situ. In 1999, four cases  of tropical malaria were recorded in Armenia. The patients were Armenian pilots  who contacted malaria during duty travels: 1 in Sudan and 3 in Congo. The list of  pilots making flying to endemic countries was submitted to the Republican Center  to implement preventive measures in the future. In Armenia malaria surveillance  has been improved to ensure timely detection of all suspected cases and to carry  out malaria control activities. In this regard, a seminar was held for 21  entomologists and 12 parasitologists. UNICEF and WHO Armenian offices provided a  substantial support to organize seminars. To facilitate the seminars, the manual  "Malaria parasitology and entomology" was published and distributed among their  participants. On April 19, 1999, the session of the Ministry's Executive Board  (Collegium) gave recommendations to reinforce malaria control activities in the  country. Decrees No. 256 of May 31, 1999, No. 47 of May 29, 1999, and No. 245 of  April 30, 1999, "On malaria and preventive and control activities" were issued by  the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Internal  Affairs and National Security to serve as a guideline for planning and  implementing activities. The Ministry of Agriculture undertook to clean the  collective irrigation (drainage) system covering 102 and 77 km in the Ararat and  Armavir marzes, the Ministry of Health provided a list of endemic foci where  cleaning was a priority. Taking into account the importance of the people's  participation in ensuring effective prevention and control, emphasis was laid on  health education activities: publication of leaflets, as well as articles in  local newspapers, radio broadcasts and TV shows. Throughout the season, the early  detection of malaria cases, timely hospitalization (in no later than 1-3 days)  for at least 5 days and subsequent treatment under direct supervision of a  physician were successfully carried out due to home-to-home visits. Entomological  studies conducted in the malaria foci show an increase in the presence and  density of a malaria vector in the buildings. As far as treatment is concerned,  the overall surface of stagnant waters comprised 2642 ha in 1999 (2733 ha in  1998), including 1285 ha of anophelogenic stagnant waters (2276 ha in 1998). The  biggest stagnant water surfaces were in the Ararat and Armavir marzes--2209 ha,  where the majority of malaria cases were recorded. A total of 1,283,111 and  559,213 sq. m. of constructions were treated in 1999 and 1998, respectively, out  them there were 1,259,637 sq. m. in 5 endemic regions. Stagnant water surfaces  were treated with bacticulicides on 250.7 and 743.8 (almost 3 times more) in 1998  and 1999, respectively. In 1999, 740 ha of surface were biologically treated  using Gambusia compared to 900 ha treated in 1998. There is no highly qualified  diagnostic specialists in many regions of the country, which necessitates the  holding of further seminars involving relevant specialists, in all malaria  regions. There is a tendency of geographical spread of malaria: malaria cases  occur in new regions and dwellings. A country-wide action plan was drafted for  2000, mainly focusing on staff training. With WHO assistance, a seminar was held  for 324 specialists from endemic regions. During the first quarter of 2000, 13  cases of tertian malaria were recorded as compared 59 cases during the same  period of last year. All these patients contacted malaria in the previous season  and demonstrated long incubation periods. Thus, the malaria control plan  recommended by WHO and the rational and targeted use of its assistance has shown  a 2-fold decrease in the incidence of malaria.

AB  - We assessed spatial patterns in 37 PCB congeners, eight pesticides, and the heavy metals mercury and cadmium in the flatfish Solea solea at four sites in the Gulf  of Lions (NW Mediterranean). Overall contaminant concentrations generally  exceeded those reported for S. solea elsewhere, but fell into the range of other  Gulf fishes, testifying of a relatively high contaminant load of this area.  Spatial patterns in all three contaminant classes were highly significant, but  differed among classes. PCB congener and chlorination class profiles also  differed among sites. The observed patterns would be consistent with (1) PCB  point-sources in the Eastern Gulf (Marseille, Rhone River) versus dominance of  atmospheric input in the West, (2) pesticide input by the Rhone and from  agricultural fields in the West, and (3) mercury point-sources near Marseille.  The unique, site-specific contaminant profiles prove to be a powerful tool to  differentiate between S. solea populations from different sites.

AU  - Nicolaou, K. C.

T2  - Journal of the American Chemical Society
AB  - Vancomycin is the last line of defense available in the clinic for treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Vancomycin contains two 16-membered  diaryl ether macrocycles, each of which contains a stereogenic axis across the  diaryl ether linkage. Since an effective total synthesis of vancomycin requires  that these stereogenic axes be formed in a stereoselective manner, we have  developed an atropselective variation of the triazene mediated diaryl ether  forming reaction. This variation introduced an energetic penalty into the  transition state of the undesired atropisomer. This reaction is used to  synthesize the C-O-D diaryl ether macrocycle found in vancomycin with high  diastereoselectivity (de > 90%), providing the naturally occurring atropisomeric  configuration.

AB  - Sublethal concentration (2.6 mg/l) of a triterpene based piscicidal glycoside of A. indica damaged the neurons, fibre tracts and central correlation sites for  gustatory, tactile and visceral sensory impulses in medulla oblongata of fish  after prolonged poisoning. The fear, sinking to bottom, lack of schooling and non  discriminatory pattern in treated fish were because of neurodepression. The jerky  movement, ventilatory inefficiency, swallowing air bubbles and light pinkness of  gills were due to the degradation of respiratory centres in the vagal lobes of  toxified fish.

AB  - There is growing evidence that long-term exposure to prometryn (a widely used herbicide) can induce toxicity in bony fish and shrimp. Our previous study  demonstrated its 96 h acute toxicity on the crab Eriocheir sinensis. However,  studies on whether longer exposure to prometryn with a lower dose induces  toxicity in E. sinensis are scarce. Therefore, we conducted a 20 d exposure  experiment to investigate its effects on the hepatopancreas and intestine of E.  sinensi. Prometryn reduce the activities of antioxidant enzymes, increase the  level of lipid peroxidation and cause oxidative stress. Moreover, long-term  exposure resulted in immune and detoxification fatigue, while short-term exposure  to prometryn could upregulate the expression of genes related to immunity,  inflammation and detoxification. Prometryn altered the morphological structure of  the hepatopancreas (swollen lumen) and intestine (shorter intestinal villi,  thinner muscle layer and thicker peritrophic membrane). In addition, prometryn  changed the species composition of the intestinal flora. In particular,  Bacteroidota and Proteobacteria showed a dose-dependent decrease accompanied by a  dose-dependent increase in Firmicutes at the phylum level. At the genus level,  all exposure groups significantly increased the abundance of Zoogloea and a  Firmicutes bacterium ZOR0006, but decreased Shewanella abundance. Interestingly,  Pearson correlation analysis indicated a potential association between  differential flora and hepatopancreatic disorder. Phenotypic abundance analysis  indicated that changes in the gut flora decreased the intestinal organ's  resistance to stress and increased the potential for opportunistic infection. In  summary, our research provides new insights into the prevention and defense  strategies in response to external adverse environments and contributes to the  sustainable development of E. sinensis culture.

AB  - Xenorhabdus nematophila produces type 1 fimbriae on the surface of Phase I cells. Fimbriae mediate recognition and adhesion of the bacteria to its target cell. To  investigate the role of fimbriae in the biology of X. nematophila, we have  produced a fimbrial mutant strain by insertional inactivation of the mrxA gene,  encoding the structural subunit of type 1 fimbriae. Phenotypic characterization  of the mutant revealed loss of fimbriae on the cell surface. Cell surface  characteristics like dye absorption, biofilm formation, red blood cell  agglutination remained unaltered. The mrxA mutant was defective in swarming on  soft agar, although swimming motility was not affected. Flagellar expression was  suppressed in the mrxA strain under swarming conditions, but not swimming  conditions. Agglutination and cytotoxicity of the mutant to larval haemocytes was  also reduced. When the mutant cells were injected in the haemocoel of the fourth  instar larvae of Helicoverpa armigera, an increase in the LT(50) of 9-12 h was  observed relative to the wild-type strain. The nematode growth was slow on the  lawn of the fimbrial mutant. The mrxA negative strain was unable to colonize the  nematode gut efficiently. This study demonstrates importance of type 1 fimbriae  in establishment of bacteria-nematode symbiosis, a key to successful pest  management program.

AB  - CD9 is a glycoprotein of the transmembrane 4 superfamily that is involved in various cellular processes. Studies related to the immune functions and  activities of CD9 in teleost fish are limited. In this study, we characterized  two CD9 homologs, PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3, from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys  olivaceus). Sequence analysis showed that PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 possess  characteristic transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) structures. PoCD9.1 shares  70.61% sequence identity with PoCD9.3. The expression of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 in  the three main immune tissues was significantly induced in a time-dependent  manner by extracellular and intracellular pathogen infection, which indicates  that the two CD9 homologs play an important role in the response to pathogenic  infection. Following infection with the extracellular pathogen Vibrio  anguillarum, the expression profiles of both PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 were similar.  After infection with the intracellular pathogen Edwardsiella piscicida, the  expression levels of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 were different at different stages of  infection, especially in the spleen. The spleen was the most important tissue for  the PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 responses to pathogen infection among the three examined  immune tissues. Knockdown of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 attenuated the ability of host  cells to eliminate pathogenic bacteria, and PoCD9.1 knockdown was more lethal  than PoCD9.3 knockdown for host cells with E. piscicida infection. Overexpression  of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 promoted host or host cell defence against E. piscicida  infection. These findings suggest that PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 serve as  immune-related factors, play an important role in the immune defence system of  Japanese flounder, and display different functions in response to different  pathogens at different stages of infection.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - As an organophosphate ester (OPE), triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) has been frequently detected in aquatic environments, and its environmental risk has been widely  studied. The gills and intestines are the most important part of the mucosal  immune barrier in fish as the first line of defense against the invasion of  harmful substances. TPhP is more abundant in the gill and intestine of fish.  However, knowledge of the toxic effects and potential mechanisms of TPhP on the  intestine and gill is limited. Herein, the adverse effects of TPhP (0.01, 0.1 and  1 mg/L) on the gills and intestines of zebrafish after 75 days of exposure were  investigated from the perspectives of histology, oxidative stress and immune  level. The histological results of exposed zebrafish showed that TPhP caused  significant damage to gills and intestines. TPhP significantly increased the  activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and glutathione  s-transferase (GST), inducing oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA.  Meanwhile, the immune function of the gills and intestines was significantly  influenced by TPhP, as evidenced by the upregulation of the expression of  interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), upregulation of the content of  complement 3 (C3) and complement 4 (C4), and downregulation of the activity of  lysozyme (LZM) and the content of immunoglobulin M (IgM). Oxidative stress and  the immune response were more severe in the gills. These findings indicate that  TPhP, a typical OPE, caused tissue damage in aquatic organisms by inducing  oxidative stress and immune damage and has strong environmental toxicity.

AB  - Human natural killer (NK) lymphocytes play a central role in immune system defense against viral infection and against the formation of primary tumors.  Organotin (OT) pesticides have been used in industrial and agricultural  applications, and OT contamination has been reported in water, sediment, and  fish. Carbamate pesticides are currently used in agricultural chemicals. Two  specific carbamates used in agriculture are ziram and maneb; ziram also is used  as an additive in rubber products including latex gloves. In previous studies we  demonstrated that at concentrations in the 150-200 nM range, the OTs tributyltin  (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) were capable of disrupting the function of human NK  cells after incubations to as short as 24 h. Previously, we also examined the  effects of ziram and maneb at higher concentrations on the cytotoxic function of  human NK cells. The current study examined the effects of exposure of up to 6  days to lower concentrations of each of these compounds on the cytotoxic function  of NK cells. The OTs were studied at concentrations ranging from 200 to 10 nM;  ziram was studied at concentrations of 2.5 microM-125 nM and maneb at  concentrations of 10-1 microM. These conditions were studied both in highly  purified NK cells and in a mixture of lymphocytes containing both T and NK cells.  As little as 25 nM TBT decreased the function of purified NK cells after 24 and  48 h, whereas 10 nM TBT was effective after 6 days. The lowest level of TPT that  was effective at 24 h was 50 nM whereas the results after 48 h and 6 days were  similar to those seen with TBT. The presence of T lymphocytes diminished the  effects of both TBT and TPT on NK cytotoxic function. A concentration of ziram as  low as 125 nM produced significant loss of cytotoxic function in highly purified  NK cells (65% decrease in function after 6 days). The toxicity of each of the  compounds studied increased very significantly with length of exposure.

T2  - Journal of health & pollution
AB  - BACKGROUND: Population growth has led to the need to increase global food production. Pesticides are an important tool used in efforts to control insect  pests. About 20-30% of agricultural produce is lost annually due to insect pests,  diseases, weeds and rodents. While pesticides are effective against pest  populations, if used injudiciously, they may pose health hazards to humans,  domestic animals, natural enemies of crop pests and other forms of life through  unwanted contamination of food, feed, water bodies and the environment.  OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to examine farmers' level of  knowledge and awareness of environmental pollution due to unsafe use of  pesticides for controlling rice pests and to explore ways of reducing their  usage. METHODS: The research population consisted of 120 rice farmers: 40 farmers  randomly selected from each of the three rice growing districts of Bangladesh;  Mymensingh, Tangail and Jamalpur. Data was collected through group discussions,  direct observations and personal interviews during March 2013 to May 2014.  RESULTS: Farmers mainly sought advice on pesticide use from pesticide dealers or  retailers and a very few farmers contacted government extension workers for this  purpose. Most of the farmers had an understanding of natural enemies of rice  pests and that the application of synthetic insecticides in the field can reduce  their population. A few farmers followed integrated pest management (IPM)  practices with little understanding of the adverse effects of insecticides on the  environment and ecosystem. The majority of farmers understood the harmful effects  of pesticides on health of human and animals, beneficial species, fish, insect  resistance, soil and food. It was also found that education on pest management,  information through television, more contact with extension personnel and  farmers' awareness of IPM were critical factors for improving rice farmers'  understanding of the ecological hazards caused by overuse of pesticides. Most of  the farmers suggested that timely removal of weeds, appropriate timing for  pesticide application, balanced doses of fertilizers, pest monitoring, correct  dose of appropriate pesticides, pest tolerant varieties, increasing technical  knowledge and skills and creating social awareness of environmental pollution  among farmers were necessary to reduce the quantity of pesticides and minimize  environmental hazards. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified a need to  intensify farmers' awareness and knowledge of integrated pest management and  environmental pollution through extension organizations which could help promote  sustainable agricultural development and improve the currently endangered  bio-diversity of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANT CONSENT: Obtained. ETHICAL APPROVAL:  This study was approved by the PhD Supervisory Committee assigned by the  Department of Entomology of Bangladesh Agricultural University.

T2  - Infection and immunity
AB  - AIP56 (apoptosis-inducing protein of 56 kDa) is a metalloprotease AB toxin secreted by Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida that acts by cleaving NF-κB.  During infection, AIP56 spreads systemically and depletes phagocytes by  postapoptotic secondary necrosis, impairing the host phagocytic defense and  contributing to the genesis of infection-associated necrotic lesions. Here we  show that mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDM) intoxicated by AIP56  undergo NF-κB p65 depletion and apoptosis. Similarly to what was reported for sea  bass phagocytes, intoxication of mBMDM involves interaction of AIP56 C-terminal  region with cell surface components, suggesting the existence of a conserved  receptor. Biochemical approaches and confocal microscopy revealed that AIP56  undergoes clathrin-dependent endocytosis, reaches early endosomes, and follows  the recycling pathway. Translocation of AIP56 into the cytosol requires endosome  acidification, and an acidic pulse triggers translocation of cell surface-bound  AIP56 into the cytosol. Accordingly, at acidic pH, AIP56 becomes more  hydrophobic, interacting with artificial lipid bilayer membranes. Altogether,  these data indicate that AIP56 is a short-trip toxin that reaches the cytosol  using an acidic-pH-dependent mechanism, probably from early endosomes. Usually,  for short-trip AB toxins, a minor pool reaches the cytosol by translocating from  endosomes, whereas the rest is routed to lysosomes for degradation. Here we  demonstrate that part of endocytosed AIP56 is recycled back and released  extracellularly through a mechanism requiring phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)  activity but independent of endosome acidification. So far, we have been unable  to detect biological activity of recycled AIP56, thereby bringing into question  its biological relevance as well as the importance of the recycling pathway.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aimed to develop a comprehensive risk assessment tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and any dementia, that will be  applicable in high and low resource settings. METHOD: Risk factors which can  easily be assessed in most settings, and their effect sizes, were identified from  an umbrella review, or estimated using meta-analysis where new data were  available. RESULTS: Seventeen risk/protective factors met criteria for the  algorithm to estimate risk for any dementia including age, sex, education,  hypertension, midlife obesity, midlife high cholesterol, diabetes, insufficient  physical activity, depression, traumatic brain injury, atrial fibrillation,  smoking, social engagement, cognitive engagement, fish consumption (diet),  stroke, and insomnia. A version for AD excluded atrial fibrillation and insomnia  due to insufficient evidence and included pesticide exposure. There was  insufficient evidence for a VaD risk score. DISCUSSION: Validation of the tool on  external datasets is planned. The assessment tool will assist with implementing  risk reduction guidelines.

AB  - Currently, treatments for dengue infection are only symptomatic as no antiviral agents nor vaccines are available to combat this virus. Despite challenges faced  by researchers, many efforts are ongoing to reduce cases of dengue infection  either by targeting the vector or the virus. Vector population is monitored and  reduced by using mechanical, chemical and biological controls. Chemical control  is achieved either by using synthetic or natural insecticides where the latter is  more preferable. In biological control, bacteria, fungi and larvivorous fish are  utilised to reduce the vector population. Moreover, genes of mosquitoes are also  explored to produce progenies which are sterile with low survival ability.  Vaccines are among the most effective ways to prevent viral infection. Various  approaches have been used and are still being explored towards producing vaccines  for dengue. These include live attenuated, inactivated, recombinant subunit,  nucleic acid and virus-like particles vaccines. The aim is to produce a vaccine  which can target all the four serotypes of the virus. Monoclonal antibodies are  widely researched on to equip the host defense mechanism against the dengue  virus. Deeper understanding of the virus replication cycle warrants the  development of antiviral agents which target viral proteins vital for the  replication process. Bioactive compounds are also utilised in the development of  antiviral agents. The importance of surveillance and supportive therapy are also  discussed.

AB  - Fumio Matsumura joined the University of California, Davis, faculty in 1987 where he served as founding director of the Center for Environmental Health Sciences,  associate director of the U.C. Toxic Substances Research and Teaching Program,  and chair of the Department of Environmental Toxicology. He was an active  affiliate with the NIEHS-funded Superfund Basic Research Program and the NIH  Comprehensive Cancer Center. He was in many instances a primary driver or  otherwise involved in most activities related to environmental toxicology at  Davis, including the education of students in environmental biochemistry and  ecotoxicology. A significant part of his broad research program was focused on  the long range transport of chemicals such as toxaphene, PCBs and related  contaminants used or released in California to the Sierra Nevada mountains,  downwind of the urban and agricultural regions of the state. He hypothesized that  these chemical residues adversely affected fish and wildlife, and particularly  the declining populations of amphibians in Sierra Nevada streams and lakes. Fumio  and his students and colleagues found residues of toxaphene and PCBs at higher  elevations, an apparent result of atmospheric drift and deposition in the  mountains. Fumio and his wife Teruko had personal interests in, and a love of the  mountains, as avid skiers, hikers, and outdoor enthusiasts.

T2  - Environmental research
AB  - The giant otter, Pteronura brasiliensis, (Zimmermann, 1780), is a semiaquatic carnivore that feeds mainly on fish. Mercury has high toxicity and high potential  for bioaccumulation in tissues and biomagnification in organisms through food  chains. Thus, as a top predator in the trophic chain, the giant otter has the  potential to accumulate mercury by biomagnification. The objective of the present  study was to measure the total mercury concentration in giant otter fur samples  from an area in the southern Brazilian Pantanal. Fur samples from 19 otters from  different social groups were collected from captured animals or were sampled with  biopsy darts. Total mercury determination was performed by cold steam  spectrophotometry. Mercury concentrations found in the giant otter fur were  7.15 ± 3.41 μg g(-1) (2.01-12.06 μg g(-1)) dry weight. The values are above to  the upper limit found in fur samples of otter species not exposed to  contamination sources, which typically range from 1 to 5 μg g(-1). The  concentrations found in the study area indicate that even in the southern  Pantanal, which is approximately 475 km from gold mining activity, mercury can be  considered a threat for giant otters, as well as for riverside populations. It is  also important to consider that other anthropogenic sources of mercury, such as  pesticides used in agriculture, could affect this population.

AB  - Detoxifying pathways of mosquitoes against the neem (Azadirachta indica) extracts are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of  adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in this process in  Anopheles stephensi, one of the main malaria vectors in southern Asia.  Third-stage larvae of An. stephensi were fed with fish food alone or in  combination with neem extract at 0.5%, 1%, 5%, and 10%. Six ABC-transporter genes  from 3 different subfamilies (B, C, and G) were analyzed to assess their relative  expression compared with controls. A bioassay was also performed to assess larval  mortality rate at different concentrations and in combination with verapamil, an  ABC-transporter inhibitor. No significant variation in the expression levels of  any transporter belonging to the B, C, and G subfamilies was detected.  Furthermore, the use of verapamil did not induce an increase in mortality at any  of the tested neem extract concentrations, indicating that ABC transporters are  not involved in the detoxification of neem extracts in An. stephensi larvae.

AB  - Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) is responsible for disease outbreaks in marine aquaculture worldwide. Solea senegalensis, a valuable fish  species for aquaculture in the south of Europe, is frequently affected by this  pathogen. It is well established that bacteria respond to environmental signals  and, in the case of pathogens, this ability may determine the outcome of their  interaction with the host. Determination of gene expression under in vivo  conditions constitutes a valuable tool in the assessment of microbial  pathogenesis. Considering that different hosts may represent different  environments for the pathogen, expression of Phdp virulence and in vivo induced  antigen (IVIAT) genes during S. senegalensis infection has been determined in the  present work. Increased transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in iron  acquisition (Irp1, Irp2, HutB and HutD), oxidative stress defence (AhpC and Sod),  adhesion (PDP_0080), toxins (AIP56) and metabolism (Impdh, Shmt and AlaRS) were  detected in Phdp infecting S. senegalensis head kidney or liver. The highest  increases corresponded to genes involved in survival under iron limiting  conditions and oxidative stress, indicating their essential role during infection  of sole. Results obtained give insight into Phdp virulence strategies and  contribute to the identification of promising targets for the control of  photobacteriosis.

AB  - Biocontrol of subterranean termites is largely impeded by their social immune responses. Studies on biocontrol agents combined with natural insecticides and  their possible effects on the immune defense mechanisms of termites are limited.  In this study, we investigated the effects of a combined biocontrol strategy  using a plant-derived insect ATPase inhibitor, α-terpineol, with the  entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) Steinernema carpocapsae against the  subterranean termite Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki. Survival assays showed that  even a low lethal concentration of α-terpineol significantly increased the  EPNs-induced virulence in C. formosanus. α-terpineol treatment majorly inhibited  the activity of Na(+)- K(+)- ATPase, which disturbed the EPNs-induced enhancement  of locomotor activity and grooming behavior in termites treated with the combined  strategy. Furthermore, the combination treatment had a synergistic inhibitory  effect on innate immune responses in C. formosanus, which were measured as  changes in the expression of immune-related genes and activities of immune system  enzymes. In conclusion, α-terpineol can weaken the immune defense of termites  against EPNs at low lethal concentrations, and is a suitable non-synthetic  insecticide to prove the biocontrol efficiency of EPNs on C. formosanus. This  study provides a theoretical basis and technical reference for a novel biocontrol  strategy that promises to overcome the problems of host immune defense in  termites.

T2  - Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry
AB  - A microextraction technique based on ultrasonic emulsification and demulsification was developed for detecting pesticides at trace levels in  environmental water samples. In this ultrasound-assisted microextraction (UAME),  chloroform was emulsified with an aqueous sample solution containing trace  fenitrothion (MEP) by ultrasonic irradiation (48 kHz) for 5 min. The emulsion was  then demulsified by ultrasonic irradiation (2.4 MHz) for 10 min. This resulted in  phase separation of the water and chloroform without centrifugation. The  demulsified chloroform was collected by a microsyringe and submitted to gas  chromatography-mass spectrometry. In conventional extraction with mechanical  stirring, the extraction recovery (ER) of MEP was strongly dependent on the  sample/chloroform volume ratio. However, in UAME, the ER was independent of the  volume ratio and the ER was >80 % when the enrichment factor was 40. In UAME, MEP  was rapidly extracted into the chloroform because of the large specific surface  areas of the small chloroform droplets in the oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion. This  gave a high extraction efficiency for MEP. UAME is a simple method requiring only  a change in the ultrasound frequency and with no pretreatment steps that could  contaminate the sample. The suitability of UAME was demonstrated by application  to the detection of trace levels of pesticides in a spiked water sample from a  fish tank.

AB  - As a leading pathogen, Edwardsiella piscicida can cause hemorrhagic septicemia in fish and gastro-intestinal infections in humans. The two-component regulatory  system EsrA-EsrB plays essential roles in pathogenesis through the type III and  type VI secretion systems, and hemolysin production in E. piscicida It is unclear  whether other virulence- or stress response-associated genes are regulated by  EsrA-EsrB. In this study, the proteomes of wild-type E. piscicida EIB202 and esrB  mutant strains were compared to reveal EsrB regulon components after growth in  Luria-Bertani broth (LB). Overall, the expression levels of nine genes exhibited  significant changes, and five of them required the presence of EsrB, while others  exhibited higher levels in the esrB mutant. The diverse functions of these  proteins were identified, including amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress  defense and energy production. Interestingly, superoxidase dismutase and thiol  peroxidase were the most significantly down-regulated by EsrB. Furthermore, other  reported reactive oxygen species (ROS) resistance-related genes were also  down-regulated by EsrB as revealed by quantitative real-time. Compared with the  wild-type and the complement strain esrB(+), ΔesrB displayed a significantly  enhanced ROS resistance. These results demonstrated that EsrB plays important  roles in the ROS resistance pathway in E. piscicida grown in LB conditions.

T2  - Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects approximately 35 million people worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that many risk factors for AD are modifiable. AD  pathology develops over decades. Hence risk reduction interventions require very  long follow-ups to show effects on AD incidence. Focussing on AD risk, instead of  diagnosis, provides a more realistic target for prevention strategies. We  developed a novel methodology that yields a global approach to risk assessment  for AD for use in population-based settings and interventions. The methodology  was used to develop a risk assessment tool that can be updated as more evidence  becomes available. First, a systematic search strategy identified risk and  protective factors for AD. Eleven risk factors and four protective factors for AD  were identified for which odds ratios were published or could be calculated (age,  sex, education, body mass index, diabetes, depression, serum cholesterol,  traumatic brain injury, smoking, alcohol intake, social engagement, physical  activity, cognitive activity, fish intake, and pesticide exposure). An algorithm  was developed to combine the odds ratios into an AD risk score. The approach  allows for interactions among risk factors which provides for their varying  impact over the life-course as current evidence suggests midlife is a critical  period for some risk factors. Finally, a questionnaire was developed to assess  the risk and protective factors by self-report. Compared with developing risk  indices on single cohort studies, this approach allows for more risk factors to  be included, greater generalizeability of results, and incorporation of  interactions based on findings from different stages of the lifecourse.

AB  - For decades, multiple anthropogenic stressors have threatened the Galápagos Islands. Widespread marine pollution such as oil spills, persistent organic  pollutants, metals, and ocean plastic pollution has been linked to concerning  changes in the ecophysiology and health of Galápagos species. Simultaneously,  illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are reshaping the composition and  structure of endemic and native Galápagos pelagic communities. In this novel  review, we discuss the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and their associated  ecotoxicological implications for Galápagos species in the face of climate change  stressors. We emphasize the importance of considering fishing pressure and marine  pollution, in combination with climate-change impacts, when assessing the  evolutionary fitness of species inhabiting the Galápagos. For example, the  survival of endemic marine iguanas has been negatively affected by organic  hydrocarbons introduced via oil spills, and endangered Galápagos sea lions  exhibit detectable concentrations of DDT, triggering potential feminization  effects and compromising the species' survival. During periods of ocean warming  (El Niño events) when endemic species undergo nutritional stress, climate change  may increase the vulnerability of these species to the impacts of pollutants,  resulting in the species reaching its population tipping point. Marine plastics  are emerging as a deleterious and widespread threat to endemic species. The  Galápagos is treasured for its historical significance and its unparalleled  living laboratory and display of evolutionary processes; however, this unique and  iconic paradise will remain in jeopardy until multidisciplinary and comprehensive  preventative management plans are put in place to mitigate and eliminate the  effects of anthropogenic stressors facing the islands today. We present a  critical analysis and synthesis of anthropogenic stressors with some progress  from local and international institutional efforts and call to action more  precautionary measures along with new management philosophies focused on  understanding the processes of change through research to champion the  conservation of the Galápagos.

AB  - Exploring the contamination profile of multi-class emerging contaminants (ECs) in wastewater is highly desirable. To this end, the occurrence, removal, mass  loading and risks associated with a large panel of pharmaceuticals and personal  care products, illicit drugs, perfluorinated compounds and organophosphate flame  retardants in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the region of  Thessaloniki (Greece) after a survey is illustrated. Influent and effluent  wastewaters were submitted to solid phase extraction on Oasis HLB cartridges,  followed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography Orbitrap high-resolution  mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Orbitrap MS). Influent concentrations in both WWTPs were  notably higher than effluent, with caffeine, acetaminophen, irbesartan and  valsartan being the most ubiquitous compounds, exhibiting elevated  concentrations. Average effluent concentrations ranged from below the method  quantification limits (<MQL) to remarkably high values (μg L(-1) scale), such as  for caffeine, acetaminophen, diclofenac, irbesartan and valsartan, among others.  Removal efficiencies ranged between -273% for lamotrigine and 100%, i.e., for the  UV filter BP1. Notably, the polar compounds such as cytarabine, methotrexate and  capecitabine were removed at a rate >80% in both WWTPs, allowing the correlation  between logK(ow) and removals. Interesting trends for the illicit drugs were  revealed by means of mass loading estimation, as in the case of benzoylecgonine  (71.6 mg/day/1000 inhabitants). Ecotoxicological risk assessment was evaluated  for both single components and mixture, using three approaches: risk quotient  (RQ), risk quotient considering frequency (RQ(f)) and toxic units (TU).  Irbesartan and telmisartan posed a high risk in all trophic levels, while fish  was the most sensitive taxa for diclofenac. This work aspires to intensify the  surveillance programs for the receiving water bodies, as well as to motivate the  investigation of toxicity to non-target organisms.

AB  - Evolution of resistance by pests can reduce the efficacy oftransgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner  (Bt). In conjunction with refuges of non-Bt host plants, fitness costs can delay  the evolution of resistance. Furthermore, fitness costs often vary with  ecological conditions, suggesting that agricultural landscapes can be manipulated  to magnify fitness costs and thereby prolong the efficacy of Bt crops. In the  current study, we tested the effects of four species of entomopathogenic  nematodes (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) on the magnitude and dominance  of fitness costs of resistance to Bt toxin CrylAc in pink bollworm, Pectinophora  gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). For more than a decade, field  populations of pink bollworm in the United States have remained susceptible to Bt  cotton Gossypium hirsutum L. producing CrylAc; however, we used laboratory  strains that had a mixture of susceptible and resistant individuals. In  laboratory experiments, dominant fitness costs were imposed by the nematode  Steinernema riobrave Cabanillas, Poinar, and Raulston but no fitness costs were  imposed by Steinernema carpocapsae Weiser, Steinernema sp. (ML18 strain), or  Heterorhabditis sonorensis Stock, Rivera-Orduño, and Flores-Lara. In computer  simulations, evolution of resistance to Cry1Ac by pink bollworm was substantially  delayed by treating some non-Bt cotton refuge fields with nematodes that imposed  a dominant fitness cost, similar to the cost observed in laboratory experiments  with S. riobrave. Based on the results here and in related studies, we conclude  that entomopathogenic nematodes could bolster insect resistance management, but  the success of this approach will depend on selecting the appropriate species of  nematode and environment, as fitness costs were magnified by only two of five  species evaluated and also depended on environmental factors.

T2  - Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology
AB  - Environmental regulators charged with protecting water quality must have scientifically defensible water quality goals. For protection of aquatic life,  regulators need to know what levels of contaminants a water body can tolerate,  without producing adverse effects. The USEPA has developed water quality criteria  for many chemicals, but few are for current-use pesticides. Other countries also  derive aquatic life criteria utilizing a variety of methodologies. As a prelude  to developing a new criteria derivation methodology, this chapter explores the  current state of aquatic life criteria derivation around the world. Rather than  discussing each methodology independently, this review is organized according to  critical elements that must be part of a scientifically defensible methodology.  All of the reviewed methodologies rely on effects data to derive aquatic life  criteria. Water quality criteria may be derived from single-species toxicity data  by statistical extrapolation procedures (for adequate data sets), or by use of  empirically based AFs (for data sets of any size). Assessment factor methods are  conservative and have a low probability of underestimating risk, with a  concomitant high probability of overestimating risk. Extrapolation methods may  also under-, or overestimate risk, but uncertainty is quantifiable and is reduced  when larger data sets are used. Although less common, methods are also available  for criteria derivation using multispecies toxicity data. Environmental toxicity  of chemicals is affected by several factors. Some of these factors can be  addressed in criteria derivation, and some cannot. For example, factors such as  magnitude, duration and frequency of exposure may be incorporated into criteria,  either through use of time-to-event and population models or by derivation of  both acute and chronic criteria that have duration and frequency components.  Aquatic species may be exposed to hydrophobic organic chemicals by multiple  routes. They may take up residues directly from water, or may be exposed  dietarily, or combinations of both. Unfortunately, to properly address such  multiple routes in criteria derivation, food web models are needed that work for  chemicals that have specific modes of action. Similarly, both bioavailability and  toxicity parameters may contribute to derivation of criteria, providing  sufficient data are available. Ecotoxicological effects and physical-chemical  data are needed for criteria derivation. The quality and quantity of required  data are clearly stated in existing methodologies; some guidelines provide very  specific data quality requirements. The level of detail provided by guidelines  varies among methodologies. Most helpful are those that provide lists of  acceptable data sources, descriptions of adequate data searches, schemes for  rating ecotoxicity data, specifications of required data types (e.g., acute vs  chronic), and instructions for data reduction. Many methodologies present  procedures for deriving criteria from both large and small data sets. Very small  data sets may be supplemented through the use of QSARs for selected pesticides,  and through the use of models such as ICE (for prediction of toxicity to  under-tested species), and ACE (for estimation of chronic toxicity from acute  data). The toxicity of mixtures is addressed by several existing methodologies.  In some cases, additional AFs are applied to criteria to account for exposure to  mixtures, whereas in others, concentration addition models are used to assess  compliance. Multiple stressors and bioaccumulation are also addressed in some  methodologies, by providing for application of additional safety factors. Methods  are also available for translating dietary exposure limits for humans or other  fish-eating animals into water concentrations. Options for addressing the safety  of TES exist, and rely heavily on data from surrogate species to derive criteria.  Utilizing partition coefficients, criteria may be harmonized across media to  ensure that levels set to protect one compartment do not result in unacceptable  levels in other compartments. Several methodologies derive criteria from entire  data sets through the use of statistical extrapolations; other methods utilize  only the lowest (most sensitive) data point or points. Utilization of entire data  sets allows derivation of confidence limits for criteria, and encourages data  generation. Criteria derivation methodologies have improved over the past two  decades as they have incorporated more ecological risk assessment techniques. No  single existing methodology is ideal, but elements of several may be combined,  and when used with newer risk assessment tools, will produce more usable and  flexible criteria derivation procedures that are protective.

AB  - Cyanobacteria have been recognized for their advantageous impact on plant growth and development. The application of certain techniques has the potential to  enhance various aspects of plant development, including growth, yield, proximate  content (such as protein and carbohydrate levels), as well as the ability to  withstand abiotic stresses such as herbicide exposure. The current investigation  focused on examining the influence of bioactive compounds derived from the  cyanobacterium Neowestiellopsis persica strain A1387 on enhancing the antioxidant  and anyimicrobial activity of wheat plants in their defense against the plant  pathogenic Sunn pest. The findings of the study indicate that the levels of  H(2)O(2) and GP(x) in wheat plants that were infected with aphids were  significantly elevated compared to the treatments where aphids and cyanobacteria  extract were present. The confirmation of these results was achieved through the  utilization of confocal and fluorescent microscope tests, respectively.  Furthermore, the findings indicated that the constituents of the cyanobacterial  extract augmented the plant's capacity to withstand stress by enhancing its  defense mechanisms. In a broader context, the utilization of cyanobacterial  extract demonstrated the ability to regulate the generation and impact of oxygen  (O(2)) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), while concurrently enhancing the  functionality of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione  peroxidase (GP(x)) enzymes within wheat plants. This facilitation enabled the  plants to effectively manage oxidative stress. Moreover, the findings of the  antibacterial activity assessment conducted on the extract derived from  cyanobacteria demonstrated notable susceptibility. The bacteria that exhibited  the highest sensitivity to the extract of cyanobacterium Neowestiellopsis persica  strain A1387 were staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conversely,  salmonella typhi demonstrated the greatest resistance to the aforementioned  extract. The potential impact of cyanobacteria extract on the antioxidative  response of wheat plants to sunn pest infestation represents a novel contribution  to the existing body of knowledge on the interaction between wheat plants and  aphids.

AB  - The effects of Nexide (a.i. gamma-cyhalothrin 60 g L(-1)) on cumulative mortality, growth indices, and ontogenetic development of embryos and larvae of  common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) were studied. Levels of oxidative stress  parameters glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase  (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and lipid peroxidation were determined.  Eggs of newly fertilised common carp were exposed to Nexide at concentrations 5,  25, 50, 100, and 250  μ g L(-1) (0.3, 1.5, 3, 6, and 15  μ g L(-1)  gamma-cyhalothrin). All organisms exposed to concentrations higher than 50  μ  g L(-1) died soon after hatching; at 25  μ g L(-1), 95% mortality was recorded.  Larvae exposed to 5  μ g L(-1) showed significantly lower growth and retarded  ontogenetic development compared to control. Histological examination of the  livers of larvae from the exposed group revealed dystrophic changes. The value of  detoxification enzyme GST of organisms from the exposed group was significantly  higher compared to the control and the value of defensive enzyme GPx was  significantly lower compared to the control. The results of our investigation  confirmed that contamination of aquatic environment by pesticides containing  cyhalothrin may impair growth and development of early life stages of carp and  cause disbalance of defensive enzymes.

AB  - In addition to environmental pollution issues, social concerns about the sustainability, safety, and quality of conventionally grown fruits and vegetables  have been increasing. In order to evaluate if there were any microbiological  differences between samples of organic and conventional lettuce, a wide range of  parameters were tested, including pathogens and indicator organisms: the  enumeration of Escherichia coli; the detection of Salmonella spp.; the  detection/enumeration of Listeria monocytogenes; the enumeration of lactic acid  bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. yeasts and molds, and Enterobacteriaceae. This study  also evaluated the chemical safety of the lettuce samples, quantifying the  nitrate concentration and 20 pesticides (14 organochlorine and 6 organophosphorus  pesticides). Significant differences (p < 0.05) between the conventional and  organic samples were only detected for the counts of total microorganisms at 30  °C. Pathogens were absent in all the samples. The analytical method, using the  quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) approach for pesticide  extraction, was suitable for detecting the targeted analytes; the limit of  quantification (LOQ) was between 0.6 and 1.8 µg/kg (lower than the Maximum  Residue Levels (MRLs) established by EU legislation). In three organic lettuce  samples, one organochlorine pesticide (α-HCH) was observed below the MRLs. For  the samples analyzed and for the parameters investigated, except for the total  mesophilic counts, the organic and conventional lettuces were not different.

AB  - In May 2003, Phytophthora ramorum S. Werres & A.W.A.M. de Cock was isolated from leaflets of wood rose (Rosa gymnocarpa Nutt.), a native, low shrub of the  Rosaceae family, at the Jack London State Park in Sonoma County, California.  Affected leaflets had cream-to-brown lesions or spots, sometimes delimited by a  chlorotic zone. Lesions coalesced with time and spread into the petiole and  rachis. Lesions on the stems were not observed. Isolates were typical of P.  ramorum with large chlamydospores and caduceus, semipapillate sporangia, and the  sequence (GenBank Accession No. AY526571) of the internal transcribed spacer  (ITS) region of the rDNA matched those published previously (4). The site was a  mixed forest containing some confirmed P. ramorum-infected trees of coast redwood  (Sequoia sempervirens), bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), and tanoak  (Lithocarpus densiflorus) (3,4). These sites also contained California rose (R.  californica Cham. & Schldl.); however, no symptoms were observed on this species.  A terminal leaflet of asymptomatic, pesticide-free, potted-plants of California  rose and wood rose (four plants each) was inoculated with zoospores of a P.  ramorum isolate (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, ATCC MYA-3281;  Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures, Baarn, the Netherlands, CBS 114390)  obtained from infected wood rose (2). A control leaflet of each plant was dipped  in sterile deionized water. Branches containing the inoculated and control  leaflets were placed in moist plastic bags, and plants were maintained at 21 to  22°C in the laboratory for 6 days. The inoculation experiment was repeated. In  both inoculations, brown lesions (extending up to 8 mm from the leaflet tip) were  observed on leaflets of both species 2 days after inoculation with P. ramorum. At  6 days after inoculation, lesions starting from the leaflet tip averaged 12.2 mm  in length (range 10 to 16 mm) for wood rose and 9.6 mm (range 3 to 20 mm) for  California rose. Some lesions extended into the petiole in both rose species.  Sporangia were observed in washings of the lesions from four plants of California  rose and one plant of wood rose, and P. ramorum was reisolated on  Phytophthora-selective agar medium modified with 25 mg of pentachloronitrobenzene  (PCNB) (4) from all lesions. Control leaflets had no lesions, and P. ramorum was  not reisolated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a species of Rosa  as a natural host for P. ramorum, although R. sempervirens was identified as  being susceptible in artificial inoculations of detached leaves (E. Moralejo and  L. Hernández, personal communication). Toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia) in  California and salmon berry (Rubus spectabilis) in Oregon are the other known  hosts from the family Rosaceae (1). Wood rose is popular in the horticultural  industry and is readily available from native plant nurseries in California,  Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, Canada. California rose is also  popular, primarily in California. The pathogen could be disseminated on these  plants, especially since sporangia were obtained from inoculated leaflets of  these two species. References: (1) J. M. Davidson et al.

AB  - To accelerate malaria elimination in areas where core interventions such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are already widely used, it is crucial to  consider additional factors associated with persistent transmission. Qualitative  data on human behaviours and perceptions regarding malaria risk was triangulated  with quantitative data on Anopheles mosquito bites occurring indoors and outdoors  in south-eastern Tanzania communities where ITNS are already used but lower level  malaria transmission persists. Each night (18:00h-07:00h), trained residents  recorded human activities indoors, in peri-domestic outdoor areas, and in  communal gatherings. Host-seeking mosquitoes were repeatedly collected indoors  and outdoors hourly, using miniaturized exposure-free double net traps (DN-Mini)  occupied by volunteers. In-depth interviews were conducted with household  representatives to explore perceptions on persistent malaria and its control.  Higher proportions of people stayed outdoors than indoors in early-evening and  early-morning hours, resulting in higher exposures outdoors than indoors during  these times. However, exposure during late-night hours (22:00h-05:00h) occurred  mostly indoors. Some of the popular activities that kept people outdoors included  cooking, eating, relaxing and playing. All households had at least one bed net,  and 83.9% of people had access to ITNs. Average ITN use was 96.3%, preventing  most indoor exposure. Participants recorgnized the importance of ITNs but also  noted that the nets were not perfect. No complementary interventions were  reported being used widely. Most people believed transmission happens after  midnight. We conclude that insecticide-treated nets, where properly used, can  still prevent most indoor exposures, but significant risk continues unabated  before bedtime, outdoors and at communal gatherings. Such exposure is greatest  for rural and low-income households. There is therefore an urgent need for  complementary interventions, particularly those targeting outdoor-biting and are  applicable for all people including the marginalised populations such as  migratory farmers and fishermen. Besides, the differences in community  understanding of ongoing transmission, and feedback on imperfections of ITNs  should be considered when updating malaria-related communication and  interventions.

AB  - Centruroides tecomanus is a medically important scorpion of the state of Colima (Mexico). This communication reports the identification of venom components of  this scorpion with biological activity over insects/crickets (Acheta domestica),  crustaceans/fresh water shrimps (Cambarellus montezumae), and mammalians/mice  (Mus musculus, strain CD1). It also describes the pharmacological effects on cell  lines in culture (L5178Y cells, HeLa cells, HuTu cells and Jurkat E6-1 cells), as  well as on several types of bacteria (see below). The soluble venom of this  scorpion was fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and  collected separately in twelve independent fractions collected over 60 min run  (5 min time apart each other). The HPLC components of fraction VII were lethal to  all three species used for assay. The IVth fraction had a toxic effect on  freshwater shrimps. In this species, fractions VI, VII and VIII were all lethal.  For crickets, fractions V and VI were toxic and fraction VII was lethal. In  mouse, the lethal components were found in fraction VII, whereas fraction VIII  was toxic, but not lethal, at the doses assayed. The molecular weight of peptides  from the various group of fractions were identified by mass spectrometry  determination. Components lethal to mice showed molecular weights from 7013 to  7487 Da. Two peptides were obtained in homogeneous form and shown to be lethal to  the three species of animal used for assay. The soluble venom tested on L5178Y  cell line survival was shown to be cytotoxic, at 10-100 μg/mL concentration, when  compared to control murine splenocytes (p = 0.007). The soluble venom applied to  Hela, Hutu and Jurkat cell lines did not show cytotoxic effects at these  concentrations. On the contrary, it seems to have a proliferative effect. However  the HPLC fractions I, III, VI and XII do have a cytotoxic effect on Jurkat  E06-1 cells in culture at 200 μg/mL concentration. The antimicrobial activity of  the venom fractions on Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive), Escherichia coli,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa y Salmonella spp (gram-negative) was measured, using the  liquid inhibition growth system. The four strains of bacteria used were  susceptible to fractions III and IV, affecting all four bacterial strains at  concentrations below 5 μg/mL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Timor-Leste Ministry of Health has recently finalized the National Malaria Control Strategy for 2010-2020. A key component of this roadmap  is to provide universal national coverage with long-lasting insecticide-treated  nets (LLINs) in support of achieving the primary goal of reducing both morbidity  and mortality from malaria by 30% in the first three years, followed by a further  reduction of 20% by end of the programme cycle in 2020 1. The strategic plan  calls for this target to be supported by a comprehensive information, education  and communication (IEC) programme; however, there is limited prior research into  household and personal usage patterns to assist in the creation of targeted,  effective, and socio-culturally specific behaviour change materials. METHODS:  Nine separate focus group discussions (FGDs) were carried out in Dili, Manatuto,  and Covalima districts, Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, in July 2010.These  focus groups primarily explored themes of perceived malaria risk, causes of  malaria, net usage patterns within families, barriers to correct and consistent  usage, and the daily experience of users (both male and female) in households  with at least one net. Comprehensive qualitative analysis utilized open source  analysis software. RESULTS: The primary determinants of net usage were a  widespread perception that nets could or should only be used by pregnant women  and young children, and the availability of sufficient sleeping space under a  limited number of nets within households. Both nuisance biting and disease  prevention were commonly cited as primary motivations for usage, while  seasonality was not a significant factor. Long-term net durability and ease of  hanging were seen as key attributes in net design preference. Very frequent  washing cycles were common, potentially degrading net effectiveness. Finally,  extensive re-purposing of nets (fishing, protecting crops) was both reported and  observed, and may significantly decrease availability of nighttime sleeping space  for all family members if distributed nets do not remain within the household.  CONCLUSIONS: Emphasizing that net usage is acceptable and important for all  family members regardless of age or gender, and addressing the complex  behavioural economics of alternative net usages could have significant impacts on  malaria control efforts in Timor-Leste, as the country's programmes make progress  towards universal net coverage.

TI  - Social marketing and the fight against malaria in Africa: population services international (PSI) and insecticide treated nets (ITNS).
AU  - Omona, Julius
T2  - East African journal of public health
AB  - This textual analyses on Social marketing, Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) and Population Services International (PSI) were undertaken to achieve two  objectives: (a) to contribute to the continuing debate and search for a better  strategy for combating malaria in sub-Saharan Africa; and (b) to contribute to  theory building on social marketing. The analyses revealed that Malaria has  reached an epidemic proportion and despite major inroads by PSI in combating  malaria on the principles of social marketing, the strategies of pricing and  segmentation of the clients are not appropriate for Sub-Saharan African countries  that are mired in absolute poverty where majority of the rural communities eke a  living on less than a dollar per day and the health sector does not receive  priority attention from policy makers and politicians. The descriptive statistics  and a one sample t test for the sampled countries suggest that sub-Saharan  countries have not even met the hypothesized 5% investment of their GDP on  health, compared to their counterparts, the developed countries, who are all  above this figure. The null hypothesis that there is no significant different  between the population and the sample means of both developed and a developing  country in their investments in the health sector was also tested and rejected.  Though the elements in some of the existent models and theories of social  marketing such as Health Belief Model, Theory of Reasoned Action, Social  Cognitive Theory and Trans-theoretical Models all attempt to advocate for  elimination of constraints and barriers to effective access to a service or  product, PSI is adamant to these and try to generalize these principles in all  contexts, including in Sub-Saharan Africa. The African scenario, where about 90%  of Malaria related deaths cases in the world occur, demands more than what these  theories present. Accordingly, it was concluded that however good intentioned  social marketing is, in the case of ITNs in this region, it is counter productive  as the pricing de-motivates clients who usually have other pressing needs to  address and segmentation limits coverage. Social marketing is thus more relevant  to developed economies where absolute poverty no longer exist and people can  afford to pay for health services. Malaria in sub-Saharan Africa needs a "carpet  bombing" strategy. It was also concluded that for Sub-Saharan countries to  effectively address the MDG six on malaria, and implement the Abuja Summit and  the Roll Back Malaria partnership declarations, it requires a high degree of  political commitment, amongst others, to enable the vulnerable communities have  access to free malaria treatment related drugs. Partners in the fight against  malaria such as PSI should adopt a more eclectic intervention strategy, and be  cognizant of the fact that the strategy that works for Africa should be that  which is based on strict equity and stimulates demand for ITNs. The paper  concludes by agreeing with Professors Curtis and Sachs that comprehensive malaria  control in Africa is achievable by 2010, at the minimal cost if sound principles  of public health and economics are observed. Millions of lives can be saved and  Africa will be given vital help in escaping from the viscous circle of poverty  and diseases that continue to grip the continent. The target for all intervention  efforts should be to eliminate the cost factor and ensure free distribution of  all malaria related treatment products.

T2  - Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology
AB  - The study of pesticide effects on algae, and diatoms in particular, was focused on photosynthesis and biomass growth disturbances. Few studies have been  performed to investigate the effects of these toxic agents on intracellular  structures of diatom cells. Nuclear alterations and cell wall abnormalities were  reported for diatoms exposed to toxic compounds. Nevertheless, the cellular  mechanisms implicated in the development of such alterations and abnormalities  remain unclear. Sensitivity to pesticides is known to be quite different among  different diatom species. Eutrophic and small species are recognized for their  tolerance to pesticides exposure. More pronounced cell defenses against oxidative  stress may explain this absence of sensitivity in species of smaller physical  size. Notwithstanding, on the whole, explaining the rationale behind tolerance  variations among species has been quite difficult, thus far. In this context, the  understanding of intracellular toxicity in diatoms and the relation between these  intracellular effects and the disturbance of species composition in communities  represent a key target for further research. The original community species  structure determines the response of a diatom community to toxic agent exposure.  Diatom communities that have species capable of switching from autotrophic to  heterotrophic modes, when photosynthesis is inhibited (e.g., after pesticide  exposure), can continue to grow, even in the presence of high pesticide  pollution. How diatoms respond to toxic stress, and the degree to which they  respond, also depends on cell and community health, on ecological interactions  with other organisms, and on general environmental conditions. The general  structural parameters of diatom communities (biomass, global cell density) are  less sensitive to pesticide effects than are the specific structural parameters  of the unicellular organisms themselves (cell density by species, species  composition). For benthic species, biofilm development and grazing on this matrix  as a source of food for invertebrates and fishes may also modify the response of  diatom communities. Environmental parameters (light exposure, nutrient  concentrations, and hydraulic conditions) affect, and often interfere with, the  response of diatoms to pesticides. Therefore, the complexity of aquatic  ecosystems and the complexity of pesticide to easily detect the effects of such  pollutants on diatoms. Clearly more research will be required to address this  problem.

AB  - Chronic periodontitis is a widespread and major dental disease. Recent studies have analyzed a possible relationship between polymorphism of several genes and  periodontitis. Histatins are salivary polypeptides with fungicidal activities  against Candida albicans and yeast and bactericidal activities against  Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus mutans. Histatins are part of the  innate defense of the oral cavity. We examined the frequency of the polymorphism  codon 23 of the histatin 3 gene (HIS2 allele) in relation to periodontitis in the  Japanese population. The subjects were 143 Japanese individuals, of which 63 were  healthy control subjects and 80 were periodontal patients. We isolated genomic  DNA from lingual mucosal cells and tested them for single nucleotide polymorphism  (SNP) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism  (PCR-RFLP). The incidence of polymorphism was analyzed statistically by Fisher's  exact test. The results indicated that the gene polymorphism at codon 23 of the  histatin 3 gene was not associated with periodontitis in the Japanese population  (p = 0.166). Rather, if at all, it appeared to be associated with resistance to  periodontitis.

TI  - Sickness-related dysfunction in persons with self-reported multiple chemical sensitivity at four levels of severity.
AU  - Gibson, Pamela Reed
AU  - Vogel, Valerie M.
T2  - Journal of clinical nursing
AB  - AIM: To examine quality of life outcome for persons who self-report chemical sensitivity, often referred to as multiple chemical sensitivity. BACKGROUND:  Multiple chemical sensitivity is poorly understood with few providers  specialising in its treatment. This lack of treatment and the ubiquity of  chemicals engender severe life impacts such as job loss, financial loss, social  isolation and even homelessness for persons who experience these sensitivities.  DESIGN: Survey. METHOD: We examined chemical incitants, symptoms and  sickness-related behavioural dysfunction as measured by the Sickness Impact  Profile in 254 persons self-identified with multiple chemical sensitivity.  RESULTS: Chemicals rated as causing the most symptomatology in respondents were  pesticide, formaldehyde, fresh paint, new carpet, diesel exhaust, perfume and air  fresheners. The five highest rated symptoms in this sample were  tiredness/lethargy, difficulty concentrating, muscle aches, memory difficulties  and long-term fatigue. Overall mean Sickness Impact Profile score was 25.25%,  showing serious impairment, with the most serious dysfunction in the categories  of work (55.36%), alertness behaviour (53.45%) and recreation and pastimes  (45.20%). CONCLUSION: Multiple chemical sensitivity is an important health care  issue because it often includes serious dysfunction, is poorly understood by  providers and poses extensive financial and treatment obstacles for those who  experience it. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Persons with multiple chemical  sensitivity seek medical treatment in a variety of contexts and informed  providers can both avoid iatrogenic harm due to medical exposures and provide any  possible treatment for the chemical sensitivities. Understanding the impact of  the health condition is crucial to communicate with and treat persons who  experience the sensitivities.

AB  - We conducted 96-h static acute toxicity studies to evaluate the relative sensitivity of juveniles of the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus)  and the standard cold-water surrogate rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) to  three rangeland herbicides commonly used for controlling invasive weeds in the  northwestern United States. Relative species sensitivity was compared using three  procedures: standard acute toxicity testing, fractional estimates of lethal  concentrations, and accelerated life testing chronic estimation procedures. The  acutely lethal concentrations (ALC) resulting in 50% mortality at 96 h (96-h  ALC50s) were determined using linear regression and indicated that the three  herbicides were toxic in the order of picloram acid > 2,4-D acid > clopyralid  acid. The 96-h ALC50 values for rainbow trout were as follows: picloram, 41 mg/L;  2.4-D, 707 mg/L; and clopyralid, 700 mg/L. The 96-h ALC50 values for bull trout  were as follows: picloram, 24 mg/L; 2.4-D, 398 mg/L; and clopyralid, 802 mg/L.  Fractional estimates of safe concentrations, based on 5% of the 96-h ALC50, were  conservative (overestimated toxicity) of regression-derived 96-h ALC5 values by  an order of magnitude. Accelerated life testing procedures were used to estimate  chronic lethal concentrations (CLC) resulting in 1% mortality at 30 d (30-d CLC1)  for the three herbicides: picloram (1 mg/L rainbow trout, 5 mg/L bull trout),  2,4-D (56 mg/L rainbow trout, 84 mg/L bull trout), and clopyralid (477 mg/L  rainbow trout; 552 mg/L bull trout). Collectively, the results indicated that the  standard surrogate rainbow trout is similar in sensitivity to bull trout.  Accelerated life testing procedures provided cost-effective, statistically  defensible methods for estimating safe chronic concentrations (30-d CLC1s) of  herbicides from acute toxicity data because they use statistical models based on  the entire mortality:concentration:time data matrix.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Humic substances (HS) comprise the majority of dead and living organic carbon, including organisms. In the environment, they are  considered to be chemically inert or at least refractory. Recent papers, however,  show that HS (including natural organic matter-NOM, isolated by reverse osmosis)  are natural chemicals which interact with aquatic organisms. They are taken up  and cause a variety of stress defense reactions which are well known from  man-made chemicals. These reactions include chaperon activation, induction and  modulation of biotrans-formation enzymes, or induction of antioxidant defense  enzymes. One specific reaction with freshwater plants is the reduction of  photosynthetic oxygen release. In this contribution, we compare the  susceptibilities (cell yield) of two closely related coccal green algae,  Monoraphidium convolutum and M. minutum, towards various NOM isolates. METHODS:  Cultures of M. convolutum and M. minutum were obtained from the algal collection  of the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Berlin, and  from the Culture Collection of Algae, Göttingen, and maintained in a common  medium. The cultures were non-axenic. The algae were exposed to 5 mg L(-1) DOC of  each humic material, an environmentally realistic concentration. Cell numbers  were counted microscopically in Neugebauer cuvettes in 5 replicates on days 1, 4,  7, 10, 14, and 21. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Almost all NOM isolates modulated the  growth of the algae. Only the NOM of a Norwegian raised peat bog lake did not  reveal any significant effect with M. convolutuim. In general, the results with  two algal species are by no means uniform. For instance, Suwannee River NOM  causes a decrease in cell density with M. minutum, but temporarily stimulates the  growth of M. convolutum. The opposite applies to Aurevann NOM: Growth increase in  M. minutum, but a bi-phasic response in M. convolutum. Different responses of  both Monoraphidium species must be attributed to intrinsic factors of the algae  rather than only to chemical features of the exposed materials, because the  exposures were identical with both algal species. The reduction in growth yields  can be explained as a herbicide-like mode of action that affects the photosystem  II most prevalently. The growth promoting effect remains somewhat obscure. It may  be due to (1) an increase in bioavailability of some trace nutrients in the  presence of HS, (2) the release of some growth promoting substances by microbial  or photochemical processing of the humic materials, and (3) a hormetic effect  upon the exposure of HS. Hormesis means stimulation of organisms or metabolic  activities when exposed to noxes in low concentrations. However, it is still open  to discussion why the growth promotion only applies to one or the other, but not  simultaneously to both Monoraphidium species. CONCLUSION: Exposure of the closely  related coccal green algal species to humic material changes their growth  characteristics. Since the reactions are not consistent within the two species  and the various humic materials, it seems that the less sensitive species is  favored by HS exposure. The environmental relevance, however, is subject to  future studies.

AB  - The present paper summarizes key features of time-dependent sensitization (TDS) in neuropharmacology (progressive amplification of behavioral, neuronal,  endocrine, and/or immune responses to repeated intermittent exposures to an  environmental agent or cross-sensitizing agents) as a possible model for cacosmia  (subjective sense of feeling ill from low levels of environmental chemical odors)  in nonindustrial and industrial populations; and extends previous cacosmia  research in nonpatient populations to an elderly sample. This study examined the  symptom and psychological profiles of 263 older adults (aged 60-90 y, 71% women,  29% men); 57% reported that at least one chemical and 17% reported that at least  four of five chemicals (pesticide, automobile exhaust, paint, new carpet,  perfume) made them feel ill. Cacosmia ratings correlated weakly and negatively  with age (r = -0.19, p = .001) over the whole sample. Cacosmia correlated  significantly with self-reported illness from foods that may mobilize or generate  opioid peptides (wheat, dairy, eggs) (r = 0.32, p < .0001) and with illness from  opiate drugs (r = 0.23, p < .0001). When the sample was divided into four cells  on the basis of above-versus below-median total chemical-induced illness score  (CI) and total food-induced illness score (FI), the high CI and high FI, high CI  only, and high FI only groups had more frequent indigestion, and the high CI  group had more frequent difficulty concentrating than the groups below median for  illness from both chemicals and foods (NOILL), even after covarying for age and  anxiety. The most cacosmic subjects noted higher prevalence of  physician-diagnosed allergies and irritable bowel than did noncacosmic subjects.  In contrast with previous young adult cohort studies, the older illness groups  did not differ with regard to sex distribution, depression, shyness, or  repressive defensiveness. When considered with prior surveys of young adults, the  present findings are consistent with the presence of previously established,  time-dependent sensitization to multiple xenobiotic agents in susceptible  individuals for whom psychological variables do not explain the symptom of  cacosmia. If cacosmia is a symptom of TDS, then the neuropharmacology literature  suggests the possibility of excitatory amino acid, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis, dopaminergic, and/or opioid involvement. Prospective studies with objective  measures testing the possible induction of TDS to specific chemicals are  indicated.

AB  - OPP: This paper provides the rationale and support for the decisions the OPP will make in requiring and reviewing mutagenicity information. The regulatory  requirement for mutagenicity testing to support a pesticide registration is found  in the 40 CFR Part 158. The guidance as to the specific mutagenicity testing to  be performed is found in the OPP's Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision  F, Hazard Evaluation: Human and Domestic Animals (referred to as the Subdivision  F guideline). A revised Subdivision F guideline has been presented that becomes  the current guidance for submitters of mutagenicity data to the OPP. The decision  to revise the guideline was the result of close examination of the version  published in 1982 and the desire to update the guidance based on developments  since then and current state-of-the-science. After undergoing Agency and public  scrutiny, the revised guideline is to be published in 1991. The revised guideline  consists of an initial battery of tests (the Salmonella assay, an in vitro  mammalian gene mutation assay and an in vivo cytogenetics assay which may be  either a bone marrow assay for chromosomal aberrations or for micronuclei  formation) that should provide an adequate initial assessment of the potential  mutagenicity of a chemical. Follow-up testing to clarify results from the initial  testing may be necessary. After this information as well as all other relevant  information is obtained, a weight-of-evidence decision will be made about the  possible mutagenicity concern a chemical may present. Testing to pursue  qualitative and/or quantitative evidence for assessing heritable risk in relation  to human beings will then be considered if a mutagenicity concern exists. This  testing may range from tests for evidence of gonadal exposure to dominant lethal  testing to quantitative tests such as the specific locus and heritable  translocation assays. The mutagenicity assessment will be performed in accordance  with the Agency's Mutagenicity Risk Assessment Guidelines. The mutagenicity data  would also be used in the weight-of-evidence consideration for the potential  carcinogenicity of a chemical in accordance with the Agency's Carcinogen Risk  Assessment Guidelines. In instances where there are triggers for carcinogenicity  testing, mutagenicity data may be used as one of the triggers after a  consideration of available information. It is felt that the revised Subdivision F  guideline will provide appropriate, and more specific, guidance concerning the  OPP approach to mutagenicity testing for the registration of a pesticide. It also  provides a clearer understanding of how the OPP will proceed with its evaluation  and decision making concerning the potential heritable effects of a test  chemical.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

T2  - World health statistics quarterly. Rapport trimestriel de statistiques sanitaires mondiales
AB  - In the course of economic development from the pre-industrial to the post-industrial stages, human communities go through major social and economic  transitions. The demographic transition, a long established concept, refers to  the change from a stage of high birth rates and mortality rates to one of low  birth rates and mortality rates. The mortality rates have always decreased before  the birth rates, giving rise to a period of rapid population growth in each  society. The recently-coined term "health transition" provides a more detailed  view of the different aspects of the mortality decline and of the changes in  morbidity and causes of morbidity which also accompany economic development. The  health transition is associated with major changes in exposure to environmental  and occupational health hazards. The traditional hazards of the pre-industrial  stage include unsafe drinking-water, poor sanitation, infected food, tropical  disease vectors, indoor air pollution from biomass smoke, and accidents in  agriculture and fishing. Gradually these are replaced by or overlap with the  modern hazards, such as urban air pollution, tobacco smoking, pesticides,  occupational hazards in new industries and traffic accidents. The health impact  of these hazards depends very much on the preventive measures taken. For some  hazards there is an increasing health risk, in parallel with the increasing  occurrence of the hazard, which is followed by a decreasing health risk as  preventive actions become effective. This intervention transition does not occur  automatically with economic development, but requires specific policies and  plans, as well as community involvement. The adult age group (15-59 years) is  likely to be at particular risk for environmental and occupational hazards which  emerge during the health transition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - The effects of subclinical levels of 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on the response of mice to infection with either Salmonella bern or Herpesvirus  suis, also known as pseudorabies virus, are reported. TCDD is a contaminant of  certain commercially useful chemicals, such as chlorinated phenols or herbicides.  It has been shown to cause thymic atrophy and to suppress cell-mediated immunity  in laboratory animals. Sublethal levels of TCDD were used: 0.5, 1,5, 10, or 20  mug/kg, given through a gastric tube once weekly for 4 weeks. A significant  decrease in weight gain compared with control mice occurred at the 20-mug dosage.  Dose schedules of 1 mug or more, followed by salmonella infection, resulted in  significant increases in mortality and decreases in the time from infection to  dealth. However, TCDD had no significant effect on mortality in the  pseudorabies-infected mice. The most important finding in this study is that  extremely low levels of TCDD, which do not produce clinical or pathological  change, still have the capacity to affect host defense.

TI  - Isotianil (2(nd) edition) (Pesticides).
T2  - Food safety (Tokyo, Japan)
AB  - Food Safety Commission of Japan (FSCJ) conducted a risk assessment of isotianil (CAS No. 224049-04-1), an isothiazole agent for induced resistance to blast  disease. This evaluation was requested from Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries (MAFF) on the reevaluation article of Agricultural Chemicals Regulation  Act. Additional information including the fate in livestock (goats and chickens)  and genotoxicity, and also the list of published scientific literature were newly  submitted from the MAFF. The following data were used in the assessment; fate in  plants (including paddy rice and potatoes), residues in crops, fate in livestock  (goats and chickens), residues in livestock products, fate in animals (rats),  subacute toxicity (rats, mice and dogs), chronic toxicity (rats and dogs),  carcinogenicity (rats and mice), two-generation reproductive toxicity (rats),  developmental toxicity (rats and rabbits), and genotoxicity. Major adverse  effects of isotianil were observed in the stomach (mucosal epithelium hyperplasia  of the forestomach limiting ridge in rats), the liver (including organ weight  gain), and the kidney (including chronic nephropathy). No adverse effects were  observed on carcinogenicity, fertility, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. The  lowest no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) obtained from the studies  described above was 2.83 mg/kg bw per day in a one-year chronic toxicity study in  rats. FSCJ specified an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.028 mg/kg bw per day  based on the NOAEL after applying a safety factor of 100. An acute reference dose  (ARfD) was judged unnecessary to be specified, based on the results of a single  oral administration of isotianil and other related tests.

AB  - The severity of infectious diseases associated with the resistance of microorganisms to drugs highlights the importance of investigating bioactive  compounds with antimicrobial potential. Therefore, nineteen synthetic cinnamides  and cinnamates having a cinnamoyl nucleus were prepared and submitted for the  evaluation of antimicrobial activity against pathogenic fungi and bacteria in  this study. To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the  compounds, possible mechanisms of antifungal action, and synergistic effects,  microdilution testing in broth was used. The structures of the synthesized  products were characterized with FTIR spectroscopy, (1) H-NMR, (13) C-NMR, and  HRMS. Derivative 6 presented the best antifungal profile, suggesting that the  presence of the butyl substituent potentiates its biological response (MIC =  626.62 μM), followed by compound 4 (672.83 μM) and compound 3 (726.36 μM). All  three compounds were fungicidal, with MFC/MIC ≤ 4. For mechanism of action,  compounds 4 and 6 directly interacted with the ergosterol present in the fungal  plasmatic membrane and with the cell wall. Compound 18 presented the best  antibacterial profile (MIC = 458.15 μM), followed by compound 9 (550.96 μM) and  compound 6 (626.62 μM), which suggested that the presence of an isopropyl group  is important for antibacterial activity. The compounds were bactericidal, with  MBC/MIC ≤ 4. Association tests were performed using the Checkerboard method to  evaluate potential synergistic effects with nystatin (fungi) and amoxicillin  (bacteria). Derivatives 6 and 18 presented additive effects. Molecular docking  simulations suggested that the most likely targets of compound 6 in C. albicans  were caHOS2 and caRPD3, while the most likely target of compound 18 in S. aureus  was saFABH. Our results suggest that these compounds could be used as prototypes  to obtain new antimicrobial drugs.

T2  - Biotechnology advances
AB  - The cytoskeleton is a protein-based intracellular superstructure that evolved early after the appearance of bacterial prokaryotes. Eventually cytoskeletal  proteins and their macromolecular assemblies were established in eukaryotes and  assumed critical roles in cell movements, intracellular organization, cell  division and cell differentiation. In biomedicine the small-molecules targeting  cytoskeletal elements are in the frontline of anticancer research with  plant-derived cytoskeletal drugs such as Vinca alkaloids and toxoids, being  routinely used in the clinical practice. Moreover, plants are also major  material, food and energy resources for human activities ranging from  agriculture, textile industry, carpentry, energy production and new material  development to name some few. Most of these inheritable traits are associated  with cell wall synthesis and chemical modification during primary and secondary  plant growth and inevitably are associated with the dynamics, organization and  interactions of the plant cytoskeleton. Taking into account the vast  intracellular spread of microtubules and actin microfilaments the cytoskeleton  collectively assumed central roles in plant growth and development, in  determining the physical stance of plants against the forces of nature and  becoming a battleground between pathogenic invaders and the defense mechanisms of  plant cells. This review aims to address the role of the plant cytoskeleton in  manageable features of plants including cellulose biosynthesis with implications  in wood and fiber properties, in biofuel production and the contribution of plant  cytoskeletal elements in plant defense responses against pathogens or detrimental  environmental conditions. Ultimately the present work surveys the potential of  cytoskeletal proteins as platforms of plant genetic engineering, nominating  certain cytoskeletal proteins as vectors of favorable traits in crops and other  economically important plants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) have proven instrumental in the successful reduction of malaria incidence in holoendemic regions during the past  decade. As distribution of ITNs throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is being  scaled up, maintaining maximal levels of coverage will be necessary to sustain  current gains. The effectiveness of mass distribution of ITNs, requires careful  analysis of successes and failures if impacts are to be sustained over the long  term. METHODS: Mass distribution of ITNs to a rural Kenyan community along Lake  Victoria was performed in early 2011. Surveyors collected data on ITN use both  before and one year following this distribution. At both times, household  representatives were asked to provide a complete accounting of ITNs within the  dwelling, the location of each net, and the ages and genders of each person who  slept under that net the previous night. Other data on household material  possessions, education levels and occupations were recorded. Information on  malaria preventative factors such as ceiling nets and indoor residual spraying  was noted. Basic information on malaria knowledge and health-seeking behaviours  was also collected. Patterns of ITN use before and one year following net  distribution were compared using spatial and multi-variable statistical methods.  Associations of ITN use with various individual, household, demographic and  malaria related factors were tested using logistic regression. RESULTS: After  infancy (<1 year), ITN use sharply declined until the late teenage years then  began to rise again, plateauing at 30 years of age. Males were less likely to use  ITNs than females. Prior to distribution, socio-economic factors such as parental  education and occupation were associated with ITN use. Following distribution,  ITN use was similar across social groups. Household factors such as availability  of nets and sleeping arrangements still reduced consistent net use, however.  CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive, direct-to-household, mass distribution of ITNs was  effective in rapidly scaling up coverage, with use being maintained at a high  level at least one year following the intervention. Free distribution of ITNs  through direct-to-household distribution method can eliminate important  constraints in determining consistent ITN use, thus enhancing the sustainability  of effective intervention campaigns.

T2  - Plant disease
AB  - In November 2002, a disease was observed on eight cultivars of Asiatic hybrid lilies (Lilium sp.) in two fields in Carpinteria, CA. The same disease was  observed on greenhouse grown Asiatic hybrid lilies in Nipomo, CA in an adjacent  county. 'Monte Negro' was the most severely affected. Symptoms consisted of  necrotic leaf tips as well as 5- to 10-mm ellipsoidal necrotic spots on stems and  the abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces. Lesions were initially dark brown and  water soaked, becoming lighter as they dried. Although leaf spot symptoms usually  began at the leaf tip, eventually the entire leaf would become blighted. Disease  symptoms were not observed on Oriental hybrid lilies in the same nurseries. A  Botrytis sp. was consistently associated with the disease symptoms. In pure  culture, the fungus matched the description of Botryotinia sphaerosperma  (Gregory) Buchw. (anamorph Botrytis sphaerosperma (Gregory) Buchw.) (1). The  fungus is distinguished by its large, spherical conidia that average 23 to 25 μm  in diameter at maturity. The conidia are born in compact heads on unbranched  conidiophores. Conidia and conidiophores are hyaline when young. At maturity, the  conidia turn dark brown, whereas the conidiophores turn blackish brown. The  fungus formed abundant sclerotia on potato dextrose agar when incubated at room  temperature with 12 h per day of fluorescent lighting. The sclerotia were black,  ovate to sphaeroidal, had a rough surface, and were 1.5 to 2.5 × 1 to 2.5 mm.  Apothecia were not observed. Pathogenicity was tested on 12 Asiatic hybrid and 12  Oriental hybrid lilies. Inoculum consisting of mycelial fragments and conidia (1  × 10(5) conidia per ml) was produced on lily leaf agar (500 ml of H(2)O, 7.5 g of  agar, and 25 g of healthy, macerated lily leaves). Plants were inoculated by  rubbing leaves and stems with the spore and mycelial fragment suspension using  cotton swabs. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 25°C. After 7 days,  characteristic lesions were observed on the leaves and stems of Asiatic hybrid  and Oriental hybrid lilies, from which the same Botrytis sp. was consistently  isolated. Three control plants each of Asiatic hybrid and Oriental hybrid lilies  treated with water as a check, remained symptomless. Although studies to  determine potential fungicides for controlling this pathogen have not yet been  undertaken, good sanitation, a lily-free period, and steam sterilization of beds  should be considered in the management of this disease. In Europe, this fungus  has been reported as a pathogen on Lilium regale (2). To our knowledge, this is  the first report of this pathogen in North America. Herbarium specimens were  submitted to the USDA APHIS mycology laboratory in Beltsville, MD (Accession No.  BPI 842231). Cultures were also submitted to the American Type Culture Collection  (MYA-2890). References: (1) P. H. Gregory. Trans. Br. Mycol. Soc. 25:26, 1941.  (2) G. L. Hennebert. Friesia 9:52, 1969.

AB  - Allergic disease affects millions of persons in the United States. Environmental control measures are essential for persons who are sensitive to dust mite and cat  allergens and may be important in persons who are sensitive to cockroaches and  fungus. The bedroom is the most important room in which to implement  environmental control measures, such as encasing mattresses and pillows in vinyl  or semipermeable covers. Patients with asthma (especially persistent asthma)  should be considered for allergy testing and more aggressive environmental  control measures. Carpet in the bedroom or over concrete should be removed. For  persons who are sensitive to pet allergens, permanent removal of the pet is  recommended. Dust mite and fungus growth can be controlled by keeping the  household humidity level at less than 50 percent. Removing sources of food and  water and using insecticides will help control cockroach populations. Patients  who are sensitive to mold and outdoor air pollution should consider limiting  outdoor activities when these levels are high. Patients with asthma should avoid  exposure to tobacco smoke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) through universal coverage campaigns is a widely adopted approach for the prevention of  malaria at scale. While post-distribution surveys play a valuable role in  determining cross-sectional levels of LLIN retention and use, as well as  frequently cited reasons for non-use, few studies have explored the consistency  of LLIN use over time, within the expected lifespan of the net, and the factors  which may drive this. METHODS: In this qualitative study, 74 in-depth interviews  were conducted with (male) household heads and (female) caregivers of children in  LLIN recipient households, as well as community health workers, in Buliisa, Hoima  and Kiboga districts in Uganda, 25-29 months following a LLIN mass campaign  distribution. A triangulation approach to data analysis was taken, incorporating  thematic analysis, most significant change and positive deviance. RESULTS: The  factors found to be most influential in encouraging long-term LLIN use were  positive experience of net use prior to the distribution, and appreciation or  awareness of a range of benefits arising from their use, including protection  from malaria as well as importantly, other health, lifestyle, social and economic  benefits. Social support from within the community was also identified as an  important factor in determining continued use of LLINs. Net use appeared to be  more consistent amongst settled urban and rural communities, compared with  fishing, pastoralist, refugee and immigrant communities. CONCLUSIONS: A multitude  of interplaying factors encouraged consistent LLIN use in this setting. Whilst  the protection of malaria remains a powerful motivator, social and behaviour  change (SBC) strategies should also capitalize on the non-malaria benefits of net  use that provide a long-term rationale for consistent use. Where supplies are  available, SBC campaigns should promote replacement options, emphasizing ongoing  net care and replacement as a household responsibility, thus reducing dependence  on free distributions. The triangulation approach to qualitative data analysis  enabled increased confidence in the validity of findings and an enhanced  contextual understanding of the factors promoting consistent net use in  mid-western Uganda. The approach should be considered when designing future  studies to explore factors driving net retention and use trends.

TI  - Humpback Dolphins: A Brief Introduction to the Genus Sousa.
AU  - Jefferson, Thomas A.
AU  - Curry, Barbara E.
T2  - Advances in marine biology
AB  - The delphinid genus Sousa has recently undergone a major revision, and currently contains four species, the Atlantic humpback (Sousa teuszii), Indian Ocean  humpback (Sousa plumbea), Indo-Pacific humpback (Sousa chinensis), and Australian  humpback (Sousa sahulensis) dolphins. Recent molecular evidence suggests that  humpback dolphins in the Bay of Bengal may comprise a fifth species. These  moderate-sized dolphin species are found in shallow (<30m), coastal waters of the  eastern Atlantic, Indian, and western Pacific oceans. Abundance and trends have  only been studied in a few areas, mostly in eastern Africa, China, and northern  Australia. No global, empirically derived abundance estimates exist for any of  the four species, but none appear to number more than about 20,000 individuals.  Humpback dolphins feed mostly on small fishes, and sometimes shrimps; occur for  the most part in small groups (mostly 12 or less); have limited nearshore  movements; and in most parts of their range exhibit a fission/fusion type of  social organization. Major threats that affect all the species are entanglement  in fishing gear, and habitat degradation/destruction from various forms of  coastal development. Impacts from vessel traffic (including behavioural  disturbance and displacement, as well as mortality and morbidity from collisions  with vessels) appear to be significant in most areas. Several other threats are  apparently significant only in particular parts of the range of some species  (e.g. high levels of organochlorine contaminants affecting Indo-Pacific humpback  dolphins in Hong Kong). Direct hunting only occurs in limited areas and primarily  on a small scale. Conservation actions so far have been limited, with most  populations receiving little study and almost no management attention. Much more  work is needed on humpback dolphin population status, threats, and how the major  threats can be reduced or eliminated. Extinction risks for the four species and  some populations are preliminarily re-assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria  in the current volume. The results suggest that all four species in the genus are  threatened at some level (suggested Red List status ranges from Vulnerable for S.  chinensis and S. sahulensis to Critically Endangered for S. teuszii).

TI  - N-player mosquito net game: individual and social rationality in the misuse of insecticide-treated nets.
AU  - Honjo, Keita
AU  - Satake, Akiko
T2  - Journal of theoretical biology
AB  - Many governmental and non-governmental organizations have distributed insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) to malaria endemic areas, which contributed to  the reduction of malaria deaths. However, some people in malaria endemic areas  used ITNs for alternative purposes such as fishery and agriculture. It is unclear  why people threatened by malaria misuse ITNs. Here we develop a N-player mosquito  net game, and theoretically show that the misuse of ITNs might be underpinned by  individual and social rationality. In the mosquito net game, each player uses  ITNs for malaria prevention or alternative purposes. The proper ITN use decreases  the probability of malaria infection, while the improper ITN use increases the  player's labor productivity. Each player's expected payoff is influenced by other  players' strategies. We found that the misuse of ITNs can be a Pareto efficient  Nash equilibrium. The maximum number of players using ITNs for malaria prevention  is limited by insecticidal effectiveness of ITNs and extra income from ITN  misuse. Furthermore, we found that players in a low-income community are  attracted to the misuse of ITNs even if the probability of malaria infection is  high. Introduction of a tax on ITN misuse was shown to be effective to motivate  the players to use ITNs for malaria prevention. Our results demonstrate that  understanding decision making of people in malaria endemic areas is essential to  design more effective malaria control programs.

AB  - The biological functions of avian cathelicidins are poorly defined. In mammals, cathelicidins have shown to possess potent broad-range antimicrobial activity as  well as immunomodulatory activities. Therefore, we investigated the microbicidal  activities and localization of Cathelicidin-2 in non-infected and  Salmonella-challenged broiler chickens. Using immunohistochemistry,  Cathelicidin-2 was shown to be abundantly present in heterophils, localized in  the large rod-shaped granules, but absent in other peripheral blood cells and  intestinal epithelial cells. Cathelicidin-2 synthesis was observed to be  initiated at the early promyelocyte stage. Considerable infiltration of  Cathelicidin-2 containing heterophils was observed in the jejunum of Salmonella  enteritidis-challenged broilers within 8 h post-infection. Heterophils were shown  to release mature Cathelicidin-2 peptide upon stimulation with Salmonella-derived  LPS in a time-dependent way. Processing of the Cathelicidin-2 precursor was  mediated by serine proteases with a divalent cation dependency. Cathelicidin-2  peptide showed potent bactericidal and fungicidal activity against all tested  microorganisms, including chicken-specific Salmonella isolates. These results  underscore the importance of avian heterophils as a first line of defence against  invading pathogens and implicate that via heterophil-mediated release,  cathelicidins may greatly contribute to avian innate immunity.

AB  - Food-borne pathogens are responsible for most cases of food poisoning in developed countries and are often associated with poultry products, including  chicken. Little is known about the role of beta-defensins in the chicken  digestive tract and their efficacy. In this study, the expression of chicken  beta-defensin gallinacin-6 (Gal-6) and its antimicrobial activity against  food-borne pathogens were investigated. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed  high expression of Gal-6 mRNA in the esophagus and crop, moderate expression in  the glandular stomach, and low expression throughout the intestinal tract.  Putative transcription factor binding sites for nuclear factor kappa beta,  activator protein 1, and nuclear factor interleukin-6 were found in the Gal-6  gene upstream region, which suggests a possible inducible nature of the Gal-6  gene. In colony-counting assays, strong bactericidal and fungicidal activity was  observed, including bactericidal activity against food-borne pathogens  Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Clostridium  perfringens, and Escherichia coli. Treatment with 16 mug/ml synthetic Gal-6  resulted in a 3 log unit reduction in Clostridium perfringens survival within 60  min, indicating fast killing kinetics. Transmission electron microscopy  examination of synthetic-Gal-6-treated Clostridium perfringens cells showed  dose-dependent changes in morphology after 30 min, including intracellular  granulation, cytoplasm retraction, irregular septum formation in dividing cells,  and cell lysis. The high expression in the proximal digestive tract and broad  antimicrobial activity suggest that chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 plays an  important role in chicken innate host defense.

AB  - Despite much debate over a presumptively somatic vs psychological etiology of nonatopic food and chemical sensitivities, little systematic research has  addressed the issues. The present study investigated self-reported illness from  several common foods (wheat, dairy, eggs) and chemicals (pesticide, car exhaust,  paint, perfume, new carpet), symptom patterns, and psychological profiles of a  sample of young adult college students (n = 490, age 19.4 +/- 2.4, 52% female/48%  male). Subjects were divided into 4 groups on the basis of sample medians for  frequency of illness from the foods (FI) and chemicals (CI); high FI with high CI  (FI/CI), high FI alone, high CI alone, and NOILL (low FI and CI). FI was  associated with more defensiveness (denial of negativity) while CI was linked  with more shyness (avoidance of novelty). Women outnumbered men in all groups  (FI/CI: 61%; FI: 80% CI: 55%) except the NOILL (40% women). Nevertheless, the  FI/CI, FI, and/or CI groups still had significantly higher total symptom scores  as well as more indigestion, headache, and memory trouble than did the NOILL  group, even after depression, anxiety, shyness, defensiveness, and gender were  covaried. The illness groups reported significantly more limitation of foods that  mobilize endogenous opioids or generate exogenous opioids (sweets, fats, bread)  as well as more illness from opiate drugs, small amounts of beverage alcohol, and  late meals. Nasal symptoms from pollens or animals were more common in the FI/CI  (42%) and CI (42%) than in FI (26%) or NOILL (28%) groups. Premenstrual tension  syndrome and irritable bowel were also more common in the FI/CI group. The  findings indicate that young adults outside the clinical setting who are  relatively higher in FI and/or CI have distinctive symptom and psychological  patterns. Covariate analyses suggest that important symptoms in FI and CI  individuals such as indigestion, headache, and memory problems may occur in  addition to rather than as simply part of emotional distress. The data are  consistent with a previously hypothesized role of olfactory-limbic and  hypothalamic pathways and with a time-dependent sensitization model for illness  from foods and chemicals.
