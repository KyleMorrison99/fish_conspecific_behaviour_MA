TI  - Pyroptosis Mediates Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation during Bacterial Infection in Zebrafish
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The formation of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) is a critical host defense when neutrophils migrate to infection sites. Pyroptosis is a newly identified programmed cell death, which is tightly regulated by inflammasome activation. However, the mechanism of pyroptotic signaling participating in NET production remains to be elucidated. In this study, the zebrafish larvae otic vesicle microinjection model was used to infect larvae with hemolysin-overexpressing Edwardsiella piscicida (EthA(+)), and a rapid migration of neutrophils to infection sites was observed. Intriguingly, EthA(+) infection effectively induced significant neutrophil membrane rupture in vivo, which was dependent on caspase-B (caspy2) and gasdermin Eb (GSDMEb) but not caspase-A or gasdermin Ea. Specifically, the EthA(+) E. piscicida infection induced pyroptosis along with NETosis in vitro, and depletion of either caspy2 or GSDMEb impaired NET formation in vivo. Consequently, inhibition of the caspy2-GSDMEb axis-gated NETosis impaired bacterial clearance in vivo. Altogether, these data provide evidence that teleost fish innate immune cells, including neutrophils, express features of pyroptosis that are critical for NETosis in teleost innate immunity.

AB  - Specimens of two endemic cyprinids, Squalius laietanus (Catalan chub) and Barbus meridionalis (Mediterranean barbel), were sampled from a reference site in a small stream of the Ripoll River (NW Mediterranean) outside of their reproductive season. Biomarkers involved in xenobiotic-mediated responses were individually contrasted in fish of both species and 17 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) analysed in muscle to reveal bioaccumulation trends. The parameters were in muscle: cholinesterases, metabolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and citrate synthase (CS); and in liver: cytochrome P450 dependent activities (EROD and BFCOD), carboxylesterase (CE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT). All markers are considered adaptive defence mechanism to face stress. Sensitivity to a model pesticide: dichlorvos was also contrasted in vitro in muscular acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and hepatic CE to reveal species sensitivity to neurotoxic chemicals. Enzymatic activities related to protective mechanisms such as butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), CE and CAT were higher in chub whereas the antioxidant defences GR and GPX were higher in barbel. Aerobic CS was also higher in barbel while anaerobic LDH was so in chub. EROD activity did not differ between the two species but BFCOD activity was higher in barbel. Levels of PFAS were higher in barbel likely due to its benthic habitat. The in vitro tests revealed higher sensitivity to dichlorvos of muscular AChE in chub (lower IC50) which was probably compensated by a higher catalytic efficiency of CE. All these former biochemical particularities are discussed in terms of fish ecological performance in front of anthropogenic stressors.

KW  - Pathogen
AB  - CD9 is a glycoprotein of the transmembrane 4 superfamily that is involved in various cellular processes. Studies related to the immune functions and activities of CD9 in teleost fish are limited. In this study, we characterized two CD9 homologs, PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3, from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Sequence analysis showed that PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 possess characteristic transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) structures. PoCD9.1 shares 70.61% sequence identity with PoCD9.3. The expression of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 in the three main immune tissues was significantly induced in a time-dependent manner by extracellular and intracellular pathogen infection, which indicates that the two CD9 homologs play an important role in the response to pathogenic infection. Following infection with the extracellular pathogen Vibrio anguillarum, the expression profiles of both PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 were similar. After infection with the intracellular pathogen Edwardsiella piscicida, the expression levels of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 were different at different stages of infection, especially in the spleen. The spleen was the most important tissue for the PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 responses to pathogen infection among the three examined immune tissues. Knockdown of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 attenuated the ability of host cells to eliminate pathogenic bacteria, and PoCD9.1 knockdown was more lethal than PoCD9.3 knockdown for host cells with E. piscicida infection. Overexpression of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 promoted host or host cell defence against E. piscicida infection. These findings suggest that PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 serve as immune-related factors, play an important role in the immune defence system of Japanese flounder, and display different functions in response to different pathogens at different stages of infection.

AB  - The flavonoid metal-insecticide [Mg(hesp)2(phen)], denominated MgHP, has high potential for controlling agricultural pests. If applied in large scale, it may reach aquatic ecosystems and be harmful to the biota. This study evaluated the effects of MgHP in the gills of the Neotropical fish, Prochilodus lineatus by determining the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione s-transferase (GST), and the levels of glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) after 24 and 96 h exposure to 0, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 mu g L-1. The histopathological changes with emphases to mitochondria-rich cells (MRC) were evaluated as well. After 24 h exposure the enzyme activities and the GSH and LPO levels were unchanged however, after 96 h exposure to high MgHP concentration (1000 mu g L-1), the GST activity and GSH levels increased. Oxidative stress measured as LPO levels did not occur after MgHP exposure in both periods. Gill tissue alterations increased after MgHP exposure to 10, 100 and 1000 mu g L-1. Cellular atrophy, pillar cells changes, filament epithelium hyperplasia and hypertrophy, lamellar epithelium hyperplasia were the most frequent histopathology. MRC in the filament epithelium decreased after exposure to 24 h and increased after 96 h indicating possible transitory osmo-ionic disruption. P. lineatus exhibited high tolerance to MgHP. The increased GST activity and GSH levels after 96 h exposure suggested possible MgHP accumulation and concentrationand time dependent response. Histopathology in the gills of exposed fish occurred at high MgHP concentrations. These results suggested that the MgHP into water, at high concentrations, affect the gills by changing GST activity, GSH levels and histology being useful biomarkers for MgHP water contamination.

AB  - Dolphins are among the largest and most diverse predators in marine ecosystems, but our understanding of their foraging ecology, which is crucial for ecosystem management, is poor. Delphinus delphis (common dolphins) are found in tropical and temperate waters globally. Stomach content studies indicate they are opportunistic predators that feed locally on abundant small pelagic schooling fish, but information is lacking on how their diet may vary seasonally and with ontogeny. We investigated effects of body length, sex, season, and year on D. delphis diet in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope analysis of 56 skin samples collected during 13 years (2004-2016). Dolphin delta N-15 values changed with body length, suggesting ontogenetic dietary variation. Nitrogen isotope values were higher in austral autumn/winter compared to spring/summer, whilst delta C-13 values decreased throughout the study period, suggesting temporal changes in primary productivity likely affecting the dolphins' diet. Sex had a minor effect on dolphin delta C-13 values, with male and female isotopic niches overlapping by 62.6% and 45.2% (respectively). Our results provide a baseline for detecting future changes in the trophic ecology of D. delphis in a key habitat in New Zealand and highlight their role as a sentinel species in this coastal ecosystem.

AB  - Pollutants in the environment and exposure to them lead to medical ailments around the world. The present study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of evening primrose oil and fish oil against fenitrothion pesticide-induced toxicity in rats. Male Wistar rats weighing 150-220 g, were randomly distributed into seven groups, the first served as control. The second group received fenitrothion, the third and fourth groups were supplemented with fish oil and evening primrose oil, respectively. Rats of group five were exposed to fish oil and fenitrothion. The sixth group was exposed to evening primrose oil and fenitrothion. Rats of the seventh group were exposed to fish oil and evening primrose oil and fenitrothion. The results showed that the activities of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and the levels of bilirubin (BIL), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), glucose (GLU), cholesterol (CHOL), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), very low-density lipoproteins cholesterol (VLDL-c), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were noticeably increased in rats administered fenitrothion. However, the level of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and glutathione (GSH) were markedly decreased. It was found that fish oil and evening primrose oil decreased the physiological unsettling influences initiated by fenitrothion. Moreover, the antioxidant properties of these oils supported the bioactive roles of its defensive impacts on fenitrothion toxicity. Finally, the present findings suggest that these oils may be utilized as preventive components against the toxicity of fenitrothion because of their antioxidant properties.

AB  - Human-induced land use changes like agriculture and urban development occur commonly at the cost of natural wetlands, which require immediate attention and sustained efforts from urban planners and concerned governments. In view of the East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW), India, this paper has examined the trend, causes, extent and impacts of landscape transformation during the last few decades. Hence we aim to present a review of several studies in and around EKW and suggests a sustainable model for EKW. This 'Ramsar site of International Importance' is one of the world's largest wastewater-fed aquaculture systems where the city sewage is recycled for pisciculture and agriculture, and acts as flood resistance for the city of Kolkata. Rapid encroachment in the EKW due to unplanned development has caused various environmental, social and economic impacts. The key ecological impacts found in the study included loss of faunal and floral diversity, eco-toxicological impacts, etc. In terms of biodiversity loss, while the number of bird species in the EKW decreased from 248 in 1960s to 72 in 2005, about 59% fish species are near threats, vulnerable and endangered. Reported persistent organic pollutants (POPs) around the EKW region were found to pose deleterious impact on environment and ambient biota. Several studies have evidenced that the open burning of solid waste in the dumping ground of Dhapa is a potential source of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo dioxin/furans (PCDD/Fs). Further the ecological transformation of the EKW focussing on policy development and regulatory compliance issues has been studied in this paper. The aspects of encroachment and wetland shrinkage triggered by economic drivers like urban sprawl have been analyzed. The paper presents adaptive co-management as the future roadmap for action to curb further degradation of the wetlands, and adopt an integrated approach of environmental, political, physical, economic and institutional aspects. It is envisaged that the adaptive co-management model will contribute to long-term sustainable sustenance of this precious ecosystem. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are known to play a role as a first line of defence against microbial invasion. Liver Expressed Antimicrobial Peptides-2 (LEAP-2) is one of the AMPs. LEAP-2 includes four highly conserved cysteine residues and belongs to a cysteine-rich peptides group. We identified and characterized the molecular properties of LEAP-2 in rock bream. The expression levels of rock bream LEAP-2 (RbLEAP-2) in the 12 different tissues of healthy fish and the RbLEAP-2 expression pattern after infections with Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida), Streptococcus iniae (S. iniae) and red seabream iridovirus (RSIV) were examined. This data provide that RbLEAP-2 plays an important role in innate immunity when rock bream is infected with a pathogen. (c) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Ultrastructural and histopathological reponses in the organs of living organisms are important and useful tools to determine the health condition and the effects of pollutants, such as pesticides, on the organisms. The aim of this study is to determine possible histopathological, cytopathological and ultrastructural alterations in gills of Oreochromis niloticus individuals exposed to 850 mu g/L carbaryl standart at 7th, 14th and 21st days with light and electron microscopes. The fish were exposed to carbaryl for 21 days and the histopatological, ultrastructural and cytopathological alterations occuring in the gill tissues of organisms were determined by light, Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopes (SEM and TEM). At the end of the study, it was observed that carbaryl caused both histopathological and cytopathological changes in the gills of O. niloticus. It has been determined that the most of the pathological changes in the exposed organisms are the metabolic defence reactions.

AB  - Currently, treatments for dengue infection are only symptomatic as no antiviral agents nor vaccines are available to combat this virus. Despite challenges faced by researchers, many efforts are ongoing to reduce cases of dengue infection either by targeting the vector or the virus. Vector population is monitored and reduced by using mechanical, chemical and biological controls. Chemical control is achieved either by using synthetic or natural insecticides where the latter is more preferable. In biological control, bacteria, fungi and larvivorous fish are utilised to reduce the vector population. Moreover, genes of mosquitoes are also explored to produce progenies which are sterile with low survival ability. Vaccines are among the most effective ways to prevent viral infection. Various approaches have been used and are still being explored towards producing vaccines for dengue. These include live attenuated, inactivated, recombinant subunit, nucleic acid and virus-like particles vaccines. The aim is to produce a vaccine which can target all the four serotypes of the virus. Monoclonal antibodies are widely researched on to equip the host defense mechanism against the dengue virus. Deeper understanding of the virus replication cycle warrants the development of antiviral agents which target viral proteins vital for the replication process. Bioactive compounds are also utilised in the development of antiviral agents. The importance of surveillance and supportive therapy are also discussed.

AB  - Background. Population growth has led to the need to increase global food production. Pesticides are an important tool used in efforts to control insect pests. About 20-30% of agricultural produce is lost annually due to insect pests, diseases, weeds and rodents. While pesticides are effective against pest populations, if used injudiciously, they may pose health hazards to humans, domestic animals, natural enemies of crop pests and other forms of life through unwanted contamination of food, feed, water bodies and the environment.
   Objectives. The aim of the present study was to examine farmers' level of knowledge and awareness of environmental pollution due to unsafe use of pesticides for controlling rice pests and to explore ways of reducing their usage.
   Methods. The research population consisted of 120 rice farmers: 40 farmers randomly selected from each of the three rice growing districts of Bangladesh; Mymensingh, Tangail and Jamalpur. Data was collected through group discussions, direct observations and personal interviews during March 2013 to May 2014.
   Results. Farmers mainly sought advice on pesticide use from pesticide dealers or retailers and a very few farmers contacted government extension workers for this purpose. Most of the farmers had an understanding of natural enemies of rice pests and that the application of synthetic insecticides in the field can reduce their population. A few farmers followed integrated pest management (IPM) practices with little understanding of the adverse effects of insecticides on the environment and ecosystem. The majority of farmers understood the harmful effects of pesticides on health of human and animals, beneficial species, fish, insect resistance, soil and food. It was also found that education on pest management, information through television, more contact with extension personnel and farmers' awareness of IPM were critical factors for improving rice farmers' understanding of the ecological hazards caused by overuse of pesticides. Most of the farmers suggested that timely removal of weeds, appropriate timing for pesticide application, balanced doses of fertilizers, pest monitoring, correct dose of appropriate pesticides, pest tolerant varieties, increasing technical knowledge and skills and creating social awareness of environmental pollution among farmers were necessary to reduce the quantity of pesticides and minimize environmental hazards.
   Conclusions. The present study identified a need to intensify farmers' awareness and knowledge of integrated pest management and environmental pollution through extension organizations which could help promote sustainable agricultural development and improve the currently endangered bio-diversity of Bangladesh.

AB  - Metals and pesticides are common pollutants and the modulation of biomarkers can indicate sub-lethal influences on the physiology of organisms inhabiting impacted aquatic systems. We examined the effects of mercury and the organophosphate pesticide dimethoate on EROD, MROD, glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholine esterase (AChE), metallothionein (MT) and glutathione (GSH) in the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus). Crayfish were injected with mercury chloride or dimethoate (0.3, 0.6, 0.9 mu g kg(-1)) and dissected after 72 h. EROD activity in the hepatopancreas did not change in response to mercury chloride treatment but exhibited a dose dependent decrease at all concentrations of dimethoate tested. MROD (hepatopancreas) exhibited a significant decrease at the 0.9 mu g kg(-1) treatment for both chemicals. GST (hepatopancreas) demonstrated a significant dose dependent decrease at all concentrations of both mercury chloride and dimethoate. AChE (tail muscle) decreased at the 0.6 and 0.9 mu g kg(-1) concentrations of dimethoate and 0.9 mu g kg(-1) mercury chloride. In gill tissue, MT increased in response to 03 and 0.6 mu g kg(-1) of mercury chloride but no effect was observed at the 0.9 mu g kg(-1) concentration of mercury chloride or any concentrations of dimethoate tested. MT did not change in response to mercury or dimethoate in tail tissue. Furthermore, neither chemical modulated GSH concentrations. Our results indicate that, apart from GSH, these markers are sensitive to the pollutants tested and that animals exposed in the wild are potentially compromised in their ability to detoxify environmental contaminants and carry out normal cellular processes.

AB  - People living a subsistence lifestyle in the Arctic are highly exposed to persistent organic pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Formerly Used Defense (FUD) sites are point sources of PCB pollution; the Arctic contains thousands of FUD sites, many co-located with indigenous villages. We investigated PCB profiles and biological effects in freshwater fish (Alaska blackfish [Dallia pectoralis] and ninespine stickleback [Pungitius pungitius]) living upstream and downstream of the Northeast Cape FUD site on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea. Despite extensive site remediation, fish remained contaminated with PCBs. Vitellogenin concentrations in males indicated exposure to estrogenic contaminants, and some fish were hypothyroid. Downstream fish showed altered DNA methylation in gonads and altered gene expression related to DNA replication, response to DNA damage, and cell signaling. This study demonstrates that, even after site remediation, contaminants from Cold War FUD sites in remote regions of the Arctic remain a potential health threat to local residents - in this case, Yupik people who had no influence over site selection and use by the United States military.

AB  - The mucus layer covering the surface of fish contain a high number of antimicrobial compounds that provide a first line of defense against aquatic pathogens. In the present study, bactericidal activity present on skin mucus of Caspian kutum (Rutilus frisii kutum) broodstock was tested against six pathogenic bacterial strains (Streptococcus iniae, Yersinia ruckeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia cola Furthermore, fungicidal activity was assessed against four pathogenic fungi (Saprolegnia sp., Fusarium solani, Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus). Maximum and minimum antibacterial activity was observed against Y. ruckeri and S. iniae, respectively, while maximum and minimun fungicidal activty was detected against F. solani and C. albicans, respectively. Curiously, antimicrobial activity was higher in the fish mucus of female than male against most tested strains. In addition, minimum inhibitory concentration test showed that minimum concentrations of mucus ranged between 125 to 500 mu g/L were able to inhibit the growth of the selected bacterial and fungal pathogens. Alkaline phosphatase, lysozyme, protease and esterase activities were also studied on mucus samples being the observed activities very similar between both sexes, although higher lysozyme activity was detected in the mucus of female fish in comparison to the values recorded on male samples. Skin mucus of this fish species (especially females) could be a potential source of newer and more effective antibacterial components.

AB  - Cockroaches, the important indoor sanitary pests in urban worldwide. In China, there are six species of dominant indoor cockroaches which are increasingly hard to control due to their high adaptability, strong fecundity and extensive insecticide resistance. These cockroaches harbour abundant microorganisms varying from bacteria to viruses, fungi and protists, which have formed an interdependent symbiotic relationship with hosts in the process of long-term coevolution. A growing research has revealed that symbionts can modulate limited metabolic networks, thereby expanding ecological niches of host insects as a significant regulatory factor in insect growth and development. Therefore, in-depth study on the mechanisms of symbiont-insect interactions can shed light on a new perspective for pest prevention and control technology. Here, we give a general overview on classification and hazards of indoor cockroaches in China, as well as species, distribution and transmission mechanism of symbionts within cockroaches. Besides, we mainly discuss the interactions between insects and symbionts from the following aspects: nutritional physiology, reproductive regulation, pesticide resistance, defence, behaviour and so on. Based on the earlier symbiotic interactions, we propose some promising new insights into integrated pest management of cockroaches (i.e., utilizing symbionts to control cockroaches), such as application of Wolbachia to restrict population number, utilization of interactions between symbionts and entomopathogenic fungi including synergism or antagonism to accelerate host death, limiting host's vectorial capacity via paratransgenesis, push-pull strategy.

Neotropical tadpoles experience large temperature fluctuations in their habitats and many species are distributed in areas impacted by agriculture. This study evaluated the effects caused by the exposure to clomazone (Gamic) at different temperatures (28, 32 and 36 degrees C) on biochemical stress responses and esterase activities in Physalaemus nattereri and Rhinella schneideri tadpoles. Results evidenced that temperature modulates the effects of clomazone on biochemical response of tadpoles. Antioxidant enzymes, including catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase had their activities increased by clomazone in P. nattereri treated at higher temperatures. The biotransformation enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was also induced by clomazone at 32 and 36 degrees C. In R. schneideri, clomazone failed to alter antioxidant enzymes at 28 degrees C, but SOD and GST were increased by clomazone at higher temperatures after three days. All enzymes had their activities returned to the control levels after eight days in R. schneideri. Lipid peroxidation was induced in both species exposed to clomazone at 32 and 36 degrees C, but not at 28 degrees C. Acetylcholinesterase was not sensitive to clomazone and temperature, while most treatments impaired carboxylesterase activity. Integrated biomarker response (IBR) was notably induced by temperature in both species, and a synergic effect of temperature and clomazone was mostly observed after three days of exposure. These findings imply that tadpoles from tropical areas may present differential responses in their physiological mechanism linked to antioxidant defense to deal with temperature fluctuations and agrochemicals presence in their habitats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fish arc a source of persistent organic pollutants (POPS) in the human diet. Although species, trophic level, and means of production are typically considered in predicting fish pollutant load, and thus recommendations of consumption, capture location is usually not accounted for.
   OBJECTIVES: Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) are harvested from across the world's oceans and are widely consumed. Here, we determined geographic variation in the overall mass, concentration, and composition of POPs in yellowlin and examined the differences in levels of several POP congeners of potential relevance to human health.
   METHODS: We sampled dorsal muscle of 117 yellowfin tuna from 12 locations worldwide, and measured POP levels using combined liquid or gas chromatography and mass spectrometry according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standard procedures.
   RESULTS: POP levels varied significantly among sites, more than 36-fold on a mass basis. Individual fish levels ranged from 0.16 to 138.29 ng/g wet weight and lipid-normalized concentrations from 0.1 to 12.7 mu M. Levels of 10 congeners that interfere with the cellular defense protein P-glycoprotein, termed transporter interfering compounds (TICs), ranged from 0.05 to 35.03 ng/g wet weight and from 0.03 to 3.32 mu M in tuna lipid. Levels of TICs, and their individual congeners, were strongly associated with the overall POP load. Risk-based analysis of several carcinogenic POPs indicated that the fish with the highest levels of these potentially harmful compounds were clustered at specific geographic locations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Capture location is an important consideration when assessing the level and risk of human exposure to POPs through ingestion of wild fish.

AB  - Fish consumption is hypothesized to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Nonetheless, consuming sport fish from the Great Lakes increases exposure to certain persistent organic pollutants, namely polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine insecticides, which may increase the risk of cancer. Evidence that exposure to persistent organic pollutants is associated with colorectal cancer is sparse. We examined colorectal cancer incidence in the New York State Angler Cohort Study (NYSACS), a prospective cohort of 17,110 anglers and spouses age 18-40 years at enrollment. In 1991, participants completed a mailed self-administered questionnaire that ascertained the number of years that fish from Lake Ontario were consumed, as well as potential confounders. Forty-one histologically confirmed first primary incident colorectal cancers diagnosed as of December 31, 2008 were identified via the New York State Cancer Registry. Vital status was ascertained by linkage with the Social Security Administration Death File. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with Poisson regression, adjusting for age, pack-years of smoking, and sex. Compared with never consumers, colorectal cancer incidence was statistically non-significantly lower among consumers of Lake Ontario sport fish (RR=0.66; 95% CI: 0.35; 1.24). Incidence of colon cancer was lower among Lake Ontario sport fish consumers (RR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.20; 1.00). We did not observe any evidence of effect measure modification by sex or age. Although consumption of Lake Ontario sport fish may have an inverse association with colorectal cancer risk, inferences are complicated by a small number of cases and a lack of information regarding potential confounders including other dietary factors. However, our results do not provide support for the hypothesis that consumption of contaminated sport fish increases the risk of colorectal cancer.

AB  - The world's oceans are a global reservoir of persistent organic pollutants to which humans and other animals are exposed. Although it is well known that these pollutants are potentially hazardous to human and environmental health, their impacts remain incompletely understood. We examined how persistent organic pollutants interact with the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an evolutionarily conserved defense protein that is essential for protection against environmental toxicants. We identified specific congeners of organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers that inhibit mouse and human P-gp, and determined their environmental levels in yellowfin tuna from the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we solved the cocrystal structure of P-gp bound to one of these inhibitory pollutants, PBDE (polybrominated diphenyl ether)-100, providing the first view of pollutant binding to a drug transporter. The results demonstrate the potential for specific binding and inhibition of mammalian P-gp by ubiquitous congeners of persistent organic pollutants present in fish and other foods, and argue for further consideration of transporter inhibition in the assessment of the risk of exposure to these chemicals.

AB  - An experimental study of the effects of dietary administered polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on bream (Abramis brama L.) is reported in the present article. Responses of xenobiotic biotransformation system (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and glutathione-S-transferase activities), antioxidant system (superoxide dismutase and catalase activities), and lipid peroxidation system (levels of conjugated dienes and malonic dialdehyde) are investigated. A PCB dose of 2 mg/kg feed does not cause irreversible physiological transformations in bream after 14 days of administration. The defense systems appear to efficiently suppress the effects of the xenobiotic and maintain stable and low intensity of the destructive processes at the exposure conditions used.

AB  - A population's exposure to persistent organic pollutants, e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), is typically assessed through national biomonitoring programs, such as the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). To complement statistical methods, we use a deterministic modeling approach to establish mechanistic links between human contaminant concentrations and factors (e.g. age, diet, lipid mass) deemed responsible for the often considerable variability in these concentrations. Lifetime exposures to four PCB congeners in 6128 participants from NHANES 1999-2004 are simulated using the ACC-Human model supplied with individualized input parameters obtained from NHANES questionnaires (e.g., birth year, sex, body mass index, dietary composition, reproductive behavior). Modeled and measured geometric mean PCB-153 concentrations in NHANES participants of 13.3 and 22.0 ng g(-1) lipid, respectively, agree remarkably well, although lower model-measurement agreement for air, water, and food suggests that this is partially due to fortuitous error cancellation. The model also reproduces trends in the measured data with key factors such as age, parity and sex. On an individual level, 62% of all modeled concentrations are within a factor of three of their corresponding measured values (Spearman r(s) = 0.44). However, the model attributes more of the inter-individual variability to differences in dietary lipid intake than is indicated by the measured data. While the model succeeds in predicting levels and trends on the population level, the accuracy of individual-specific predictions would need to be improved for refined exposure characterization in epidemiological studies.

AB  - Fumio Matsumura joined the University of California, Davis, faculty in 1987 where he served as founding director of the Center for Environmental Health Sciences, associate director of the U.C. Toxic Substances Research and Teaching Program, and chair of the Department of Environmental Toxicology. He was an active affiliate with the NIEHS-funded Superfund Basic Research Program and the NIH Comprehensive Cancer Center. He was in many instances a primary driver or otherwise involved in most activities related to environmental toxicology at Davis, including the education of students in environmental biochemistry and ecotoxicology. A significant part of his broad research program was focused on the long range transport of chemicals such as toxaphene, PCBs and related contaminants used or released in California to the Sierra Nevada mountains, downwind of the urban and agricultural regions of the state. He hypothesized that these chemical residues adversely affected fish and wildlife, and particularly the declining populations of amphibians in Sierra Nevada streams and lakes. Fumio and his students and colleagues found residues of toxaphene and PCBs at higher elevations, an apparent result of atmospheric drift and deposition in the mountains. Fumio and his wife Teruko had personal interests in, and a love of the mountains, as avid skiers, hikers, and outdoor enthusiasts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Although predictors of contaminants in serum or whole blood are usually examined by chemical groups (e.g., POPs, toxic and/or essential elements; dietary sources), principal component analysis (PCA) permits consideration of both individual substances and combined variables.
   Objectives: Our study had two primary objectives: (i) Characterize the sources and predictors of a suite of eight PCBs, four organochlorine (OC) pesticides, five essential and five toxic elements in serum and/or whole blood of pregnant women recruited as part of the Mother-and-Child Contaminant Cohort Study conducted in Northern Norway (The MISA study); and (ii) determine the influence of personal and social characteristics on both dietary and contaminant factors.
   Methods: Recruitment and sampling started in May 2007 and continued for the next 31 months until December 2009. Blood/serum samples were collected during the 2nd trimester (mean: 18.2 weeks, range 9.0-36.0). A validated questionnaire was administered to obtain personal information. The samples were analysed by established laboratories employing verified methods and reference standards. PCA involved Varimax rotation, and significant predictors (p <= 0.05) in linear regression models were included in the multivariable linear regression analysis.
   Results: When considering all the contaminants, three prominent PCA axes stood out with prominent loadings of: all POPs; arsenic, selenium and mercury; and cadmium and lead. Respectively, in the multivariate models the following were predictors: maternal age, parity and consumption of freshwater fish and land-based wild animals; marine fish; cigarette smoking, dietary PCA axes reflecting consumption of grains and cereals, and food items involving hunting. PCA of only the POPs separated them into two axes that, in terms of recently published findings, could be understood to reflect longitudinal trends and their relative contributions to summed POPs.
   Conclusions: The linear combinations of variables generated by PCA identified prominent dietary sources of OC groups and of prominent toxic elements and highlighted the importance of maternal characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Male Siamese fighting fish are highly territorial and aggressive towards conspecifics. We have suggested that aggressive behavior of Betta splendens males is highly sensitive and might be useful as a bioindicator of fresh water pollution. This was tested by determining opercular expansion count and duration when pollutant-exposed fish were confronted by naive fish. We found that paraoxon, a commonly used pesticide used as a model pollutant, inhibits aggressive behavior of Betta males. The results indicate that males treated with paraoxon for 24 hours were significantly less aggressive than control males. The findings suggest that aggressive behavior in Betta splendens may have use as a bioindicator of organophosphate pollution in fresh water.

AB  - In recent years, Solea senegalensis has increasingly been used in pollution monitoring studies. In order to assess its response to some particular widespread pollutants, juveniles of S. senegalensis were administered an intraperitoneal injection of the model aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist P-naphto-flavone (beta NF) and chemicals of environmental concern, such as the fungicide ketoconazole (KETO), the lipid regulator gemfibrozil (GEM), the surfactant nonylphenol (NP) and the synthetic hormone ethinylestradiol (EE2). Two days after injection, the effect of these chemicals was followed up as alterations of hepatic microsomal activities of the cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and associated reductases, carboxylesterases (CbEs) and the conjugation enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT). In the cytosolic fraction of the liver, the effect on CbEs, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and antioxidant activities was also considered. Alterations on the endocrine reproductive system were evaluated by plasma levels of vitellogenin (VTG) and the sex steroids estradiol (E-2), testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) and the progestin 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta-P). Injection with the model compound PE induced the hydrolysis rate of the seven CYP substrates assayed. The xenobiotic GEM induced three CYP-related activities (e.g. ECOD) and UDPGT, but depressed antioxidant defenses. EE2 induced four CYPs, more significantly ECOD and BFCOD activities. The xenoestrogens NP and EE2 altered the activities of CbE in microsomes and catalase, and were the only treatments that induced de nova VTG synthesis. In addition, the progestin 17,20 beta-P, was induced in NP-injected fish. None of the treatments caused statistically significant effects on steroid plasma levels. In conclusion, the CYP substrates assayed responded specifically to treatments and juveniles of S. senegalensis appear good candidates for assessing xenobiotics exposure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Water pollution represents a threat of increasing importance to human health. Bivalve mollusks are filter-feeding organisms that can accumulate chemical and microbiological contaminants in their tissues from very low concentrations in the water or sediments. Consumption of contaminated shellfish is one of the main causes of seafood poisoning. Thus, marine bivalves are normally depurated in sterilized seawater for 48 h to allow the removal of bacteria. However, this depuration time might be insufficient to eliminate chemical contaminants from their tissues. We have developed a novel technology that accelerates up to fourfold the excretion rate of xenobiotics in bivalves by treatment with the antioxidant and glutathione (GSH) pro-drug N-acetylcysteine (NAC) during the depuration period. NAC improved dose-dependently the detoxification of the organophosphate (OP) pesticide fenitrothion in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, diminishing its levels up to nearly a hundred fold compared to conventional depuration, by enhancing the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and inducing the GSH anabolism (GSH synthesis and reduction by glutathione reductase). Notably, this induction in GSH anabolism and GST activity was also observed in uncontaminated bivalves treated with NAC. As the GSH pathway is involved in the detoxification of many pollutants and biotoxins from harmful algal blooms, we validated this proof of principle in king scallops (Pecten maximus) that naturally accumulated the amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) toxin domoic acid. We illustrate here a method that enhances the elimination of organic contaminants in shellfish, opening new avenues of depuration of marine organisms. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The widespread use of herbicides across the globe has increased the probability of synthetic chemicals entering freshwater habitats. On entering aquatic habitats, these chemicals target and disrupt both physiological and behavioral functioning in various aquatic organisms. Herbicides, such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), can have negative impacts on chemoreception because these receptor cells are in direct contact with water-soluble chemicals in the environment. Studies focusing on lethal concentration (LC50) levels may understate the impact of herbicides within aquatic habitats because damage to the chemoreceptors can result in modified behaviors or lack of appropriate responses to environmental or social cues. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether exposure to sublethal levels of 2,4-D alters the foraging behaviors of crayfish Orconectes rusticus. We hypothesized that crayfish exposed to greater concentrations of 2,4-D would be less successful in locating food or on locating food would consume smaller amounts possibly due to an inability to recognize the food odors in the contaminated waters. Crayfish were exposed to three sublethal levels of 2,4-D for 96 h and placed into a Y-maze system with a fish gelatin food source placed randomly in the right or left arm. Average walking speed, average time spent in the correct arm, and percent consumption were analyzed. Our data show that crayfish were impaired in their ability to forage effectively. These inabilities to locate and consume adequate amounts of food could result in lower body weights and decreased fitness in populations of crayfish exposed to 2,4-D in natural habitats.

AB  - The chronic toxicity of chemicals to fish is routinely assessed by using fish early life stage (ELS) test results. Fish full life cycle (FLC) tests are generally required only when toxicity, bioaccumulation, and persistence triggers are met or when there is a suspicion of potential endocrine-disrupting properties. This regulatory approach is based on a relationship between the results of fish ELS and FLC studies first established more than 35 yr ago. Recently, this relationship has been challenged by some regulatory authorities, and it has been recommended that more substances should undergo FLC testing. In addition, a project proposal has been submitted to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to develop a fish partial life cycle (PLC) test including a reproductive assessment. Both FLC and PLC tests are animal-and resource-intensive and technically challenging and should therefore be undertaken only if there is clear evidence that they are necessary for coming to a regulatory decision. The present study reports on an analysis of a database of paired fish ELS and FLC endpoints for plant protection product active substances from European Union draft assessment reports and the US Environmental Protection Agency Office of Pesticide Programs Pesticide Ecotoxicity Database. Analysis of this database shows a clear relationship between ELS and FLC responses, with similar median sensitivity across substances when no-observed-effect concentrations (NOECs) are compared. There was also no indication that classification of a substance as a mammalian reproductive toxicant leads to more sensitive effects in fish FLC tests than in ELS tests. Indeed, the response of the ELS tests was generally more sensitive than the most sensitive reproduction NOEC from a FLC test. This analysis indicates that current testing strategies and guidelines are fit for purpose and that there is no need for fish full or partial life cycle tests for most plant protection product active substances.

AB  - The toxic effects may include both lethal and sublethal concentrations, which may change the growth rate, development, reproduction, histopathology, biochemistry, physiology and behavior on target organisms and undesirable perturbations in the environment. The result of the present work i.e., observed percentage mortality of species of fresh water fish Cirrhinus mrigala when exposed to the 10% emulsifiable concentration (E.C.) cypermethrin for time periods 24, 48, 72 and 96 h in static system toxicity is in the range of 2.69 ppb, 2.61 ppb, 2.41 ppb, 2.28 ppb Respectively. In the present investigatiion, the test species C. mrigala has shown differential toxicity level with a functin of period. With the increase period of exposure (96 h), the fish showed mortality at less concentration and with decrease of duration of exposrue the fish exhibited mortality at higher concentration. In the present investigation, when fish were exposed to sublethal concentration of cypermethrin for 4 days. Several behavioural changes were observed which include loss of schooling behaviour, swimming near the water surface, hyper activity, erratic movements, seizures, loss of buoyancy, elevated cough, restlessness before death, darting movements and hitting against the walls of test tanks were noticed in all the species tested. A film of mucus was also observed all over the body and also on the gills.

AB  - Contaminants, like pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and metals, are persistent and ubiquitous and are known to threaten the environment. Traditionally, scientists have considered the direct physiological risks that these contaminants pose. However, scientists have just begun to integrate ethology and toxicology to investigate the effects that contaminants have on behavior. This review considers the potential for contaminant effects on mating behavior. Here, we assess the growing body of research concerning disruptions in sexual differentiation, courtship, sexual receptivity, arousal, and mating. We discuss the implications of these disruptions on conservation efforts and highlight the importance of recognizing the potential for environmental stressors to affect behavioral experimentation. More specifically, we consider the negative implications for anthropogenic contaminants to affect the immediate behavior of animals and their potential to have cascading and/or long-term effects on the behavioral ecology and evolution of populations. Overall, we aim to raise awareness of the confounding influence that contaminants can have and promote caution when interpreting results where the potential for cryptic effects are possible.

AB  - This study was conducted to detect the effects of paclobutrazol (PBZ) at environmental concentration on the antioxidant defense system in Sebastiscus marmoratus. Fish were exposed to concentrations of PBZ (10, 100, 1,000 ng/L) for 50 days. The results showed: (1) The glutathione contents in the liver and brain were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. (2) The activities of glutathione S-transferases (GST) and catalase in liver and brain were inhibited as the increase of PBZ concentration. A highest 2.16-fold (p = 0.05) and 11.54-fold (p < 0.001) reduction of GST activity in the liver and brain respectively was observed in 1,000 mu g/L group. (3) The activities of glutathione peroxidase in liver were inhibited. These results suggest that the exposure of PBZ would influence the antioxidant ability of S. marmoratus.

AB  - The Arc River and Berre lagoon are one of important river basin hydrosystem in the South of France that receives industrial and municipal wastewaters from the adjacent area.
   Due to its social and economic impact as well as ecological function of basin, an assessment of environmental risk due to mobilization of contaminants is necessary. Thus, the study aims to determine the spatial distribution of n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine and organophosphorous pesticides in surface sediments and their potential origins by using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.
   Total alkanes concentrations ranged from 563 to 5,068 mu g kg(-1) sediment dry weight (dw), the sum of 17 PAHs ranged from 153 to 1,311 mu g kg(-1) dw, the sum of seven PCBs concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 466.8 mu g kg(-1) dw, and the total pesticides concentrations ranged from 0.02 to 7.15 mu g kg(-1) dw. Ratios of specific n-alcanes (carbon preference index, natural n-alkanes ratio, and terrigenous/aquatic ratio) and ratios of selected PAH (anthracene (Ant)/(Ant + Phe), fluoranthene (Fl)/(Fl + pyrSne (Pyr)), BaA/(BaA + chrysene (Chry)), indeno[1,2,3,c,d]pyrene (IPyr)/(IPyr + BghiP)) were calculated to evaluate the possible sources of hydrocarbons.
   The evaluations suggest the sources of hydrocarbons in the sediments were generally biogenic and markedly more pyrolytic rather than petrogenic. In the perspectives of environmental risk assessment, all contaminants levels were also compared with sediments quality guidelines (SQG) resulting that the contamination levels in all stations were most of the time lower than their respective SQG. While, for PCBs concentrations, three stations (A8, B1, and B2) were higher than their effect range median values which may indicate high potential toxicity of the sediment with probable adverse effects to the living biota.

AB  - Lake Yuriria, located in the heavily populated and polluted Mexican Central Plateau, receives domestic sewage, industrial effluents, and municipal wastewaters that are still directly discharged without treatment into the tributaries and the lake. Pollutants in water and sediments include heavy metals, aromatic hydrocarbons, and organochlorine pesticides. Activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as Na+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase) activity, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were evaluated in the livers of the fish Goodea atripinnis after 96 h of exposure to water collected in March and June 2005 from three sites: Y (limnetic zone), L (Lerma tributary), and C (la Cinta tributary). Physical and chemical parameters of the lake water were also analyzed. Increases in CAT activity and LPO levels at all three sites were detected compared with control fish (P < 0.05), while GPx and SOD activities decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Na+/K+-ATPase activities were similar to the control in fish exposed to limnetic water from both March and June but were higher than control at the two tributary sites in March (P < 0.05); fish exposed to water from the Lerma tributary in June exhibited lower Na+/K+-ATPase than the control (P < 0.05). During March, CAT and Na+/K+-ATPase activities were increasing more than in June in Y and L, respectively, while in June, SOD and GPx were depleted more than March in L and Y and L, respectively. Despite the antioxidant defenses of the fish liver, exposure to all water samples from Lake Yuriria exerted alterations in hepatic LPO levels, antioxidant enzymes, and Na+/K+-ATPase activities that could substantially impair the mechanisms of fish defenses against oxidative stress.

AB  - Phosmet is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20003, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20024. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the European Commission.
   Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on phosmet in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 23 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 03 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Margarita Internacional. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6 April 2006 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 12 May 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 75).
   Phosmet was included in Annex I of Directive 91/414 by Commission Directive 2007/25/EC of 23 April, 20075. The entry into force of the Annex I inclusion was 1 October 2007.
   In March 2010 the European Commission received a request to modify the ADI for phosmet, based on an evaluation of new toxicological data carried out by the United Kingdom following an application from Gowan Comercio Internacional e Servicos. In compliance with the Guidance Document SANCO 10328/2006 rev. 6, the European Commission invited all Member States and EFSA to provide comments on the new evaluation. Following consideration of the comments received, the European Commission requested EFSA to organise a peer review of the new evaluation and to deliver its conclusions on the new proposed ADI for phosmet.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an acaracide and insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises tractor-mounted spraying and airblast assisted sprayers in orchards. Application is made to citrus fruit at a rate of 0.5 kg phosmet per hectare, pome fruit at 0.3 kg phosmet per hectare and potatoes at 0.5 kg phosmet per hectare.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Imidan 50 WP a wettable powder (WP) registered under different trade names in Europe. The representative uses assessed were located in southern Europe only as stated in the application for annex 1 listing. No conclusion on the equivalence of the two sources could be made as some mammalian toxicology data were missing.
   In the main adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. The residue definition for water can not be finalised due to outstanding ecotoxicology data. The method for body fluids and tissues is currently only validated for phosmet and as the oxon is in the residue definition further validation data will be required. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Limited analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are some outstanding issues related to the relevant impurities.
   The toxicological risk assessment is based on the assumption that the studies have been performed with a test material that covers the current technical specification.
   The absorption is rapid and almost complete, there is no accumulation in tissues and the excretion is mainly via urine. Phosmet is toxic by oral administration and the proposed classification is T, R25. It is non-irritant to skin and eyes and does not cause sensitisation by skin contact.
   The critical effect after repeated exposure is depression of the plasma, erythrocyte and brain acetylcholinesterase activities. The most sensitive species is the dog. Phosmet is an in vitro but not in vivo genotoxic agent. Increased incidence of liver tumours is observed in mice at the highest dose level (14 mg/kg bw/day), higher than controls but within the same range as historical control data. In a two-generation study with rats, the fertility parameters and the offspring are not directly affected. Phosmet shows no evidence of teratogenicity in rat or rabbits, and no potential to induce delayed neurotoxicity. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, based on a NOAEL of 1 mg/kg bw/day from the rat multigeneration study, supported by short-term studies in dogs and rats and a long-term study in rats. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.045 mg/kg bw and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) 0.02 mg/kg bw/day.
   For the use on potatoes and pomes, exposure estimates according to the German model are below the AOEL for operators wearing personal protective equipment and respiratory protective equipment. In spite of these high protection measures, the operator exposure is above the AOEL during application on citrus fruits. Estimates of worker and bystander exposure are below the AOEL for all the supported uses.
   Plant metabolism studies with 14C-phosmet in cherries, potatoes and corn are available covering the representative uses. A common metabolic pathway is proposed. Phosmet is able to penetrate through the plant surface where the main metabolic reactions take place. Within the plant tissues only a limited transport is observed. The primary metabolic reactions are hydrolysis and conjugation reactions which produce phthalic acid and a range of related compounds, none of them containing the phosphorodithioate group. Oxidation reaction leading to the oxygen analogue phosmet oxon is a minor metabolic reaction. Considering the fact that oxygen analogue compounds are of high toxicity and the fact that no specific information on the toxicological significance of this compound is available, it was concluded to include phosmet oxon in the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring purposes. However, pending on the outcome of the study aimed to address the relative potency of phosmet oxon in comparison with the parent compound, it might be necessary to reconsider the residue definitions. Supervised residue trials in oranges, apples and potatoes have been submitted, which allow the proposal of the following MRLs: oranges and pome fruit: 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, potatoes: 0.02* mg/ kg. No MRLs are proposed for other citrus fruit as the available trials in oranges are not suitable for extrapolation to the whole crop group.
   Supervised residue trials in oranges, apples and potatoes have been submitted, which allow the proposal of the following MRLs: oranges and pome fruit: 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, potatoes: 0.02* mg/kg. No MRLs are proposed for other citrus fruit as the available trials in oranges are not suitable for extrapolation to the whole crop group.
   The effects of processing on the nature and the level of residues were investigated. Under conditions simulating pasteurisation, baking/brewing/boiling and sterilisation, phosmet degraded to less toxic compounds or compounds that occurred also in animal metabolism studies. The transfer factors to apple juice, apple pure and canned apples were very low, with residues essentially left in the pomace and peel fractions.
   Studies on succeeding or rotational crops are not required due to the fast degradation of phosmet in soil.
   Livestock can be exposed to residues of phosmet through consumption of fruit pomace and potatoes. Metabolism studies in lactating goat and laying hens demonstrated that phosmet will not occur in animal tissues, milk and eggs when livestock is fed with feed produced according to GAP for the supported use.
   The consumer risk assessment was carried out taking into account chronic and acute exposures according to the provisional residue definition (sum of phosmet and phosmet oxon, expressed as phosmet). The calculations indicate that the exposure will be below the ADI and the ARfD, respectively.
   In aerobic laboratory soil degradation studies (20 degrees C, 21-50% soil maximum water holding capacity) phosmet exhibited low persistence and did not form any major (>10% AR) extractable non volatile soil metabolites. The major sink for the radiolabels used in the experiments was mineralisation to CO2 (5377% applied radioactivity (AR) at 120-150 days). Residue not extracted by acetone /acidified acetone accounted for 17-38% AR at 150 days. In field dissipation studies carried out in the USA phosmet also exhibited low persistence. Under laboratory (23 degrees C) anaerobic soil conditions the major (14.5% AR) metabolite N-hydroxymethyl phthalamic acid was identified.
   Based in the results of laboratory batch adsorption studies phosmet exhibited low mobility being considered immobile in one of the four soils tested. In a BBA guideline lysimeter study carried out in Switzerland that covers the applied for representative uses if applications are made in July, there was no leaching of radioactivity (excluding CO2) in collected leachate samples > 0.06 mu g/L, confirming the results of FOCUS scenario groundwater modelling for parent phosmet and indicating leaching of the soil metabolites that are formed at low levels is unlikely to be significant. All this information indicates, that for the applied for intended uses, the potential for groundwater exposure above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is negligible.
   In laboratory (20 degrees C) natural sediment water systems phosmet both dissipated rapidly by partitioning to sediment and degraded rapidly, resulting in it exhibiting very low persistence. The major (>10% AR) metabolites identified were: phthalamic acid phthalic acid and N-hydroxymethyl phthalimide. Based on the available sterile hydrolysis studies and laboratory aqueous photolysis study O, Odimethylphosphorodithioc acid and O, O-dimethylphosphoric acid may also be formed as major metabolites in natural surface waters. In sediment the only major component of the residue in addition to phosmet was phthalamic acid. All these identified breakdown products were themselves relatively labile. CO2 from the carbonyl radiolabel used in the natural sediment water studies was the major sink for the applied radioactivity (accounting for 80-92% AR at 100 days). FOCUS step 2 to 4 surface water assessments have been completed for parent phosmet (with step 4 just considering spray drift mitigation) but only southern European scenarios and then only early season application timings were simulated. As the applied for representative southern European uses assessed are not restricted to applications only being made later in the growing season, if phosmet is included in annex 1, then southern member states where later season uses are applied for, should carry out national assessments of the potential for surface water exposure and associated aquatic risk assessments from the drainage and runoff routes of entry to surface water, as it is not clear that the available EU level assessment covers these situations. Also the current assessment identifies that for the early season application southern European scenarios assessed, only 1 scenario for each crop (D6 potatoes, R4 citrus and pome fruit), represented a low risk to aquatic organisms without mitigation to reduce runoff input to surface water being considered. For all other geoclimatic situations assessed high risk was identified when only the spray drift risk was mitigated.
   A high acute risk to insectivorous birds was identified for all evaluated uses and also for herbivorous birds in potatoes. The initially identified high long-term risk to birds for all evaluated uses was reassessed based on measured residues in insects and grass. The refined long-term TER values for birds are above the Annex VI trigger. For a generic herbivorous mammal a potential high long-term risk was identified for all uses. The refined assessment based on selected focal mammalian species needs to be further justified.
   Phosmet is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Since data on acute toxicity to seven fish species are available the safety factor was lowered from 100 to 20. Risk mitigation measures to reduce spray drift input corresponding to 40 m in orchards and 20 m in potatoes are needed in order to meet this trigger for one FOCUS scenario in each crop. Based on data from an available mesocosm study, the same buffer zones will also be sufficient to protect aquatic invertebrates in southern Europe in case of early application for one FOCUS scenario in each crop. The risk assessment for the aquatic environment needs to be complemented with scenarios for later in the season, when drainage and runoff routes of entry are likely to contribute to the concentration in surface water from the assessed uses in southern Europe.
   Phosmet is very toxic to bees. The high risk needs to be managed at Member State level. Application should be avoided when there are likely to be any bees in the crop and a withholding period needs to be established. The risk to non-target arthropods is high. A potential for in-field recolonisation has been demonstrated, however further data is required to address the impact off-field and the potential for recolonisation from off-field areas.
   The risk to earthworms, other non-target soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.

AB  - Oysters have been an important resource in Washington state since the mid 1800s and are intimately associated with recent history of the Willapa Bay estuary, just as they have defined social culture around much larger U.S. east coast systems. The Willapa Bay oyster reserves were set aside in 1890 to preserve stocks of the native oyster Ostrea lurida in this estuary, but these stocks were overfished and replaced with the introduced Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas during the late 1920s. Pacific oysters have spawned and set naturally in this estuary on a fairly regular basis since that time, and have formed the basis of a sustainable fishery established on state oyster reserves. The fishery is managed as an annual sale of oysters to private aquaculture interests. Oysters are harvested mostly by hand from intertidal tracts, usually moved to better growing areas closer to the estuary mouth, and shell is required to be returned to the reserves to perpetuate the fishery. Although oyster harvest for human consumption will remain an important social management goal, these bivalves have been shown to provide a suite of other ecosystem functions and services. A survey of the reserves suggests that they represent 11.2% of the intertidal habitat in Willapa Bay and cover substantial subtidal areas as well. A comparison with historical maps suggests that most of the low intertidal area in the reserves formerly populated by native oysters is now covered primarily with eelgrass (Zostera marina), which potentially serves as important habitat for numerous other organisms, including juvenile salmon. Dungeness crab, and migratory waterfowl like black Brant. Native oysters can still potentially be restored to some of these areas, but the value of both introduced oysters and eelgrass as habitat and ecosystem engineers also deserves attention, and the reserves provide an excellent place to elucidate the role of these additional conservation targets at the landscape scale.

AB  - Triflumuron is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/ 2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation ( EC) No 1095/2007(4). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triflumuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 28 February 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 30 September 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 194).
   Following the Commission Decision of 16 March 2009 (2009/241/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of triflumuron in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Bayer CropScience AG made a resubmission application for the inclusion of triflumuron in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues and concerns identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/146/08) as follows:
   The risk to consumers
   The risk to aquatic organisms.
   The acute toxicity of metabolite M07.
   The lack of data to determine an appropriate residue definition.
   The lack of data on the levels of residues in processed commodities.
   The high risk to the aquatic environment
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Italy, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 5 March 2010.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 10 March 2010 and 11 March 2010 respectively. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 26 April 2010.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to deliver its conclusions on triflumuron.
   The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on apples, pears, peaches and nectarines. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Alsystin SC 480", a suspension concentrate (SC), containing 480 g/l triflumuron.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.
   Sufficient data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Data for the relevant impurity 4-trifluoro-methoxyaniline are missing.
   With regard to its toxicological properties, triflumuron is extensively absorbed after oral administration and has a low acute toxicity. The main adverse effect after repeated administration is haemolytic anaemia with compensative responses and secondary effects in different organs. No mutagenic or carcinogenic potential has been demonstrated in the available tests. In the reproductive toxicity testing, no specific effects on the fertility parameters, on the growth of the offspring or on the foetal development were observed in the absence of maternal toxicity. It was agreed that triflumuron has no specific neurotoxic potential.
   Several tests were performed on metabolites and/or impurities. The plant metabolites M01, M02, M07 and M08 were considered as covered by the toxicological studies with the parent (use of the same acceptable daily intake). Since it was shown to be acutely more toxic than triflumuron, new toxicological data were provided for the plant metabolite M07 during the resubmission, allowing the derivation of a specific acute reference dose.
   The agreed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for triflumuron is 0.014 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 1-year dog study supported by the 2-year rat study and with the use of a safety factor of 100. The agreed Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.036 mg/kg bw/day, based on the overall NOAEL of the 90-day rat studies and applying a safety factor of 100. The derivation of an Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not considered needed for triflumuron.
   The agreed dermal absorption values resulting from in vivo and in vitro testing are 1% for the concentrate (mixing/loading) and 5% for the dilution (application). The estimated operator exposure levels according to the models are below the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment, and the estimated exposure values for the workers and bystanders are even lower.
   The plant metabolism of triflumuron was investigated in apple, tomato, potato and soya bean. Triflumuron was seen to be the major component of the residues in all plant groups investigated. Therefore, the residue definition for monitoring was proposed as triflumuron alone. For the fruit crop group, since no metabolite was detected in significant levels in the metabolism studies conducted on apple and tomato, triflumuron alone was also proposed to define the residue for risk assessment. For the oilseed and root crop groups, metabolites M07 and M08 were, in addition to the parent, included in the definition for risk assessment. Sufficient supervised residue trials were submitted to derive MRL on pome fruit, peaches and nectarines. Processing factors were calculated for processed fruit commodities, and additional studies on apples and peaches confirmed that metabolites M07 and M08 are not expected to be present above the LOQ in processed fractions. However a data gap was identified for peaches, asking for supplementary information on the initial residue levels in the raw products, prior processing. It was concluded that, based on the representative uses, no MRLs are necessary for products of animal origin. No chronic risk was identified for the consumers, the highest TMDI being 46% of the ADI. The acute risk was not considered since no ARfD was allocated to triflumuron.
   Triflumuron is low to moderate persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions. Two major metabolites are formed: 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl urea. The trifluoromethoxyphenyl ring was less mineralized and more prone to form unextractable residues than the chlorophenyl ring.
   From the data available it was not possible to derive reliable half-lives either for parent or for major soil metabolites under anaerobic conditions. Metabolites M02 (max 46.7 % AR) and M08 (max. 48.5 % AR) were the only major metabolites identified under dark anaerobic conditions. According the study available, triflumuron may be considered stable to photolysis in soil.
   PECs soil have been updated in the Additional Report.
   According to the available adsorption / desorption studies triflumuron may be considered immobile to low mobile in soil (Koc = 1629 - 30006 mL/g), metabolite M08 may be considered medium to high mobile in soil (Koc = 113 - 280 mL/g) and M02 may be considered very high mobile in soil (Koc = 4.0 - 8.8 mL/g).
   Triflumuron was stable to hydrolysis at pH 5 and 7 and degrades with a half-life between 29 and 57 d at pH 9. Main hydrolysis metabolites at this pH were M02 (max. 28.9 % AR after 30 d) and M08 (max. 48.8 % AR after 30 d). According to the available study, aqueous photolysis is considered to contribute only in a minor extent to the overall degradation of triflumuron. In the absence of a corresponding study, it is proposed to classify triflumuron as not readily biodegradable.
   In water sediment systems triflumuron partitioned to the sediment and degraded (DT50 = 4.1 - 7.1 d) to major metabolites M08 (max in water: 47.8 % AR after 14 d, max. in sed.: 20.4 % AR after 7 d; DT50 = 11.4 - 11.7 d) and M02 (max in water: 60.4 % AR after 14 d, max. in sed.: 7.9 % AR after 14 d; DT50 = 17.6 - 62.9 d). Mineralization was more important for the chlorophenyl ring than for the trifluoromethoxyphenyl moiety. The pH of the water phase of the systems investigated was in the alkaline range. A data gap, which was not considered essential to finalize the EU risk assessment, was identified for water / sediment studies within a wider range of pH values.
   Updated PEC (SW/SED) were presented in the resubmission dossier following the FOCUS SW scheme. New calculations have been presented in the Addendum to the Additional Report. Only the Step 4 calculations taking into account 95% mitigation for spray drift have been retained for the assessment.
   PEC GW calculations have been updated with FOCUS PELMO 3.3.2 and FOCUS PEARL 3.3.3 to the current GAP and with the new degradation data available. Neither the parent triflumuron nor the two soil metabolites 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl urea are expected to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L for any of the relevant scenarios.
   Based on the physical and chemical properties of triflumuron, the volatilization study available and the calculated photochemical half-life for triflumuron, it is expected that it will not be transported over long range distances and will not accumulate in air.
   The first-tier risk assessment for birds resulted in acute and short-term TERs above the Annex VI trigger of 10 but the long-term TER was below the trigger of 5. The refined long-term risk assessment was based on blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) as a focal species. A PT of 0.61 and a RUD of 5.1 ( birds feeding only on large insects) were suggested to refine the risk assessment. The experts rejected the RUD refinement since no data supported the assumption that blue tits would feed only on large insects. The long-term TER was below the trigger of 5 on the basis of the agreed refinement steps and the revised long-term NOEC of 20 ppm. Therefore a data gap was identified in the expert meeting. The refinements suggested by the applicant and evaluated by the RMS in the Additional Report were not accepted and therefore the data gap remains.
   The acute and long-term trigger values for mammals were exceeded in the first-tier risk assessment indicating a low risk. The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm- and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low.
   Triflumuron was very toxic to aquatic invertebrates. The acute and chronic TERs for daphnids were significantly below the Annex VI triggers of 100 and 10 for all FOCUS step 4 scenarios with a no-spray buffer zone of 30 m. A mesocosm study was submitted. The experts agreed on a regulatory endpoint of 0.1 mu g a.s./L in combination with an assessment factor of 3. A no-spray buffer zone of 30 m would not be sufficient to achieve TERs >3. Further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment is needed. New FOCUS step 4 calculations including the maximum spray drift reduction of 95% did not result in a FOCUS scenario where all TERs exceeded the trigger of 3 (applied to a mesocosm NOAEC of 0.1 mu g a.s./L). A high risk to the aquatic environment is indicated.
   The risk to adult bees was low but bee brood was very sensitive for exposure to triflumuron (insect growth regulator). Exposure of bees was considered to take place via flowering weeds in the orchards. Increased mortality of pupae was observed at an application rate relevant for exposure on weeds. It was further noted that the second application was not covered by the field studies. It was not sufficiently demonstrated that the risk to bee brood development was low and risk mitigation measures such as cutting flowering weeds in the treated field were suggested to protect bees. Chrysoperla carnea was the most sensitive non-target arthropod species tested. This observation was confirmed in a field study in an apple orchard. Full recovery of affected arthropod populations (including the most sensitive species C. carnea) was observed. The study provided some evidence that a sufficiently high number of Chrysoperla larvae could survive in the untreated area to allow recolonisation of the treated in-field area. Overall it was concluded that the risk to non-target arthropods was sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. Since triflumuron inhibits the chitin synthesis the experts considered the potential adverse long-term effects on earthworms necessary to be investigated and therefore a data gap was identified under the first review. For the resubmission, a long-term (reproduction) study with earthworms was submitted and the long-term risk to earthworms was evaluated as low. No studies with other soil non-target macro-organisms were made available for triflumuron under the first review. The experts agreed in the meeting that studies with collembola should be conducted considering the high toxicity to arthropods and that the DT90 can be longer than 100 days under some soil conditions. For the resubmission, new soil degradation studies were made available which indicated that the DT90 is less than 100 days and therefore a study with collembola was not triggered any longer.
   The risk to soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Flurochloridone is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 1 le, to withdraw support for the inclusion of flurochloridone in Annex Ito Council Directive 91/414/EEC.
   Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC)5 concerning the non inclusion of flurochloridone in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Makhteshim made a resubmission application for the inclusion of flurochloridone in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR.
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Spain being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 03 November 2009.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 10 November 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 05 January 2010.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the area of toxicology and deliver its conclusions on flurochloridone.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of flurochloridone as a herbicide on sunflower and potato as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   No critical areas of concern were indentified in the physical chemical properties section, however several data gaps were identified for the active substance and formulation (see section 1).
   A data gap was identified in the toxicology section to address the relevance of the impurities present in the technical specification. No toxicological information is available on the metabolite R42819 that may be found in groundwater at levels above the threshold value of 0.1 mu g/L according to environmental models; based on the classification proposal as R61 (Repr. Cat. 2, "May cause harm to the unborn child") and R62 (Repr. Cat. 3, "Possible risk of impaired fertility") for the parent, this metabolite is relevant according to the Guidance document on assessment of the relevance of metabolites in groundwater (European Commission, 2003) and a critical area of concern was identified.
   Based on the metabolism studies conducted on sunflower and potato (oilseeds/pulses group and tubers/roots group), the residue for monitoring and risk assessment was defined as flurochloridone (sum of cis and trans isomers). MRLs were proposed at the LOQ (0.01 mg/kg). No risk was identified for the consumers, the TMDI and IESTI being less than 0.1% of the ADI and less than 4% of the ARfD.
   The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses. A high potential for groundwater contamination by metabolite R42819 in a wide range of geoclimatic conditions above the parametric drinking water limit (0.1 mu g/L) is indicated by the exposure assessment that could be finalised with the available data. (All the FOCUS groundwater scenarios pertinent for sunflower and 7 of the 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios pertinent for potato have annual average groundwater recharge concentrations predicted to be >0.1 mu g/L).
   Two data gaps were identified in the environmental risk assessment to address the potential risk to birds and fish from flurochloridone acting as endocrine disruptor and to address the risk to algae for the representative uses.
   The risk to non -target plants was assessed as low for the representative uses, based on mitigation measures equivalent to no-spray buffer zones of 5 m.

AB  - Dithianon is one of the 79 substances of the third stage part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by Greece, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of dithianon in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC.
   Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of dithianon in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant BASF SE made a resubmission application for the inclusion of dithianon in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR.
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Greece, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 27 January 2010.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 1 February 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 18 March 2010.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology and ecotoxicology and to deliver its conclusions on dithianon.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of dithianon as a fungicide on pome fruit and table and wine grapes as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   No critical areas of concern were identified in the area of identity, and physical and chemical properties, however several data gaps were identified.
   A data gap was identified in the mammalian toxicology section for the submission of a new valid Comet assay.
   An acute consumer intake concern was identified for table grapes (149% of the ARfD). Given the identified areas of uncertainty regarding the storage stability of dithianon incurred residues in pome fruit and grape wine and the nature of the residues in processed products under standard hydrolytic conditions, the consumer risk assessment can only be considered as provisional at this stage, and the potential for exceedance of the ADI (grapes and pome fruit) and the ARfD (pome fruit) cannot be excluded.
   With regard to environmental fate and behaviour, information is lacking regarding the route of aerobic degradation, and specifically the quantification/identification of the unidentified soil transformation products formed in two aerobic soil degradation studies that would trigger a further exposure assessment in the environmental compartments. Although anaerobic conditions are unlikely to occur under the representative uses, a complete assessment of the degradation pathway of dithianon in soil under anaerobic conditions is not available. As a consequence of the lack of information on reliable soil degradation rates for the major soil photolysis degradation product phthalic acid, data gaps were identified for surface water and groundwater exposure assessments for this photodegradation product. A data gap was also identified for an aquatic exposure assessment for the major aqueous photolysis degradation products phthalaldehyde and 1,2-benzenedimethanol.
   A high long-term risk for insectivorous birds was identified for all representative uses, even though several options for refinement and ecological data were taken into account. Therefore a critical area of concern and a data gap are identified. The long-term risk for herbivorous mammals was assessed as low on the basis of ecological data and further refinements. Dithianon is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The risk was assessed as low for fish and invertebrates for the representative use on grapes at FOCUSsw step 4, including drift and run-off mitigation measures and refined toxicity endpoints. However, the risk for fish (chronic) and invertebrates (acute) was assessed as high for the representative use on pome fruit and a data gap was identified. Data gaps were also identified to further address the risk to soil and aquatic organisms for the soil and aqueous photodegradation product phthalic acid, and the risk to aquatic organisms for the aqueous photodegradation products phthalaldehyde and 1,2-benzenedimethanol. The acute risk to fish for the metabolite CL 1017911 could not be finalised. Further assessment at FOCUS step 3 is needed.

The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of paclobutrazol in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC.
   Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC) 5 concerning the non-inclusion of paclobutrazol in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Syngenta Crop Protection AG made a resubmission application for the inclusion of paclobutrazol in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008.6 The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR.
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the United Kingdom, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 28 January 2010.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 29 January 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 15 March 2010.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on paclobutrazol.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use of paclobutrazol as a plant growth regulator on winter oilseed rape, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative use can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   Data gaps were identified in the section on identity and analytical methods.
   No data gaps were identified for the representative use in the section on mammalian toxicology.
   Based on the metabolism study conducted on rapeseed, the residue definition for monitoring was limited by default, to the parent paclobutrazol only and two separate definitions were proposed for risk assessment 1) paclobutrazol and 2) triazole derivative metabolites (provisional, pending the definition of a global and harmonized approach for all compounds of the triazole chemical class). A data gap to address the possible residue levels of the TDM metabolites in primary crop, rotational crops and in animal matrices was identified, as these metabolites were detected in significant proportions in the primary and rotational crop metabolism studies.
   The data available on fate and behaviour in the environment are essentially sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative use. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative use by paclobutrazol above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be high in geoclimatic situations that are represented by one of the relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios, while for all other scenarios it was concluded to be low. The potential for groundwater exposure regarding soil metabolites was concluded to be low over a wide range of geoclimatic conditions represented by the FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   Two data gaps were identified in the ecotoxicology section. Further information was required to address the potential endocrine disrupting properties of paclobutrazol to fish. Information on the toxicity and/or on the degradation in the environment of the two isomers is needed to finalise the aquatic risk assessment for the representative use evaluated in geoclimatic situations represented by the FOCUSsw scenarios D2, D3, D4, R1, R2 and R3. A high risk to aquatic organisms was identified from paclobutrazol and CGA149907 with a worst case assumption regarding the toxicity and exposure pattern of the enantiomers.

In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by France, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of fluazifop-P in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC.
   Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of fluazifop-P in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Syngenta Crop Protection AG made a resubmission application for the inclusion of fluazifop-P in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR.
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, France, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 19 February 2010.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 22 February 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 8 April 2010.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology and ecotoxicology and to deliver its conclusions on fluazifop-P.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of fluazifop-P-butyl as a herbicide on pome fruit, pea (green without pod), bean (green with pod), pulses (dry pea and dry bean), potato, and oilseed rape as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   No critical areas of concerns or data gaps were identified in the section identity, physical and chemical properties and analytical methods.
   The technical specification is not supported by the batches used in the toxicological studies and a data gap and a critical area of concern have been identified. Further data are needed to address the toxicological relevance of the impurity R154719 and a data gap was identified. The groundwater metabolite Compound X is considered to be a relevant metabolite for toxicology. As Compound X is considered to be a relevant metabolite for leafy crops, further data are needed to conclude on its toxicological properties and a data gap is identified.
   Additional data are required to confirm that residues do not concentrate during processing for peas (green without pods), beans (green with pods) and pulses (dry peas and dry beans). Supervised residue trials are also required to confirm the no-residue situation in pome fruit in Southern Europe. Since Compound X has to be considered as a relevant metabolite for leafy crops rotated with the representative uses (except for pome fruit), and given the lack of information on the toxicological properties of Compound X, the consumer risk assessment could not be finalised and was limited to the sum of all the constituent isomers of fluazifop, its esters and its conjugates expressed as fluazifop (sum of isomers) only.
   The data available on fate and behaviour in the environment were considered insufficient to carry out a complete environmental exposure assessment at the EU level for the representative uses. Several data gaps were identified for further investigation of the route of degradation of fluazifop-P-butyl in the environment, and for more reliable data for the properties of the metabolites Compound X and Compound IV. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by the metabolite Compound X above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be high in geoclimatic situations that are represented by the relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios. This was identified as a critical area of concern. A data gap was identified for a reliable estimation of the leaching potential of Compound IV.
   A data gap was identified to further address the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals for the representative uses on pome fruit, peas and beans. A data gap was also identified to further address the risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates for the metabolite Compound IV in the water phase for all representative uses. Mitigation measures comparable to in-field no-spray buffer zones up to 10m were necessary to protect terrestrial non-target plants.

AB  - Dicloran is one of the 79 substances of the third stage part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/20074. In accordance with Article 10(1) of the Regulation, Spain, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), provided an initial evaluation of dicloran in the format of a Draft Assessment Report (DAR), which was received by the EFSA on 22 July 2005. The Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission') examined dicloran in accordance with Article 11a of the Regulation and it was concluded that there were clear indications of harmful effects, leading to the adoption of a decision on non-inclusion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC, in accordance with Articles 11f and 12 of the Regulation.
   Following the Commission Decision of 18 September 2008 (2008/744/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of dicloran in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Gowan Comercio Internacional e Servicos, Limitada (Margarita International) made a resubmission application for the inclusion of dicloran in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/1340/08 - rev.0).
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Spain, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 6 October 2009.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 8 October 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 30 November 2009.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology and fate and behaviour in the environment, and deliver its conclusions on dicloran.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of dicloran as a fungicide on tomatoes, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   There are no critical areas of concern in the physical-chemical properties section. Data gaps are identified in relation to relevant impurities.
   Two critical areas of concern are identified in the section for mammalian toxicology: the compliance of batches tested in the data package submitted compared to the proposed specification could not be proven, and the estimated exposure for re-entry workers exceeds the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL), even with the use of personal protective equipment.
   In the residues area, for the specific use on tomatoes, the pertinent issues for consumer risk assessment have been reasonably addressed for the primary crop. For rotational crops and food of animal origin further consideration is necessary. Further data are required to confirm residue levels in following crops, including fruit crops. A risk assessment considering residues in following crops and in animal commodities is required. The implications for the consumer risk assessment are currently unknown.
   The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses. However, the characterisation/identification of a fraction of unidentified degradates formed in the aqueous photolysis study was not available. The potential for groundwater contamination by dicloran above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L consequent to the representative uses was assessed as low.
   The risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for the representative use on glasshouse tomatoes. Risk mitigation is required to address the risk to aquatic organisms for FOCUSsw scenario R2 and R3 for the representative use on outdoor tomatoes. It was not possible to identify a low risk for fish and invertebrates in the additional (relevant) FOCUSsw scenario R4 and D6, based on the data available. It was not possible to finalise the risk assessment for aquatic organisms from exposure to photodegradates of dicloran, based on the data available, for any of the representative uses. It remains to be verified whether the mixtures of photodegradates tested on fish, daphnia and algae are representative for field situations. It was not possible to finalise the risk assessment for non-target soil macro-invertebrates for the field use on tomatoes, based on the data available. The risk to birds, mammals, bees, earthworms, non-target soil micro-organisms, non-target plants, and the function of waste water treatment plants was assessed as low for the representative uses on tomatoes.

AB  - Buprofezin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR for buprofezin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 7 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 2 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Nihon Nohyaku Co. Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May -June 2007 and in December 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with Member States in February -March 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion fmalised on 3 March 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 128).
   Following the Commission Decision of 30 September 2008 (2008/771/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of buprofezin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Nihon Nohyaku Co. Ltd made a resubmission application for the inclusion of buprofezin in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/110/08 -rev. final) as follows:
   the information available was insufficient to satisfy the requirements set out in Annex II and Annex III Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to:
   the substantial lack of data to assess the consumer exposure, which is regarded as inconclusive
   the substantial lack of data to assess the risk to soil-dwelling macro-organisms and concerns were identified with regard to:
   the consumer exposure
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the United Kingdom, being the designated RMS in the resubmission procedure, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 21 August 2009.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 24 August 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 8 October 2009.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to deliver its conclusions on buprofezin.
   The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on tomatoes, lettuce and citrus. The conclusions of the resubmission were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of buprofezin as an insecticide and acaricide on tomatoes, lettuce and citrus, with a modification for the use on lettuce only. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, Applaud 25 WP", a wettable powder formulation (WP).
   Sufficient analytical methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor buprofezin residues in all matrices.
   In mammals, the acute oral, dermal or inhalation toxicity of buprofezin is low (oral and dermal LD5 0 > 2000 mg/kg bw, LC50 4.57 mg/L air/4h). Buprofezin is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a skin sensitiser.
   Target organs in subchronic and chronic studies are the liver and thyroid, showing increased weight, and histological and clinical chemistry findings. The relevant short-term NOAEL in rats is 13 mg/kg bw/day, while in dogs the relevant NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant long-term toxicity NOAEL in rats is 0.9 mg/kg bw/day, while in mice it is 1.82 mg/kg bw/day.
   The genotoxicity of buprofezin was discussed in an opinion of the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) based on a new micronucleus test in the bone marrow of mouse, showing the induction of micronuclei in the erythrocytes of mouse bone marrow when administered by oral gavage, once daily, for two consecutive days. The Panel considered buprofezin non-genotoxic, and the in vivo micronucleus test on bone marrow as not interpretable. The PPR Panel re-evaluated also the long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity studies on buprofezin and concluded that buprofezin is not carcinogenic in rats or mice.
   Buprofezin did not show any reproductive toxicity potential: the relevant parental and offspring NOAELs are 6.46 mg/kg bw/day and 9.21 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The reproductive NOAEL is 66 mg/kg bw/day. As for teratogenicity studies, overall, the NOAEL for both maternal and foetal effects is 50 mg/kg bw/day (based on decreased food consumption and increased water intake, and decreased foetal weight, skeletal effects and subcutaneous oedema, respectively). It was agreed not to propose any classification.
   Buprofezin does not have potential to induce neurotoxicity in mammals.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day is based on the relevant NOAEL of 0.9 mg/kg bw/day from the 24-month study in rats, with a safety factor of 100. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level is 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, based on a NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100 and a correction for oral absorption of 40 %. The Acute Reference Dose is 0.5 mg/kg bw, based on the NOAEL from the developmental toxicity study and applying a safety factor of 100.
   The operator exposure was below the AOEL for tractor-mounted spraying with personal protective equipment (PPE) for tomatoes and citrus, calculated with the German model. For hand-held application, the exposure was below the AOEL with PPE for tomatoes outdoors (UK-POEM). The exposure was below the AOEL with PPE/RPE for hand-held application for tomatoes and lettuce in glasshouse (Dutch model), and for hand-held application in citrus (German model). For bystanders the estimated exposure levels were below the AOEL (< 15%), for both field applications on tomatoes and citrus; bystander exposure for application in greenhouses is unlikely. The worker exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL with gloves when handling tomatoes or lettuce in glasshouse, or tomatoes outdoors. However, the exposure was above the AOEL even with gloves when handling citrus.
   The metabolism of buprofezin in plants has been elucidated in three plant groups (fruit crops, leafy crops and oilseed/pulse crops). The parent compound is the major constituent of the final residue, accounting for 47 -89 % of the TRR for pre-harvest intervals (PHIs) < 27 days. The residues in plants are mainly composed of the parent compound and the sugar conjugates of the metabolite BF4, which are identified as BF9 and BF12 under acidic analysis conditions, or as BF26 when the analytical procedures include neutral or alkaline steps. Therefore, the residues were defined as, buprofezinY' only for monitoring, and as, sum of buprofezin and BF4 conjugates analysed as BF9 and BF 12 under acidic hydrolysis and expressed as buprofezin" for risk assessment. Maximum residue limits (MRLs) are proposed for tomatoes and citrus, however a complete residue data set is requested for all representative uses in order to derive appropriate conversion factors (CF) for risk assessment, and to propose an MRL for indoor lettuce. Provisionally, and based on the metabolism studies, a CF of 1.5 is proposed for fruit crops.
   Based on new studies, processing factors are proposed for citrus and tomato. However, a data gap is identified concerning the possible transfer of the metabolite aniline, especially in processed fractions subject to pasteurisation or sterilisation.
   A potential transfer of residues to rotational crops has been noted. Based on the representative uses, no residues are expected in animal commodities, and no residue definitions and MRL are proposed for products of animal origin.
   Even if the toxicological profile of some metabolites is not fully addressed, with some of them considered to be of similar or of higher toxicity than the parent compound, the consumer risk assessment gives sufficient margin to conclude on the absence of chronic or acute concerns for the consumer, with the refined calculated intakes being below 10 % of the toxicological reference values. It should be noted that lettuce was not considered in this assessment, since the residue trials were not performed according to the critical GAP and are not appropriate to propose an MRL for this crop. In addition, the assessment for tomatoes and citrus has to be considered provisional, pending the submission of new residue trials on tomatoes and citrus in order to derive sound conversion factors for risk assessment.
   In soil under aerobic conditions buprofezin exhibits medium to high persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 19-51 % applied radioactivity (AR) after 90 -98 days.
   The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 23-33 % AR after 90-98 days. Only minor (< 5% AR) metabolites were formed. Buprofezin exhibits slight mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of buprofezin was pH dependent.
   In dark natural sediment water systems buprofezin degraded exhibiting moderate persistence in both water and sediment, forming the metabolite BF 10 in water (max. 12 % AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance, accounting for a maximum of 18 % AR at 91 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 14-15 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out (including some updated calculations for sediment presented in the Additional Report), using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for buprofezin at steps 1-3 for tomatoes, and steps 1-4 for citrus, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolite BF10 appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by buprofezin above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 gg/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   The acute and long-term risk to birds and mammals from the representative uses of buprofezin was assessed as low. The risk assessment for small herbivorous mammals in citrus plantations assumed an interception rate of 70 %, resulting in a TER value that exceeded the Annex VI trigger value. A low risk was also identified for birds and mammals exposed via the ingestion of contaminated earthworms or fish, or via contaminated drinking water.
   Buprofezin is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Low risk was identified from the use of buprofezin on tomatoes. However, the application in citrus plantations requires a no-spray-buffer zone of 21 metres when applied adjacent to edge-of-field water courses. The risk to sediment-dwelling organisms was assessed as low from the representative field uses of buprofezin. Buprofezin is not considered to bioaccumulate in fish.
   Low risk was identified for all other non-target organisms.

AB  - Napropamide is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on napropamide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 September 2005. The peer review was initiated on 17 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant United Phosphorus. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in April - May 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February - March 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 26 March 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 140).
   Following the Commission Decision of 7 November 2008 (2008/902/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of napropamide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant United Phosphorus made a resubmission application for the inclusion of napropamide in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/112/08) as follows:
   Leaching of metabolites to groundwater
   The minimum purity can not be concluded The impurity specification can not be concluded
   and concerns were identified with regard to:
   Groundwater contamination of the active substance in the Southern EU No risk assessment for aquatic organisms available A potential risk to soil functioning (organic matter breakdown)
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Denmark, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 29 June 2009.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 30 June 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 13 August 2009.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology, and deliver its conclusions on napropamide.
   The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of napropamide as a pre-planting herbicide on head cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, calabrese, tomatoes and oilseed rape. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Devrinol SC 450', a suspension concentrate (SC), registered under different trade names in Europe.
   Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of napropamide. It should be noted that the residue definition for water is not finalised, and therefore further methods could be required in the future.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. In the mammalian metabolism studies, napropamide was rapidly and extensively absorbed (> 90 %), and widely distributed. Extensive metabolism and enterohepatic circulation were observed as biliary excretion was a major pathway, and then excretion was rapid through urine and faeces. Fifteen metabolites were identified, and only < 0.5 % of the dose was recovered as the parent compound.
   Napropamide has low acute toxicity, and no classification is proposed related to acute toxicity testing including irritancy and sensitisation. The critical effect observed in short-term and long-term studies was decreased body weight. Two out of six in vitro gene mutation assays showed positive effects, as well as one weak positive effect was observed for DNA damage and repair in mammalian cells out of five chromosomal tests, but the three in vivo tests were all negative. Overall, no genotoxic potential is attributed to napropamide. No potential for carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed. No adverse effects on fertility or on reproductive parameters were observed, except for a higher abortion rate at maternally toxic doses in rabbits, which could not be ruled out as being a substance-related effect. No foetotoxicity or teratogenicity was evidenced. The relevant short-term NOAEL was the dose level of 50 mg/kg bw/day from the 1-year oral toxicity study in dogs and the 90-day oral study in rats, and the overall relevant long-term NOAEL was set at 30 mg/kg bw/day derived from both 2-year rat studies. The toxicological hazard assessment of the metabolite NOPA according to the guidance document on the relevance of metabolites in groundwater, using the available data, indicates that this metabolite is not relevant, and that the ADI of the parent compound is applicable to this metabolite if groundwater concentrations would exceed the trigger value of 0.75 mu g/L.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of napropamide is set at 0.3 mg/kg bw/day, based on the long-term rat studies and applying a safety factor of 100; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 1-year dog study and a safety factor of 100. No acute reference dose (ARfD) is allocated.
   The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL when no personal protective equipment (PPE) is used according to the German model estimates; according to the UK POEM model, operator exposure is below the AOEL when gloves are worn during mixing/loading and application. No risk is anticipated for workers or bystanders.
   Napropamide is extensively metabolised in plants. More than 10 metabolites have been identified, but their individual concentration levels are not expected to exceed 0.01 mg/kg. Considering the low consumer exposure and the toxicological profile of the compound, the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring is proposed to be restricted to the parent compound only. Supervised residue trials confirmed that maximum residue limits (MRLs) can be set at the analytical limit of quantification (0.01* mg/kg) for all representative uses. Investigation of the effect of processing on residues is not needed. Livestock exposure is minimal, and a residue definition for animal commodities is not necessary. A potential transfer of soil residues of napropamide above 0.01 mg/kg is present for root crops for plant back intervals up to 180 days. No risk for the consumer resulting from the presence of napropamide residues in plant commodities has been identified. However, the consumer exposure to the metabolite NOPA present in drinking water could not be finalised, as the assessment of the levels that might be present in groundwater is not finalised.
   In soil under aerobic conditions napropamide exhibits moderate to very high persistence, forming the minor non-transient soil metabolite NOPA (accounting for a maximum of 5.78% of the applied radioactivity (AR) in 30 degrees C incubations and 1.1% AR in 20 degrees C incubations), which exhibits low persistence. It should be noted that the database is limited, and further data are necessary to further clarify the persistence of napropamide (southern European field studies). Mineralisation of the 1-naphthyl radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for only 5% AR after 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 12.7-14.7 % AR after 90 days. Napropamide exhibits medium to low mobility in soil, while metabolite NOPA exhibits high mobility in soil. The adsorption behaviour of NOPA was pH dependant (lower adsorption as soil pH increased).
   In dark natural sediment water systems napropamide partitioned relatively slowly from water to sediment where it degraded, exhibiting high to very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance, accounting for a maximum of 3.6 % AR at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were the major sink, representing 11-19 % AR at study end. In a laboratory aqueous photolysis study napropamide was photolysed to 4 major metabolites (all identified). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments (including the potential for accumulation in sediment) using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach are available.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by napropamide above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low under the geoclimatic situations that are represented by all the FOCUS groundwater scenarios. For the metabolite NOPA further assessment is required to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment. However, based on the available simulations, that use too favourable input parameters, it is clear that a groundwater non-relevance assessment is triggered, and NOPA concentrations will be > 0.75 mu g/L. From the mammalian toxicological point of view, sufficient information is available to conclude on the nonrelevance of NOPA. However, a consumer risk assessment would be required before a conclusion on groundwater non-relevance of NOPA could be finalised, and this requires the estimates of potential levels in groundwater to be finalised.
   The risk to birds was assessed as low for all representative uses. The first-tier long-term TER value of 4.5 was below the trigger of 5 for the use on tomatoes. It was agreed that the risk to insectivorous birds is likely to be low, because the end point (NOEC reproduction) is based on the highest tested dose, and that a certain proportion of the insect prey would consist of large insects (lower residues compared to small insects). The risk to earthworm-eating and fish-eating birds from secondary poisoning was assessed as low.
   The risk to mammals is considered to be low for the representative uses. The long-term TERs for insectivorous mammals and earthworm-eating mammals were below the trigger of 5 for the use in southern Europe (tomatoes). The submitted information gave some indication that the proportion of time spent feeding in the treated area (PT) is likely to be considerably lower than assumed in the firsttier risk assessment. In a weight of evidence approach it was agreed that the risk to insectivorous and earthworm-eating mammals is low. The risk from plant metabolites was considered to be addressed by the risk assessment for the parent napropamide.
   Napropamide is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The risk assessment for aquatic organisms is driven by the toxicity to Lemna gibba. The refinement based on a study containing sediment in the test system was not accepted by the experts in the PRAPeR 33 meeting. The end points to be used in the risk assessment were discussed, since several studies with Lemna species and different aquatic invertebrate species were available. The experts suggested using in the aquatic risk assessment the end point of 0.067 mg a.s./L, and a geometric mean value of 5.4 mg a.s./L, for macrophytes and invertebrates, respectively. The risk to aquatic organisms (excluding rooted aquatic macrophytes) was assessed as low based on FOCUS step 3 PECsw values for the representative use on brassicas. Two full FOCUS scenarios out of 6 resulted in TER values above the trigger of 10 for Lemna (D4 and R1) for the use on winter oilseed rape, and no full FOCUS scenario resulted in a TER exceeding the trigger of 10 for the use on tomatoes. No major metabolites in surface water were identified in the water/sediment study. However, the experts on environmental fate and behaviour agreed that the parent compound, as well as 5 different photolysis metabolites and NOPA (where groundwater becomes surface water) should be considered for risk assessment. The risk assessment from the metabolite NOPA remains open since the PECgw is not finalised. In addition, data gaps were identified to address the risk to macrophytes rooted in the sediment, and to refine the risk to aquatic organisms for the use in southern Europe (tomatoes), with e.g. FOCUS step 4 calculations.
   The risk of bioconcentration in fish was assessed as low. The risk to earthworms and soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed as low for the uses in northern Europe, but is not finalised for the use in southern Europe. The risk to soil functioning (organic matter breakdown) was assessed as low for northern European uses (brassicas and oilseed rape), but cannot be excluded for the higher application rates for the southern European use on tomatoes.
   The risk to bees, non-target arthropods and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.

AB  - Commission Regulation (EC) No 737/20073 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation') lays down the procedure for the renewal of the inclusion of a first group of active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and establishes the list of those substances. Imazalil is one of the first group of active substances listed in the Regulation.
   In accordance with Article 6 of the Regulation, the notifiers Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Certis Europe B.V., Makhteshim Chemical Works Ltd., AgriChem B.V. and Laboratorios Agrochem S.L. submitted a dossier on imazalil to The Netherlands and Spain, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), and co-rapporteur Member State (co-RMS), respectively.
   In accordance with Article 10 of the Regulation, The Netherlands prepared an Assessment Report in consultation with Spain, which was submitted to the EFSA and the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'). The Assessment Report was received by the EFSA on 9 June 2009.
   In accordance with Article 11 of the Regulation, the EFSA distributed the Assessment Report to Member States and the notifiers for comments on 11 June 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 13 July 2009.
   In accordance with Article 12, following consideration of the Assessment Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange an expert consultation on the Assessment Report as appropriate and deliver its conclusions on imazalil The conclusions presented in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses
   of imazalil as a fungicide on citrus post harvest, protected tomatoes grown on artificial substrate, and as a cereal seed treatment, as proposed by the notifiers. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   There is no agreed specification for imazalil.
   No areas of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicity section. The exposure/risk assessment for re-entry workers (scenario: tomatoes) with regard to the exposure to the individual enantiomers that make up the active substance residue on treated fruit was considered as a data gap. In plants, the residue was defined as imazalil for monitoring and sum of imazalil and metabolite R014821 for risk assessment, although this metabolite is of no concern for the currently supported uses. The residue definition for ruminant matrices could not be finalised and the notifier was asked to propose a residue definition for monitoring including at least the parent imazalil and the metabolites FK284 and/or FK772. No chronic concern was identified with the maximum refined TMDI (IEDI) being 4% of the ADI only. Acute concern can not be totally excluded since the maximum refined IESTI is 92% of the ARfD when calculations are performed using the mean processing factor (0.07) derived for citrus pulp, but 115% of the ARfD for grapefruit (DE, child) and 105% of the ARfD for orange (UK infant) when calculations are performed using the individual processing factors derived for grapefruit (0.13) and for orange (0.08).
   With regard to environmental fate and behaviour, for the representative use as a cereal seed treatment information is missing regarding the route of degradation in soil and natural surface water systems and consequently the groundwater exposure assessment for potential soil metabolites is not finalised. For the representative use on glasshouse tomatoes grown on artificial media, information is missing regarding the route of degradation in natural surface water systems. The assessment of the representative use post harvest on citrus is based on there being no soil or surface water exposure from this use, consequent from appropriate management measures to preclude such exposure being implemented. A data gap was identified to address the long-term risk to granivorous birds and mammals from uses of imazalil as a seed treatment. The potential endocrine disrupting effects of imazalil on fish should be addressed for uses on tomatoes in glasshouses and for seed treatment.
   A data gap was identified to assess the long-term effect of the metabolite R014821 on soil micro-organisms for the use as a seed treatment.

AB  - Oxadiazon is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023.
   Oxadiazon was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 2 July 2008 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.
   Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on oxadiazon in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 11 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 29 March 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Bayer CropScience. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA identifying the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April - May 2009.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2009.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a herbicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprises pre-emergence spraying in sunflower for the control of weeds. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'RONSTAR', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 250 g/L oxadiazon. The minimum purity and specification of the active substance could not be concluded on. Data gaps for vapor pressure, flash point and surface tension were identified.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Oxadiazon residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin can be monitored by the multi-residue method DFG S19. Adequate methods are available to monitor oxadiazon residues in environmental matrices.
   A critical area of concern was highlighted based on the lack of information whether the tested material used in the toxicological studies is representative of the product manufactured and commercialised at present.
   In the mammalian metabolism studies, oxadiazon was moderately rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. No potential for accumulation was observed, the majority of the substance being excreted within 48 hours.
   The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route; no eye or skin irritation was observed, and no potential for skin sensitisation was found in a Magnusson and Kligman test.
   The main target organs of oxadiazon were the liver and the haematopoietic system consistent with oxadiazon's ability to inhibit protoporphyrinogen oxidase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of both haem and chlorophyll. The overall short term no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was 18 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day study in rat.
   Oxadiazon itself did not present genotoxic potential, however a positive Ames test suggested the presence of a mutagenic impurity in the batch tested. The notifier should address the apparent presence of a mutagenic impurity in the technical specification (data gap).
   Liver tumours were observed in both the rat and mouse species; mechanistic studies confirmed that oxadiazon is a peroxisome proliferator. Although peroxisome proliferators are hepatocarcinogens in rodents, the current scientific opinion is that humans are not responsive to this class of non-genotoxic carcinogens and therefore, oxadiazon is unlikely to present a carcinogenic risk to humans. The relevant long term NOAEL was the dose level of 0.36 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study.
   Effects on the reproduction (increase in gestation length and irregular oestrus cycle) were more prominent in a preliminary dose-range finding study to the multigeneration study where total litter losses were observed at ca.30 mg/kg bw/day, as the main study was conducted with much lower dose levels. On this basis a classification with the risk phrase R62 "possible risk of impaired fertility" was proposed. The NOAEL in the main study was 5 mg/kg bw/day for reproduction toxicity while the NOAEL for parental and offspring's toxicity was 15 mg/kg bw/day. In the developmental toxicity studies, the rat presented the more critical (developmental) NOAEL for the risk assessment of 12 mg/kg bw/day.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of oxadiazon is 0.0036 mg/kg bw/day based on the long-term rat study and applying a safety factor of 100. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.05 mg/kg bw/day based on the multigeneration study in rat and applying a safety factor of 100; no correction factor for enteral resorption is needed. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is set at 0.12 mg/kg bw, based on the developmental NOAEL of 12 mg/kg bw/day from the rat developmental toxicity study and a safety factor of 100.
   Dermal absorption was determined for the representative formulation, Ronstar (R) as 2 % for the concentrate and 3% for the in-use spray dilution based on an in vitro study performed with human skin. The level of operator exposure for the representative formulation at a maximum dose rate of 750 g oxadiazon/ha in sunflowers was below the AOEL according to the German model without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and according to the UK POEM when the use of gloves during mixing/loading and application was considered. Re-entry worker exposure represented 68 % of the AOEL when no specific PPE is worn and bystander exposure to oxadiazon was considered negligible. Metabolism of oxadiazon was investigated in sunflowers, rice and tomatoes and in rotational crops (spinach, radish and barley).
   Metabolism was found to be moderate. Besides oxadiazon, its metabolites AE0618785, AE0608021, AE0616182 and AE0618784 were identified. Additionally metabolite AE608033 is possibly present in sunflowers and rotational crops. As AE0608033 is not covered by the rat metabolism nor addressed by other toxicology data on metabolites a data gap was formulated. The notifier should clarify the occurrence of metabolite AE0608033 in primary crops and rotational crops. As parent oxadiazon was the prevalent residue found in metabolism studies on primary and rotational crops, the plant residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was proposed as oxadiazon alone.
   A sufficient number of residue trials on sunflowers supporting the notified GAPs have been submitted to propose an MRL. Based on the residue levels found in the metabolism on rotational crops it was concluded that field trials on rotational crops (root crops and cereals) are necessary. A provisional MRL for root and tuber crops was proposed on the basis of the results of the metabolism study on rotational crops.
   No metabolism studies on livestock are available. Provisional dietary burden calculations show an exceedance of the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg feed (DM) for beef cattle and pigs. Based on this provisional calculation a metabolism study on ruminants is necessary.
   Chronic and acute dietary intake calculations showed that an exceedance of ADI or ARfD is not expected for intake of crops after treatment of sunflowers with oxadiazon according to the notified GAPs. The finalisation of the risk assessment is pending the submission of field trials on rotational crops to confirm the estimated residue levels in root and tuber crops.
   Oxadiazon exhibits a high to very high persistence in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C or 25 degrees C (DT50 = 187-1238 d). A number of minor or very minor metabolites were found. Mineralization was low (CO2: max. 6.41 % after 300 d). Unextractable radioactivity reached levels of 5.44 - 35.5 % AR at the later data points (269 - 365 d).
   Under dark anaerobic conditions in soil at 20 degrees C oxadiazon also exhibits a very high persistence (DT50 = 841 d), metabolite AE 0608022 (max. 4.6 % AR after 120 d) is still increasing at the end of the study. Therefore, this metabolite would need to be further addressed with respect to potential ground water contamination in situations for which prolonged anaerobic conditions may be expected to occur.
   In the photolysis experiments in soil, the extent of degradation was low and no major metabolites were identified.
   The dissipation of oxadiazon under field conditions has been investigated in four sites in EU and two sites in USA. In the field trials performed in Germany oxadiazon exhibits a high persistence in soil (DT50 = 262 - 330 d). In the field trials performed in the Southern EU (Spain and S- France) oxadiazon exhibited a medium persistence in soil (DT50 = 90 - 95 d). The geometric mean of the normalized (20 degrees C, pF 2) field half lives (DT50 (norm. field geomean) = 120 d) was agreed to represent degradation of oxadiazon in soil for modelling purposes.
   The study performed in USA was considered supplementary information.
   The peer review identified a data gap for representative field soil accumulation studies. Potential for accumulation was addressed by PEC soil calculations based on the worst case field non normalized half life.
   Two soil batch adsorption desorption studies were performed with oxadiazon. According these studies, oxadiazon is expected to exhibit low mobility in soil (K-Foc = 979 - 1527 mL /g). Oxadiazon was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, pH 5 and pH 7. At pH 9 oxadiazon hydrolysed (DT (50) = 11.7 d) yielding two major hydrolysis metabolites: AE 0608022 and AE 0592465.
   Aqueous photolysis of oxadiazon was fast under the irradiated experimental conditions. Half life in the surface water was calculated for different latitudes (30 degrees N - 50 degrees N) and seasons. Three major aqueous photolysis metabolites were identified: AE 0608035 (max. 15 % AR), AE 0608033 (max. 12.2 % AR) and AE 1117150 (max. 10.6 % AR).
   Oxadiazon is not readily biodegradable according to the available study.
   Dissipation / degradation was investigated in two dark water /sediment systems at 20 degrees C. Oxadiazon partitions with the sediment and degrades slowly in both systems (DT50 whole system. = 126.4 - 126.6 d). During the peer review, new FOCUS Step 3 and Step 4 PEC SW /SED calculations were provided by the notifier. The meeting of experts identified some drawbacks in these calculations. In addendum 2, RMS provided new PECSW/SED calculations in accordance with the meeting discussions. An estimation of the potential for oxadiazon to accumulate in the sediment was provided in addendum 1. An accumulation factor of 1.96 was derived from the 10 years plateau identified in this calculation.
   A generic FOCUS Step 1 and Step 2 PECSW/SED calculation is available for the photolysis metabolite AE0608022.
   Potential contamination of ground water by oxadiazon was assessed with FOCUS GW PEARL and PELMO models. In both cases, annual average concentration of oxadiazon in the leachate was below the regulatory limit of 0.1 mu g / L for the 80th percentile concentration at 1 m depth over 20 yr of continuous application in sunflowers.
   Oxadiazon may be considered medium to low volatile. A photochemical half life in the atmosphere of 0.22 d has been calculated with Atkinson's method. Oxadiazon is not expected to contaminate remote areas through long range transport.
   The Tier I assessment provided TER values above the Annex VI trigger for the acute and short-term risk to medium herbivorous and insectivorous birds. The long-term TER value was above the Annex VI trigger for herbivorous birds, whereas the TER value for insectivorous birds (based on a diet of small insects) failed to meet the trigger. Member State experts considered that insectivorous birds to a certain (sufficient) degree would base their diet on large insects with lower residue levels and therefore the long-term risk to insectivorous birds was considered as low. The acute and long-term risk to mammals was assessed as low, as was the risk to birds and mammals from eating fish and consumption of contaminated drinking water. Data gaps were identified for the notifier to address the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals.
   Oxadiazon was considered to be very toxic to aquatic organisms, with algae and fish reproduction as the most sensitive endpoints. The acute risk to fish, invertebrates and higher plants was addressed at FOCUSsw Step 3 without risk mitigation. Only one out of four relevant FOCUSsw scenarios passed the Annex VI trigger for the risk assessment of algae, based on a higher tier algae biomass endpoint and 20m buffer zones to mitigate spray drift and run-off. In order to address the long-term risk to fish further refinements are needed (i.e. data gap), since exposure mitigation was insufficient to address the risk and refinement of the chronic fish toxicity endpoint was not accepted by Member State experts (i.e. adding sediment to the test system). Refinements in line with the recommendation in the PPR-panel opinion on Dimoxystrobin were suggested. The in-field risk assessment to non-target arthropods indicated a high risk to T. pyri, whereas the off-field risk could be considered as low. Laboratory and extended laboratory studies with three species of soil living non-target arthropods indicated that the risk from the intended spraying of bare soil could be considered as low.
   The risk to bees, earthworms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Alkylpehnol polyethoxylates (APEOs) and the derivatives of APEOs such as nonylphenol (NP) are generally used as anti-oxidants in many organic compounds including detergents, herbicides and pesticides. In this study, NP effects on growth, egg production and hatching in Japanese quails were investigated. Also, NP effects on plasma vitamin levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined. NP does not affect body weight gain (BWG), feed consumption (FC) and feed conversion ratio for growth (FCRG) in all experimental groups in growing chicks, while it cause a significant decrease in egg production (EP) (P<0.01). Also, the present study showed that NP concentrations, 10, 100 and 500 mu g NP in ethanol (ETOH)/kg-feed, exposure cause an increase in beta-Carotene, Vitamin A and MDA levels (P<0.01). There is also significant rise in Vitamin C level induced by NP in all experimental groups (P<0.01). In conclusion, NP has dramatic effects on EP rate and anti-oxidant system in a concentration dependent manner in Japanese quails.

AB  - Lecanicillium muscarium, notified as Verticillium lecanii, is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004.
   Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 May 2009 pursuant to Article 24b of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as, jhe Regulation'). In accordance with Article 25a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as,, the Commission') in accordance with Article 25(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.
   The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 5 July 2007. The peer review was initiated on 7 May 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation to the sole notifier Koppert Beheer B.V., and on 21 January 2009 to the Member States. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a scientific meeting with Member State experts in June 2009.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in November 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses on cucumber, tomato, sweet pepper, strawberry and ornamentals for the control of whitefly and thrips. The formulation is applied as a spray to the crops. Full details of the application rate and timings can be found in the list of end points attached at appendix A to this report.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Mycotal", a wettable powder formulation (WP).
   The available data indicate that the micro-organism is not competitive in the environment unless the host species are present, it is not pathogenic to humans, nor toxic or infective and does not produce any known toxicologically significant secondary metabolites, therefore methods of analysis for monitoring are not required. However, it should be noted that some methods are given in the DAR although there are no validation data.
   Sufficient test methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available. Methods for the unequivocal identification of the strain could not be concluded on, as the new information has not been peer-reviewed. The acceptability of the methods for microbial contaminants was questioned as they appeared not to be ISO methods. After the experts" meeting the notifier confirmed that ISO methods were used. Further validation is needed for the whitefly assay. It was considered that the level of contaminating pathogens was in some cases too high when compared to internationally available proposed levels for pathogenic microbial contaminants, and this is considered by EFSA as a critical area of concern.
   In acute toxicity studies, Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 did not induce signs of toxicity, pathogenicity or infectivity. The human/rat body temperature would mean that the micro-organism would not remain viable in these warm-blooded species. Clinical cases of systemic infection were described in the open literature in immuno-compromised patients, either receiving chemo/radiotherapy, or treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics; very rare cases of keratitis were caused by Lecanicillium species.
   No potential for skin sensitisation was found in a Magnusson & Kligman test. Sensitisation studies with micro-organisms are considered to be of limited value, as reactions to foreign proteins (most micro-organisms) can be anticipated. Therefore, all micro-organisms should be regarded as potential sensitisers ( in contact with skin and by inhalation). The following phrase was agreed by the experts "Micro-organisms may have the potential to provoke sensitising reactions", since labelling with risk phrases applicable to chemicals ( according to Directive 67/548/EEC4 and Directive 1999/45/EC5) is not appropriate for micro-organisms.
   In a 28-day study by inhalation in rats conducted with the representative formulation, MVycotal", the no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL) was found at 1 mg/m(3), based on macro- and microscopic changes in the lungs, nasal cavity and mediastinal lymph nodes most pronounced at 10 and 100 mg/m3 groups. Although these changes were indicative of a local immune reaction rather than a toxicological effect, this could not be confirmed due to the lack of a control group in the study. Short-term toxicity is not expected, because accumulation of Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 has not been demonstrated in the body. No potential for genotoxicity was found in vitro. As no known toxicologically significant metabolite was identified, the PRAPeR M3 meeting of experts agreed that no further data would be required for the genotoxicity end point.
   No reference values were set and none were needed as the micro-organism is not pathogenic or infective and does not produce toxins.
   Low risk was anticipated for operators if adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and respiratory protective equipment (RPE) are worn. Workers are also required to use PPE to lower dermal exposure. No bystanders should be allowed during greenhouse applications. A concern was raised by the experts over outdoor bystander exposure by inhalation due to the potential sensitisation by inhalation and no protection possible for bystanders. The rapporteur Member State provided a risk characterisation for bystanders after the experts" meeting, concluding that bystander exposure is low when compared to the amount of micro-organisms that are inhaled daily as a background value. Nevertheless, a concern over outdoor bystander inhalation remains. Furthermore, for outdoor uses, as there is an outstanding issue with the specification of the product with regard to some pathogenic contaminants, the exposure risk assessment of bystanders could not be finalized.
   Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 does not colonise the plant surface, and thus, the micro-organism is considered not likely to grow and multiply on plant material. Dietary exposure from use of Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 is likely to be minimal. Moreover, any potentially occurring residual deposits on the treated crops are not relevant, as no human health concerns have been identified due to the toxicological profile of this strain. This assessment is subject to a final specification for microbial contamination of the plant protection product.
   The available data on the fate and behaviour in the environment indicated that the only component that required environmental exposure and risk assessment was the colony forming units of Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6. Data on the competitiveness and persistence of added Lecanicillium muscarium to soil and natural surface water indicated that the organism was not very competitive, and that following addition of Lecanicillium muscarium to the soil environment or common artificial plant substrate, or spray drift exposure to surface water, levels would be expected to decline. However, information on the natural background concentrations in soil was not presented and no specific data on the influence of UV light on persistence and multiplication in water were available. There was sufficient evidence to show that Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 does not produce any known secondary metabolites of toxicological or environmental concern.
   A general consideration to address the risk to non-target organisms was the very narrow 'natural' host or target range of Lecanicillium muscarium, in addition to the apparent lack of evidence that birds, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms and terrestrial plants are among the 'natural' target or host range of Lecanicillium muscarium. Furthermore, it was considered that the occurrence of 'natural' epizootics in the field could impose the same 'risks' to non-target organisms as epizootics induced by products with Lecanicillium muscarium.
   No acute toxic, infective or pathogenic effects were identified in any of the studies on birds, aquatic organisms, bees or earthworms based on the data available.
   However, data gaps were identified during the peer review to address the potential infectivity in fish and the potential toxicity to aquatic invertebrates, both being relevant for outdoor uses only.
   Many studies indicated no or only minimal effects on different non-target arthropod species exposed to Lecanicillium muscarium. There were however concerns among Member State experts about the strains and formulations used in the studies, and also concerns about the test conditions. Some effects were in fact seen on the species Encarsia formosa. A data gap was identified to further address the risk to non-target arthropods.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), also known as pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), are a behaviorally defined group of neurodevelopmental disorders that are usually diagnosed in early childhood. ASDs disproportionately affect male children. Mercury (Hg), a heavy metal, is widespread and persistent in the environment. Mercury is a ubiquitous source of danger in fish, drugs, fungicides/herbicides, dental fillings, thermometers, and many other products. Elevated Hg concentrations may remain in the brain from several years to decades following exposure. This is important because investigators have long recognized that Hg is a neurodevelopmental poison; it can cause problems in neuronal cell migration and division, and can ultimately cause cell degeneration and death. Case-reports of patients have described developmental regressions with ASD symptoms following fetal and/or early childhood Hg exposure, and epidemiological studies have linked exposure to Hg with an elevated risk of a patient being diagnosed with an ASD. Immune, sensory, neurological, motor, and behavioral dysfunctions similar to traits defining or associated with ASDs were reported following Hg intoxication with similarities extending to neuroanatomy, neurotransmitters, and biochemistry. The sexual dimorphism of ASDs may result from synergistic neurotoxicity caused by the interaction of testosterone and Hg; in contrast, estrogen is protective, mitigating the toxicity of Ha. Mercury exposure may significantly increase androgen levels, and as a result, patients diagnosed with an ASD may significantly benefit from anti-androgen therapy. Finally, the clinical geneticist has a wealth of biomarkers to evaluate and treat patients diagnosed with an ASD.

AB  - Haloxyfop-P is the ISO common name for the substance formerly referred to by the synonym 'haloxyfop-R' (introduced by DOW AgroSciences) which is in common use but without official status. This conclusion refers to the ISO common name haloxyfop-P.
   Haloxyfop-P is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20003, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20024 Following the Commission Decision of 19 June 2007 (2007/437/EC). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on haloxyfop-P in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 21 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 26 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.
   A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 28 July 2006 (EFSA, 2006).
   Following the Commission Decision of 19 June 2007 (2007/437/EC) 5 concerning the non-inclusion of haloxyfop-P in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant, Dow AgroSciences made a resubmission application for the inclusion of haloxyfop-P in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the European Commission review report as follows:
   The potential contamination of groundwater
   The risk to mammals
   The high toxicity to fish
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Denmark, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on haloxyfop-P in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 3 April 2009.
   In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 8 April 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 13 May 2009. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 13 July 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days.
   The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the rapporteur Member State's evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific meetings via telephone conference with Member State experts in September 2009.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in the areas of mammalian toxicology, environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology.
   The original conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control annual and perennial grasses in carrots, fodder legumes (peas and beans), rape seed, soy bean and sugar beet. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses as a herbicide. Full details of the GAP can be found in the end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'EF-1400' which was given the commercial name of 'Gallant' in the resubmission, an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), and registered under different trade names in Europe.
   For food of plant and animal origin, methods of analysis are available that will quantify haloxyfop and its esters, salts and conjugates, expressed as haloxyfop. However, it is not clear if the hydrolysis step is validated and therefore it is not known if it was comparable to the hydrolysis step in the metabolism studies. As a consequence of this the residue may be underestimated. Methods of analysis are available for soil, water and air which also include a hydrolysis step that is not necessary but which in this case will over estimate the residue.
   Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method such as the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   The toxicological studies were generally performed with pure (> 98%) racemic haloxyfop or haloxyfop-P methyl ester or with neat substances. The toxicokinetic studies indicate that absorbed methyl ester will rapidly be hydrolysed to the parent acid and the S-form haloxyfop present in racemic haloxyfop will instantaneously undergo stereochemical inversion to haloxyfop-P. Therefore, the various compounds used for testing are assumed to elicit the same systemic effects following administration and these effects can be attributed to haloxyfop-P. The absorption is rapid (> 80%) and the excretion extensive. The acute oral toxicity is moderate i. e. LD50 is around 300 mg/kg bw and the dermal toxicity low LD50> 2000 mg/kg bw, proposed classification of Xn, R22 "Harmful if swallowed". No acute inhalation toxicity studies are available. Neither racemic haloxyfop nor haloxyfop-P methyl ester was irritating to skin and haloxyfop-P methyl ester was not a sensitizer. Haloxyfop-P methyl ester is not irritating to the eye whereas racemic haloxyfop induced signs of irritation in the conjunctival sacs and iris and caused corneal opacity covering up to 100% of the cornea in all animals. Signs of irritation (corneal opacity) persisted for 21 days in un-rinsed eyes racemic haloxyfop is therefore irritating to the eye and the classification of Xi; R41 " Risk of serious damage to eyes" is proposed. The relevant short term NOAEL is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1year dog study which would also be said to cover the effects observed in the 90-day studies in the dog and monkey at 2 mg/kg bw/day.
   There is no mutagenic or genotoxic potential for haloxyfop-P. Haloxyfop is not carcinogenic in the rat but there are hepatocellular adenomas in the highest dose in the mice associated with peroxisome proliferation.
   No reproductive effects were observed at the highest dose level of 1 mg/kg bw/day, thus being a NOAEL for reproductive effects, the NOAEL for offspring toxicity is 0.065 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight of f1a pups after 21 days at 1 mg/kg bw/day.
   The NOAEL for maternal effects is 1 mg/kg bw/day and 7.5 mg/kg bw/day (in rat and rabbit, respectively) and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 7.5 mg/kg bw/day in the rat study and 15 mg/kg bw/day in the rabbit study.
   The groundwater metabolites DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone were not of relevance based on hazard assessment. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.00065 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.075 mg/kg bw, with the safety factor of 100 applied.
   The operator exposure was estimated using the standard models UK-POEM and the German model.
   The dermal absorption is 7% and 12% for the concentrate and the diluted product, respectively. The AOEL is exceeded (169%) according to the UK-POEM even with PPE (coverall) but is below according to the German model if PPE (coverall and gloves) is applied (12%). The estimated worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL.
   To investigate the residue behaviour of haloxyfop-P in plants and livestock either the haloxyfop Risomer or the unresolved isomeric mixture or ester variants of both compounds were used.
   Plant metabolism was studied following foliar application to crops representing leafy crops, root vegetables, pulses and oilseeds. Irrespective of the ester variant or whether the racemic mixture or only the R-isomer was applied, the metabolism in all the studied crops was found to be similar commencing by a rapid and almost complete degradation to haloxyfop (R, S) very soon after application, followed by conjugation with carbohydrates and triglycerides. These conjugates appeared to be unstable under alkaline and acidic conditions, releasing haloxyfop (R, S) again.
   Metabolism studies with goats and hens indicated that haloxyfop (R, S) is excreted unmetabolised by livestock animals. In tissue and organs residues were present as haloxyfop (R, S) in either form, free and conjugated.
   Due to the lack of isomeric specificity of the pre-registration analytical methods any possible stereochemical inversion in either direction in food of plant and animal origin could not be detected, even though it is assumed based on available data in soil and in rats that if such inversion occurs it will be most likely from the S-to the R-isomer.
   A sufficient number of residue trial data with haloxyfop-P methyl according to the GAP proposed for the representative uses is available to conclude the risk assessment for consumers and to propose MRLs. From crop rotation studies it can be concluded that no significant residue levels are expected in rotational and succeeding crops following application of haloxyfop-P methyl according to the critical GAP. The residue levels that could occur in food of animal origin when crops treated with haloxyfop-P methyl are fed to animals were assessed based on livestock feeding studies and MRLs have been proposed.
   The dietary risk assessment performed for different consumer groups indicates that there are no chronic and acute concerns related to dietary exposure resulting from the representative uses assessed within the peer review procedure.
   Soil degradation studies suggested a possible main degradation route for haloxyfop-P methyl ester under aerobic conditions. Haloxyfop-P methyl ester degraded rapidly (DT50 < 0.6 d at 20 degrees C) in six soils to produce the acid metabolite haloxyfop-P-6 (DE-535 acid, max. 53-91% AR), which further degraded to DE-535 pyridino17 (max. 29-52% AR). Other two metabolites, DE-535 pyridinone(8) and DE-535 phenol(9), exceeded the trigger value of 10% AR on a limited number of occasions: DE-535 pyridinone reached a maximum of 11.0% AR after 120 days, and DE-535 phenol with maximum concentration of 12.6% AR after 14 days. Final degradation ended up in minor unidentified metabolites, non-extractable soil residues (max. 44% AR after 90 days) and carbon dioxide (max. 35% AR after 90 days). Haloxyfop-P can be considered as very low to low persistent, DE-535 pyridinol as medium to high persistent, and DE-535 phenol as moderate to high persistent. A data gap for reliable degradation rates in soil for DE-535 pyridinone was identified at the PRAPeR teleconference TC18.
   Sorption characteristics indicated that haloxyfop-P, DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone are very high to high mobile in soil, whereas DE-535 phenol can be classified as low mobile. Haloxyfop-P and the metabolite trifluoroacetic acid exceeded the limit value of 0.1 mu g/L on individual occasions in some lysimeter studies, but the annual average concentrations were < 0.1 mu g/L for haloxyfop-P methyl ester and all its metabolites.
   Because the calculation model for PECsoil was not consistent with the method used for the degradation rates values, soil concentrations at later time points for haloxyfop-P, DE-535 phenol and DE-535 pyridinone should be recalculated. However, the new PECsoil values will not have an impact on the risk assessment for terrestrial organisms as safe uses have been shown using the reliable initial PECsoil.
   The hydrolysis rate of haloxyfop-P methyl ester was directly correlated with pH (stable at pH 4, DT50= 43 days at pH 7 and DT50= 0.63 days at pH 9). The photolysis of haloxyfop-P methyl ester and haloxyfop-P was investigated in pH 5 sterile buffer and natural water (pH 8.5). A new metabolite, with a chemical structure similar to dibenzofuran, was identified up to 18.6% AR in the sterile buffer system. The aquatic exposure of DE-535 furan was appropriately addressed in the resubmission dossier.
   Two natural water-sediment systems under controlled laboratory conditions showed that haloxyfop-P methyl ester was rapidly hydrolyzed to haloxyfop-P, the concentrations of which were in the range of 63.8- 81.5% AR after 1-30 days. At the same time the concentration of the metabolite DE-535 pyridinol increased up to 19.7% AR after 59 days. The same two metabolites were also found in the sediment phase up to 33.7% AR (haloxyfop-P) and 16.4% AR (DE-535 pyridinol). Haloxyfop-P methyl ester degraded rapidly in both the water and sediment phases with first order DT50 values < 0.3 days. The calculated DT50 values for haloxyfop-P ranged from 39.2 - 51.7 d (whole system) and from 31.5-54.6 d (water phase).
   The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route on entry to surface water for haloxyfop-P methyl ester, haloxyfop-P and DE-535 pyridinol. Additional calculations were performed including a worst-case contamination contribution from run-off and drainage of 15% of the application rate.
   After the resubmission procedure, a new FOCUS groundwater modelling with agreed input parameters was still necessary to fully address the potential for groundwater exposure for haloxyfop-P and major soil metabolites DE-535 phenol, DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone. Based on provisional results presented in the DAR, not complying with the recommendations of FOCUS groundwater guidance regarding the use of first order degradation kinetics, a high potential for groundwater exposure for soil metabolites DE-535 pyridinol (80th percentile annual average concentrations: 0.55-2.87 mu g/L) and DE-535 pyridinone (0.26-0.90 mu g/L) was identified. In the resubmission dossier the toxicological assessment was able to conclude that metabolites DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone were not relevant. However, in case the new FOCUS PECGw calculations will indicate that these metabolites will exceed the trigger of 0.75 mu g/L, a consumer risk assessment might be needed. Based on the available volatilisation experiment and the calculated atmospheric half-life, contamination of the air compartment and long range transport through air are not expected.
   The first tier risk assessment for herbivorous and insectivorous birds resulted in TER values above the Annex VI trigger indicating a low risk. For medium herbivorous and insectivorous mammals the acute risk is considered to be low, while a first tier high long-term risk was identified. The Member State experts in EPCO 22 did not accept a proposed refinement using a higher endpoint from a 16-week dietary study. It was agreed to use the endpoint of 1 mg/kg bw/day from a 2-generation reproduction study. Furthermore, since the half-life for residues in vegetation was observed to be longer than the default value, residue decline data for each crop should be used in the risk assessment. The resulting TER values were foreseen to be below the Annex VI trigger indicating a high risk, and the risk to mammals was not addressed in the original review. The long-term risk was addressed for herbivorous mammals in the Additional Report based on the reproductive endpoint and refinement of PD for the intended uses in sugar beet, field peas and beans. For the intended autumn use in oilseed rape refinements based on a developmental endpoint were not accepted as the intended used may coincide with the breeding season of herbivorous mammals, but it was agreed that a safe use could be shown in Northern Europe. A data gap was identified to address the risk to herbivorous mammals for the Southern Member States, at the European level. Consequently, a similar data gap was identified to address the long-term risk to insectivorous mammals from the use in oilseed rape in Southern Member States.
   Haloxyfop-P methyl ester is very toxic to aquatic organisms, fish being the most sensitive group of organisms. Risk mitigation comparable to 5 m buffer zones is required to meet the Annex VI trigger. The risk for aquatic organisms from the surface water metabolites haloxyfop-P, DE-535 pyridinol, and DE-535 furan was assessed as low. Two metabolites were found in concentrations >0.1 mu g/L in the FOCUS ground water modelling. DE-535 pyridinol is considered to be of no ecotoxicological relevance. An assessment of new data on DE-535 pyridinone indicated a lower toxicity to aquatic organisms than the parent and the risk was assessed as low in the Additional Report (March 2009). The risk to bees and other non-target arthropods is low. The risk to earthworms, other soil macro organisms and soil micro-organisms from haloxyfop-P methyl ester and haloxyfop-P is considered to be low.
   The risk to soil organisms from exposure to the persistent soil metabolites DE-535 pyridinol, DE-pyridinone and DE-535 phenol was not addressed in the original review. Assessment of the soil metabolites DE-535 pyridinol, DE-pyridinone and DE-535 phenol in the Additional Report (March 2009) indicated a low risk to earthworms, non-target soil macro-organisms and micro-organisms. The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low. The risk to non-target plants was assessed as low.

AB  - The bidirectional relationship that aquaculture has with the environment set limits to the growth this economic activity has in Chile. This condition has generated both technical constraints and environmental as well as social conflicts. The growing demand for new chemotherapeutic compounds and their release into aquatic environments is now considered one of the main problems being faced by the salmon industry in Chile. However, little is known about the effects these substances exert on non-target species and on the structure and functioning of exposed ecosystems. Through the application of theory and methods from contemporary ecology, the present work aims at contributing towards the development of a methodology that allows a reduction of the uncertainty level associated to the environmental risk assessment of veterinary products used in aquaculture. The current status of the environmental risk assessment in Chile is revised and those critical aspects feasible to fix are identified, considering the procedures currently in use. Finally, a general methodological approach is proposed that considers a coherent expansion of standard ecotoxicological tests combining research at community, population, and individual levels, with mathematical modeling of ecological systems.

AB  - Folpet is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on folpet in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 20 October 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 6 July 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Makhteshim Agan. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 14 December 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6 April 2006 leading to the conclusions.
   The outcome of experts' consultation was re-discussed within a series of scientific meetings in the section of mammalian toxicology and residues with Member States experts in November 2007 and April 2008. The conclusion has been amended accordingly and the changed reference values are laid down in this report. This updated conclusion replaces the previous version, which was finalised on 24 April 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 70 refers).
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control various fungi in winter wheat, tomatoes and wine grapes at application rates of up to 750 g folpet per hectare in winter cereals, up to 1.6 kg in tomatoes and up to 1.5 kg in wine grapes. Folpet can be used only as fungicide.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Folpan 80 WDG", a water dispersible granule (WG), registered in some EU Member States.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, i.e. folpet in soil, water and air. It should be noted that for surface water no enforcement method is needed for the determination of folpet, due to the fact that the DT90 value is below 3 d (the trigger value given in SANCO/825/00). For food of plant origin no validated analytical methods for monitoring purposes are available.
   Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, due to some outstanding data no final specification can be proposed for the technical material at the moment.
   Folpet has a low acute oral and dermal toxicity but it is R20 'Harmful by Inhalation'. It is not irritating to the skin but it is severely irritating to eyes (proposal for classification as R41 "Risk of serious damage to eyes") and is a skin sensitiser (R43 'May cause sensitisation by skin contact' is proposed). Folpet does not show any genotoxic potential in vivo but it is carcinogenic in the mouse (category 3, R 40 proposed for the classification by the majority of the experts), with a clear threshold identified. Folpet did not cause adverse effects on adult fertility or reproduction in rats over two generations, but was shown to be teratogenic in rabbits (classification as R63 is still under discussion and is forwarded to ECB). The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.2 mg/kg bw. The operator estimated exposure accounts for 34 to 77% of the AOEL in outdoor scenarios (German model with PPE considered). Estimates provided for operator exposure in glass-houses ranged from 29% to 33% of the AOEL (PPE is worn). The exposure of bystanders is 1.6% of the AOEL. Worker exposure in harvesting grapes and tomatoes without protective gloves is 133% and 68% of the AOEL, with PPE such as gloves it is assumed that the exposure is below the AOEL. Worker exposure following applications of folpet to wheat can be expected to be lower than following applications to grapes or tomatoes.
   The metabolism of folpet in plants has been adequately elucidated. The main degradation products after release of the trichloromethylthio-side chain are phthalimide and phthalic acid. As it is not possible at this stage to fully characterize the toxicological properties of phthalimide, this metabolite needs to be included in the residue definition for plant products for monitoring and risk assessment purposes. Supervised residue trials were carried out in most cases with analysis of folpet only and therefore it is not possible to establish MRLs and to conduct an exposure assessment covering the contribution of phthalimide to the residue. However, taking into account folpet only, an acute risk for toddlers consuming treated table grapes has been identified. Specific studies allowing a clear understanding of the behaviour of the compound during processing are not available. The drastic reduction of folpet level in processed commodities and the physico-chemical properties of the compound suggest that important amounts of phthalimide and/or phthalic acid could be produced during processing. No residue of folpet and related metabolites are expected in rotational crops and in animal commodities.
   Folpet is very low or low persistent in soil. First degradation step involves the release of the highly reactive thiophosgene to yield the major soil metabolite phthalimide which is further degraded through phthalamic acid to phthalic acid. All major folpet metabolites are also very low or low persistent in soil under aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. Mineralization is high and unextractable residues are formed in moderate amounts (max. 31.2 % AR at 14 d).
   In relation to the thiophosgene moiety, further information was derived from captan. The experts' meeting agreed that it is not expected that free thiophosgene will reach significant levels due to the degradation of folpet in soil. Under anaerobic conditions folpet degraded slightly slower and no new metabolites were identified.
   Photolysis does not contribute significantly to the environmental dissipation of folpet.
   PEC soil presented in the DAR were based on worst case laboratory half life (DT50 = 4.3 d) with the critical GAP of ten applications of 1.5 kg a.s / ha at 7 days interval (grapes use). In the addendum March 2005 PEC soil are recalculated for all three uses taking into account crop interception given for FOCUS GW. However, EFSA considers that this calculation is not adequate for vines (were interception factor has been averaged) and needs to be further justified for tomatoes. New PEC soil values calculated by EFSA were used in the risk assessment for earthworms presented in the conclusion. Due to ambiguities with respect to the time of application interception for PEC soil, calculation cannot be established for wheat.
   Folpet was estimated (based on physical chemical properties or theoretical calculations) to be medium mobile (K-oc = 304 mL / g), phtalamic acid very high mobile (Koc = 10 mL / g) and phthalic acid high mobile (K-oc = 73 mL / g) in soil. Phthalimide was experimentally found to be medium to high mobile in soil (K-foc = 72 - 385 mL / g).
   Hydrolysis of folpet is rapid at acidic and neutral pH (DT50 < 3 h) and very rapid at alkaline pH (DT50 < 3 min). Main hydrolysis metabolites were phathalimide and phthalic acid. Trichlomethylsulfenic acid and tricloromethylmercaptan are postulated to be the two major non characterized hydrolysis metabolites of folpet. These metabolites will degrade to thiophosgene, carbon oxysulfide and ultimately to CO2. Phthalimide was stable at 25 degrees C and pHs 4 and 7 and at pH 9 was hydrolysed with a half life of 2 h. Contribution of photolysis to the aqueous degradation of folpet was not significant. Folpet was shown to be readily biodegradable at concentrations of 1 mg C/L.
   In the water sediment systems folpet degrades very rapidly and mineralization is relatively high. Folpet is not found in the sediment phase. Major metabolites in the water phase were phthalimide, phthalamic acid, phthalic acid, benzamide and 2-cyanobenzoic acid. No major metabolite was found in the sediment phase. All the metabolites degraded rapidly in both systems (DT50 < 7 d).
   After the Experts' meeting new PECsw calculations have been presented based on FOCUS scheme. Whereas not peer reviewed, EFSA can confirm that the parameters already agreed by the experts' meeting have been used in this calculation. Values obtained for the different representative uses are lower than the worst case runoff estimation presented in the DAR (577 mu g/L). This level could be of concern only for metabolite phthalimide. Therefore, FOCUS STEP 1 values have been used to complete the assessment of this metabolite (See 5.2.). FOCUS sw calculations for the parent up to STEP 4 are also summarized in the addendum of October 2005, these calculations have not been peer reviewed and have not been used for the EU risk assessment.
   The acute risk to birds was assessed as low in a first tier risk assessment for all representative uses. The short-term and long-term TER values for herbivorous birds were below the Annex VI triggers of 10 and 5. But since the TER value of >8.9 is based on a NOEC from the highest tested dose and tomato foliage is considered not to be an attractive food source, the risk to herbivorous birds is assumed to be low for the representative use in tomatoes A high long term risk to insectivorous birds was identified in a first tier risk assessment for all representative uses. The refined risk assessment for birds was discussed in the EPCO expert meeting. It was agreed that the risk assessment should not be based on the highest observed NOEC of 769 mg a.s./kg/d and that the RUD refinement would not cover the risk from uptake of residues in small insects. On the basis of the peer reviewed data a high long-term risk to insectivorous birds cannot be excluded. The risk to mammals is low for the representative uses in winter wheat and tomatoes but a high acute and long term risk to small herbivorous mammals cannot be excluded for the representative use in grapes. The first tier risk assessment for the uptake of contaminated drinking water resulted in a high acute risk for birds and mammals if the solution is sprayed at the highest recommended concentration. The risk of secondary poisoning of birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated earthworms and fish is considered to be low for all representative uses. The intrinsic toxicity of folpet to fish and daphnids is high. Due to very rapid degradation the toxicity under static conditions is markedly lower. The acute risk to fish and daphnids is high and risk mitigation measures such as no spray buffer buffer zones of 5 m for the use in winter wheat and tomatoes and 10 m for the use in grapes are required. A long-term risk assessment for aquatic organisms is required since the representative uses cover multiple applications leading to repeated exposure. The long-term risk to fish is high and risk mitigation measures such as no spray buffer zones of 5 m and 15 m are required to for the representative uses in winter wheat, tomatoes and grapes, respectively. The available data do not allow drawing a conclusion on the long-term risk to aquatic invertebrates. The endpoints from a flow through study would lead to an overestimation of the long-term risk to daphnids. The risk of bioaccumulation and the risk from major metabolites posed to aquatic organisms are considered to be low. The risk to earthworms is low for the use in tomatoes but a high risk to earthworms cannot be excluded for the uses in grapes. The risk to earthworms from the use in winter wheat cannot be concluded until a reliable PEC soil is established.
   The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, other non-target organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Malathion is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on malathion in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 2 February 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 16 April 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Cheminova A/S. There was also another notifier (Cequisa) according to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 703/20014 but it was not possible to reach an agreement and to provide a collective dossier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January -March 2005.
   A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 30 November 2005 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 13 January 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 63)
   Following the Commission Decision of 6 June 2007 (2007/389/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of malathion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant, Cheminova A/S made a resubmission application for the inclusion of malathion in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No.33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report (European Commission, 2007) as follows:
   the presence in the technical material of isomalathion, the genotoxicity of which cannot be excluded, the consumer exposure the long term risk to mammals and concerns were identified with regard to: the exposure of operators, workers and bystanders which cannot be concluded due to the presence of isomalathion in the technical material the acute and chronic risk for consumers, due to the insufficient information on the effects of certain toxicologically relevant metabolites the high risk to aquatic organisms, honey bees and non-target arthropods.
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, The United Kingdom, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on malathion in the format of an Additional Report (The United Kingdom, 2009a). The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 11 February 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 13 February 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 17 March 2009. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 24 April 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days.
   The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS' evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific meetings and a telephone conference with Member State experts in June 2009.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been reissued to update the risk assessment in all areas.
   The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as acaricide and insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprised foliar spraying to control various harmful organisms in apples, strawberries, alfalfa and ornamentals at application rate up 1.8 kg malathion per hectare. The uses on apple and alfalfa were no longer supported in the resubmission application, and therefore the conclusion has only been updated in relation to the risk assessment of the representative uses presented in the Additional Report, i.e. only the use in strawberries and ornamentals at application rates of maximum 1.2 kg and 0.114 kg malathion per hectare respectively.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'CHA 3110' (` Fyfanon 440'), an oil in water emulsion (EW), registered under different trade names in some EU Member States.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions, however a data gap was identified concerning amendments to the description of the sample preparation for the method for residues in plants. In case of food of plant origin, malathion and malaoxon7 can also be determined by a multi-residue method. No method for the determination of malathion in food of animal origin is required for the representative uses of the resubmission. In the case of soil and surface water no enforcement method for the determination of malathion is needed due to the fact that the DT90 values are lower than 3 days.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   The concentration of isomalathion8 in the batches of technical malathion tested in the toxicological studies is lower than in the specification (between 0.018%-0.44%, if mentioned at all, of the current specification.) The currently supported specification of malathion allows a maximum concentration of 0.2 % (w/w) isomalathion in the technical active substance and according to the FAO specification, it is 0.4 % (w/w).
   Based on the available studies in the toxicological data package, only the 0.03% isomalathion content can be said to be covered. As for the level of 0.2% isomalathion, an additional safety factor of 10 was added at the EPCO meeting to the ADI and the AOEL in order to be able to conclude on the risk assessment due to uncertainties in studies relevant for the setting of reference values.
   The level of isomalathion in the current 5-batch analysis showed a mean content of 0.0480.076%. This implied that the limit of 0.03% regarding the toxicological data package would not be feasible. Thus, the toxicological assumptions had to be based on the 0.2% limit. Furthermore, it is shown in the FAO specification that the amount of isomalathion even increases during storage both in relation to time and temperature by a factor of 2-10. Thus, the reference values had to be based on the 0.2% level.
   Malathion is rapidly absorbed and excreted. There is no evidence of accumulation. The highest concentration was found in the liver, followed by skin, fat, bone and gastrointestinal tract. The metabolites excreted in urine and faeces were primarily the mono (MMCA9) and dicarboxylic (MDCA10) acids of malathion. Malathion is moderately toxic by the oral route in rat (a classification as Xn; R22 "Harmful if swallowed" is proposed). Malathion is not acutely toxic via the dermal route or through inhalation; it is not irritant to skin and eyes but it is a skin sensitizer (Xi; R43 "The cause sensitisation by skin contact" is proposed). The target uncertainties in the provisional risk assessment presented in this document, the margin of safety between the currently estimated consumer exposure and the allocated toxicological reference values is considered sufficiently big with respect to the notified use of malathion in strawberries.
   The available data demonstrate that in soil malathion degrades to the major (> 10% applied radioactivity) metabolites malathion monocarboxylic acid (MMCA) and malathion dicarboxylic acid (MDCA). Mineralization of the a carbon radiolabels in each ester moiety accounted for 50-67% AR after 92-162 days incubation at 20-22 degrees C. The values for residues not extracted by acidified acetonitrile: water followed by methylenene chloride and a methanol Soxhlet extraction or 1N hydrochloric acid followed by acidified acetonitrile and an acetone Soxhlet extraction were 26-41% AR after 92-120 days. In soil malathion and MMCA exhibited very low persistence and MDCA exhibited low persistence.
   In guideline batch soil adsorption studies malathion exhibited medium mobility. There was no evidence of pH dependant adsorption. MDCA exhibited very high to high mobility with adsorption being pH dependent with lower adsorption at higher soil pH. The adsorption of MMCA could not be measured in batch adsorption studies due to its very rapid degradation. However it is considered it will have high to very high mobility depending on soil pH, based on extrapolation of the results from MDCA.
   In sediment water systems malathion exhibited very low persistence breaking down to the major metabolites MMCA (which exhibited low persistence) and MDCA (which exhibited medium persistence). All the compounds remained primarily in the water phase of the test sediment water systems. Mineralization of the a carbon radiolabels in each ester moiety accounted for 58-69 % AR after 120 days at 20 degrees C. Residues not extracted from sediment by acidified acetonitrile followed by Soxhlet extraction with acetone were also a sink for radioactivity representing 25-36% AR at 120 days. Levels of extractable radioactivity in sediment were relatively low (< 15% AR) at all sampling times. MDCA was the largest proportion of this sediment extractable radioactivity but it accounted for a maximum of only 7.5% AR.
   For the representative use on strawberry appropriate aquatic exposure assessment in accordance with FOCUS 2001 surface water guidance is available for malathion and its metabolites MMCA and MDCA. In addition for malathion spray drift mitigation was implemented in aquatic exposure assessments in accordance with FOCUS 2007 landscape and mitigation guidance. This assessment has been demonstrated to encompass the exposure expected from the use assessed on glasshouse ornamentals, when a Dutch procedure for estimating emissions from glasshouses to surface water is followed.
   The available FOCUS groundwater modelling indicates that the potential for groundwater contamination as a consequence of the applied for representative uses (both in the original application and in the resubmission application) for malathion and its major soil metabolites MMCA and MDCA is minimal. (This may not be the case for other field uses especially if applications are possible over the late autumn and winter period. The available modelling indicated that in this situation contamination of vulnerable shallow groundwater by MDCA might be expected).
   Data were not available to conclude on the acute and long-term risk to insectivorous birds following application in strawberries. The risk is however considered low for all mammals and frugivorous birds. Based on the data available, malathion was considered to be very toxicto aquatic organisms. Acute toxicity to fish and toxicity to invertebrates was driving the aquatic risk assessment for use in strawberries. Based on FOCUSsw Step 4 exposure data including maximum mitigation measures the risk was considered low in three out of four scenarios. The toxicity to bees was identified as high and risk mitigation measures should be set at Member State level. No risk mitigations measures were needed to protect other nontarget arthropods off field. The risk of malathion to earthworms, other soil macro- and microorganisms, non-target flora and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. However, a data gap was defined to address the potential risk to earthworms for the enantiomer forms of the metabolite MDCA.

AB  - Quizalofop-P is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.(1) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted a DAR on the variant quizalofop-Pethyl and a DAR on the variant quizalofop-P-tefuryl in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which were received by the EFSA on 1 February 2007 and 2 May 2007 respectively. The peer review was initiated on 24 October 2007 by dispatching the DARs for consultation of the Member States and the respective notifiers Nissan Chemical Europe SARL and Chemtura Europe Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DARs were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting tables. These tables were evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of quizalofop-Pethyl as a herbicide on sugar beet and quizalofop-P-tefuryl as a herbicide on oilseed rape, sugar/fodder beet, potato, combining pea, field beans, linseed and sunflower. Full details of the good agricultural practice (GAP) can be found in the attached list of endpoints.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation of quizalofop-P-ethyl was 'Targa Super', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). For quizalofop-P-tefuryl the representative formulation was 'Panarex' (also known as 'Pantera'), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).
   For food of plant and animal origin none of the methods supplied comply with the residue definition. For environmental matrices sufficient methods are available. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. The specification for the ethyl variant was not accepted as further justification is required. Data gaps for surface tension and persistent foam were identified. For the tefuryl variant the specification was acceptable for section 1, although there is an outstanding question on the formation of the isomeric impurity of quizalofop. A data gap was identified for a method of analysis to separate the R and S isomers (note this is not the R and S isomers in the tefuryl part of the molecule). A data gap was also identified for kinematic viscosity for aspiration hazard classification.
   Quizalofop-P-tefuryl tested in mammalian toxicology is "Harmful if swallowed" (Xn; R22 proposed based on oral Lethal Dose - LD50 1012 mg/kg bw); it has low dermal and inhalation toxicity (LD50 >2000 mg/kg bw and Lethal Concentration - LC50 >3.9 mg/L air, respectively). Quizalofop-P-tefuryl is not a skin or eye irritant, but it is a skin sensitiser in Magnusson-Kligman test (Xn; R43 "May cause sensitisation by skin contact" was proposed). Short-term toxicity target organs were liver and testes. In rodents, the relevant No Observed Adverse Effect Level - NOAEL (rat study) was 1.7 mg/kg bw/day based on increased liver weights, accentuated lobulation of the liver and haematological and clinical chemistry findings at 33.4 mg/kg bw/day. Kidney, testis and body weights were decreased at 134 mg/kg bw/day. Quizalofop-P-tefuryl did not show genotoxic concern. In long-term toxicity studies the relevant NOAEL is 1.3 mg/kg bw/day. Quizalofop-P-tefuryl caused an increased incidence of rare renal squamous cell carcinoma, as well as a clear treatment related increase in the Leydig cell tumours in rats; the liver tumours occurring in rodents were not relevant to humans. On this basis Carc Cat, 3; R40 "Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect" was proposed. In the two-generation rat study, the NOAEL for parental and offspring was 1.4 mg/kg bw/day based on increased liver weight and liver hypertrophy in adult males and females, vacuolar changes in pituitary in adult males, decreased body weights during lactation in F1 generation and decreased viability during early lactation. The NOAEL for reproduction was 16.9 mg/kg bw/day. In developmental toxicity studies in rats the maternal NOAEL was set at 10 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the developmental NOAEL was 30 mg/kg bw/day based on increased postimplantation loss per dam with concomitant lower number of viable foetuses and increased number of malformations at maternally toxic dose. In rabbits, the NOAEL was 20 mg/kg bw/day for maternal and developmental toxicity. However, the rabbit was not adequately tested but this was considered not to preclude concluding on the risk assessment. Due to the limitations of the studies, Repr. Cat. 3; R63? ("Possible risk of harm to the unborn child") was agreed for proposal to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.013 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL of the 2-year study in rats, SF 100.
   The NOAEL of 1.7 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat study was the most relevant NOAEL, also based on its dosing regime, and applying a 60% correction factor (limited oral absorption) and SF 100 resulted in an Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) of 0.1 mg/kg bw was based on the maternal toxicity seen in the rat developmental study with a SF 100 applied. The estimated operator exposure exceeded the AOEL without the use of PPE, as well as with PPE but only with the UK POEM. The exposure was estimated below the AOEL (13%) applying the German model, with the use of gloves during mixing/loading and application and coverall and sturdy footwear during application. The exposure for workers re-entering the field for crop inspection and the bystander estimated exposure were estimated to be below the AOEL (for workers re-entering in ornamentals the use of gloves is needed).
   Quizalofop-P-ethyl is "Harmful if swallowed" (Xn; R22 proposed based on oral LD50 1182 mg/kg bw); dermal and inhalation acute toxicity is low (LD50 >5000 mg/kg bw and LC50 5.8 mg/L air, respectively). Quizalofop-P-ethyl is not a skin or eye irritant, nor does it show any sensitisation potential. Target organ in repeat dose studies was shown to be the liver. The lowest short-term NOAEL for quizalofop-P-ethyl is 1.7 mg/kg bw/day in mice study after 13-week (90-day) dietary administration, whereas the relevant long- term NOAEL is 0.9 mg/kg bw/day (2-year study in rats). Quizalofop-P-ethyl did not exhibit genotoxic or carcinogenic properties relevant to humans. It is not a reproductive or developmental toxicant: the NOAEL for offspring is 2.4 mg/kg bw/day based on hepatoxicity; the parental NOAEL is 9.4 mg/kg bw/day based on slightly decreased body weight during premating period, whereas the reproductive NOAEL is 37.8 mg/kg bw/day, highest dose tested. The maternal and developmental NOAEL in rats is 30 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight gain and food consumption, increased resorptions and skeletal variations at >= 100 mg/kg bw/day. In rabbits, no malformations were observed up to doses of 60 mg/kg bw/day, which represented the NOAEL for developmental toxicity, whereas the maternal NOAEL for dams was 30 mg/kg bw/day based on slightly decreased body weight and food consumption and decreased thymus and thyroid weights at 60 mg/kg bw/day. Quizalofop-P-ethyl does not have a potential to induce neurotoxicity in mammals. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.009 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-yr rat study with an SF 100; The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 90-day mouse study with an SF 100 (corrected for limited oral absorption of 67%). Due to the toxicological profile of quizalofop-P-ethyl, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not triggered. The operator exposure assessment was estimated to be below the AOEL (26%) with the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE, with the German model). The exposure for workers re-entering field for crop inspection and the bystander estimated exposure were estimated to be below the AOEL (for workers the use of gloves is needed).
   For both quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl, the metabolism in plants was investigated in potato, cotton and soya; the ethyl variant was additionally investigated in sugar beet. For quizalofop-P-tefuryl, one radioactive label was investigated and considering the insufficient metabolite characterisation in some studies, the meeting concluded that new studies labelled in a second position need to be provided. For both variants, the metabolism proceeds primarily by the hydrolysis of the ester link to yield quizalofop (acid) followed by the loss of the propionyl moiety leading to the quizalofop-phenol metabolite. Further metabolism occurs by hydroxylation of the quinoxaline moiety giving the hydroxy-quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol and the dihydroxy-quizalofop-phenol. In addition, the presence of the quinoxaline and phenoxy metabolites indicated a cleavage of the parent molecule. Parts of these different metabolites were also found as conjugates.
   The meeting discussed whether the phenoxy propionate and hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol metabolites which were observed in beet foliage and soya meal in similar amounts to the tefuryl ester or to quizalofop, have to be included in the plant residue definition and if they have to be taken into account in the animal feeding. Finally and provisionally, the experts decided not to include these compounds in the residue definition, awaiting a statement on their toxicological relevance, and proposed the following residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment for each individual ester variant:
   "Sum of quizalofop-ester, quizalofop and quizalofop conjugates expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers)"
   Considering the metabolism studies performed with the three quizalofop ester variants, a common residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was also proposed for propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl as:
   "Sum of quizalofop-esters, quizalofop and quizalofop conjugates expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers)"
   These definitions should remain provisional, pending the submission and the evaluation of the requested additional information. After the meeting and considering that conjugates were mainly detected in immature soya and cotton plants, the EFSA proposed not to include these conjugates in the residue definitions, especially for monitoring since the ethyl variant, tefuryl variant and quizalofop seem to be sufficient markers for the residues in plants.
   In addition for quizalofop-P-ethyl, the meeting was of the opinion that the metabolism pattern has not been sufficiently described in root crops. No characterisations were performed in potato tubers and a substantial part of the extracted radioactivity was not identified in the sugar beet. Therefore, it was concluded that these studies were not sufficient to validate the proposed residue definition on the root/tuber plant group, especially on potato. However, and considering that no metabolites are expected at significant levels in sugar beet root, it was agreed that the proposed residue definition could be applied to beet root. The notifier was requested to provide further information concerning the unidentified fractions observed in the beet studies, unless a new metabolism study has to be submitted for tuber/root crops.
   For quizalofop-P-ethyl, supervised residue trials were submitted to support a single representative use on sugar beet only. The trials performed with the highest LOQ of 0.10 mg/kg were removed from the data set and a MRL of 0.05 mg/kg was proposed for sugar beet roots. For quizalofop-P-tefuryl, a sufficient number of residue trials were submitted to propose MRLs on potato, sugar beet, bean, pea, lentil, oilseed rape, linseed, soya and sunflower. Samples were analysed using a method quantifying separately the parent quizalofop-P-tefuryl and its free and conjugated metabolites (including quizalofop) which can be converted to 2-methoxy-6-chloroquinoxaline, but this method was only validated for the tefuryl variant and quizalofop. This method was considered as appropriate in the framework of this peer review since its scope is wider than the compounds included in the proposed residue definition.
   The storage stability study showed that quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop residues are stable for at least 16 months in beet matrices. However, an additional study on oil/protein matrices was requested in order to support the results of the rotational crop study. Quizalofop-P-tefuryl and quizalofop residues were shown to be stable up to 12 - 24 months in a wider range of plant matrices (soya beans, cotton seeds, rape seed oil and cake, potato tubers). A degradation from the ester quizalofop-P-tefuryl to quizalofop was observed in beet matrices after one month, but generally recoveries were more than 80% when both quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop residues were added up. Clarifications were requested concerning the different analytical methods used in these storage stability studies and especially concerning the validation for "bound residues".
   No processing study was provided for quizalofop-P-ethyl as no residues were detected in beet roots following the use of the active substance as stated in the critical GAP. For quizalofop-P-tefuryl, a standard hydrolytic study was provided but for the boiling condition only and a new study covering the full range of the processing conditions was requested. No processing factors could be derived from the rapeseed study since the residues detected in all processed fractions (crude oil, refined oil, pressed cake etc.) were considered to be not consistent with the initial levels observed in seeds. A new processing study was requested, unless clarifications could be provided. On potatoes, the residue levels were not affected in boiled potatoes but were increased in fried potatoes.
   The compounds detected in the rotational crops studies performed with quizalofop-ethyl (racemate) and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were also present in the primary crops, suggesting a similar metabolic pathway in both primary and rotational crops. Considering the residue levels observed in these studies, it was concluded that no significant residues of quizalofop-ethyl, quizalofop-P-tefuryl and of their metabolites are expected in rotational crops.
   The metabolism in animals was investigated using the racemate quizalofop-ethyl labelled on the phenyl and quinoxaline moieties in the goat study but only on the quinoxaline moiety in the hen study. This single radio-labelling was considered as sufficient in the scope of this peer review, since the intended use on sugar beet does not lead to significant intake by poultry. For quizalofop-P-tefuryl, the metabolism studies on goat and hen were conducted using a single label only. Considering that the characterisation/identification of the metabolites was insufficiently investigated in some animal matrices, a new study using a second labelling position was requested. Similar metabolic pathways were observed for both ester variants, starting with rapid hydrolysis of the ester bond leading to the acid quizalofop and followed by hydroxylation or further hydrolysis giving the hydroxy-quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol, these metabolites being subject to conjugation. In the hen study, quizalofop-pentanoic acid was also observed as a major metabolite in liver and kidney. The very low proportion of quinoxaline metabolites (<1% TRR) indicated limited cleavage of the parent molecule. Considering the comparative metabolite distribution in rat and goat for quizalofop-P-ethyl, the experts discussed whether a supplementary metabolism study in pig should be requested. The metabolism in rat and ruminants was similar qualitatively but differences were observed quantitatively. Higher residues were detected in rat on an equivalent mg/kg bw basis, some differences being of a 10-fold magnitude. Before asking for a pig metabolism study, it was suggested to ask the notifiers to provide explanations for these quantitative differences. No comparison was possible for quizalofop-P-tefuryl since the dosages of the metabolites in rat and goat were performed at different time points. Finally and provisionally the meeting of experts proposed the following residue definitions for each individual variant:
   For monitoring: sum of quizalofop-ester and quizalofop expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers).
   For risk assessment: sum of quizalofop-ester, quizalofop pentanoic acid and quizalofop, expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers).
   Considering the metabolism studies performed with the three ester variants, the meeting of experts concluded that the following common residue definitions can be proposed for propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl:
   For monitoring: sum of quizalofop-esters and quizalofop expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers).
   For risk assessment: sum of quizalofop-esters, quizalofop pentanoic acid and quizalofop, expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers).
   These definitions should remain provisional, pending submission and the evaluation of the requested additional information and the statement on the toxicological relevance of some metabolites.
   No feeding studies were submitted for quizalofop-P-ethyl and considering the metabolism studies performed with an exaggerated dose rate, it was concluded that no significant residues are expected in animal matrices resulting from the use of quizalofop-P-ethyl on sugar beet. Feeding studies in cow and hen were submitted for quizalofop-P-tefuryl. Taking into account the transfer in animal products and the theoretical animal burden resulting from the representative uses of quizalofop-P-tefuryl, residue levels above the LOQs are expected in ruminant kidney and in poultry liver, kidney and fat. MRLs were proposed for these animal products. The stability of the residues in products of animal origin was however considered as insufficiently demonstrated and the notifier was asked to provide new data.
   Using the EFSA consumer model and considering the representative use of quizalofop-P-ethyl on sugar beet, no chronic concern was observed, the theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) being less than 13% of the ADI (0.009 mg/kg bw/d). Considering the MRLs proposed for plant and animal products, no chronic and acute concerns were observed for quizalofop-P-tefuryl, the maximum TMDI using the EFSA model being 23% of the ADI (0.013 mg/kg bw/d) and the maximum international estimated short-term intake (IESTI), 31% of the ARfD (0.1 mg/kg bw/d).
   Awaiting the additional information/ clarification requested during the peer review process, provisional MRLs were proposed for sugar beet, potato, bean and pea (without pods), lentils, soybeans, oil seed rape and sunflower. MRLs were also proposed for products of animal origin, based on the quizalofop-P-tefuryl representative uses.
   In the environmental fate and behaviour section, the data sets for the common metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop and dihydroxy-quinoxaline available in the DARs of propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were combined in order to derive a single set of endpoints (amalgamated list of endpoints) for the fate properties of each metabolite to use in the environmental exposure assessment.
   In soil under aerobic conditions quizalofop-P-tefuryl exhibits very low persistence forming the major soil metabolites quizalofop (accounting for up to 101.5% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to high persistence, hydroxy-quizalofop (accounting for up to 21% AR) which exhibits low to medium persistence, dihydroxy-quinoxaline (accounting for up to 18% AR) which exhibits moderate to high persistence, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (accounting for up to 59% AR) which exhibits very low persistence. The metabolite tetrahydrofuroic acid (up to 9.3% AR) was present at levels that trigger a groundwater exposure assessment. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring, the furfuryl group or the quinoxaline group to carbon dioxide accounted for 2.3 - 70% AR after 30 - 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 15 - 50% AR after 30 - 120 days. Due to the rapid degradation of quizalofop-P-tefuryl in soil under aerobic conditions, batch equilibrium studies with the parent compound were not performed. A worst case value of 0 mL/g and 1/n = 1 was selected for use in FOCUS scenario calculations of groundwater exposure potential. Quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop exhibit low to high mobility in soil, and dihydroxyquinoxaline exhibits low to very high mobility in soil. There was no indication in the available data that adsorption of either quizalofop-P-tefuryl or its identified soil metabolites is pH dependent.
   In dark natural sediment water systems quizalofop-P-tefuryl degraded very rapidly to the metabolites quizalofop (max. 94% AR in water and max. 53% AR in the sediment) tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (max. 16.5% AR in the water), tetrahydrofuroic acid (max. 39.1% AR in the water), CQOP (max. 11.6% in the sediment) and dihydroxy-quinoxaline (max. 16.4% AR in the sediment). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for quizalofop-P-tefuryl. After the peer review for metabolites quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop, the EFSA performed new FOCUS SW calculations at Steps 1 and 2 using the endpoints agreed in the amalgamated list of endpoints. The recalculated initial predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECsw) was used in the toxicity exposure ratio (TER) calculations for these two metabolites. For metabolites CQOP, dihydroxy-quinoxaline, tetrahydrofuroic acid and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol no reliable PECsw and predicted environmental concentration in sediment (PECsed) were available. However, as the risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to CQOP, dihydroxy-quinoxaline, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol is assessed to be low when the initial PEC values for quizalofop are used, no further assessment is required for these metabolites. No recalculations for tetrahydrofuroic acid were necessary. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by quizalofop-P-tefuryl and its metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop, dihydroxy-quinoxaline, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofuroic acid above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   In soil under aerobic conditions quizalofop-P-ethyl exhibits low to very low persistence, forming the major soil metabolites quizalofop (accounting for up to 84% AR) which exhibits low to high persistence, metabolite hydroxy-quizalofop accounting for up to 16% AR which exhibits low to medium persistence, and metabolite dihydroxy-quinoxaline accounting for up to 12% AR which exhibits moderate to high persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring or the quinoxaline group to carbon dioxide accounted for 1.8 - 32% AR after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 23 - 42% AR after 120 days. Quizalofop-P-ethyl exhibits low to slight mobility in soil. Quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop exhibit low to high mobility in soil, and dihydroxy-quinoxaline exhibits low to very high mobility in soil. There was no indication in the available data that adsorption of either quizalofop-P-tefuryl or its identified soil metabolites was pH dependent. In dark natural water/sediment systems quizalofop-P-ethyl degraded very rapidly to the metabolite quizalofop (max. 83% AR in water and max. 43% AR in the sediment). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach with Steps 1 and 2 for quizalofop-P-tefuryl, quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop and dihydroxy-quinoxaline. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by quizalofop-P-ethyl and its metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop, and dihydroxy-quinoxaline above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   Aquatic and terrestrial ecotoxicological endpoints for the common metabolites of propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were assessed by Member State experts. Where more than one study was available for the same metabolite in the dossiers for propaquizafop, quizalofop-Pethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl, the lower valid endpoint was agreed to be used in all relevant risk assessments.
   The acute, short-term and long-term risk to birds from quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl was assessed as low for the intended uses. For mammals, a revised long-term endpoint was agreed for quizalofop-P-ethyl in the meeting of experts. The acute and long-term risk to mammals from quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl was assessed as low for the intended uses. The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from the common plant metabolites was considered to be low. The risk from consumption of contaminated drinking water was assessed as low for the intended uses of both ester variants. The risk from secondary poisoning was assessed as low for the intended uses of both ester variants and for the common metabolites.
   Both quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl was found to be very toxic to aquatic organisms, based on the lower acute endpoints for algae and fish respectively. The risk from both active substances was assessed as low for the intended uses, based on FOCUS Step 2 PEC calculations. The aquatic risk assessment for metabolites was revised, based on the agreed endpoints for metabolites and PEC values derived from the GAP of quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl. Metabolite PEC values from the DAR of quizalofop-P-ethyl were used in the risk assessment, whereas EFSA did calculate new worst case PEC values for quizalofop-P-ethyl metabolites after the peer review. The risk to aquatic organisms from metabolites was assessed as low, based on FOCUS Step 2 and 3 for quizalofop-P-tefuryl and quizalofop-P-ethyl respectively. No risk from bio-accumulation was foreseen for quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl or any of the metabolites. In the initial assessment for non-target arthropods a potential in-field risk was identified from the use of quizalofop-P-ethyl. Extended laboratory studies were provided for relevant non-target arthropod species. The risk was addressed for all tested species, except for Typhlodromus pyri where the meeting of experts agreed that the in-field risk still needed to be addressed. For the uses of quizalofop-P-tefuryl the initial assessment indicated a high risk to T. pyri and Aphidius rhopalosiphi, both in-field and off-field. Extended laboratory studies were provided to address the risk for relevant species. A data gap was, however, agreed in the meeting of experts for the notifier to address the risk to Chrysoperla carnea. The risk assessment for non-target plants from intended uses of quizalofop-Pethyl indicated a need for no-spray buffer zones of 10 m to address the risk to the most sensitive plant species. No valid data were submitted to address the risk to non-target plants from the intended uses of quizalofop-P-tefuryl and a data gap was agreed during the peer review. A study was also required for quizalofop-P-tefuryl to address the risk to biological methods for sewage treatment. An assessment of the risk to biological methods for sewage treatment was provided in the DAR on quizalofop-P-ethyl, indicating a low risk. The risk to bees, earthworms, soil non-target micro-and macro-organisms was assessed as low for the intended uses of quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-Ptefuryl.

AB  - Fluopicolide is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC2 the United Kingdom received an application from Bayer for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2005/778/EC3.
   Following the agreement with the EU-Commission EFSA will organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after 30 June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State the United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on fluopicolide, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 12 December 2005.
   The peer review was initiated on 11 January 2006 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation to the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in a written procedure in March 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in November / December 2007 and in January 2009.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States in a written procedure in April 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier which comprise foliar spraying to vine grapes against downy mildew and to potatoes against late blight. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the attached end points.
   The representative formulated products for the evaluation were, 'AE F053616 06 WG71 A1'. or, 'EXP 11074B', a water dispersible granule (WG), containing 44.4 g/kg fluopicolide and 666.7 g/kg fosetyl-aluminium and, 'AE B066752 04 SC61 A1'. or, 'EXP 11120A', a suspension concentrate (SC), containing 62.5 g/L fluopicolide and 625 g/L propamocarb hydrochloride.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant and animal origin and environmental matrices. Since fluopicolide is not classified as acute toxic or very toxic, analytical methods for the determination of residues of fluopicolide in body fluids and/or tissues are not required.
   In the mammalian metabolism studies, fluopicolide was moderately rapidly but incompletely absorbed orally (approximately 62 %) and widely distributed. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation, fluopicolide was extensively metabolised and rapidly excreted mainly via faeces.
   The acute toxicity of fluopicolide in rats was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route, no skin irritation and only slight irritation to the eyes were observed. Fluopicolide did not exhibit skin sensitisation potential. The liver was the main target organ of fluopicolide in short-term tests in rats, mice and dogs. A sub-acute NOAEL of 17.7 mg/kg bw/day was based on the 28-day rat study. The relevant short term NOAEL was 7.4 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day dietary study in rat, based on haematological changes, clinical signs, liver and kidney toxicity at the next higher dose level of 109 mg/kg bw/day. As indicated in a mechanistic study, fluopicolide appears to be a phenobarbital-like inducer of liver enzymes. It is unlikely that fluopicolide presents a genotoxic hazard to humans. In a chronic rat study, effects on liver and kidneys were observed, but no tumour induction was found. Similarly, in a chronic study with mice, liver toxicity was observed. The increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas seen at high dose was considered not relevant for human risk assessment based on mechanistic considerations. Accordingly, no classification for carcinogenicity was proposed. The relevant long term NOAEL was based on the mice study with a NOAEL of 7.9 mg/kg bw/day, which was supported by the rat NOAEL of 8.4 mg/kg bw/day.
   In a two-generation study no effect on reproduction or fertility was seen. Premature delivery, effects on body weight (dams and pups) and reduced crown-rump lengths at maternally toxic doses were observed in developmental studies in rats and rabbits; the relevant developmental NOAEL was the dose level of 20 mg/kg bw/ day from the rabbit study.
   A series of fluopicolide metabolites were assessed for their toxicological relevance with the aid of toxicological studies conducted with M01(4), M02(5), M04(6), M05(7), M10(8) and M14(9). Plant metabolites M04, M05, M08(10) and M09(11), were considered less toxic than the parent. The M01 metabolite may be considered of comparable toxicity as the parent, although slightly more acutely toxic. In principle, the ADI of the parent could have been applied, however, as an acceptable set of studies were conducted with M01 and considering that M01 is also a metabolite of another active substance, an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.05 mg/kg bw/day was set for this metabolite as well as an acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.3 mg/kg bw. The metabolites M01, M03(12), M05, M10, M11(13), M12(14), M13(15) and M14 were not considered relevant according to the guidance document on groundwater metabolites(16) even if they appear at levels above 0.1 mu g/L in groundwater, however information is lacking on the metabolite M15(17), which was not peer-reviewed.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of fluopicolide was set at 0.08 mg/kg bw/day derived from the 78-week dietary study in mice and supported by the 2-year study in rats; a safety factor of 100 was applied. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was set at 0.05 mg/kg bw/day, derived from the 90-day rat study, corrected for limited oral absorption of 62 % and applying a safety factor of 100. The acute reference dose (ARfD) was set at 0.18 mg/kg bw, derived from the 28-day dietary rat study and the rabbit developmental study, applying a safety factor of 100.
   For both representative preparations, the dermal absorption values were agreed at 0.24 % for the concentrate and 2.75 % for the in-use spray dilution. Considering only the fluopicolide component of these formulations, the level of operator exposure estimated at a maximum dose rate of 0.133 kg fluopicolide/ha in grapevines and 0.1 kg fluopicolide/ha in potatoes was below the AOEL for all scenarios proposed when gloves were used during mixing/loading and application and even when no personal protective equipment (PPE) was considered according to the German model and EUROPOEM. Estimated exposures for unprotected re-entry workers and bystanders were below the AOEL for both fluopicolide representative formulations.
   Metabolism of fluopicolide was investigated in grapes, potatoes and lettuce. Metabolism was found to be moderate. Besides fluopicolide, its metabolites M-01, M-02 and M-06 were identified. With the exception of M-01 for which an ADI and an ARfD was set by the toxicology section, the metabolites were regarded as less toxic than the parent and/ or were also found in the rat metabolism studies. It was decided to include M-01 in the residue definition for risk assessment for plant matrices. As the metabolite M-01 is not unique to fluopicolide it was not included in the residue definition for monitoring. A sufficient number of residue trials on grapes and potatoes supporting the notified GAPs have been submitted to propose MRLs for these crops.
   Metabolism in rotational crops was found to be similar, but more extensive as in primary crops. Additionally identified metabolites were M-04, M-05, M-08 and M-09. On the basis of the results of field studies on rotational crops, no quantifiable levels of fluopicolide are expected in consumable crop parts.
   Metabolism studies on lactating diary and laying hens showed a low transfer into tissues, milk and eggs. Metabolism was extensive, mainly by hydroxylation followed by conjugation. The only hydrolysis product identified was metabolite M-01, which was included in the residue definition for risk assessment because of its toxicological potential. Dietary burden calculations showed only significant intake of fluopicolide residues for cattle. On the basis of available feeding studies on lactating cows, no quantifiable residues are expected in products of bovine.
   Chronic and acute dietary intake calculations showed that an exceedance of ADI or ARfD is not expected for intake of crops after treatment with fluopicolide according to the notified GAPs. The level of 0.75 mu g/L is expected to be exceeded in groundwater by metabolites M-01, M-05, M-10 and M-11. A consumer risk assessment for the consumption of drinking water for these metabolites showed that an exceedance of the relevant reference values is not expected after chronic or acute intake of fluopicolide through drinking water.
   Fluopicolide is of high to very high persistence in soil (DT50 (lab) (20) (degrees C) = 194 d - 411 d) under aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. In soil fluopicolide forms the metabolite M-03. This compound breaks down to M-01 and M-02. The metabolite M- 03 is of low persistence (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 2.2 - 5.0 d) in soils at acidic pH and of very low persistence (DT50 lab 20 degrees C < 5h) in soils at neutral or slightly alkaline pH and may be considered an intermediate in the formation of M-01 and M-02. M- 01 is of very high persistence in soil (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 557 - 1831 d) and M- 02 is of low persistence (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 3.2 - 4.6 d). No other metabolites were detected in significant amounts in the laboratory soil studies. Extent of degradation in sterilized and non sterilized samples was in the same range, indicating little contribution of microbiological degradation. M-01 was shown to be very stable in the two soils where it was investigated. Degradation of M-02 produced an extensive number of pyridine derivatives. Some of them were identified and characterized: M-10, M-05, M-14, M-11/12 and M-13. M-05 and M-10 are moderate to high persistent (M-05: DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 31 - 130 d; M- 10: 22 - 253 d), M-14 is low persistent in soil (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 5- 8 d). RMS considered that values obtained for half lives metabolites M-11/12 (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 38.5 - 86.1 d), M-13 (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 10.3 - 43.0 d), and M-10 (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 4.5 - 307 d) were not robust due to low and variable levels of these metabolites but acceptable to be used in groundwater modelling.
   Fluopicolide was very stable under dark anaerobic conditions and only metabolites M- 01 and M- 02 were identified at minor amounts.
   Photolysis degradation occurs to some extend but no new metabolites are identified in the available studies. On the absence of further data, the meeting considered that photolysis may contribute to some extend to the degradation of fluopicolide under natural conditions in EU and that the applicant should update their estimate of photolytic half life at 40 - 45 degrees N latitude.
   Dissipation of fluopicolide under field conditions has been investigated in a number of field dissipation studies in Germany (3 studies, 3 sites), Spain, Southern France and Northern France. One of the studies performed in Germany and the studies performed in France were prolonged over some seasons to investigate the potential for accumulation of fluopicolide residues. Dissipation in most of the cases was better described by a biphasic model. Three soil dissipation and accumulation studies were conducted by the applicant in Germany (one site, 5 years), Northern France (one site, 4 years) and Southern France (one site, 4 years). The expert meeting agreed with the RMS and confirmed the initial evaluation that indicates that the plateau has not been reached in some of the studies.
   For PEC soil calculations, the PRAPeR 37 expert meeting agreed using a SFO DT50 = 290 d for fluopicolide and a SFO DT50 = 315 d for M01 since they result in DT90 corresponding approximately to the worst case observed in the field studies. Potential for accumulation of fluopicolide and the metabolite M- 01 was confirmed by the PEC soil calculation (plateau are reached for the parent after 7 years in potatoes and after 9 years in vines and for the metabolite M-01 after 5 years in potatoes and 6 years in vines). Fluopicolide exhibits medium mobility in soil (K-Foc = 172 - 580 mL/g). M-01 and M-02 are very high mobile in soil (M-01: K-Foc = 31 - 51 mL / g; M-02: K-Foc = 1.1 - 10.5 mL / g). The metabolite M-03 is high mobile in acidic soil (K-Foc = 82 - 133 mL / g). Finally the metabolites M-05 and M-10 are very high mobile in soil (M-05: K-Foc = 11 - 49 mL / g; M-10: K-Foc = 0 - 10.66 mL / g).
   A three years lysimeter study was performed in Germany. Due to the fact that fluopicoline was only labelled at the pyridine ring, no information on the potential leaching of M-01 was obtained from these experiments. A number of metabolites not previously identified in the laboratory degradation in soil studies were identified in the leachate of these lysimeter studies: M-05 (max. annual average concentration = 0.9 mu g / L), M-10 (max. annual average concentration = 0.83 mu g / L), M-11/12 (max. annual average concentration = 0.55/0.36 mu g / L), M-13 (max. annual average concentration = 0.14 mu g / L), M-14 (max. annual average concentration = 0.19 mu g / L), M-15 (max. annual average concentration = 0.095 mu g / L), M- 16 (max. annual average concentration = 0.08 mu g / L), M54 (max. annual average concentration = 0.03 mu g / L), P6A (max. annual average concentration = 0.03 mu g / L), P6A (max. annual average concentration = 0.07 mu g / L), M3 (max. annual average concentration = 0.04 mu g / L) and M29 (max. annual average concentration = 0.09 mu g / L)(18).
   The mobility of the lysimeter metabolites M- 14, M-11/12 and M-13 was assessed with the HPLC method. All these metabolites are very high mobile. Due to the high polarity of M11/12 and M13, the results obtained were considered meaningless and a K-oc = 0 was assumed for the risk assessment. For M-14 was possible to estimate acceptable soil sorption parameters (K-oc = 19.2 mL / g).
   A field leaching study in South West Germany is also available. Metabolite M-01 reached annual average concentrations up to 2.93 mu g / L at 120 cm depth on the third year after application.
   Fluopicolide and its metabolite M-01 may be considered stable to hydrolysis under most relevant environmental conditions. Hydrolysis M-03 was pH dependent with half lives between 45.5 h (pH 5.1) to 9 min (pH 8.1).
   Aqueous photolysis is unlikely to be a significant route of degradation of fluopicolide in the natural aqueous environment.
   Fluopicolide and M-01 compounds should be considered not readily biodegradable.
   Degradation of fluopicolide in the water sediment systems was very limited. RMS calculated whole systems half lives for fluopicolide in both systems (DT50 (whole system) = 873 - 1428 d). During the experiment, fluopicolide was partitioned to the sediment. At the equilibrium about 10 to 40 % AR remained as parent fluopicolide in the water phase. Only M-01 and M-02 were identified as degradation metabolites at low levels.
   PECSW / SED values were calculated by means of FOCUS SW. FOCUS Step 1-2 were calculated for fluopicolide and metabolites M-01, M-02 and M-03. FOCUS SW Step 3 values were also calculated for fluopicolide.
   The potential of ground water contamination by fluopicolide and the metabolites M-03, M-01, M-02, M-05, M-10, M-11, M-12, M-14 and M-13 was assessed in the original dossier for the use in vines and potatoes with FOCUS PELMO 3.3.2. Further modelling with FOCUS PEARL has become available during the peer review. Fluopicolide and its metabolites M-03, M-01, M-05, M-10, M-11, M-12 and M-13 may exceed the limit of 0.1 mu g / L annual average concentration at 1 m depth for at least one of the scenarios simulated. The metabolite M-01 also exceeded the limit of 0.75 mu g / L in a number of scenarios. For the use in vines fluopicolide exceeds 0.1 mu g / L annual average concentration at 1 m depth for more than half of the scenarios simulated.
   In the lysimeter study, where potatoes were planted, annual average concentration of metabolites M-05, M-10, M-11, M-12, M-13 and M-15 at 1 m depth exceed the 0.1 mu g / L trigger, in the case of M-05 and M-10 also the trigger of 0.75 mu g / L was exceeded in at least one of the lysimeters in oneout of of the three years the experiment was performed. In the field leaching study metabolite M-01 reached an annual average concentration of 2.9 mu g / L in the leachate at 120 cm depth the third year after the product was applied.
   Since half life in the atmosphere is longer than 2 d and fluopicolide is sprayed, formation of aerosols and long range transport trough the atmosphere cannot be excluded.
   It was concluded that the risk for birds and mammals was assessed as low for both evaluated uses, except for the long-term risk for mammals for the use in vines. Risk mitigation measures should be required at Member Stated level. The risk from secondary poisoning and from consumption of contaminated drinking water was assessed to be low for birds and mammals.
   A potential high risk was identified for the aquatic organism for both evaluated uses, therefore risk mitigation measures were required. The risk for bioaccumulation in fish from fluopicolide is considered to be low. The risk for the relevant metabolites to aquatic organism was assessed as low.
   The risk for bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, other non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organism, non-target plants and biological methods for swage treatments, was assessed to be low.

AB  - Clofentezine is one of the 79 substances of the third stage part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2).
   Clofentezine was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 July 2008 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.
   The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on clofentezine in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 22 August 2005. The peer review was initiated on 17 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Makhteshim Agan International Coordination Centre. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in August-September 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January 2009.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in March 2009.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as acaricide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in pome fruit, stone fruit, grapes, strawberries and ornamentals for the control of mites. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Apollo 50 SC', a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 500 g/L clofentezine, registered under different trade names in Europe.
   The minimum purity of clofentezine technical could not be concluded on, as the original manufacturing site was no longer in use, and the data on the new source could not be considered in the peer review.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor clofentezine residues in food/feed of plant origin and environmental matrices, however a data gap was identified for a confirmatory method for determination of clofentezine in commodities with high water content. Furthermore, pending on the final residue definition for products of animal origin, a data gap was identified for a fully validated method for the determination of the compounds in the residue definition.
   In mammals, clofentezine is of low acute oral, dermal and inhalational toxicity; it is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a skin sensitiser. The main toxicological effect after repeated oral administration to mice, rats, and dogs was liver enlargement. The relevant short-term No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) are 2.65 mg/kg bw/day in rats, 151.4 mg/kg bw/day in mice and 1.7 mg/kg bw/day in dogs, whereas the relevant long-term NOAELs in rats and mice are 2 mg/kg bw/day and 5 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. Clofentezine does not have a genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. Clofentezine does not affect fertility or reproductive performance. Relevant maternal and offspring NOAELs are 4 mg/kg bw/day, based on increased liver weight and reduced body weight in parents and decreased pup weight in offspring, whereas the relevant reproductive toxicity NOAEL is 27.8 mg/kg bw/day. Clofentezine does not show any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits: the relevant maternal NOAELs are 250 mg/kg bw/day (rabbit) and 320 mg/kg bw/day (rat), whereas the developmental NOAELs are 1000 mg/kg bw/day and 3200 mg/kg bw/day, in rabbits and rats, respectively. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0.02 mg/kg bw/day was based on the long-term toxicity NOAEL from the 2-year rat study, with a safety factor of 100. The overall toxicological picture of clofentezine did not justify setting an Acute Reference Dose (ARfD). The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day was based on the NOAEL from the 90-day study in rat, with a safety factor of 100 and corrected by 50 % oral absorption. In all scenarios proposed for the operator applying 'Apollo 50 SC' exposure levels are below the AOEL (mainly with the use of personal protective equipment - PPE) as well as for bystanders; worker exposure estimates shows levels below the AOEL, except for re-entry in treated pome and stone fruit crops (107 % of the AOEL, no PPE considered).
   The metabolism of clofentezine has been investigated in the fruit plant group only, on apple, lemon, peach and grape. The parent clofentezine was shown to be the major compound accounting for 55 % to 87 % of the total radioactive residue (TRR). The metabolic pathway runs through the cleavage of the tetrazine ring to form 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666), which is further oxidised to 2-chlorobenzamide (AE F092117), 2-chlorobenzyl alcohol and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (AE C500233, NC233). This degradation pathway is specific to plants, since no metabolites resulting from the cleavage of the parent compound were found in rat metabolism. Based on these studies, the plant residue definition for monitoring was limited to the parent clofentezine only. However, for risk assessment, the experts were of the opinion to include the metabolite 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666) in the residue definition, awaiting additional information on its toxicity and its toxicological relevance.
   The residue trials were sufficient to propose an MRL for strawberries grown outdoor. For the other crops, the residue database was considered not relevant and incomplete, as the residue trials were mainly performed with application rates in excess of 50 % to the representative GAPs. A new residue data set in compliance with the critical GAPs was requested for plums, grapes and apples. Clofentezine residues were shown to be stable over 2 years in high water containing matrices.
   In a standard hydrolytic study, clofentezine was totally degraded at 120 degrees C to form the metabolites hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) 3, 2-chlorobenzamide (AE F092117) and 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666). These metabolites are not covered by the rodent metabolism, and no information was provided on their toxicological relevance and their possible residue levels in the processed fractions. Therefore, no residue definition was proposed, and a new processing data set taking into account the parent clofentezine and its breakdown metabolites was requested in addition to clarification concerning their toxicity and their residue levels in the processed fractions. Transfer factors (TF) taking into account the parent clofentezine only were proposed for apple juice, apple wet and dry pomace, apple sauce, pasteurised canned strawberries and raisin. Transfer in grape juice and wine was identified as a data gap.
   No standard rotational crop study was submitted, but considering the DT90 value up to 640 days in the aerobic field studies and the fact that outdoor strawberry crops may be rotated, the EFSA is of the opinion that a standard rotational crop study has to be requested.
   The discussion concerning the metabolism of clofentezine in animals was not conclusive. No residue definition was proposed, even if there was clear evidence that the residue definition for animal products should at least include the parent clofentezine and the metabolite 4-hydroxy-clofentezine(4). Moreover, considering that the dietary intake by animals is mainly based on a processed commodity (apple pomace), it was concluded that information on the nature of the residues in the processed feed is needed prior to propose a reliable residue definition for animal products. Nevertheless, and considering the residues resulting from the representative uses, no residues above the LOQ (limit of quantification) are expected in animal matrices and there is no need to set a residue definition for animal products at the moment.
   Using to the EFSA PRIMo rev2 model, the MRL of 2.0 mg/kg is proposed for strawberries, the highest TMDI (theoretical maximum daily intake) is 7 % of the ADI.
   According to the available studies, clofentezine is moderate to high persistent in soil (DT50 = 16.8 - 109 days) under dark aerobic conditions. Under these conditions clofentezine yields two major metabolites: hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) (maximum of 13 % AR after 30 days in one soil) and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (AE C500233, NC233) (maximum of 13.6 % based on theoretical molar basis). The rapporteur Member State calculated the half-life of the metabolite hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) based on data in one soil (Cottenham) (DT50 = 43 days). This value was derived from the decline phase of the metabolite, ignoring the concomitant formation. The assessment presented by the rapporteur Member State may be regarded as a conservative estimate, since this half-life is used associated to a formation fraction of 1. A data gap for two additional half-lives has been identified in order to complete the minimum data set required. This data gap is not considered essential to finalize the EU risk assessment, however, the data may be needed by Member States when evaluating other potential uses of clofentezine. An additional data gap was identified for ground water and surface water exposure assessments for the metabolite 2-chlorobenzoic acid (AE C500233, NC233). Bound residue comprised up to 32.3 % AR and CO2 up to 40.7 % AR after 120 days.
   The degradation seems to be enhanced under anaerobic conditions, with higher levels of bound residue (43.5 % AR after 90 days) and lower levels of CO2 (19 % AR after 90 days), than under aerobic conditions. However, no major metabolites were observed under the anaerobic test conditions.
   Photolysis may contribute to the degradation of clofentezine in the environment. The only metabolite identified was 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666) that reached a maximum of 5.5 % AR at the end of the study (30 days). This metabolite should be assessed for potential ground water contamination.
   Field soil dissipation trials from different locations of Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy are available and summarized in the DAR. Maximum plateau residue of 16 - 26 % of the initial applied concentration (on molar basis) of clofentezine was calculated to be reached after 3-5 years.
   No batch soil adsorption/desorption studies are available for clofentezine because of the low solubility (3 mu g/L). According to an estimation (based on the octanol/water partition coefficient) clofentezine was considered to be low mobile in soil (K-oc = 1064 mL/g). The result was confirmed by available soil column leaching-and soil TLC (thin layer chromatography) experiments. A batch soil adsorption/desorption study was conducted with the soil metabolite hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) in three soils. This metabolite showed low mobility in soil (K-foc = 742 - 1084 mL/g). A possible pH-dependence was indicated by this study with lower sorption at higher pH.
   The hydrolysis of clofentezine was pH-dependent (pH 5: DT50 = 10.4 days; pH 7: DT50 = 26.4 hours - 34.4 hours; pH 9: DT50 = 4.3 hours at 22 degrees C). The main hydrolysis product was hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) (maximum of 45 % AR at pH 9 and 22 degrees C), that was further degraded to the minor metabolites 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666) and 2- chlorobenzamide (AE F092117).
   According to the information available, photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of clofentezine. A major aqueous photolysis metabolite was identified: 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666; maximum of 79 % AR). The meeting of experts concluded that this metabolite needs to be assessed for its fate and effects on the aquatic environment. Clofentezine is not readily biodegradable.
   The degradation of clofentezine was investigated in one study in two water sediment systems. Clofentezine dissipated from the water phase via either partition to the sediment or degradation to metabolite hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600). Clofentezine whole system half-lives of 7.1 days - 13.1 days were observed.
   The Step 4 FOCUS PECSW used in the risk assessment presented in the DAR were considered not appropriate for the EU risk assessment. The PRAPeR 63 meeting of experts on ecotoxicology did not agree with the acceptable concentration proposed by the rapporteur Member State in Addendum 2. With the agreed ecotoxicological end point, mitigation would be needed to demonstrate an acceptable use with respect to the aquatic environment. No new Step 4 FOCUS PECSW calculations are available, and therefore the aquatic risk assessment remains open. It should be noted that the ecotoxicological end point is also pending on the evaluation of a study that cannot be considered at this stage in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.
   The meeting of experts agreed that PECSW/SED values for the aqueous photolysis metabolite 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666) are needed to finalize the EU risk assessment. No new calculations have been performed after the meeting of experts. The rapporteur Member State proposed in the list of end points to use the FOCUS Step 1 PECSW, calculated for the parent compound as a worst case surrogate for this metabolite in the EU risk assessment.
   The potential ground water contamination by clofentezine and its soil metabolite hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) was assessed for the representative uses in apples (fruit/stone fruit), grapevines and strawberries. The calculated concentrations were all below 0.001 mu g/L. Whereas the EFSA Opinion on FOCUS GW models(5) requires that the calculations should be done with an additional model, it is not likely that in this case the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L would be breached.
   During the peer review the need to assess the potential ground water contamination by the soil aerobic metabolite 2-chlorobenzoic acid (AE C500233, NC233) and the soil photolysis metabolite 2-chlorobenzonitrile ( AE F023666) was identified. Therefore, new data gaps have been identified for the corresponding studies and calculations.
   Clofentezine may be considered slightly volatile. On the basis of the estimated atmospheric half-life of 5.1 days clofentezine would be considered relatively stable in air. The experts agreed that even when the volatilization from water and soil and plant surfaces is expected to be low, long-range transport in the atmosphere may occur due to the formation of aerosols when the substance is sprayed.
   The acute and short-term dietary risk to birds was low, but a high long-term risk to insectivorous birds cannot be excluded for the uses in pome/stone fruit, vineyards, strawberries and ornamentals. The risk to mammals was assessed as low for all representative uses. The risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low except for the long-term risk to fish. No full FOCUS Step 3 scenario resulted in a TER greater than 10. However, the long-term risk assessment for fish was based on a NOEC value from an early life stage study where only one concentration was tested. A new study was made available where more concentrations were tested. The new study was not taken into account in the peer review in view of the restrictions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007 and should be considered at Member State level.
   The in-field hazard quotient (HQ) value was <2 for Typhlodromus pyri but not for Aphidius rhopalosiphi. No effects of >50 % were observed in standard laboratory studies with Trichogramma cacoeciae, Chrysoperla carnea, Phytoselius persimilis and Poecilus cupreus. Concerns remained with regard to the risk to sensitive life stages of non-target arthropods. The applicant submitted new studies to address the risk to sensitive life stages of non-target arthropods. The studies were evaluated by the rapporteur Member State in Addendum 1, but were not taken into account in the peer review in view of the restrictions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007. A litter bag study was triggered but not included in the original dossier. A litter bag study was submitted by the applicant and evaluated by the rapporteur Member State in Addendum 1, but the study was not taken into account in the peer review in view of the restrictions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.
   The risk to bees, earthworms, collembola, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Lufenuron is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Portugal being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on lufenuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 20 April 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on grapes and tomatoes as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Match 050 EC", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a modified multi-method (The German S19 method). The extraction procedure was as detailed in S19 however, the analysis was performed by LC-MS/MS which is a detection method not used in the multi-method.
   For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of lufenuron.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The outstanding issue is that the specification is not agreed.
   With regard to its toxicological properties, lufenuron has shown a potential of bioaccumulation in fat, and a systemic bioavailability of 70%, with a very low metabolism. During the acute toxicity testing, lufenuron showed skin sensitisation properties and the classification as R43 "May cause sensitisation by skin contact" was proposed. In oral short term studies with different species, clinical signs of neurotoxicity (tonic-clonic seizures or convulsions) and liver changes were observed, as well as some deaths in one dog study resulting in the proposed classification Xn, R48/22 "Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed". No mutagenic or carcinogenic potential was detected in the available studies. In the long term studies, the incidence and severity of the convulsions in both species were also taken into account for the setting of the NOAELs. No specific adverse effect on fertility or embryofoetal development was observed in the studies for reproductive toxicity, with low maternal toxicity (reduced body weight) and minimal offspring toxicity (delayed righting reflex). In a 4-month neurotoxicity study with rats, convulsions or fasciculations were induced at the high dose without any impairment of motor/cognitive functions or histopathological changes in the nervous system.
   The agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI) was 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the second 1-year dog study (Altman, 1995), and the agreed systemic acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.01 mg/kg bw/day using the same dog study but applying a correction factor for bioavailability (70%). Both reference values were derived with the use of a safety factor of 100. The setting of an acute reference dose (ARfD) was not considered necessary. The agreed dermal absorption values for humans were 13% for the dilution and 2% for the concentrate. The operator exposure estimates with the German model for use in field or in greenhouse didn't show exposure levels above the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment.
   The metabolism of lufenuron has been tested in three crop categories namely tomato (fruits), cabbage (leafy crop) and cotton (pulses and oilseeds). Lufenuron is always the major component of the residue, no significant metabolites were found. It was concluded that the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring is lufenuron. A full set of residue trials were supplied for grapes in the north and south of Europe. A full set of residues trials data were available for protected tomatoes; a reduced data set was accepted for outdoor tomatoes in the south as the use is much less critical.
   The stability of residues in freezer storage was demonstrated for a period of two years. Sufficient processing data were submitted for tomatoes and grapes which showed an overall reduction of the residues in processed commodities. The rotational crop studies demonstrated that residues of lufenuron are unlikely to occur in crops planted after the treated crop is harvested. Given that lufenuron is lipophilic it is unlikely to be taken up by plants. The only possible issue would be soil contamination but this will easily be removed during preparation of food before consumption. From the representative uses in grape and tomato evaluated there is no animal intake according to the current guidance. However, metabolism studies in hens and goats were provided that demonstrated that the only significant residue that will be present is lufenuron. Feeding studies were also provided but it can not be concluded if the dose levels were appropriate, because there is no animal consumption expected for the representative crops. Lufenuron is a pair of enantiomers and it is currently not addressed if the ratio remains the same in the plant metabolism. Potentially the consumer risk assessment could under estimate the risk by a factor of 2 (assuming the residue is only 1 isomer and all the toxicity comes from it). For the UK consumer model intakes were highest for the vegetarian population subgroup at 10 % of the ADI using the STMR and 80% of the ADI when using the proposed MRLs. For the WHO European diet the TMDI was 3.42 % and IEDI was 0.62 %. For the Portuguese diet the TMDI was 20.22% and the NEDI was 2.63%. An acute risk assessment has not been conducted as an ARfD has not been set.
   In soil under aerobic conditions lufenuron exhibits high to very high persistence forming the major soil metabolites CGA 2382772 (max. 32% applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence and CGA 2244433 ( max. 33% AR) which exhibits moderate to medium persistence. Under sunlight the major metabolite CGA 1497724 can be formed (max. 1 I%AR) which exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation of the dichlorophenyl ring to carbon dioxide was relatively limited accounting for 1-7 % AR after 91-100 days; this value for the difluorophenyl ring was 34% AR at 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 17-59% AR (range for both rings) after 90-100 days. Lufenuron is immobile in soil. CGA 238277 exhibits slight mobility, CGA 224443 is immobile or exhibits slight mobility and CGA 149772 exhibits very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either lufenuron or these metabolites were pH dependent.
   In dark natural sediment water systems lufenuron partitioned rapidly to sediment where it degraded, exhibiting moderate to high persistence in sediment, to the metabolites CGA 238277 and CGA 224443 which exhibited moderate and high persistence respectively. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for only 0.2 % AR of the dichlorophenyl ring by 90 days but 11.8-36% AR for the difluorophenyl ring at 90 days. Unextracted sediment residues were a sink representing 6-15% AR and 12-37% AR for each radiolabel respectively at 90 days). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for lufenuron at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolites CGA 238277 and CGA 224443 and CGA 149772 that may leach from soil to surface water appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. Information on the fate and behaviour in soil and water of the individual enantiomers of lufenuron is not available. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by lufenuron, CGA 238277, CGA 224443 and CGA 149772 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   The acute toxicity to birds and mammals and the short-term toxicity to birds were considered to be low from exposure to lufenuron. Long-term reproductive endpoints of 19.7 and 8.7 mg a.s./kg bw/d were agreed by Member State experts for birds and mammals respectively. TERs from the standard tier 1 risk assessment indicated a low risk for all intended outdoor uses, except for the risk to small herbivorous mammals from the use in vine. A refined risk assessment provided after the peer-review and agreed by EFSA indicated a low risk, based on a vine foliar interception factor of 70%. The risk from consumption of contaminated drinking water from puddle was assessed as low. The risk from secondary poisoning for the worst-case vine use was assessed as low, based on a no-spray buffer zone of 5 m and 10 m respectively for fish eating birds and mammals. The potential for biomagnification was assessed as high for birds and mammals. Food-chain modelling indicated a low risk for all steps of the food chain for the worst case use in vine, based on appropriate mitigation measures (e.g. no-spray buffer zones). No mitigation measures were required for the tomato use. The risk to birds and mammals from the metabolite CGA 224443 was assessed as low by the RMS after the peer-review. The toxicity of lufenuron suggested a classification as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The lowest acute end point value for Daphnia magna was an EC50 of 0.4 mu g a.s./L, based on a formulation study. The lowest chronic toxicity to fish (NOEC=20 mu g a.s./L) was identified from a fish full life cycle study. A lower NOEC of 2 mu g a.s./L could potentially be derived from a chronic toxicity study with fish, pending further statistical analysis. The chronic study to daphnia was not accepted by member state experts. No new study was required as chronic toxicity to invertebrates was covered by a microcosm study. A NOAEC of 0.1 mu g a.s./L from the microcosm study was agreed by member state experts with an assessment factor of 2-3. The aquatic risk assessment for the tomato use indicated a low risk, based on the microcosm endpoint and no-spray buffer zones of 5 m. For use in vine a low risk was identified, based on a no-spray buffer zone of approximately 25 m. The latter assessment would be based on an assessment factor of 2. Application of an assessment factor of 3 would require further refinement of the risk characterisation for potentially more susceptible FOCUS surface water scenarios. The risk to sediment dwellers from lufenuron exposure was assessed as low in case of a no spray buffer zone of 5 m, as well as the risk from the relevant metabolites. Bioaccumulation and biomagnification was assessed, resulting in a BCF of 28.000 and a slow elimination rate. Risk assessment based on food-chain modelling suggested a low risk to fish, also considering the potential lower toxicity of 2 mu g a.s./L from the chronic fish toxicity study.
   First tier risk assessment indicated a risk to bees. As the higher tier field studies were not accepted by member state experts, lufenuron should not be applied during the flowering season of the GAP crops. Further data were required to address the risk to bees from treated flowering weeds. The initial risk assessment to non-target arthropods from lufenuron (IGR) indicated a potential high risk. The higher tier field study was not accepted by member state experts. Further data were required to address the risk to non-target arthropods. The assessment of soil non-target macro-organisms indicated a potential high risk to collembola. The higher tier litter bag study provided to address the risk was not accepted by member state experts, as the exposure did not cover the expected plateau PECoil. Further data were required to address the risk.
   The risk to earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Cyflufenamid is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC2 the United Kingdom received an application from Nisso Chemical Europe GmbH for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/636/EC3.
   Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State, the United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on cyflufenamid, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available, which was received by EFSA on 30 January 2006.
   The peer review was initiated on 10 May 2006 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in May 2007. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in November-December 2007.
   A final consultation on the outcome of the experts. discussion took place during a written procedure with Member States in February -March 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying to winter and spring cereals against powdery mildew. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the attached end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, NF-149 EW., an oil-in-water emulsion EW), containing 50 g/L cyflufenamid.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant origin and environmental matrices, however a data requirement was identified in relation to the method for plants. A data requirement was identified for a monitoring method for the residues in food of animal origin.
   In mammals, cyflufenamid is not acutely toxic via oral, dermal or inhalation routes; it is not a skin or eye irritant or skin sensitiser. In the short-term toxicity studies the dog was the most sensitive species showing alterations in the liver function and brain vacuolation. The relevant oral No Observed Adverse Effect Level NOAEL) is 4.1 mg/kg bw/day 1-year dog study). Cyflufenamid did not show any genotoxic potential. Increased incidences of thyroid tumours and hepatocellular adenomas were observed in male rats and mice, respectively, however, these were not considered to be of relevance for the risk assessment. The relevant NOAEL from the long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies is 4.4 mg/kg bw/day rat study). No specific effect on the reproductive parameters was found in multigeneration studies with rats: the relevant parental and offspring NOAEL is 18 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the reproductive NOAEL is 57 mg/kg bw/day. Tested in developmental toxicity studies, cyflufenamid did not cause malformations in the rat or rabbit: the relevant maternal NOAELs are 100 mg/kg bw/day and 5 mg/kg bw/day rat and rabbit, respectively); the relevant developmental NOAELs are 1000 mg/kg bw/day highest dose level tested) for rat, and 10 mg/kg bw/day for rabbit based on skeletal effects enlarged anterior fontanels and retardation of ossification). The Acceptable Daily Intake ADI) of 0.04 mg/kg bw/day was derived from the chronic rat study applying a safety factor SF) of 100. The Acute Reference Dose ARfD) is 0.05 mg/kg bw NOAEL for maternal toxicity from the developmental rabbit studies, SF of 100). The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level AOEL) of 0.03 mg/kg bw/day rounded) is based on the 1-year dog study with a correction for oral absorption of 70% and a safety factor of 100. The operator, worker and bystander exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment.
   The metabolism of cyflufenamid was investigated in wheat and rotational crops. The metabolism was found to be moderate. Besides cyflufenamid, its E-isomer 149-E)-FB4 and further metabolites 149-F-2-OH-B5, 149-F-4-OH-B6, 149-F-a-OH-B7, 149-F8 and 149-F4BGlu9) were identified. The meeting of experts decided to include the E-isomer in the residue definition for plant matrices based on the assumption that the analytical methods used in the residue trials and for monitoring cannot separate the two isomers. The notifier was asked to confirm this assumption. Based on the results of a confined rotational crop study, no residues above the LOQ are expected in parts of rotational crops intended for human consumption.
   Dietary burden calculations showed a significant intake of cyflufenamid through cereal straw and grain for dairy and beef cattle only. A metabolism study on ruminants was submitted and showed low transfer of residues into milk and tissues. Cyflufenamid was the main radioactive component in fat. However, in other tissues and milk, the metabolite 149-F110 was the main radioactive component. The meeting of experts decided to include 149-(E)-FB and 149-F1 in the residue definitions for animal matrices. It was concluded that bioaccumulation of cyflufenamid is not expected, and that no significant residues are expected in food of animal origin after feeding with cereal grain and straw treated according to the notified cGAP.
   MRLs for wheat, triticale, rye and barley were proposed provisionally on the basis of the residue trials on wheat and barley, pending confirmation that the analytical method used in the residue trials covers the residue definition for food in plant matrices. MRLs for animal matrices should be set at the LOQ when an analytical method for animal products is available.
   A chronic and acute dietary intake estimate was carried out by the rapporteur Member State. The theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) was below 1% of the ADI and the national estimated short-term intake (NESTI) maximum 2% for all considered consumer groups.
   In soil under aerobic conditions cyflufenamid exhibits low to high persistence forming the soil metabolites: 149-F (low to moderate persistence), 149-F1111 (low persistence), 149-F1 (high to very high persistence), 149-F612 (very high persistence). Mineralisation to carbon dioxide represented less than 0.1% of the applied radioactivity (AR) in the fluorinated phenyl-labelled study, and represented 49.8% AR at 45 days in the cyclopropyl-labelled study. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 27.0-36.8% AR after 45-120 days. Cyflufenamid exhibits slight to low mobility in soil, with the four metabolites indicated above exhibiting very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of any of these compounds was pH dependant.
   In dark natural sediment-water systems cyflufenamid dissipated from the water phase with a first-order DT50 of 3.6-5.0 days. Cyflufenamid partitioned to the sediment with a peak concentration measured 14 days after dosing of 63.0-64.8% AR. The more prominent degradation products in both systems were 149-F11 (maximum 15.5% AR in water and maximum 6.8% AR in sediment) and 149-F (maximum 7.1% AR in water and maximum 8.6% AR in sediment). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 0.5-3.5% of the applied fluorinated phenyl-U-[C-14] cyflufenamid. Unextracted sediment residues were a sink representing 8.4-19.1% of this radiolabel at the study end. The available surface water exposure assessment for cyflufenamid and for the metabolites 149-F and 149-F11 only considered the spray drift route of entry to surface water bodies, as FOCUS SW was not available when the DAR of cyflufenamid was written.
   The potential contamination of ground water by cyflufenamid and its soil metabolites 149-F, 149-F1, 149-F6 and 149-F11, when used according to the proposed representative uses, was assessed with FOCUS GW PELMO (v. 3.3.2) model and the relevant scenarios. The results showed that for cyflufenamid and for the metabolites 149-F and 149-F11 no annual average concentration in the percolate at 1m soil depth exceeding 0.001 mu g/L is to be expected. The concentrations for the metabolite 149-F1 are in the range of 0.011 - 0.546 mu g/L. The concentration of 0.1 mu g/L is exceeded in 7 out of 9 European FOCUS scenarios parameterised for winter cereals. For the metabolite 149-F6 the estimated PECgw are > 0.75 mu g/L in all the simulated scenarios (80th percentile annual average concentration at 1m ranged from 1.566 rho g/L to 5.623 mu g/L). The toxicological assessment was able to conclude that the metabolites 149-F1 and 149-F6 are not relevant concerning groundwater at the expected concentrations.
   Cyflufenamid is not expected to be transferred to the atmospheric compartment and the potential for long-range transport may be considered negligible.
   The acute, short-term and long-term risk to herbivorous and insectivorous birds and the acute and long-term risk for herbivorous and insectivorous mammals was low for the representative uses in cereals at an application rate of 25 g a. s./ha. The risk from secondary poisoning and from the uptake of contaminated drinking water to birds and mammals can be considered as low.
   Aquatic organisms were more sensitive to the lead formulation, NF-149 EW.. The potential exposure of surface water with the parent compound cyflufenamid and the soil major metabolites 149-F, 149-F1 and 149-F11 via the drainage and run-off routes of entry has not been assessed. The EFSA considers that the main route of exposure was via drift. Therefore, in case the new PECsw for the run-off and drainage are considered, it is expected that these would be lower than those obtained with the drift. The risk to aquatic organisms for the representative uses of cyflufenamid and its relevant metabolites can be regarded as low for exposure via drift. The resulting BCF (bioconcentration factor) exceeds the Annex VI trigger value of 100 for not readily biodegradable compounds. Nevertheless, the risk from bioconcentration in fish is considered to be low as more than 95% depuration was observed in 14 days.
   Low acute and chronic risk to earthworms was assessed from the representative uses of cyflufenamid and its relevant metabolites.
   The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target terrestrial plants and biological methods for sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Cadusafos is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU- Commission.
   Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on cadusafos in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 1 June 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant FMC Chemical. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005.
   A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 February 2006 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion issued on 24 April 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 68)
   Following the Commission Decision of 18 June 2007 (2007/428/EC) 4 concerning the noninclusion of cadusafos in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the notifier FMC Chemical made a resubmission application for the inclusion of cadusafos in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report as follows:
   the potential contamination of groundwater.
   the operators exposure.
   the risk to birds and mammals.
   its possible impact on non-target organisms
   Greece, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted the additional report on cadusafos to the EFSA on 15 October 2008. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA dispatched the additional report to Member States and the notifier for consultation. The comments received were subsequently submitted to the Commission for evaluation. In accordance with Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the Commission subsequently requested the EFSA, by letter received on 8 January 2009, to arrange a peer review of the evaluation, i. e. the additional report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days.
   The peer review was initiated on 14 January 2009 by dispatching the comments received on the additional report to the rapporteur Member State for examination. The rapporteur provided a response to the comments in the reporting table, which was subsequently evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues to be further considered in a series of scientific meetings via teleconferences with Member State experts in March 2009.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in March-April 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in the areas of identity, physical, chemical and technical properties and methods of analysis, mammalian toxicology, residues, environmental fate and behaviour, and ecotoxicology.
   The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide and nematicide as presented in the DAR, which comprise application by spraying or via the drip irrigation system to control a range of soil insects and nematodes in potatoes and bananas at application rates of up to 6 kg cadusafos per hectare. In case of potatoes incorporation into soil takes place after the application. It should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated that only the use in bananas will be supported in the EU review process. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as insecticide and nematicide, which comprise application via the drip irrigation system to control a range of soil insects and nematodes in bananas at application rates of up to 4 kg cadusafos per hectare. It should be noted that the use on potatoes was not supported in the resubmission application either, and therefore the conclusion has only been updated in relation to the risk assessment of the representative uses presented in the additional report, i.e. only the use on bananas at application rates of up to 4 kg cadusafos per hectare. The risk assessment presented for potatoes has not been updated.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, Rugby 200 CS., a capsule suspension (CS). Preparations containing cadusafos were registered in Cyprus, France, Greece and Spain.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Adequate analytical methods are available to monitor cadusafos in food of plant origin, environmental matrices and body fluids and tissues.
   The absorption of cadusafos is extensive and rapid; the excretion is mainly via urine, without evidence of body accumulation. The acute oral toxicity is high, and the acute inhalation and dermal toxicity are very high. The proposed classification is T+, R26/27 "Very toxic by inhalation and in contact with skin"; T, R25 "Toxic if swallowed".
   The main effect after short-term oral administration is the decrease of cholinesterase activities in all species. Cadusafos has no genotoxic potential and is not considered to be carcinogenic. In the two-generation rat study, there was no effect on reproductive performance or fertility, and in the rat-and rabbit teratology studies, there was no evidence of teratogenic effects in the absence of maternal toxicity.
   Supplementary studies were performed due to the introduction of a new impurity in the technical material. The acute and subchronic oral tests revealed no difference in toxicity. The Ames test was negative but not valid. A further assessment of the genotoxic potential of the impurity was required.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.0007 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.003 mg/kg bw. The comparison of the oral and dermal LD50 values results in a dermal absorption value of 100%. The operator exposure estimates are based solely on one specific and restricted representative use in bananas, with automatic drip irrigation, work rate of 1 ha/day, application rate of 4 kg a. s./ha, and assuming that the microcapsules in the formulation do not release cadusafos until they are diluted for application. The results are below the AOEL, with the use of gloves, according to the currently used models, which do not apply properly to this particular scenario. Worker and bystander exposures are expected to be very low due to the mode of application by drip irrigation.
   The metabolism of cadusafos has been investigated on several crops after soil application. The use on potatoes can be considered as adequately covered by these data and the residue definition for this use can be cadusafos only, for both monitoring and risk assessment. The available residue trials in potatoes for Southern Europe are however not sufficient to draw a robust conclusion on the residue levels consumers may be exposed to. The available data suggest that residues are below 0.01 mg/kg, but results from trials in Northern Europe indicate that the currently available data may underestimate the actual situation. Further supervised residue trials should be carried out.
   For the representative use on bananas, two metabolism studies for this crop were originally submitted, and the data were not sufficient to propose a residue definition. This was due to major deficiencies in the studies, making it impossible to evaluate the possible presence of degradation products still exhibiting the anticholinesterase activity of the parent compound.
   Therefore, a new metabolism study in bananas was needed, as well as residue trials carried out according to the representative use pattern.
   The situation for rotational crops has not been addressed by the notifier, although the soil persistence of the compound exceeds the trigger value for conducting uptake and metabolism studies in succeeding crops. Therefore these studies should be requested.
   Based on the current knowledge of the residue situation in potatoes, the exposure of livestock is very low and metabolism studies in domestic animals do not need to be carried out. Only preliminary acute and chronic exposure assessments could be conducted for the use on potatoes, but these assessments need to be re-examined on the basis of complete and robust data. No MRLs can be proposed at this stage.
   In the resubmission, only the use on banana is supported with a lower application rate of 4 kg as/ha instead of 6 kg as/ha, and a harvest interval of 90 days instead of 14 days. A new plant metabolism study showed that no significant metabolites are formed. None of the minor metabolites formed will have the anticholinesterase activity of cadusafos. The study confirms that the residue definition is cadusafos only. Overdosed residue trials showed that no significant residues will be present at harvest even with shorter harvest intervals. A TMDI calculation using the EFSA model showed that the highest intakes were < 5% of the ADI. The acute risk assessment gave intakes at < 30 % of the ARfD. The proposed MRL for banana is 0.01* mg/kg. It should be noted however, that cadusafos has two chiral carbons and it is not known if the ratio of the isomers remains the same as the material tested in the mammalian toxicity studies.
   The available data demonstrate that in soil cadusafos degrades to the minor (< 10% applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone5. Mineralisation of the butyl-2-[C-14] radiolabel accounted for 43-71% AR after 90-120 days incubation at 25 degrees C. The values for residues not extracted by acetonitrile/water were 25-32% AR after 90-120 days. In soil cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and methyl-2-butyl sulfone exhibited low persistence, though this categorisation for methyl-2-butyl sulfone is based only a single experimental DT50 value.
   In guideline batch soil adsorption studies cadusafos exhibited medium mobility. There was no evidence of pH dependant adsorption. Data on the adsorption of methyl-2-butyl sulfone were not available. As this metabolite accounted for > 5% AR at two consecutive sampling points in a soil route of degradation study, data on its mobility in soil are required to enable a groundwater exposure assessment for this metabolite to be carried out.
   In sediment water systems cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and produced no major metabolites. It dissipated by partitioning to sediment, volatilising and mineralising to CO2 (butyl-2-[C-14] radiolabel accounted for 12-18% AR after 100 days incubation at 20 degrees C). Residues not extracted from sediment by acetonitrile/water accounted for only 6-8% AR at 100 days.
   The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on bananas (application via drip irrigation) just in Tenerife indicated that surface water exposure and consequently sediment exposure would be negligible. This conclusion is specific to this use in Tenerife and should not be applied to bananas grown elsewhere. The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on potatoes is appropriate for addressing just the spray drift route of entry to surface water for initial PEC in aquatic systems. Surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessments from the run-off and drainage routes of entry are not available for the potato use.
   The available FOCUS groundwater modelling for bananas in Tenerife for the parent cadusafos and for the metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone are not satisfactory, and the potential for groundwater contamination is therefore currently unclear. New groundwater modelling is therefore required for cadusafos and for the soil metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone.
   Cadusafos is moderately volatile and volatilisation will contribute to dissipation from soil and water. However, cadusafos is not expected to be subject to long-range transport via the upper atmosphere due to a relatively rapid calculated photochemical oxidative degradation rate with hydroxyl radicals.
   In the first-tier assessment an acute and long-term risk was identified for insectivorous birds. A risk was also identified for earthworm-eating birds and mammals, as well as for fish-eating birds and mammals for the use in potatoes. Since the use in potatoes was withdrawn by the applicant, the refinements of the risk to birds and mammals from this use were not further considered.
   For the use in banana plantations a high risk was identified for insectivorous and earthwormeating birds and mammals in a first-tier risk assessment. The proposed refinement was not accepted by the experts due to the lack of supporting data. However, due to the mode of application (drip-irrigation), only 16% of the in-field area is treated, leaving the majority of food items uncontaminated (the exposure of epigaec insects was considered negligible). This information could be used in a weight of evidence approach for a qualitative risk assessment.
   Cadusafos is very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The assessment indicates a high risk. However, for the specific use in banana plantations in Tenerife, the risk to aquatic organisms is considered low based on negligible contamination of surface water.
   The toxicity to bees is high, but since for the proposed uses application will be to bare soil, the risk is considered low.
   No in-field exposure of leaf-dwelling non-target arthropods is expected from the evaluated uses. For the application of cadusafos by drip irrigation to banana plants no off-field exposure is expected. No new data was provided with the resubmission dossier. No further data was considered necessary for the use in banana plantations, since only 16% of the in-field area is treated leaving enough uncontaminated refuges, which would allow the recolonisation of the treated area.
   A high acute and long-term risk was identified for earthworms. The field study conducted in the United Kingdom was considered not appropriate for the risk assessment for banana plantations. A data gap was identified to provide information on the potential for recolonisation of earthworms in the treated area of banana plantations, or alternatively, a study on effects on earthworm populations in banana plantations.
   A study with Collembola and mites was required to address the risk to other soil macroorganisms. No study with Collembola was provided with the resubmission dossier. However, the experts considered further data not necessary for banana plantations, since only 16% of the in-field area is treated leaving enough uncontaminated refuges, which would allow the recolonisation of the treated area.
   The risk to soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment plants is low. For the drip irrigation use in banana no off-crop exposure is expected, and hence the risk to non-target plants is considered low.

AB  - Difenacoum is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004,(2) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.(3) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on difenacoum in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 16 July 2007. The peer review was initiated on 3 March 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Sorex Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in November-December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a rodenticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise manual application into protected bait boxes for rodent control. Full details of the representative use can be found in the attached endpoints.
   Difenacoum consists of two diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers. A data gap was set for a new technical specification.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Neosorexa Pellets', a bait (ready-for-use) formulation (RB) containing 0.05 g/kg difenacoum.
   Analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible, however a data gap was identified for storage stability study.
   Monitoring methods to determine difenacoum residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin are not required, no MRLs are established. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in soil and water. Adequate methods are available to monitor difenacoum residues in tissues, however a method for the determination of residues of difenacoum in body fluids (blood) was identified as a data gap.
   With regard to its toxicological properties, difenacoum is a direct anticoagulant that interferes with the blood clotting mechanism by inhibiting the vitamin K epoxide reductase. The active substance is well absorbed following oral administration, and widely distributed within the body with the highest concentration in the liver. Based on the results of the acute toxicity studies, the proposed classification was T+ R26/27/28 "Very toxic by inhalation, in contact with skin, and if swallowed". In repeated dose studies, no other toxic effect than reduced coagulation and haemorrhages were observed, leading to a short-term rat NOAEL of 0.03 mg/kg bw/day. In the in vitro genotoxicity studies, no gene mutation was induced in bacterial and mammalian cells, while two chromosome aberration tests gave positive results. As the three in vivo genotoxicity studies were negative, the overall conclusion is that difenacoum has no genotoxic potential. No multigeneration study was provided in the dossier. In the developmental studies with rats and rabbits, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In rats, no developmental toxicity was observed at a dose maternally toxic. Foetal effects in rabbits were observed in both the test and control groups, and were concluded as not dose-related. However, the experts considered that difenacoum should be regarded as teratogenic based on the knowledge about analogous compounds (other antivitamin K anticoagulants in humans), and they agreed with the classification proposed by the Specialised Experts on Reproductive Toxicity (Ispra, 19-20 September 2006) i.e. Reprotoxic Category 1, R61 "May cause harm to the unborn child".
   The experts assumed that no contamination of crops would occur during the intended use, and concluded that the derivation of an acceptable daily intake and acute reference dose was not required. For the operator risk assessment, the agreed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.000017 mg/kg bw/day (or 17 ng/kg bw/day), based on the maternal NOAEL in the developmental rabbit study with the use of an overall safety factor of 300. The additional safety factor of 3 was justified by the severity of the toxicological effects of difenacoum, the higher potency of the second generation anticoagulants (such as difenacoum) compared to warfarin, and the much higher vulnerability of human foetuses to vitamin K deficiency compared to rodents. For the operator exposure assessment, the exposure estimates for the biocide use(4) were considered as a worst-case scenario, which gave an exposure of 52% of the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment. No worker or bystander exposure was expected due to the type of product assessed and the representative use in secured bait boxes.
   Under the conditions of use as applied for (i.e. formulated bait in secure bait boxes), it is very unlikely that residues in food of plant or animal origin will occur. Therefore, it was concluded that the dietary consumer risk is negligible, and that data on the residue behaviour of difenacoum in plants and livestock animals are not required. No MRLs were proposed.
   However, a situation has not been assessed where bait pellets are removed from bait boxes and hoarded by rodents because of their natural instinct. Depending on the treated area, this may lead to a situation where food or feed could become contaminated or where domestic animals might become exposed.
   The consumer risk assessment is strictly based on the assumption of a 'no dietary exposure situation' for humans and livestock from the notified representative use, presuming that no contact of difenacoum with food, feed or drinking water will occur.
   No reliable information is available on the route and rate of degradation of difenacoum in soil, though the information available indicates it has some persistence. The adsorption of difenacoum to soil would be expected to be pH-dependent at environmentally relevant pH, with lower adsorption expected at higher soil pH. Evidence from laboratory sieved soil column leaching studies indicates difenacoum would be expected to exhibit low mobility in soil including alkaline soils, though limitations in the design of experiments in three of the four soils investigated means it is not possible to conclude that difenacoum is immobile. Difenacoum is stable under conditions of sterile aqueous hydrolysis but undergoes rapid aqueous photodegradation. Information is not available on its behaviour in natural aerobic water/sediment systems. Though the available data are relatively limited, the available information is considered sufficient to complete an environmental exposure assessment at EU level for the applied for intended use, but only when formulated bait products are placed in secure bait boxes. When the product is used in this way, the potential for surface water body exposure was assessed as negligible. Also, when the product is used in this way, the potential for groundwater contamination by difenacoum above a toxicologically based concentration limit of 0.05 mu g/L was considered to be low.
   The acute, short-term and long-term risk to birds was assessed as high, if birds can get access to the baits. The acute risk of primary poisoning was assessed as low for larger mammals like dogs or pigs, but a high long-term risk was indicated. Risk mitigation measures are needed, which are proven to be efficient, to prevent birds and larger mammals gaining access to the baits (e.g. bait boxes). The risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning was assessed as high. It is more difficult to mitigate the risk from secondary poisoning of birds and mammals. The efficiency and applicability of risk mitigation in the context of the application in the field, such as removal of carcasses during and after the control campaign, is uncertain and would need some further consideration. A high risk was evident for small non-target mammals. No risk mitigation measures were proposed. It is unclear if the risk to small non target mammals can be mitigated without reducing the efficacy of the product. Member States should be aware that it cannot be excluded that the suggested application of difenacoum in the field may also affect endangered/protected small mammal species potentially found in agricultural landscapes.
   Difenacoum was very toxic to fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae. However, the risk to aquatic organisms was considered to be low because exposure of the aquatic environment was expected to be negligible from the applied for intended use.
   The risk to bees, other arthropod species, earthworms, soil macro- and soil micro-organisms, terrestrial plants and biological sewage treatment plants was considered to be low because of negligible or low local point exposure.

AB  - Paraffin oils (CAS 64742-46-7, 72623-86-0 and 97862-82-3) are among the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004,(2) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.(3) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on paraffin oils (CAS 64742-46-7, 72623-86-0 and 97862-82-3) in accordance with the provisions of Article 21(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 6 May 2008. The peer review was initiated on 23 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Total Fluides. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide for use on pome fruit, stone fruit, citrus and potato. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of endpoints.
   The representative formulated products for the evaluation were 'Citrole', 'Arb'hiver', 'Arbofine' and 'Finavestan TS', all emulsifiable concentrates (EC).
   For food and environmental matrices there are data gaps and currently it is not clear whether methods will be required, see sections 2, 3, 4 and 5.
   Sufficient internationally accepted methods (e.g. ASTM and ISO) are available to characterise the technical material and formulated product. However, numerous data gaps have been identified for the physical and chemical properties of the technical materials and plant protection products.
   During the mammalian toxicology meeting, concerns were raised over relevant impurities that require classification of paraffin oils as T "Toxic", carcinogenic category 2, R45 "May cause cancer". The meeting on toxicology confirmed that the impurities benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons are relevant and the specification as proposed by the notifier could not be accepted on toxicological grounds due to the high levels of relevant impurities. On this basis, no toxicological studies were required, no ADI, AOEL or ARM were proposed and no risk assessment of operator, worker and bystander exposure were conducted.
   It was noted however that if highly purified paraffin oils were considered (i.e. no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the active substance), then no toxicological concern would be raised for consumers, operators, workers and bystanders. Sources of mineral oil are laxatives in pharmacy or oils used in food technology as release agents, for lubrication purposes, or as a substitute for fat. Paraffin oils are chemically inert substances, especially the straight chain (n) alkanes and on ingestion most of the mineral oil (about 98 % depending on the length of the C-chain) remains unabsorbed and is rapidly excreted, mostly unchanged, via faeces.
   Acute toxicity studies have confirmed the low toxicity profile of paraffin oils. The experts agreed that no acute, short-term, long-term, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity studies would be required, provided that no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the substance. Paraffin oils are not considered to be genotoxic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic or toxic to the reproduction. Considering the low toxicity of paraffin oils (of high purity), no ADI, AOEL or ARfD would be necessary, and no risk assessment for operators, workers and bystanders would be required.
   The list of endpoints on mammalian toxicology has been filled in considering that the technical material does not contain unacceptable levels of relevant impurities.
   No information on potential levels of residues in food or feed items were presented in the DAR.
   A consumer risk assessment has not been performed due to the possible high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. If these compounds are present then it would result in a toxicological classification that would mean that these compounds could not be registered as plant protection products. The risk to consumers can therefore not be finalised.
   With regard to environmental fate and behaviour, no information was provided in the dossier, nor presented by the RMS in the DAR, except for results from ready biodegradability studies that were carried out using a sewage sludge inoculum. Therefore only crude and incomplete environmental exposure estimates for surface water (only spray drift route of entry assessed) and soil, based on the applied for uses, could be made. With the exception of the requirement for ready biodegradability data, all data requirements remain open. No conclusion on the potential for groundwater exposure can be made using the information in the DAR.
   The acute TERs estimated for fish and D. magna were above the Annex VI trigger when a non-spray buffer zone of 25 m was applied for the pome fruit uses. However, acute TERs values were above the Annex VI trigger values without the use of any non-spray buffer zone for the other evaluated uses.
   The acute TERs for alga were above the Annex VI trigger values without risk mitigation for all the evaluated uses. Therefore, risk mitigation measures or refined of aquatic risk assessment were required.
   The experts at the meeting agreed that in absence of data addressing the risk to bees, mitigation measures should be taken to avoid the application in the presence of bees.
   Two field studies were conducted with two different plant protection products 'SAM 501' and 'Arbofine'. The intension of the first study was to determine the efficacy of the product 'SAM 501' on red spider mites in apples trees as well as the effects on Amblyseius andersoni in apple tree during summer. The purpose of the second study was to assess the effects on Typhlodromus pyri in apple orchards after the application of 'Arbofine' (1 x 2 hl/ha equivalent to 20.08 Kg a.s./ha). The meeting of the experts had some concern regarding the reliable of the A. andersoni study. The experts also expressed their concern regarding to the second study showed adverse effects on the T. pyri density (at least lasting 43 days) with only one application rate of 20 kg as/ha. The evaluated uses proposed in the GAP included the uses in citrus with 4 x 23.7 kg as/ha. The increase of adverse effects on T pyri populations with repeated application should not be disregarded. The experts agreed that further information to address the risk to non-target arthropods was necessary or mitigation measures should be requested at Member State level.
   A data gap was identified during the experts meeting for the notifier to address the acute risk to earthworms.
   There was no valid study to evaluated in the DAR assess the effects of paraffin oils on soil non-target micro-organisms, or soil non-target macro-organisms. Data gaps for information to address these issues are identified. The risk to birds and mammals, non-target plants and biological method of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Etofenprox is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on etofenprox in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005 and following a quality check on the DAR, on 14 February 2007. The peer review was initiated on 18 July 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Landis Kane Consulting. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in November-December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in oilseed rape, head cabbage, grapes, peach and apple for the control of biting and sucking insects. Full details of the GAP can be found in the endpoints.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'TREBON 30EC', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 287.5 g/L etofenprox.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant and animal origin and environmental matrices.
   In the mammalian metabolism studies, etofenprox was rapidly but partially absorbed after oral administration. It was uniformly distributed through the body, and transferred via placenta and via milk. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation; etofenprox was rapidly eliminated, mainly via faeces, a major part as metabolites.
   The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route; no eye or skin irritation was observed and no potential for skin sensitisation was found in a modified maximisation test. The main target organs of etofenprox were the liver and thyroid upon short-term or long-term exposure in the rat, which was the most sensitive species. The mouse presented also renal toxicity, but at much higher dose levels and the dog was less sensitive, showing effect only in the liver. The relevant NOAEL for short-term exposure was the dose level of 20 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat feeding study; for long-term exposure, the NOAELs in rat and mouse were similar. 3 1 mg/kg bw/day in mouse and 3.7 mg/kg bw/day in rat. No potential for genotoxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. The aetiology of the formation of the thyroid adenomas observed in rats was elucidated in a mechanistic study and considered not relevant for human risk assessment. Marginally increased renal cortical tumours found only in male mice at high doses were also not considered relevant to humans. No effect on the reproduction, fertility or development was found, however, considering the increased mortality of offsprings during the lactation phase, classification with R64, "May cause harm to breastfed babies", was proposed.
   Further studies were provided on the plant metabolite alpha-CO2, which showed that its toxicity is covered by the parent's toxicity studies.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of etofenprox was 0.03 mg/kg bw/day based on the long-term mouse study and applying a safety factor of 100, which is supported by the long-term rat study. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.06 mg/kg bw/day based on the oral 90-day rat study, applying a safety factor of 100 and a correction factor of 30 % for low oral absorption. The acute reference dose (ARfD) was set at 1.0 mg/kg bw, based on the NOAEL of 100 mg/kg bw/day from the rabbit developmental toxicity study and a safety factor of 100. A default value of 30 % was agreed for dermal absorption.
   The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation "TREBON 30EC", at a maximum dose rate of 0.21 kg etofenprox/ha in high crops (grapes, peaches and apples) was below the AOEL when the use of gloves was considered; in field crops (oilseed rape and head cabbage), no personal protective equipment (PPE) was needed to achieve an operator exposure estimate below the AOEL, according to the German model. According to the UK POEM model, estimated operator exposure was above the AOEL, even when the use of PPE was considered. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with etofenprox was below the AOEL, if PPE were worn (protective gloves, long-sleeved shirt and long trousers). Bystander exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL.
   Concerning the plant and animal metabolism studies, the meeting of experts discussed the unusual way the experiments were conducted, using applications of a 1:1 mixture of both labelled forms in a single study, instead of two distinct radioactive labels from two separate studies. After discussion, the experts were of the opinion that such studies may only be accepted when no extensive cleavage of the parent molecule is observed. Thus, in the specific case of etofenprox, this practice could be accepted as no extensive metabolism was observed in plants and animals Otherwise, in the case of an extensive metabolism and/or early cleavage of the parent molecule, the recovered levels of the different metabolites may be underestimated, when compared to the initial radioactive level of parent molecule. In such situation, the meeting re-enforced its opinion that metabolism studies must be conducted separately according to the different labelling forms, in order to depict the fate of each labelling portion of the molecule as completely as possible and to provide reliable quantitative information.
   In plants, the metabolism of etofenprox has been investigated in rapeseed, grape and lettuce. The metabolism was limited and etofenprox was found to be the major compound of the residues, the other metabolites being detected in very low proportions, up to 7% of the TRR for the alpha-CO metabolite. However and considering that the alpha-CO metabolite was observed in proportions higher than 10 % of the etofenprox levels in the supervised residue trials, the meeting of experts decided to define the residue for risk assessment and monitoring as the "sum of etofenprox and alpha-CO expressed as etofenprox". Sufficient supervised residue trials were submitted to propose MRLs on rape seed (Northern GAP) and on head cabbage, grape, peach and apple (Southern GAP). The storage stability studies demonstrated that etofenprox and alpha-CO residues were stable under freeze storage conditions for at least two years in oil and water-containing matrices. A standard hydrolytic study was identified as a data gap and additionally, one balance study and three follow-up studies were requested for red wine and for raisin. Processing transfer factors could be calculated for some rape seed, apple and peach processed commodities.
   For animals, the experts discussed the validity of the metabolism studies performed with the parent etofenprox only. Considering that the alpha-CO metabolite was shown to be a significant constituent of the residues in plants, the experts were of the opinion that information on the fate of this compound in the ruminant metabolism has to be requested. The parent etofenprox was found to be the major residue in all goat and hen matrices, and the residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was set provisionally as "etofenprox", awaiting the requested information on the alpha-CO metabolite. Based on the cow feeding study and the animal burden calculations, MRLs were proposed for milk and ruminant products.
   The chronic and acute consumer risk assessments were performed using the EFSA and the UK PSD models. Using the MRLs proposed for plant and animal products, the calculated theoretical maximum daily intakes (TMDI) and international estimated short term intakes (IESTI) were shown to be below the ADI and ARfD values.
   Degradation of etofenprox in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C occurred through oxidation at different parts of the molecule followed by breaking down in smaller moieties (DT50 = 7 - 57.7 days). In one study, one of the metabolites, alpha-CO, was observed to exceed 5 % AR in one of the soils (DT50 = 12 - 45 days). Unextracted radioactivity amounted to a maximum of 55.8 % AR after 55 days, and mineralization (CO2) up to a maximum of 45.6 % AR after 120 days. Under dark anaerobic conditions at 20 degrees C, etofenprox is highly persistent in soil (DT50 = 174 days). Under these conditions metabolite 4'-OH3 was identified as a major metabolite. Mineralization was negligible, and unextractable residue in soil amounted to 9.5 % AR after 121 days. Photolysis only slightly enhanced degradation of etofenprox in soil. PEC soil were calculated for etofenprox based on the soil half-life of 25 days for all representative uses. The meeting of experts agreed that these values could be used for the risk assessment.
   According to the results of available soil batch adsorption/desorption experiments, etofenprox may be classified as immobile in soil (Koc = 8548 - 14923 mL/g). The meeting of experts identified a data gap for an additional batch soil adsorption/desorption study, but considered it not essential to finalize the EU risk assessment. The metabolites alpha-CO and 4'-OH were estimated to be immobile with PCKOCWIN (EPA).
   Chemical hydrolysis is not expected to contribute to the environmental degradation of etofenprox. The photolysis of etofenprox is relatively rapid. The major aqueous photolysis metabolites were alpha-CO (max 63.6 %) and PENA(4) (max. 14.4 %). The metabolite alpha-CO was also found to reach up to 10% of the parent's applied amount in the outdoor mesocosm study.
   On the basis of the available studies, etofenprox should be considered not ready biodegradable. In water/sediment systems, partition of etofenprox to the sediment occurs during the first seven days. The meeting of experts agreed on the half-lives calculated for etofenprox in the whole system (DT50 whole system = 6.5 days - 20.1 days). The metabolite 4'-OH was identified as a major metabolite in the sediment phase of both systems.
   The meeting of experts discussed the need to consider aqueous photolysis and photolysis metabolites for the EU risk assessment, and agreed that the risk assessment presented for the metabolite alpha-CO by the applicant could be regarded as conservative.
   PECSW were calculated with FOCUS SW modelling for the relevant scenarios based on the soil halflife of 25 days. Degradation in the water phase was assumed to occur with a half-life of 1000 days, and the mean whole water/sediment system half-life was applied to the sediment phase. Step 3 and Step 4 (only oilseed rape; assuming 30m spray drift buffer zone) were calculated for the representative uses. PECSW of the aqueous photolysis metabolite alpha-CO was estimated to be 63.6 % of the PECsw of the parent compound. Worst case PECsw were also estimated for the sediment metabolite 4'-OH as 21.9 % of the PECsw calculated for the parent compound. The meeting of experts identified the need to recalculate PECSED for the parent compound for the uses different from oilseed rape, to take into account the accumulation of etofenprox after multiple applications and the PECSED of the metabolites alpha-CO and 4'-OH. The necessary PECSW / SED values were provided by the rapporteur Member State in the addendum Volume 3 v3 after the meeting of experts.
   Neither etofenprox nor its soil metabolite alpha-CO is expected to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g /L for any of the representative uses and scenarios simulated. The environmental concentrations in air and transport through air of etofenrprox are considered negligible.
   The risk assessment indicated low risk to birds and mammals for all intended uses. Refinements of the long-term risk assessment for mammals were, however, required for the uses in head cabbage, grape, peach and apple to meet the Annex VI trigger. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals was considered to be low for all of the intended uses, as was the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals for the intended use in oilseed rape. Further refinements were still required to address the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals for the intended uses in head cabbage, grapevine, peach and apple. The acute risk to birds and mammals from consumption of contaminated drinking water from puddles was assessed as low for all intended uses of etofenprox. Etofenprox was not considered to biomagnify in the terrestrial food chain, and the risk from plant metabolites was assessed to be low. The risk to aquatic organisms was not addressed for any of the intended uses. The TER values for aquatic organisms, based on tier 1 effect data and FOCUS Step 3 and 4, failed to meet the Annex VI trigger value. The use of an endpoint from the available higher tier mesocosm study would require further supportive data. Member State experts suggested that single species tests on the most sensitive species from the mesocosm study should be provided to consolidate the confidence in the data from the mesocosm. The design of the single species tests should take into account the multi-application uses. Based on the additional studies, a relevant assessment factor should be reconsidered for a refined aquatic risk assessment. A fish full life cycle (FFLC) study was required by the Member State experts, which should be included in the aquatic risk assessment. The risk to sediment dwellers should be addressed for etofenprox and for the metabolites 4'-OH and alpha-CO. Also, the aquatic risk assessment for alpha-CO would have to be refined further for uses in head cabbage, grapevine, peach and apple. In addition, the risk from biomagnification and potential endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic organisms should be addressed.
   Hazard quotient (HQ) values indicated a high risk to bees from all intended uses. Member State experts concluded that the available field studies did not address the risk to bees, and they agreed that mitigation measures were needed for pre-flowering/flowering uses in oilseed rape, grapevine and apple to avoid exposure of bees. The Tier I risk assessment indicated a high in-field risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri for all intended uses. The off-field risk was considered to be low for A. pyri and A. rhopalosiphi for uses in oilseed rape and head cabbage, based on no-spray buffer zone of 1 and 5m, respectively. Higher tier risk assessment based on extended laboratory studies with A. rhopalosiphi, T pyri, Orius laevigatues and Chrysoperla carnea still indicated a high in-field risk to non-target arthropods. The potential for in-field recovery was not addressed in the draft assessment report. The higher tier off-field risk assessment indicated a low risk to non-target arthropods for uses in oilseed rape and head cabbage, with no-spray buffer zones of 1 and 5m, respectively. For uses in grapevine, the assessment indicated a need for a no-spray buffer zone of 10m to identify a low risk. Further refinements were required to address the off-field risk to non-target arthropods for uses in peach and apple.
   The risk to earthworms, non-target micro- and macro-soil organisms and non-target plants was assessed as low for all intended uses.

AB  - Propaquizafop is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.(1) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on propaquizafop in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 22 September 2005. The peer review was initiated on 12 May 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the sole notifier Makhteshim Agan and the Member States. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   Propaquizafop is an ester variant of the active substance quizalofop-P-2 which is included in the third stage Part B of the review programme. The EFSA wrote a conclusion on quizalofop-P based on the DARs which were submitted on the ester variants quizalofop-P-ethyl(3) and quizalofop-P-tefuryl.(4)
   This conclusion on propaquizafop was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on sugar beet and oilseed rape. Full details of the good agricultural practice (GAP) can be found in the attached list of endpoints.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Agil 100 EC', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).
   The meeting of experts was not able to conclude on the acceptability of any of the methods as none of the methods were capable of analysing for the original residue definition proposed in the DAR. As it is not possible to reconsider all the methods at this time no conclusion can be reached. A general data gap for reconsideration of the methods has been identified.
   There are insufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The specification of the technical material has not been accepted. The method of analysis for the formulation is identified as a data gap. The formulation was seen to perform poorly in some of the physical-chemical tests. And there are outstanding issues on possible relevant impurities.
   In mammals, propaquizafop shows a low acute toxicity via the oral and dermal routes, as well as via inhalation; it is non-irritating to the skin and eyes. Skin sensitisation tests in guinea pigs gave positive results (R43 "May cause sensitisation by skin contact" was proposed). In repeated dose studies, liver was shown to be the target organ. The short-term toxicity No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) for rats and mice were 6.25 and 10 mg/kg bw/day, respectively, on the basis of liver effects (Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Levels - LOAELs 25 and 30 mg/kg bw/day, respectively); in long-term studies the relevant NOAELs were set at 5 mg/kg bw/day for rats and 1.5 mg/kg bw/day for mice (LOAELs 25 mg/kg bw/day and 7.5 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). Propaquizafop did not show any genotoxic potential. Increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were seen in both rats and mice. In one study in rats, an increase in Leydig cell tumours was also noted. Mechanistic studies performed in rats and mice indicate that propaquizafop acts as a peroxisome proliferator. Based on the occurrence of malignant tumours in two species (hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in rats and mice) and on an increased incidence of Leydig cell tumours in rats, proposal for classification and labelling of propaquizafop as Carc. Cat. 3 R40("Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect") was considered and proposed during the meeting. In a multigeneration reproductive toxicity study, there were no treatment-related effects on mating performance, fertility index, gestation length or gestation index. The relevant reproductive NOAEL was 15 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the relevant maternal and offspring NOAEL were 3 mg/kg bw/day. In a rat developmental study, numbers of implantations, corpora lutea and viable foetuses were comparable among groups. No treatment-related skeletal malformations were observed in any dose group. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 20 mg/kg bw/day based on an increased incidence of dilated renal pelvis up to 50 mg/kg bw/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 50 mg/kg bw/day due to decreased body weight gain at 125 mg/kg bw/day. In rabbits, there were no treatment related malformations or developmental changes. The relevant maternal and developmental NOAELs were 6 mg/kg bw/day and 18 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0.015 mg/kg bw/day was based on the NOAEL of 1.5 mg/kg bw/day from the mouse long-term study ( Safety Factor (SF): 100); the NOAEL of 6.25 mg/kg bw/day from the rat 90 day study was the basis for the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, SF 100 and limited oral absorption (65%). Based on the acute toxicological profile of the propaquizafop, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not allocated. The operator, worker and bystander exposure assessment is below the AOEL even without the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
   The metabolism of propaquizafop has been investigated in cotton, soybean, lettuce and sugar beet using C-14-propaquizafop labelled on the phenyl and/or the quinoxaline moiety. The metabolism proceeds primarily with the hydrolysis of the ester link to yield quizalofop followed by the loss of the propionyl moiety leading to quizalofop-phenol(5), these metabolites being also observed as conjugates. Further metabolism occurs by hydroxylation of the quinoxaline moiety giving hydroxy-quizalofop(6) and hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol(7). In addition and in a limited extent, the presence of quinoxaline metabolites and phenoxy acid metabolites indicated a cleavage of the oxygen bond of the molecule. In the sugar beet study, the metabolites quizalofop-phenol, hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol, hydroxy-quinoxaline(8) and dihydroxy-quinoxaline(9) were detected in leaves and roots in similar proportions to propaquizafop and quizalofop. However, taking into account the overall low residue levels expected in leaves and roots at harvest, these metabolites were not included in the plant residue definition. Finally, considering that the radioactivity was not sufficiently characterized in sugar beet and in cotton seeds the notifier was asked to provide clarifications on the uncharacterized radioactivity, otherwise a new metabolism studies on root crop on oilseed crop should be submitted. In conclusion and provisionally the experts proposed the following residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment:
   "Sum of propaquizafop and quizalofop, expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers)". Considering the metabolism studies performed with the three quizalofop esters, a common residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was proposed for propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl as:
   "Sum of quizalofop-esters, quizalofop and quizalofop conjugates expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers)".
   These definitions should remain provisional, pending the submission and the evaluation of the requested information on the toxicological relevance of the phenoxy metabolites observed in the quizalofop-P-ethyl studies. After the meeting, the EFSA was however of the opinion that there is no need to include the conjugates in the residue definition for monitoring.
   Supervised residue trials were submitted to support representative uses on rape seed and sugar beet. Samples were analysed using a method covering propaquizafop, quizalofop and quizalofop-phenol. Although this method was not strictly in line with the residue definition, results were considered as valid since the scope of this method was wider than the proposed residue definitions. The storage stability study showed the residues of propaquizafop, quizalofop and quizalofop-phenol to be stable under deep freeze storage conditions for at least 2 years in soya, rapeseed and tomato matrices. The behaviour of the residues in processing products was not investigated due to the low residue levels detected in the raw agricultural products.
   A rotational crop study performed with C-14-propaquizafop labelled on the quinoxaline moiety was provided. Propaquizafop was not observed in the different rotational plant parts investigated and the detected metabolites (quizalofop, quizalofop-phenol and their hydroxy derivatives) have also been identified in the primary crop studies, suggesting a similar metabolic pathway in both primary and rotational crops. Taking into account the residue levels observed in plants at harvest, it was concluded that no significant residues of propaquizafop or its metabolites are expected in rotational crops.
   Metabolism studies in lactating goat and laying hen were provided. However, the meeting of experts concluded that no residue definitions can be established on the basis of these studies since the characterisation of the radioactivity was not sufficiently investigated in some matrices, especially in fat. However, and taking into account the low residues levels observed in rapeseed and sugar beet, the experts agreed that there is no need to set a residue definition in products of animal origin for propaquizafop at the moment. No feeding study was provided, the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg in diet being not exceeded.
   Considering the comparative metabolite distribution in rat and goat for quizalofop-P-ethyl and propaquizafop, the experts discussed whether a supplementary metabolism study on pig should be requested. The metabolism in rats and ruminants was similar qualitatively but differences were observed quantitatively. Higher residues were detected in rat on an equivalent mg/kg bw basis and the notifiers were asked to provide explanations for these quantitative differences. Such request is not relevant for propaquizafop at the moment, but this point would have to be considered if new uses beyond those supported in this review lead to a significant residue intake by animals.
   No chronic risk for the consumer resulting from the use of propaquizafop according to the representative uses on sugar beet and oilseed rape is expected since the Theoretical Maximum Daily Intake (TMDI) using various calculation models was at most 21% of the ADI (0.015 mg/kg bw/d) using the UK model. No acute evaluation was performed as no ARfD was set for propaquizafop.
   Based on the available supervised residue trials and the proposed residue definition a MRL of 0.05* mg/kg was proposed on sugar beet and rape seed, these MRLs being consistent with the proposals done for quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl on these crops.
   In the environmental fate and behaviour section, the data sets for the common metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop and dihydroxy-quinoxaline available in the DARs of propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were combined in order to derive a single set of endpoints (amalgamated list of endpoints) for the fate properties of each metabolite to use in the environmental exposure assessment.
   In soil under aerobic conditions propaquizafop exhibits very low persistence forming the major soil metabolite quizalofop (accounting for up to 88% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to high persistence, the metabolite hydroxy-quizalofop accounting for up to 33% AR which exhibits low to medium persistence, and the metabolite dihydroxy- quinoxaline accounting for up to 14% AR which exhibits moderate to high persistence. The metabolite hydroxy-quinoxaline (up to 8.8% AR) was present at levels that trigger a groundwater exposure assessment and exhibits moderate to medium persistence. Another minor non transient metabolite in soil (max. 5.4 - 5.7% AR in three consecutive sampling points) was quizalofop-phenol. Mineralisation of the hydroquinone ring or the quinoxaline group to carbon dioxide ranged from 22.6% AR (after 121 days) to 44.2% AR (after 119 days). The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 36 - 39 % AR after 120 - 121 days. Due to the rapid degradation of propaquizafop in soil under aerobic conditions, batch equilibrium studies with the parent compound were not performed. An adsorption Koc of 2220 mL/g has been estimated for modelling purposes, based on the n-octanol/water partition coefficient Log Kow. Quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop exhibit low to high mobility in soil, dihydroxyquinoxaline exhibits low to very high mobility, and hydroxy-quinoxaline exhibits very low mobility in soil. Based on the adsorption properties of the minor non transient metabolite quizalofop-phenol (slight mobility to immobile) a groundwater exposure assessment for this metabolite was considered not necessary. There was no indication in the available data that adsorption of either propaquizafop or its identified soil metabolites was pH dependent.
   In dark natural sediment water systems propaquizafop degraded very rapidly to the metabolites quizalofop (max. 90 % AR in water and max. 45% AR in the sediment), dihydroxy-quinoxaline (max. 10% in the sediment) and hydroxy-quizalofop (max. 11.2% AR in the sediment). The estimated rate of degradation in the aquatic system (DT50 (system), DT50 water, DT50 sed) for propaquizafop and its metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop, dihydroxy-quinoxaline and hydroxy-quinoxaline are not peer reviewed and were not used in the risk assessment. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for hydroxy- quizalofop, dihydroxy- quinoxaline and hydroxy-quinoxaline (Steps 1 and 2) and for propaquizafop and quizalofop (up to Step 3). The initial predicted environmental concentrations in surface water (PECsw) and in sediment (PECsed) were used with the appropriate toxicity endpoints for the calculation of the toxicity exposure ratios (TERs).
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by propaquizafop and its metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop, dihydroxy-quinoxaline, and hydroxy-quinoxaline above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   The lower metabolite toxicity endpoints available in the dossiers for propaquizafop, quizalofop-Pethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were used in the risk assessments of propaquizafop.
   The acute and short-term risk to birds was assessed as low for the intended uses at tier one, as was the long-term risk to herbivorous birds. Further refinements were required to address the risk to insectivorous birds. The rapporteur Member State provided a refined risk assessment in an addendum after the expert meeting (Addendum, July 2008), based on yellow wagtail (Motacilla flava) as generic focal species feeding on a mixed small-large arthropod diet. A TER value of 14.8 was calculated using wet weight based proportion of different food types (PD) refinements, indicating a low long-term risk to insectivorous birds from the intended uses. The first tier acute and long-term TERs were above the Annex VI trigger for mammals, indicating a low risk from the intended uses. All TERs for secondary poisoning to birds and mammals were above the Annex VI trigger, indicating a low risk from all intended uses. The acute risk from consumption of contaminated drinking water was assessed for the puddle scenario. TERs were above the Annex VI trigger of 10 for both birds and mammals. The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from plant metabolites was not addressed in the DAR or during the peer review. Mammal toxicity and metabolism data, however, suggest that the risk to herbivorous mammals was covered by the risk assessment for the parent substance. Propaquizafop was found to be very toxic to aquatic organisms, with fish being the most sensitive species tested. A comparable toxicity was identified for the macrophyte Glyceria fluitans exposed to the metabolite quizalofop. FOCUS Step 3 exposure refinements were required to identify a low risk to aquatic organisms. For use in sugar beet all FOCUS Step 3 scenarios indicated a low risk to aquatic organisms, whereas only 3 out of 5 scenarios for spring use in oilseed rape and 2 out of 6 in winter oilseed rape indicated a low risk to aquatic organisms. The risk to sediment dwellers and the risk from bioaccumulation were assessed as low. The risk to non-target arthropods needed to be refined further to address the in-field risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi. A no-spray buffer zone of 5 m was required to identify a low risk to the non-target plants, based on the most sensitive vegetative vigour endpoint for oat.
   The risk to bees, earthworms, biological methods for sewage treatment and other soil non-target macro- and micro-organisms was assessed as low.

AB  - Triflumuron is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triflumuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 28 February 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on apples, pears, peaches and nectarines. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Alsystin SC 480", a suspension concentrate (SC), containing 480g/l triflumuron.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition except for air where a data gap has been identified. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.
   Sufficient data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Data for the relevant impurities is missing and the specification can not be finalised. A method for the active substance in the plant protection product has been identified as a data gap. Also some physchem properties have been identified as data gaps.
   With regard to its toxicological properties, triflumuron is extensively absorbed after oral administration and has a low acute toxicity. The main adverse effect after repeated administration is haemolytic anaemia with compensative responses and secondary effects in different organs. No mutagenic or carcinogenic potential has been demonstrated in the available tests. In the reproductive toxicity testing, no specific effects on the fertility parameters, on the growth of the offspring or on the foetal development were observed in the absence of maternal toxicity. It was agreed that triflumuron has no specific neurotoxic potential.
   Several tests were performed on metabolites and/or impurities. According to them, three impurities were considered toxicologically relevant, three plant metabolites were considered covered by the toxicological studies with the parent (use of the same reference value) but new toxicological data were required for the derivation of the acute reference dose for one acutely toxic plant metabolite. The agreed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for triflumuron is 0.014 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 1-year dog study supported by the 2-year rat study and with the use of a safety factor of 100. The agreed Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.036 mg/kg bw/day, based on the overall NOAEL of the 90-day rat studies and applying a safety factor of 100. The derivation of an Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not considered needed for the triflumuron, however it was agreed to require further data in order to derive an ARfD for the plant metabolite M07, since this metabolite was shown to be more acutely toxic
   The agreed dermal absorption values resulting from in vivo and in vitro testing are 1% for the concentrate (mixing/loading) and 5% for the dilution (application). The estimated operator exposure levels according to the models are below the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment, and the estimated exposure values for the workers and bystanders are even lower.
   The plant metabolism of triflumuron was investigated in apples, potatoes and soybean. The study on apples was assessed by the RMS as having several deficiencies, and hence a new fruit metabolism study has been required to support the notified uses in pome fruit and stone fruit crops. The meeting of experts noted deficiencies also in the metabolism studies in potatoes and soybean and agreed that further data is necessary to conclude on a final plant residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring. Though the number and quality of the submitted residue trials was considered sufficient, the conducted trials do not determine all compounds included in the provisionally proposed residue definition for the risk assessment. In addition, further studies on the level of residues in processed fruit commodities are necessary to allow robust estimates of human and livestock dietary exposure to residues present following the use of triflumuron. Consequently, the assessment in terms of potential residues in food of animal origin including a residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in animal products could not be finalised, neither could the consumer exposure and risk assessment be concluded. In addition, the need for further data to derive an ARfD was identified for 4-trifluoromethoxyaniline, a metabolite and degradation product of triflumuron that has been considered pertinent for the consumer risk assessment.
   At the current stage, with the data available and eligible for evaluation it was only possible to provisionally propose residue definitions and MRLs for the notified uses. However, precise estimates of human and livestock dietary exposure, and finally a robust consumer risk assessment can only be finalised when the outstanding data and information will be evaluated.
   Triflumuron is low to moderate persistent in soil (DT50 (lab 20 degrees C) = 6.9 - 52 d) under dark aerobic conditions. Two major metabolites are formed: 2-chlrobenzoic acid (M02, max. 23.5 % TRR; DT50(lab) (20 degrees C) = 1.2 - 4.2 d) and 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl urea (M08, TMPU, max. 23.1 % TRR; DT50(lab 20 degrees C) = 1.3 - 20.5 d). Trifluoromethoxyphenyl ring was less mineralized and more prone to form unextractable residues than the chlorophenyl ring. The range of pH in the soils investigated was too narrow with respect to the directive requirements. Therefore, a new data gap to address the rate of aerobic degradation of parent and formation and degradation rates of metabolites in alkaline soils was identified.
   From the data available it was not possible to derive reliable half lives either for parent or for major soil metabolites under anaerobic conditions. Metabolites M2 (max 46.7 % AR) and M08 (max. 48.5 % AR) were the only major metabolites identified under dark anaerobic conditions. According the study available, triflumuron may be considered stable to photolysis in soil.
   PEC soil calculations were presented in addendum 2 were accepted by the experts for the parent compound. However, new PEC soil calculations for metabolite M02 and M08 were requested. The new PEC soil have been calculated with the agreed input parameters and EFSA has presented the figures in the list of end points (a mistake was identified in the values calculated in addendum 3).
   According available adsorption / desorption studies triflumuron may be considered immobile to low mobile in soil (Koc = 1629 - 30006 mL/g),metabolite M08 may be considered medium to high mobile in soil (Koc = 280 - 113 mL/g) and M02 may be considered very high mobile in soil (Koc = 4.0 - 8.8 mL/g). However, available data may only be considered relevant for acidic soils. Therefore, the experts identified a data gap for batch adsorption / desorption studies with more alkaline soils for parent and metabolite M02. The PRAPeR meeting of experts noted that these studies would eventually influence the results of PECGW and PECSW calculations and that these calculations may need to be revised.
   Triflumuron was stable to hydrolysis at pH 5 and 7 and degrades with a half life between 29 and 57 d at pH 9. Main hydrolysis metabolites at this pH were M02 (max. 28.9 % AR after 30) and M08 (max. 48.8 % AR after 30 d). According the available study, aqueous photolysis is considered to contribute only in a minor extent to the overall degradation of triflumuron. In the lack of the corresponding study, it is proposed to classify triflumuron as not readily biodegradable.
   In water sediment systems triflumuron partitioned to the sediment and degraded (DT50 = 4.1 - 7.1 d) to major metabolites M08 (max in water: 47.8 % AR after 14 d, max. in sed.: 20.4 % AR after 7 d; DT50 = 11.4 - 11.7 d) and M02 (max in water: 60.4 % AR after 14 d, max. in sed.: 7.9 % AR after 14 d; DT50 = 17.6 - 62.9 d). Mineralization was more important for the chlorophenyl ring than of the trifluoromethoxyphenyl moiety. The pH of the water phase of the systems investigated was in the alkaline range. A data gap, which was not considered essential to finalize the EU risk assessment, was identified for water / sediment studies within a wider range of pH values.
   The meeting agreed that FOCUS PEC (SW / SED) presented in the DAR (including the Step 4 approach based on GIS) were not appropriate for the EU risk assessment. New FOCUS PECSW based on FOCUS kinetics were requested. New calculations provided in addendum 3 are not peer reviewed. EFSA considers that Step 2 calculations for metabolites are adequate for risk assessment. However, Step 3 and Step 4 calculations do not necessary represent worst case estimations. Step 3 single application calculations are still missing for the combination of input parameters agreed by the meeting.
   Potential ground water contamination was addressed in the DAR by FOCUS PECGW calculations (80th percentile at 1 m depth) for triflumuron and its soil metabolites M02 and M08 with the FOCUS model PEARL and the nine FOCUS GW scenarios. Formation fraction of one had been assumed in these calculations for both soil metabolites M02 and M08. During the peer review data gaps have been identified for triflumuron and the metabolite M02 adsorption / desorption studies on more alkaline soils. Furthermore, rate of formation / degradation on alkaline soils needs to be investigated for triflumuron and both soil metabolites M02 and M08. Therefore, results of the available modelling are only relevant for acidic soils. Under these conditions neither the parent triflumuron nor any of the two soil metabolites M02 and M08 are expected to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g / L.
   The first-tier risk assessment for birds resulted in acute and short-term TERs above the Annex VI trigger of 10 but the long-term TER was below the trigger of 5. The refined long-term risk assessment was based on blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) as a focal species. A PT of 0.61 and a RUD of 5.1 (birds feeding only on large insects) was suggested to refine the risk assessment. The experts rejected the RUD refinement since no data supported the assumption that blue tits would feed only on large insects. The long-term TER was below the trigger of 5 on the basis of the agreed refinement steps and the revised long-term NOEC of 20 ppm. Therefore a data gap was identified in the expert meeting. The acute and long-term trigger values for mammals were exceeded in the first-tier risk assessment indicating a low risk. The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm- and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low.
   Triflumuron was very toxic to aquatic invertebrates. The acute and chronic TERs for daphnids were significantly below the Annex VI triggers of 100 and 10 for all FOCUS step 4 scenarios with a no-spray buffer zone of 30 m. A mesocosm study was submitted. The experts agreed on a regulatory endpoint of 0.1 mu g a.s./L in combination with an assessment factor of 3. A no-spray buffer zone of 30 m would not be sufficient to achieve TERs > 3. Further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment is needed. The risk to adult bees was low but bee brood was very sensitive to exposure to triflumuron (insect growth regulator). Exposure of bees was considered to take place via flowering weeds in the orchards. Increased mortality of pupae was observed at an application rate relevant for exposure on weeds. It was further noted that the second application was not covered by the field studies. It was not sufficiently demonstrated that the risk to bee brood development was low and risk mitigation measures such as cutting flowering weeds in the treated field were suggested to protect bees. Chrysoperla carnea was the most sensitive non-target arthropod species tested. This observation was confirmed in a field study in an apple orchard. Full recovery of affected arthropod populations (including the most sensitive species C. carnea) was observed. The study provided some evidence that a sufficiently high number of Chrysoperla larvae could survive in the untreated area to allow recolonisation of the treated in-field area. Overall it was concluded that the risk to non-target arthropods was sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. No long-term studies were conducted with earthworms. Since triflumuron inhibits the chitin synthesis the experts considered the potential adverse long-term effects on earthworms necessary to be investigated and therefore a data gap was identified. No studies with other soil non- target macro-organisms were made available for triflumuron. The experts agreed in the meeting that studies with collembola should be conducted considering the high toxicity to arthropods and that the DT90 can be longer than 100 days under some soil conditions.
   The risk to soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Paraffin oil (CAS 8042-47-5, chain lengths C-17-C-31, boiling point 280-460 degrees C) is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/20042, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/20073. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on paraffin oil (CAS 8042-47-5) in accordance with the provisions of Article 21(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 7 May 2008. The peer review was initiated on 30 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Stahler International GmbH&Co.KG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide for use on pome fruit, stone fruit, grapes and ornamentals. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of endpoints.
   The representative formulated products for the evaluation were 'Para Sommer', it is currently not clear what the formulation type is and a data gap is set to address this.
   Methods of analysis for food items are currently not required see section 3. For environmental matrices methods are not required for groundwater and air, for surface water a method is required for alkanes (chain lengths up to C31). For soil it is not concluded if a method is required or not, see sections 4 and 5.
   Sufficient internationally accepted methods (e.g. ASTM and ISO) are available to characterise the technical material and formulated product. However, at this time the technical specification is not accepted, the method of manufacture is not known and there is no supporting batch data. Data gaps have been identified for vapour pressure and auto-flammability of the technical paraffin oil. For the formulation, data gaps have been identified for flash point and emulsion stability after shelf-life storage.
   During the mammalian toxicology meeting, as no technical specification was agreed by the meeting on physical and chemical properties, concerns were raised over relevant impurities generally associated with these compounds. While it is not demonstrated that no concern is raised due to the impurity profile of the substance, paraffin oil has to be classified as T "Toxic", carcinogenic category 2, R45 "May cause cancer". On this basis, no toxicological studies were required, no ADI, AOEL or ARfD were proposed and no risk assessment of operator, worker and bystander exposure could be conducted, as the experts considered that these specifications were not acceptable from the toxicological point of view.
   It was noted however, that if highly purified paraffin oils were considered (i.e. no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the active substance), then no toxicological concern would be raised for consumers, operators, workers and bystanders. Sources of mineral oil are laxatives in pharmacy, or oils used in food technology as release agents, for lubrication purposes, or as a substitute for fat. Paraffin oils are chemically inert substances, especially the straight chain (n) alkanes and on ingestion most of the mineral oil (about 98% depending on the length of the C-chain) remains unabsorbed and is rapidly excreted, mostly unchanged, via faeces.
   Paraffin oil has a low toxicity profile. No toxicological study was submitted or accepted. The experts agreed that no short term, long term, genotoxicity, or reproductive toxicity studies would be required, provided that no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the substance; paraffin oils are not considered to be genotoxic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic or toxic to reproduction. Also in line with the low toxicity of paraffin oils (of high purity), no ADI, AOEL or ARfD would be proposed, nor considered necessary, and no risk assessment for operators, workers and bystanders would be required.
   The list of endpoints on mammalian toxicology has been filled in considering that the technical material does not contain unacceptable levels of relevant impurities.
   No information on potential levels of residues in food or feed items were presented in the DAR. A consumer risk assessment has not been performed due to the possible high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. If these compounds are present then it would result in a toxicological classification that would mean that these compounds could not be registered as Plant Protection Products. The risk to consumers can therefore not be finalised.
   In soil under aerobic conditions this paraffin oil mixture exhibits moderate to medium persistence in terms of the time taken for carbon tetrachloride extracted alkanes to be mineralised. The alkanes in the mixture are classed as immobile in soil, on the basis of QSAR estimates and adsorption is not pH dependent. In a 55 cm deep microcosm study this paraffin oil mixture formed a layer at the water surface (spray application made), where it dissipated rapidly exhibiting low persistence in water. Sediment concentrations were not measured. The mechanism of the dissipation was not identified. Surface water exposure assessments are available using the SWASH drift calculator tool. A data gap is identified regarding the potential for water body associated sediment to be exposed and information on degradation/dissipation potential of this paraffin oil mixture in sediment. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by alkanes up to C31 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   Based on the available data, paraffin oil was proposed to be classified as toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute risk of paraffin oil to fish was assessed as low for all the relevant scenarios. Risk mitigation measures equivalent to 25m, 3m and 1m no-spray buffer zones were necessary to refine the risk for aquatic invertebrates and alga for the pome-fruit, grapevines and ornamental uses. The available information did not allow the risk to sediment dwelling organisms to be assessed.
   Standard laboratory tests were conducted with the formulation 'Para Sommer' and the species Coccinella septempunctata (0 % effects on mortality; 58 % fecundity) and Phytoseidus permisilis on the leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris (69 % of mortality). Two extended laboratory studies with the standard indicator species Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri were submitted. The in-field HQ values were above the Annex VI trigger values, however the off-field HQs were below the triggers. Therefore, the in-field risk should be further addressed and risk mitigation measures should be considered.
   Data gaps were identified after the peer review by EFSA to address the risk to soil non-target micro-organisms and to soil non-target macro-organisms.
   The risk to birds and mammals, bees (with mitigation to avoid direct spraying of bees), nontarget plants, and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Tebufenpyrad is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tebufenpyrad in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 12 March 2007. The peer review was initiated on 6 February 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June-July 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as acaricide, insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in pome fruit for the control of mite pests on all developmental stages of mites. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "BAS 31806I" ("MASAI"), a wettable powder (WP) containing 200 g/kg tebufenpyrad.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The specification cannot be finalised as there are outstanding issues. Also a shelf-life study and a new suspensibility study have been identified as data gaps.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor tebufenpyrad residues in food/feed of plant origin and environmental matrices.
   Mammalian toxicology of tebufenpyrad was assessed in a series of tests. Tebufenpyrad is absorbed extensively but slowly. It is widely distributed and has no potential for accumulation. It is excreted slowly but completely and is rapidly and extensively metabolized. It is of moderate toxicity by the oral and the inhalation route and of low toxicity by the dermal route. Tebufenpyrad is neither irritant to skin nor to the eyes but is a skin sensitizer. Based on the available data on acute toxicity a classification as Xn; R20 ("Harmful; Harmful by inhalation"), Xn; R22 ("Harmful; Harmful if swallowed") and Xi; R43 ("Irritant; May cause sensitization by skin contact") is proposed.
   In short term tests with tebufenpyrad effects on bodyweight and food consumption were observed in all species tested (rat, mouse, dog and rabbit). While in rats and mice the liver was the target of toxicity, in dogs gastrointestinal effects and lesions were prevalent. The lowest no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was achieved in the rat (0.7 mg/kg bw/day). In dogs an overall NOAEL of 2 mg/kg bw/day was set. Tebufenpyrad is not genotoxic. A 2-year rat study and an 18-month study with mice were reported. In the rat study a systemic NOAEL of 0.8 mg/kg bw/day was derived based on effects on bodyweight and food consumption, altered erythrocyte parameters, and liver effects. The liver adenomas observed were considered not relevant for human risk assessment. In the mouse study a NOAEL of 3.6 mg/kg bw/day was derived based on increased liver and kidney weights, and reduced bodyweight and food consumption. No tumours were observed. Tebufenpyrad did not cause specific effects on reproduction in a two-generation study. While no effects on development were observed in rabbits, in rats increased incidences of supernumerary ribs were seen at maternally toxic doses.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) were set at 0.01 mg/kg bw/day. An acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.02 mg/kg bw was allocated.
   Using the German model operator exposure amounted to 65% (tractor-mounted application) and to 92% (hand-held application) of the AOEL when personal protective equipment (PPE) was used. In the UK POEM exposure exceeded the AOEL in all scenarios. Worker exposure was calculated to be 57% of the AOEL when PPE is used. A refined exposure assessment after the PRAPeR meeting of experts showed a bystander exposure of 93% of the systemic AOEL.
   The metabolism of tebufenpyrad in apples was investigated. Application was made at a rate of 2.22 kg a.s./ha which is a 22N rate. Some minor metabolites were identified but given that the study was conducted at such a high rate the only significant residue will be tebufenpyrad. The residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment is therefore tebufenpyrad only. Sufficient residue trials were supplied for the critical GAP in the north and south of Europe. Residues of tebufenpyrad were stable under freezer storage for a period of at least two years. On processing, the nature of the residue will be unchanged, and sufficient data were supplied to derive processing factors for juice and pomace. Metabolism data in goat and hen were provided; the most significant residues were tebufenpyrad, CL 810,7202 and CL 810,721(3). In a ruminant feeding study, even at 3N, significant residues of tebufenpyrad as well as these two metabolites were not found. Also at the 10N rate, only very low levels were found. The meeting of experts concluded that there will be no significant residues present in products of animal origin. The residue definition was therefore set as tebufenpyrad for monitoring and risk assessment for ruminant only. The meeting noted however, that this should be considered again if other uses lead to higher intakes. No conclusion was reached on the residue definition for poultry. However, the notified uses would not give rise to significant residues in poultry as there is no dietary exposure. The risk assessment showed that maximum intakes are 28 % of the ADI and 64 % of the ARfD. An MRL for pome fruit was set at 0.2 mg/kg.
   In soil under aerobic conditions tebufenpyrad exhibits moderate to medium persistence forming the major soil metabolite CL 810,721 (accounting for up to 23% of applied radioactivity (AR)), which exhibits low to moderate persistence, and the minor non-transient metabolite CL 810,7284 (accounting for up to 5.1 % AR). Mineralisation of both the benzene- and pyrazole rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 16% AR and 9.2-43.9% AR, respectively, after 120-122 days. The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 3.5 % AR and 2.5-35.5% AR, respectively, after 120-122 days. Photolysis studies with tebufenpyrad on soil revealed CL 810,7295 to be the major photo- degradation product accounting for up to 12% AR. Tebufenpyrad is immobile to low mobile in soil; CL 810,721 and CL 810,729 exhibit high to very high mobility in soil, and CL 810,728 is very highly mobile. There was no indication that adsorption of tebufenpyrad, CL 810,728 and CL 810,729 were pH-dependent, whilst sorption of CL 810,721 was clearly dependent on pH in soil.
   In dark natural sediment water systems tebufenpyrad partitioned rapidly from water to sediment, where the metabolite CL 810,721 was formed at maximum 16.5% of AR in the water phase. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for tebufenpyrad up to step 4, step 3 for metabolite CL 810,728 and step 2 for metabolites CL 810,721 and CL 810,729. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by tebufenpyrad and its metabolites CL 810,721, CL 810,728 and CL 810,729 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations, that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   The acute and short-term risk to birds and the acute and long-term risk to mammals were assessed as low in a first-tier risk assessment. The long-term (reproductive) endpoint for birds was discussed by the experts. A long-term NOEL of 6.6 mg a.s./kg bw/day was agreed based on effects on reduced number of hatchlings, eggs laid and 14-day old survivors at the higher tested concentrations. The first-tier long-term TER was below the Annex VI trigger of 5. The refined risk assessment based on the agreed PD (proportion of different food types) resulted still in a TER below 5, and a data gap was identified to further refine the long-term risk to insectivorous birds. The risk to earthworm-and fish-eating birds was assessed as low.
   Tebufenpyrad was very toxic to fish and to aquatic invertebrates with steep dose-response curves. All FOCUS step 4 scenarios resulted in acute TERs > 100 for daphnids, if a no-spray buffer zone of 20m was applied. However, no full FOCUS step 4 scenario resulted in TERs above the Annex VI trigger for fish. The risk assessment for fish was refined by HC5 (hazard concentration of the 5th percentile of the species distribution) calculation based on five species. The experts suggested using the lower limit HC5 (95% tile lower confidence limit) of 6.1 mu g a.s./L together with a reduced safety factor of 10. The trigger was exceeded in all FOCUS step 4 scenarios with a no-spray buffer zone of 20m. The long-term risk assessment for invertebrates was based on a population development study with daphnids (NOEC of 4 mu g a.s./L). The Annex VI trigger of 10 was exceeded in the full scenarios D3, D4, R1, R4 and the part scenario D5 (pond), but was below the trigger in the full scenarios R2, R3 and the part scenario D5 (stream), if a 20m no-spray buffer zone was applied. The risk from the major metabolites in water and soil was assessed as low. The maximum bioconcentration factor (BCF) for fish, normalised to the lipid content, was 953. Tebufenpyrad was rapidly metabolised and excreted with a clearance time CT90 of 1.65 days. It is applied only once per year and it dissipates rapidly from the water phase. Therefore it was concluded, that the risk from bioconcentration and bioaccumulation is low. The risk to sediment-dwelling organisms was assessed as low.
   T. pyri was the most sensitive arthropod species tested. A potential for high in-field and off-field risk was indicated in the first-tier risk assessment. In higher tier (extended laboratory) tests it was shown that the off-field risk to T. pyri is low. Recolonisation of the in-field area was considered as plausible, since effects were <50% after 14 days of ageing of residues.
   The risk to bees, earthworms, other soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Teflubenzuron is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on teflubenzuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 August 2007. The peer review was initiated on 26 November 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF Agro BV. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier which comprise foliar spraying in apple and indoor tomatoes for the control of codling moth, leafminers, whiteflies and caterpillars. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Nomolt", a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 150 g/l teflubenzuron.
   The minimum purity of teflubenzuron could not be concluded on as with the data available no specification could be set.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   There are methods available to monitor teflubenzuron residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin, soil and water, however data gaps were identified for confirmatory method(s) for the determination of teflubenzuron from plant matrices, from soil and from drinking and surface water. An analytical method to determine teflubenzuron residues in surface water with an LOQ of 0.0025 mu g/l and a primary method for the determination of teflubenzuron from air with an LOQ of 1.8 mu g/m(3) are missing.
   In the mammalian metabolism studies, teflubenzuron was rapidly but only partially absorbed after oral administration. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation; teflubenzuron was eliminated mainly unchanged via faeces. The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route and no eye or skin irritation was observed. As the study on skin sensitisation was not considered acceptable by the experts, classification of teflubenzuron with R43, may cause sensitization by skin contact, was proposed. The main target organ of teflubenzuron was the liver upon short term or long term exposure in either the rat, mouse or dog species; the relevant NOAEL for short term exposure was the dose level of 8.0 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat feeding study; only a LOAEL could be derived from the long term studies due to slight hepatotoxicity found at 2.1 mg/kg bw/day in the 18-month oncogenicity study in mouse. Benign hepatocellular adenomas observed only in this mouse study were not considered relevant for human exposure. There was no evidence for genotoxic or neurotoxic potential related to teflubenzuron administration; no effect on the reproduction, fertility or development was observed. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of teflubenzuron was 0.01 mg/kg bw/day based on the LOAEL from the 18-month study in mouse and applying a safety factor of 200; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.016 mg/kg bw/day based on the oral 90-day rat study, a safety factor of 100 and a correction factor of 20 % for low oral absorption; no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 2 % for the concentrate representative formulation and 20 % for the in-use spray dilution. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation Nomolt, at a maximum dose rate of 0.120 kg teflubenzuron/ha in apples and of 0.225 kg teflubenzuron/ha in protected tomatoes was below the AOEL, when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was considered. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with teflubenzuron was below the AOEL, either if the dermal absorption assumption is based on the value obtained with the concentrate formulation or, alternatively, if PPE are worn. Bystander, residential and exposure of small children playing on a lawn contaminated with fallout from spray drift containing Nomolt were all estimated to be below the AOEL.
   Concerning residues, the metabolism of teflubenzuron was investigated in apples, potatoes and a further study on spinach which was not regarded as acceptable by the PRAPeR meeting of experts. The major component in the crops at harvest was unmetabolised teflubenzuron. The experts requested new metabolism studies on rotational crops to support the use of teflubenzuron on tomatoes grown in glass houses on soil based systems, because the submitted studies were under dosed. Therefore, only a provisional residue definition could be proposed. Currently only the use of teflubenzuron on protected tomatoes is sufficiently supported by residue trials to set a provisional MRL. The PRAPeR meeting of experts followed the RMS's suggestion and set a data gap for residue trials on cherry tomatoes to cover fully the notified use on tomatoes. For the use on apples a data gap for further residue trials was identified. Sufficient processing studies on tomatoes were submitted to calculate transfer factors. Further processing studies are required for apples.
   The metabolism study on goats and the animal transfer studies on dairy cattle require further investigation and the PRAPeR meeting of experts proposed a data gap for a new metabolism study and data on storage stability in animal products. Depending on the results of the metabolism study further studies on livestock might be required. Therefore, only provisional residue definitions for animal products were proposed. Intake calculations for livestock, which are required to support the notified use on apples, can only be carried out when the additional data on livestock and apple processing studies are available.
   The consumer risk assessment and the MRL proposals cannot be finalised. On the basis of a provisional intake calculation for tomatoes only, the consumer exposure is expected to be below the ADI.
   Teflubenzuron is moderate to high persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions (DT50 = 30.4 - 151.5 d) and yields 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea as a major metabolite. Another metabolite, 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluoroaniline, exceeded 5 % in two non consecutive data points. After consultation with the experts on toxicology, a data gap to address ground water exposure for this metabolite has been identified.
   Reliable kinetic parameters (formation and degradation rate constants) for the major metabolite 3,5-dichloro-2,4-dichlorophenylurea were not available and the PRAPeR meeting of experts identified a data gap for these parameters. The ground water exposure assessment may need to be subsequently updated.
   Degradation was faster under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic ones in the experiment available where the rest of conditions are maintained. However, anaerobic conditions are not considered to be especially relevant for the representative uses (tomato and apple) evaluated at EU level. Photolysis does not significantly contribute to the environmental degradation of teflubenzuron in soil under EU realistic conditions.
   Four field dissipation studies are available, which allow appropriately deriving the dissipation half lives for PEC soil calculations. However, the PRAPeR meeting of experts identified a new data gap for a new kinetic evaluation of field dissipation study for its use in environmental modelling. This data gap was not considered essential to finalise the EU risk assessment.
   PEC soil of teflubenzuron was calculated in the DAR for the use in apples (outdoor) based on the worst case field half live of 16.4 days. For the metabolites 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea, 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluoroaniline the peak maximum PEC soil was calculated based on the maximum formations observed in the laboratory studies.
   According to the available studies teflubenzuron may be considered immobile in soil (K-OC = 21 139 32 556 mL / g) and the metabolite 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea may be considered to exhibit low mobility in soil (KOC = 942 - 1720 mL / g).
   In water teflubenzuron is stable at pH 5 and 7 and hydrolyses with a DT50 = 8.7 d at pH 9. The metabolite 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea is expected to be stable to hydrolysis in the normal range of environmental conditions.
   The RMS estimated an aqueous photolysis half-life of 13.7 days (40 degrees N, continuous irradiation) on basis of the available study. RMS considered that photolysis would not contribute significantly to the environmental degradation of teflubenzuron under realistic conditions for the representative uses. Teflubenzuron was not readily biodegradable according the available study.
   Dissipation / degradation of teflubenzuron was investigated in two dark aerobic water/sediment systems. In both systems, teflubenzuron partitioned to the sediment and degraded (DT50whole system = 11 - 21.4 d) to form the major metabolites 5-chloro-2,4-difluoroaniline (UNK 5 in the DAR), 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenyl-urea, 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluoroaniline and 2,6-difluorobenzoic acid. The applicant provided PECSW/SED calculations based on FOCUS Step 1 and Step 2 for the metabolites 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea, 3,5-dichloro-2,4difluoroaniline, 2,6-difluorobenzoic acid and 5-chloro-2,4-difluoroaniline for the use in apples.
   For the parent teflubenzuron PECSW/SED values were calculated with FOCUS scheme up to Step 4 considering up to 100 m spray drift buffer zone for the use in apples. It is noted that this buffer zone represents a 99.6 % mitigation when compared with Step 3 (above the 95 % mitigation deemed as practicable by the FOCUS Landscape and Mitigation guidance document).
   For the greenhouse use in tomatoes the RMS provided indicative parent PECSW value of 0.0225 mg/L based on 0.1 % losses to surface water (Dutch model). However, the RMS also indicated that from the ecotoxicology assessment the total loss from glasshouse should be 0.00001 % only. To attain this low level, glasshouses would have to operate with negligible emissions of teflubenzuron. With the available information, it is not possible to assess if measures that actually achieve these low levels of emission rates are practicable. Therefore, EFSA proposed a critical area of concern for the aquatic environment with respect to the uses in green house.
   The PRAPeR meeting of experts considered for teflubenzuron that the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L is not expected to be exceeded for the representative use in apples.
   No PECGW calculations are available for metabolite 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluoroaniline. The need to address the potential ground water contamination by this metabolite has been identified after consultation with the PRAPeR meeting of experts on toxicology. No groundwater assessment is available for the greenhouse use. Therefore, the assessment presented is considered only to address situations were plants are grown on artificial substrate or on hydroponics. On basis of its properties long term transport of teflubenzuron through the atmosphere is not expected to be of concern.
   The acute and short term risk to birds and the acute and long term risk to mammals were concluded to be low in a first-tier assessment. No valid long term endpoint (reproductive toxicity) was available for birds and therefore, a data gap was identified for a suitable chronic study. The risk to earthworm and fish-eating mammals was considered low.
   Teflubenzuron is highly toxic to aquatic organisms. A lower acute toxicity to fish was observed when formulated. Water/sediment metabolites were less toxic than the active substance and thus considered as not ecotoxicologically relevant. The most sensitive organisms tested were aquatic invertebrates. These effects were addressed by higher tier studies. A NOEC = 0.005 mu g a.s./L from a mesocosm study and an assessment factor (AF) of 2 was agreed by the PRAPeR meeting of experts. The first-tier risk assessment indicated a potential high risk to aquatic organisms. For the outdoor use on apples, FOCUS step 4 scenarios only resulted in toxicity exposure ratios (TERs) above the trigger values for fish and algae if a no-spray buffer zone of 16 m was included in the calculations. None of the FOCUS step 4 scenarios resulted in TERs above the triggers for invertebrates, even including a no-spray buffer of 100 m and taking into account the higher tier study. For the application on greenhouse tomatoes, TERs based on the Dutch model PEC values were below the Annex VI triggers, except those related to the formulated product for fish (acute) and for algae. As mentioned above, a total loss percentage from glasshouses as low as 0.00001% would be needed to be achieve a low risk. Since during the peer review no mitigation measures were assessed which could allow the achievement of such negligible emissions, a potential high risk to aquatic organisms from greenhouse uses cannot be excluded. A data gap was suggested for further refinements.
   A low risk to adult bees was identified. A potential high risk to hive development was not excluded, as clear effects on the bee population reduction were observed at tested rates lower than the GAP. Therefore, a data gap was suggested to further address the risk to bees for the outdoor use. For the glasshouse use the risk to bee population was expected to be low. However the risk to introduced pollinators might need to be managed. A high risk for non-target-arthropods was identified for the in-field exposure scenario and a no-spray buffer zone of 15 m would be needed to meet the trigger of 2 for the off-field scenario. The oral uptake was considered by the RMS a major route of exposure. The submitted data as well as the ESCORT2 approach did not address this route of exposure. A data gap was identified to further address the risk to non-target arthropods (i.e. a field study), considering the mode of action of the active substance and the potential for recovery.
   Since teflubenzuron is a chitin synthesis inhibitor, a data gap was identified for a chronic study on earthworms, even if the acute risk was assessed as low and the DT50 in soil was lower than 100 d.
   The risk to other soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Bensulfuron is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within 6 months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bensulfuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 11 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 24 November 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant United Phosphorus Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on rice for the control of broad-leaved weeds and Cyperaceae as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Londax (R), a water-dispersible granule (WG) containing 600 g/kg of bensulfuron-methyl which is a variant of bensulfuron(2).
   The technical specification is not finalised, a data gap was identified for a revised specification. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor bensulfuron-methyl residues in food/feed of plant origin, soil, surface water and air; however no monitoring methods were submitted for the metabolites set as part of the residue definition in ground water. An analytical method for food of animal origin is not required due to the fact that no residue definition is proposed.
   In the mammalian metabolism studies, bensulfuron-methyl was rapidly but incompletely absorbed after oral administration. It was distributed mainly to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys and plasma and was extensively metabolised, showing no potential for accumulation. The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route; no eye or skin irritation was observed and no skin sensitisation potential was found in a Magnusson & Kligman test. The main target organ of bensulfuron-methyl was the liver upon short term or long term exposure in either the rat, mouse or dog species; the relevant NOAEL for both short term and long term exposure was the dose level of 19.9 mg/kg bw/day from the one-year dog study. No potential for neurotoxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity was seen with bensulfuron-methyl; no reproductive or fertility effects were observed in a two-generation reproduction toxicity study. Some unspecific effects or delay in the development of rats were observed upon high dosing of bensulfuron-methyl without expressing maternal toxicity, in rabbits only decreased body weight was observed at maternal toxic doses.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of bensulfuron-methyl was 0.2 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.12 mg/kg bw/day based on the same 1-year dog study, safety factor of 100, and applying a correction factor of 60 % for low oral absorption; no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 5.9 % for the concentrate representative formulation and 7.2 % for the in-use spray dilution, based on an in vivo study in rat. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation Londax (R) (a water dispersible granule (WG) formulation containing 600 g/kg of bensulfuron-methyl), at a maximum dose rate of 0.06 kg bensulfuron-methyl/ha in rice was below the AOEL according to the UK POEM, only when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) as gloves during mixing/loading and application was considered; according to the German model, estimated exposure was below the AOEL even when no PPE were worn. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with bensulfuron-methyl was below the AOEL, without the use of PPE. Bystander exposure was low compared to the AOEL value.
   In metabolism studies with radio labelled bensulfuron-methyl in paddy rice, upon application to the water surface, levels of total radioactivity recovered in rice plants were very low and hence identification of residues was limited to the extractable radioactivity from foliage and straw. Neither intact bensulfuron-methyl nor bensulfuron was detected, but, though at very low levels, some metabolites could be identified that indicate a cleavage of the sulfonylurea bridge occurred. In the meeting of experts the need for further data on the nature of the residue in plants with foliar exposure and in rotational crops was identified. Therefore a residue definition for risk assessment and MRL setting purposes could only be proposed provisionally as bensulfuron-methyl.
   Residue trials with post-emergence application to rice plants indicate that under practical conditions, residues of bensulfuron-methyl above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are not expected in rice grain, while in rice straw residues above the LOQ could be found in one trial.
   In a confined rotational crop study total residues in the rotated crops did not exceed 0.01 mg/kg, however data indicated an increase of residues in rotated cereals with time and thus clarification on potential uptake of soil metabolites is required.
   No significant residues are expected to occur in commodities to be processed or used in livestock diet, and therefore no further investigation in processing studies and livestock studies is required to support the representative uses in rice.
   In a provisional chronic consumer exposure and risk assessment, based on the provisional residue definition for risk assessment, it was demonstrated that the maximum estimated dietary intake of residues of bensulfuron-methyl is well below (<1%) the toxicological reference value ADI. As no ARfD was allocated an acute risk assessment is not considered necessary. Based on the available environmental fate and behaviour studies in aerobic soil and aerobic natural sediment water systems it was identified that bensulfuron-methyl and the breakdown products IN-F78803 (max 9.7% applied radioactivity (AR) in whole natural sediment water systems), bensulfuron (max 27.7% AR in soil), IN-J02904(max 46% AR in soil), IN-N52975 (max 31.7% AR in whole natural sediment water systems), IN-DAT976 (max 9.9% AR in whole natural sediment water systems) and IN-D1R847 (max 18.2% AR in soil) needed environmental exposure assessments. In a sterilised natural water (indirect) aqueous photolysis study IN-T58318 was formed at up to 13.7% AR. An environmental exposure assessment was also completed for this metabolite. These observed formation fractions were used as the basis for calculating the available environmental exposure assessments. Bensulfuron-methyl was characterised as exhibiting moderate to high persistence, IN-F7880 low to medium persistence, bensulfuron low to moderate persistence, IN-J0290 low to moderate persistence, IN-N5297 low to medium persistence, IN-T5831 no data available but considered to have moderate persistence on the basis of structural similarity to IN-J0290, IN-DAT97 moderate persistence and IN-D1R84 low to moderate persistence.
   Mineralisation of both the phenyl and pyrimidine rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 12-39% AR after 95-119 days and 2-25% AR after 95-119 days respectively in the available aerobic studies. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 11-37 % AR (same radiolabels, results amalgamated) after 95-119 days in these studies. A data gap was identified for experimental data on the route and rate of degradation of bensulfuron-methyl under aerobic flooded soil conditions (that needs to include alkali soil conditions).
   Bensulfuron-methyl was characterised as exhibiting medium to low mobility, IN-F7880 high to medium mobility, bensulfuron very high to low mobility, IN-J0290 high to low mobility, IN-N5297 very high to high mobility, and IN-D1R84 very high mobility. For IN-T5831 and IN-DAT97 no experimental data were available and a data gap was identified. The environmental exposure assessment was completed assuming that these two compounds (IN-T5831 and IN-DAT97) exhibited very high mobility. Using this assumption the assessment indicated that mitigation to reduce the potential for the exposure of groundwater may be necessary for these two metabolites for one of the applied for intended uses in situations represented by the MED-Rice sand groundwater scenario.
   The information available was insufficient to enable a satisfactory environmental exposure assessment to be completed in line with agreed MED-Rice (2003) guidance(9), due to the data gaps identified above. A triggered higher tier exposure assessment for bensulfuron-methyl regarding natural surface water and sediment for situations represented by the MED-Rice sand soil scenario and for all scenarios where application is made before sowing the rice crop is missing. Whilst a higher tier exposure assessment regarding natural surface water and sediment for situations represented by the MED-Rice clay soil scenario for bensulfuron-methyl and post planting applications is available, the Member State experts did not accept the soil DT50 used as input (field dissipation value) to the RICEWQ module of the simulations or the way the exposure concentrations (90th percentile 14 day TWA values) provided by the applicant had been calculated. The experts agreed that there was a data gap for 90th percentile 14 day TWA values to be represented in a way that has some meaning for an edge of field risk assessment. The approach used by the applicant in the available assessment mixed temporal and spatial factors in an inappropriate way, such that the resulting aquatic risk assessment does not demonstrate in which (if any) situations the active substance might be used without impacting on populations of aquatic species, which is what Member State experts agreed would be required to demonstrate compliance with annex VI criteria.
   It can be concluded that the potential for bensulfuron-methyl to contaminate vulnerable groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L from the applied for intended uses is low. For the known metabolites, based on the available data, there are indications that this is also the case when applications are made to paddies with a 10cm layer of water overlying the soil and for shallower paddy water depths in situations represented by the MED-Rice clay scenario. However in situations represented by the MED-Rice sand scenario where applications are made to paddies with <10cm overlying water it cannot be excluded with the available data that IN-5297, IN-T5831 and IN-DAT97 may be present in vulnerable groundwater at > 0. 1 mu g/L (calculations indicate concentrations up to 0.23 mu g/L). Therefore a non relevance assessment for these three metabolites was triggered, but these are not available. In the absence of data to assess the non relevance of these metabolites, the available groundwater exposure assessments indicate that risk management options may be effective at mitigating the potential for groundwater exposure by these metabolites in regions represented by the MED-Rice sand scenario. However the groundwater assessment for metabolites cannot be finalised until the data gap for experimental data on the route and rate of degradation of bensulfuron-methyl under aerobic flooded soil conditions (that needs to include alkali soil conditions) has been filled.
   Bensulfuron-methyl is used as a herbicide and it is very toxic to aquatic and terrestrial plants. A low risk to the aquatic environment (algae and macrophytes) was not demonstrated using the submitted data and further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment is needed. The risk to non-target terrestrial plants in the off-field area needs to be mitigated. Risk mitigation comparable to an in-field no-spray buffer zone of 5 m is required to protect non-target terrestrial plants.
   The risk to birds, mammals, fish and aquatic invertebrates, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro- and micro-organisms, and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.

AB  - Methyl parathion (MP), an organophosphate widely applied in agriculture and aquaculture, induces oxidative stress due to free radical generation and changes in the antioxidant defense system. The antioxidant roles of selenium (Se) were evaluated in Brycon cephalus exposed to 2 mg L-1 of Folisuper 600 BR (R) (MP commercial formulation - MPc, 600 g L-1) for 96 h. Catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels in the gills, white muscle and liver were evaluated in fish fed on diets containing 0 or 1.5 mg Se kg(-1) for 8 weeks. in fish treated with a Se-free diet, the MPc exposure increased SOD and CAT activities in all tissues. However, the GPx activity decreased in white muscle and gills whereas no alterations were observed in the liver. MPc also increased CST activity in all tissues with a concurrent decrease in GSH levels. LPO values increased in white muscle and gills and did not change in liver after MPc exposure. A Se-supplemented diet reversed these findings, preventing increases in LPO levels and concurrent decreases in GPx activity in gills and white muscle. Similarly, GSH levels were maintained in all tissue after MPc exposure. These results suggest that dietary Se supplementation protects cells against MPc-induced oxidative stress.

AB  - Aclonifen is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on aclonifen in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 11 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 24 November 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March-April 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June-July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a pre emergence herbicide as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Bandar", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC).
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of aclonifen.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The exception to this is the relevant impurity phenol where there is no method to monitor it in the formulation. It was concluded during the peer review process that the specification is not supported and a data gap has been identified. In addition it was considered by the meeting of experts mammalian toxicology that phenol is a relevant impurity. The meeting of experts discussed that as the technical material is a wet cake a TK specification should be required but no conclusion was reached on this in the meeting.
   Mammalian toxicology of aclonifen was assessed in a series of investigations. Aclonifen is absorbed rapidly to an extent of about 80% and is distributed widely in the body. It has no potential for accumulation. It is excreted rapidly and almost completely and it is extensively metabolised. Aclonifen is of very low acute toxicity. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant but has skin sensitising properties. A classification as Xi; R43 "Irritant; May cause sensitisation by skin contact" is proposed. Short term studies were carried out with dogs, mice and rats and the lowest NOAEL of 3.6 mg/kg bw/d was obtained in rats (effects on body weight, liver and kidney). Aclonifen is not genotoxic. Two chronic rat studies and a carcinogenicity study with mice have been carried out. While the thyroid tumours seen in rats and the bladder tumours observed in mice were considered not relevant for human risk assessment the brain tumours seen in the rat could not be dismissed and a classification as Xn; Carc. Cat. 3 R40 "Harmful; Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect" was proposed. Aclonifen did not exert specific effects on reproduction and was neither teratogenic in rats nor in rabbits. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) were set at 0.07 mg/kg bw/d. An acute reference dose (ARfD) was not allocated. Operator exposure amounted to 16.1% of the AOEL when wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in the German model. When no PPE is worn in the German model and in all scenarios in the UK POEM exposures exceeded the AOEL. Exposure of bystanders and unprotected re-entry workers was estimated to amount to 4.6% and 2.9% of the AOEL respectively.
   The metabolism of aclonifen was investigated in wheat, peas and potatoes. However in the meeting of experts PRAPeR 45 no conclusion could be reached on the cereal and potato metabolism studies because there were no GAPs for these crops in the representative uses evaluated. So only the pea study was considered further. The pea study is representative of the relevant metabolism group for sunflowers which is the supported crop. This study showed that there are no significant residues in peas or in podded peas the major residue in the vinings was aclonifen. The residue definition for pulses and oilseeds was set as aclonifen only. The rotational crop metabolism study showed that in the majority of crops no significant residues would occur. However, for root and tuber crops it showed that residues could be expected. A data gap was set for a rotational crop residue study. The need for animal studies was not triggered. A goat metabolism study was evaluated in the DAR but the peer review did not conclude on its acceptability. A full set a residue data were available for the north and south of Europe all residues were <0.02 mg/kg at harvest. The consumer risk assessment could not be concluded because of the data gap identified for rotational crops. A risk assessment based on intakes of sunflower showed that the TMDI did not exceed 1 % of the ADI, no acute risk assessment was necessary.
   The route of degradation in soil under dark aerobic conditions was investigated in two studies in a total of five soils. Albeit the drawbacks identified in these studies, the meeting of experts agreed that the data submitted was enough to satisfy the regulatory requirements. Practically the totality of the extracted radioactivity consisted on parent compound with only very minor metabolites detected. Mineralization was negligible or very low (CO2: 0.7 5.2 % AR). Unextracted soil residue increase continuously up to 40.9 63.7 % AR at the end of the experiments. According the photolysis in soil study, photolysis may contribute slightly to the degradation of aclonifen in soil. No metabolite exceeded 5 % AR. Degradation of aclonifen in soil under anaerobic conditions was investigated in one of the studies presented in the dossier but it was not considered reliable. A data gap, which was considered not essential to finalize the risk assessment of the EU representative uses, was identified by the meeting of experts.
   Aclonifen may be considered moderate to high persistent in soil under aerobic conditions at 20 C (DT50 = 32.2 134 d).
   Kinetics of all aerobic degradation data was re-evaluated with non linear regression to first order kinetic and values obtained were normalized to 20 degrees C and pF2. Since the report was not available in the updated dossier, the meeting identified a formal data gap for the applicant to incorporate this report (Hardy, I. and Patel, M. 2008) into it. The meeting of experts agreed the end points proposed by the RMS in table 66 of addendum 1.
   Two field dissipation studies are available in Northern Europe (1 study in Germany, 4 sites) and Southern Europe (1 study in Spain and France, 1 site each). First order half lives between 57 d 195 d were observed in these trials. The two soil accumulation trials performed in Germany were considered not adequate to address the potential accumulation of aclonifen in soil. Accumulated, PEC soil were calculated by the RMS and presented in addendum 1 based on the worst case field half life, annual application of 2400 g/ha and no interception. Plateau steady state was calculated after 10 yr over a mixing layer of 20 cm. Actual and TWA PECs were calculated adding the result of the annual application on a 5 cm mixing layer over the plateau. The calculation was agreed by the experts in the meeting.
   Aclonifen may be considered practically immobile in soil (K-proportional to = 5318 10612). Aclonifen is stable to hydrolysis at pH 5, 7 and 9. The aqueous photolysis study and the subsequent RMS model calculation show that photolysis may contribute in a limited extend to the degradation of aclonifen in the aquatic environment. Aclonifen is not readily biodegradable.
   Degradation of aclonifen was investigated in one study with two water sediment systems (pH(water) = 6.7 7.5; pH(sed) = 6.8 8.4, OC 3.8 5.7 %, clay 10.54 28.99 %) incubated under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. In both water / sediment systems aclonifen steadily partitioned to the sediment and degraded. None of the metabolites observed reached 5 % AR in any of the phases. Mineralization was negligible in both systems (max CO2 = 2.07 % AR) and unextractable residue in the sediment amounted up to 65.6-76.5 % AR at the end of the experiments (180 d). Separated half lives for the water and sediment phases were considered unreliable and not representing true degradation by the experts. The meeting agreed that total system half lives could be used for the risk assessment (DT5o = 17.3 d). New FOCUS PECsw/SED up to STEP 4 (including effect of spray drift and run off mitigation by buffer and vegetative strips) using the agreed input parameters were available in addendum 1. The calculations were agreed for the STEP 3 and the STEP 4 when only spray drift mitigation was assumed. Therefore, only PECsw/SED presented in Table 17 of addendum 1 may be considered peer reviewed for the EU risk assessment.
   Aclonifen is not considered to pose a risk for contamination of ground water above the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L when used according the GAPs for the representative use evaluated. Concentrations in air and transport through air are considered negligible for aclonifen.
   The acute and short-term first-tier TERs for insectivorous birds and the acute TER for insectivorous mammals exceeded the trigger of 10 but the long-term risk needed further refinement. The refinement of PT was rejected in the experts' meeting since it was not sufficiently supported with data. A data gap was identified to submit a new refined long-term risk assessment for birds and mammals. The long-term endpoint (35 mg a.s./kg bw/d) used in the original risk assessment for mammals in the DAR was discussed in the meeting. Statistically significant effects on body weight were observed at the dose of 35 mg a.s./kg bw/d. The effects were <10% but a reduced fitness and thus adverse effects on populations of wild mammals under realistic environmental conditions cannot be excluded. The experts agreed that the NOEC of 8 mg a.s./kg bw/d should be used in the risk assessment. The risk of secondary poisoning of earthworm- and fish-eating birds and fish-eating mammals was assessed as low. The risk to earthworm-eating mammals needs further refinement. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was considered to be low since the product is applied to bare soil. The lowest endpoints were observed in studies with fish, algae and higher aquatic plants. The experts accepted the use of 4-day time weighted average PECsw values to refine the risk to higher aquatic plants. The use of time weighted average values was also accepted for growth effects on fish but concerns were raised with regard to the long time interval of 28 days. It was suggested that the time window may be revised at MS level when guidance will be available from the e-link workshop. Effects on hatch success of fish were also observed in the early life stage test. Effects on hatch success can be caused by short exposure peaks. The experts agreed that the NOEC hatch success should be compared to initial PECsw values which lead to TERs significantly below the trigger of 10. However the TERs for algae are lower and the risk to fish would be covered by the risk mitigation required for algae. Even if a no-spray buffer zone of 40 m in combination with run-off mitigation by 80/95% is applied then the TERs are above the trigger in only one full FOCUS step 4 scenario (D5) and in the part scenario R1 (pond). It is noted that the suggested reduction of spray-drift entry exceeds the recommendation of the FOCUS Landscape report and uncertainty remains also with regard to the PECsw following the proposed run-off mitigation. The full scenarios R3, R4 and the part scenario R1(stream) still result in TERs below the trigger of 10. Overall it is concluded that the representative use of aclonifen poses a high risk to aquatic organisms. Brassica napus was the most sensitive non-target plant species tested. It reacted very sensitive under high temperature and high soil moisture growth conditions. Even an in-field no-spray buffer zone of 50 m would not be sufficient to achieve a TER of >5 for the ER50 of 1.12 g a.s./ha for Brassica napus. Under field exposure conditions the observed endpoints were significantly higher. However the experts identified uncertainties with regard to the influence of the weather conditions on the dissipation of aclonifen, the application pattern and actual exposure in the field studies. A data gap was identified in the experts' meeting for the applicant to provide a refined risk assessment for non target plants.
   The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro- and microorganisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative use of aclonifen.

AB  - Dodemorph is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on dodemorph in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 9 February 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 May 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May June 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a fungicide on roses under permanent protection. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Mehltaumittel", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). In the formulation the active substance is present as the acetate variant.
   Methods of analysis for products of plant and animal origin are not required for the representative use on roses. Adequate methods are available to monitor the sum of cis and trans dodemorph in soil and air. Methods of analysis for water have been identified as a data gap.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some of the quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Several data gaps have been identified. Namely new 5 batch data, water solubility, vapour pressure, Henry's law constant and surface tension.
   Mammalian toxicology was assessed in a series of tests. Dodemorph is absorbed rapidly to an extent of at least 40%. It is distributed widely and uniformly. It has no potential for accumulation. It is excreted rapidly and practically completely and is extensively metabolised. It is of low acute toxicity by the oral and dermal route. Based on its irritant, corrosive and sensitising properties a classification as Xi; R37 "Irritant to the respiratory system", C; R34 "Corrosive; Causes burns" (Xi; R41 "Irritant; Risk of serious damage to eyes" is implicit) and Xi; R43 "Irritant; May cause skin sensitisation" was proposed. Short term studies were carried out with rats, dogs and rabbits. The liver was the main target of toxicity. The lowest NOAEL of 8.2 mg/kg bw/d was based on vomiting, salivation, changes in faecal excretion and liver effects seen in dogs. Dodemorph is not genotoxic. A 2-year rat and an 18-month mouse study have been reported. Critical effects observed were decreased bodyweight gain (both species) and liver effects (rat) while no increased tumour incidences could be observed in these investigations. Dodemorph did not cause effects on reproduction but induced developmental effects in rabbits (open eye, irregularly shapen sternebrae) based on which a classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R63 "Harmful; Possible risk of harm to the unborn child" was proposed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was set at 0.082 mg/kg bw/d, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) and the acute reference dose (ARfD) were set at 0.033 mg/kg bw/d and at 0.33 mg/kg bw respectively. Operator exposure amounts to 88% of the AOEL when personal protective equipment (PPE) in the form of gloves, coverall and gas mask is worn. Worker exposure when PPE (gloves, coverall and gas mask) is used amounts to 45% of the systemic AOEL of 0.033 mg/kg bw/d. Bystander exposure is not anticipated based on the use of dodemorph in greenhouses.
   No data were submitted to study and assess the residue behaviour of dodemorph in plants and livestock animals in order to define the relevant residues for dietary consumer risk assessment. The representative use of dodemorph on roses is normally not expected to result in any dietary exposure to humans or livestock animals. A situation where treated rose petals are used for human consumption was neither assessed nor considered. Under conditions excluding any potential consumer exposure to dodemorph residues, there will be no dietary consumer risk related to the notified representative use.
   In soil under aerobic conditions dodemorph acetate exhibits moderate to high persistence forming no major metabolite (> 10% applied radioactivity (AR)), but forming an unknown minor non-transient metabolite. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 17.1-35.9% AR after 93-125 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink accounting for 21.9% to 43.4% of the applied radioactivity after 93-125 days. Dodemorph is immobile in soil and there was no indication that adsorption was pH dependant.
   In dark natural sediment water systems dodemorph degraded exhibiting fast disappearance from the water column, but high persistence in sediment. No major metabolites were found. The terminal metabolite, carbon dioxide, accounted for 15.4-23.2% AR by 103 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a significant sink representing 27-28% AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were carried out assuming 0.1% emission from glasshouse (Dutch approach). These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by dodemorph above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However no calculation for the unknown minor non-transient metabolite was available.
   Although it is expected that dodemorph does not reach the surrounding environment in significant amounts, emission to surface water is considered possible. A risk assessment for birds and mammals was provided for exposure from contaminated drinking water and for consumption of contaminated fish. A PECsw value was based on the Dutch model. A long-term reproductive endpoint for birds was estimated by using the lower endpoint from reproductive effect studies on birds for related substances (Structure Activity Relationship). The risk assessment indicated a low risk to birds and mammals exposed to dodemorph through drinking water and fish. In the aquatic environment dodemorph was most toxic to fish and daphnia. It was considered to be toxic to aquatic organisms on an acute scale and very toxic on a chronic scale. Dodemorph is lipophilic (logPow = 4.6) and the bioaccumulation factor was estimated in the range of 583-746 based on whole fish. Given a TER >> 10 based on the fish early life stage endpoint the risk from bioaccumulation was considered to be low. Whereas the risk to bees was considered to be low, assessment of non-target arthropods (NTA) indicated a risk. This is of particular importance as various non-target arthropods may be used in integrated pest management in greenhouses. The risk to earthworms was considered to be low as was the risk to non target soil micro-organisms and micro-organisms in sewage treatment plant. No data were submitted nor required for non-target macro soil organisms. Risk to non-target plants was considered to be negligible for glass house use and no data were submitted by the applicant.

AB  - Copper (I), copper (II) variants (formerly referred to as copper compounds) are one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on copper (I), copper (II) variants in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 7 June 2007. The peer review was initiated on 17 September 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant the European Union Copper Task Force. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May June 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide/bactericide on grapes and tomatoes. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints.
   The representative formulated products for the evaluation were "Kocide 101" (copper hydroxide), a wettable powder formulation containing 500 g/kg of Cu; "Mace 80" (Bordeaux mixture), a wettable powder formulation containing 200 g/kg of Cu; "Cuprocaffaro WP" (copper oxychloride), a wettable powder formulation containing 500 g/kg of Cu; "Cuproxat SC" (tribasic copper sulfate), a suspension concentrate formulation containing 193 g/L of Cu and "Nordox 75 WG " (copper (I) oxide), a wettable granule formulation containing 750 g/kg Cu.
   Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The methods of analysis for the technical materials and the formulations are not accepted at this time as the identity of the various variants of copper are in question. The specifications and batch data are not accepted. In addition to this, there are some missing physical and chemical properties as well as storage stability data for the variants of copper.
   In the mammalian metabolism studies, bioequivalence was established for the five representative copper (I) and (II) variants with copper sulphate pentahydrate, with which most of the toxicological studies were conducted. As a micronutrient essential for life, copper follows a specific homeostatic regulation mechanism, which allows excess copper to be excreted mainly through the bile; once absorbed, copper is bound to proteins so that free copper is normally not found neither in the blood, nor in the cells.
   Copper hydroxide is toxic by inhalation, harmful if swallowed and present a risk of serious damage to eyes. Bordeaux mixture is harmful by inhalation and presents a risk of serious damage to eyes. Copper oxychloride and copper (I) oxide are harmful by inhalation and if swallowed. Tribasic copper sulphate is harmful if swallowed. Target organs of excess copper after oral administration are the liver and the kidneys. A concern was raised over inhalation of copper as lung lesions found in operator exposure were reproducible in guinea pigs; a data gap was identified for a short term inhalation toxicity study. Genotoxicity was not of concern upon oral administration, however, there was insufficient evidence to exclude a genotoxic potential of copper after non-oral exposure, and a critical area of concern was raised after inhalation of copper (I) and (II) variants. No carcinogenic potential was attributed to copper, neither in rats nor in humans. Copper did not produce adverse effect on fertility, reproductive parameters or on the development; no neurotoxicity was attributed to copper ingestion, either. Four categories of copper poisoning were identified in the literature, namely direct oral ingestion as suicide attempts, cases where food or drinking water had become contaminated with copper, cases where home-made Bordeaux mixture had resulted in lung disease, and a single case of long term administration of excess copper as a dietary supplement resulting in liver failure.
   Based on the WHO values established for human copper intake, the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) or more appropriately designated as "upper limit for copper intake" - for copper (I) and (II) variants was 0.15 mg Cu/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.072 mg Cu/kg bw/day and no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Default value of 10 % for dermal absorption was set for the five concentrate representative formulations and the in-use spray dilutions. Operator exposure calculated for field applications was below the AOEL only, if personal protective equipment (PPE) was used; for greenhouse applications, estimated operator exposure was below the AOEL only, if a respiratory protective equipment (RPE) was added to the PPE. Unprotected bystander exposure was calculated to be below the AOEL for all proposed uses and all representative formulations. Estimates of worker exposure indicated that exposure to copper (I) and (II) variants may exceed the AOEL for workers wearing protective gloves, long sleeved shirt and long trousers in some scenarios of application. Therefore, a refinement of worker risk assessment is required for those specific scenarios.
   Data presented and evaluated on the uptake, translocation and nature of copper residues in plants consist mainly of a review of public scientific literature. To determine the magnitude of residues in the treated raw agricultural commodities, residue trials in grapes and tomatoes were submitted. Also data on the residue levels in processed tomato and grape products were made available, but only found valid and acceptable for grapes. The data allow for MRL proposals and for a consumer exposure assessment with regard to the notified representative uses. As exposure to copper is not only due to residues from the use as a plant protection product, an aggregate exposure assessment was performed by the rapporteur Member State, including in addition background levels of copper in food and drinking water, based on a recent French dietary survey. This aggregate estimate shows that, in particular for children, the overall dietary copper exposure is not negligible and approximates the established toxicological reference value. Additional potential sources of dietary copper intakes have not been considered. Moreover, the estimate is not representative for all European consumers and therefore situations may arise where the overall copper intake of some consumer groups exceeds the toxicological reference value.
   The data presented in the dossier and summarized in the DAR on the fate and behaviour of copper in soil consist mainly of a review of public scientific literature. Although the information is qualitatively complete, it does not allow deriving quantitative parameters to perform a proper environmental risk assessment. Data gaps have been identified by the rapporteur Member State for accumulated PEC soil, PECSW/SED and PECGW values as well as for the experimental (laboratory, field or monitoring) data to asses them. The data gaps have been confirmed by the peer review.
   The representative uses of the various copper variants are applications to vines and tomatoes (outdoor and indoor). The risk to herbivorous birds from the use in tomatoes was considered low since the tomato foliage is not palatable to birds.
   The first-tier acute, short-term and long-term TERs for insectivorous birds were below the Annex VI trigger values for all representative uses. The refined risk assessment suggests a low acute and short-term risk to birds, but further refinement is needed for the long-term risk assessment. The first-tier long-term TERs for earthworm-eating birds and mammals were below the Annex VI trigger of 5. No further information was provided to refine the risk assessment and a data gap was identified in the meeting of experts. The first-tier risk assessment for mammals indicated a potential high acute and long-term risk. The refined risk assessment submitted by the applicant was not transparent. It was not clear which refinements were taken into account and no information/data were provided to support the refined acute and long-term risk assessment. Therefore, a data gap was identified for a refined risk assessment for mammals where all refinement steps are transparent and supported by information/data. The risk to birds and mammals from the use in tomatoes in glasshouse is considered to be low because of negligible exposure.
   Copper is very toxic to the aquatic organisms. An indoor-microcosm study was submitted to address the risk to aquatic invertebrates. The experts suggested using a NOEC of 3.12 lag Cu (dissolved)/L together with a safety factor of 3-5 to take into account uncertainties related to effects on chironomids and possible favourable exposure conditions in the microcosm (high pH). Information from public literature suggests a high potential of bioaccumulation of copper in some aquatic organisms. The potential risk of bioaccumulation in fish needs to be addressed further. A data gap was identified in the meeting to address the risk from bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms.
   The risk assessment for aquatic organisms needs to be finalized once reliable PECsw/sed values are established for the outdoor uses of copper in tomato and vines. The risk to aquatic organisms from the use in tomato in glasshouse is considered to be low.
   The risk to bees from contact exposure was assessed as low, except for copper oxychloride and the Bordeaux mixture. The risk to bees from oral exposure was assessed as high in the first-tier risk assessment, and the experts suggested a data gap to address the risk to bees further.
   A high long-term risk to earthworms was indicated on the basis of the available information. A data gap was identified to address the long-term risk to earthworms.
   Information from published studies with soil macro-organisms was submitted by the applicant. The studies were considered as reliable and robust enough to be considered in the risk assessment. No effects of >25% on soil nitrification were observed up to the highest tested application rate of 20 kg Cu/ha. A reduction of 29 % in carbon mineralization was observed on day 28, at an application rate of 12.5 kg Cu/ha in a study with copper hydroxide. However, a final conclusion on the risk to soil macro- and micro-organisms can only be drawn after reliable PECsoil values have been established.
   The assessment of the risk to non-target plants is based on information from public literature. It was not possible for the experts to draw a conclusion on the reliability of the studies. The experts agreed that a more comprehensive summary of the literature information is needed. Furthermore, the accumulation of copper in the off-field area should be considered in the risk assessment.
   The risk to non-target arthropods and to biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.

AB  - The effects of diflubenzuron (DFB), an insecticide to control ectoparasites in fish farms, on muscle acetylcholinesterase (AChE), detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes, hematological and physiological parameters, and liver histopathology were evaluated in Prochilodus lineatus after 6, 24 and 96 h of exposure to 25 mg L-1 of DFB. The insecticide caused a reduction in the number of erythrocytes and hemoglobin content after 96 h exposure, probably due to hemolysis. Hyperglycemic response indicated energy mobilization, and may have contributed to the increase in osmolarity after 96 h exposure to DFB. The induction of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase activities in liver pointed to the activation of xenobiotic metabolic pathways and antioxidant defenses. The decrease in muscle AChE at all experimental times showed that DFB is an AChE inhibitor. In addition, DFB induced hepatic alterations that might impair normal liver functions. These results show that DFB can cause health disorders in fish and further studies are required to better define its safe use in aquaculture. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fluazinam is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Austria being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fluazinam in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 3 January 2006. The peer review was initiated on 23 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant ISK Biosciences Europe. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in May 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in July and October 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises foliar spraying to potatoes against late blight and tuber blight (Phytophtora infestans). Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Fluazinam 5005C", a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 500 g/L fluazinam.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant origin, for environmental matrices and for body fluids and tissues.
   Concerning the mammalian toxicology, the toxicokinetic studies have shown that oral absorption of fluazinam was 35% of the administered dose. In the acute studies, fluazinam was harmful by inhalation (Xn, R20), severely irritating to the eyes (Xi, R41) and skin sensitizer (R43).
   The liver was the target organ in repeat dose studies with rats, mice and dogs. Some haematological changes were also observed in dogs, and the increased vacuolation of white matter in brain and spinal cord observed at high doses was demonstrated to be directly related to one impurity. Therefore it was agreed that the level of this impurity in the technical specification should not exceed the amount present in the toxicological batches, i.e. 0.2%. Based on the effects observed in the skin in the repeat dose study by dermal administration, the classification Xi, R38 Irritating to the skin was proposed for fluazinam. In the genotoxicity studies, no mutagenic potential was observed in vitro or in vivo. There was no carcinogenic potential in long term studies. In the reproduction studies, the fertility parameters and the offspring were not affected, but the indications of teratogenicity in the rat studies led to the proposal of classification Reprotox. Cat. 3, R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child. No adverse effect on the nervous system was observed in specific neurotoxicity studies with rats.
   The relative toxicity of the plant metabolite trifuoro-acetic acid (TFAA) in comparison with fluazinam could not be established based on the available data.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, the acute reference dose (ARfD) 0.07 mg/kg bw and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) 0.004 mg/kg bw/day, all derived with the use of a safety factor 100. The dermal absorption values were 1.5% for the concentrate and 7% for the dilution. The operator exposure estimate is below the AOEL according to the German model when personal protective equipment is used, and the worker exposure estimates (during crop inspection or harvesting) are below the AOEL with the use of personal protective equipment.
   Based on appropriate metabolism studies, the metabolism of fluazinam in potatoes is clearly elucidated. Parent compound, AMPA-FLUAZINAM and AMGT are present at harvest in potato tubers at low but comparable amounts and are included in the residue definition for risk assessment. A further degradation product was identified as TFAA. This metabolite is present at very low levels in potato tubers but also in rotational crops. As information on its toxicological properties is lacking, the proposed residue definition is provisional.
   For enforcement, the residue definition can be restricted to parent compound. Supervised residue trials show that the MRL for potatoes can be set at the LOQ (limit of quantification level).
   Livestock exposure to fluazinam residues is very low and the setting of a residue definition and MRLs in animal products is not necessary.
   Under restriction of the information to be provided on the toxicological relevance of TFAA and if appropriate on the actual consumer exposure to this metabolite, no dietary risk is expected resulting from the representative use of fluazinam in potatoes.
   It must be noted that the issue related to TFAA is a generic issue and potentially concerns a range of active substances containing a trifluoromethyl moiety.
   Under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C, fluazinam is medium to high persistent in soil. Substitution of phenyl ring chlorine by hydroxyl in fluazinam yields the major soil metabolite HYPA that was shown to be moderate to high persistent under these conditions. Other minor metabolites identified resulted from the reduction of the phenyl nitro groups to form the corresponding anilines. In the experiment performed in the most recent study (1 soil) up to 14 minor metabolites were found and none of them individually exceeded 4.7 % AR. Metabolites resulting from the cleavage of the bridging amino group have not been identified in any of the available studies. After 90 d non extractable residues reached levels of 16.7 50.5 % AR and mineralization was almost negligible.
   Fluazinam was low to moderate persistent under dark anaerobic conditions due to the relatively rapid reduction of the nitro groups to form the MAPA, AMPA-FLUAZINAM and DAPA metabolites.
   Higher amounts of non extractable residues were formed under these conditions.
   Photolysis was shown to contribute to the degradation of fluazinam in soil. HYPA and AMPA-FLUAZINAM are found as minor photolysis metabolites.
   There are field dissipation studies available in UK (two sites), Germany (four sites) and USA (four sites). USA field trials were considered not relevant for EU conditions and were not used in the risk assessment. The potential effect of photolysis on the degradation of fluazinam in these field trials was discussed in the experts' meeting. The meeting agreed that the kinetic parameters derived from the field trials were not appropriate for use in environmental modelling and that new FOCUS PECsw and FOCUS PECGw will need to be calculated on basis of laboratory data. Furthermore, since the studies were performed on bare soil they were not considered representative of the uses proposed. Therefore new PEC soil calculation using the longest laboratory half life and application every two years for potato was regarded as necessary by the meeting. After the experts meeting, new PEC soil have been presented by the rapporteur Member State in an updated addendum to B.8 following the parameters agreed by the meeting.
   According batch soil adsorption / desorption studies available fluazinam may be considered slight to low mobile and HYPA low to medium mobile. Fluazinam may be considered stable at pH 4 and it is rapidly hydrolysed at pH 7 and pH 9. The major hydrolysis metabolite at pH 7 and 9 was CAPA that is stable to hydrolysis under normal environmental conditions.
   Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental dissipation of fluazinam Fluazinam is not readily biodegradable according the available study.
   In water sediment systems fluazinam partitioned with the sediment and was converted to a number of metabolites through substitution of chlorine atom and reduction of nitro groups. Among these metabolites only AMPA-FLUAZINAM reached levels above 10 % in the sediment phase. Non extractable residues amounted up to 55 % AR after 100 d and mineralization was practically negligible. There are no indications that the amino bridge between the two rings is broken during the degradation. Dissipation rate of metabolite AMPA-FLUAZINAM was calculated with data of one of the systems. The rapporteur Member State provided in an addendum the whole system kinetic parameters for HYPA based on a multicompartmental fitting of the data of both systems. The rapporteur Member State identified shortcomings in the water/sediment study that do not invalidate it in its integrity but need to be considered when using the results for risk assessment.
   PECsw for fluazinam and for the major sediment metabolite AMPA-FLUAZINAM were presented in the DAR for the representative use in potatoes. The input parameters used in the applicant's calculation for fluazinam were not agreed by the meeting. After the meeting, the rapporteur Member State presented new FOCUS PECsw and PECSED for Fluazinam and HYPA using the input parameters agreed by the meeting of experts in the updated addendum to B.8.
   Potential ground water contamination by fluazinam and the major soil metabolite HYPA for the representative use in potatoes may be considered negligible with the available modelling.
   Fluazinam may be relatively persistent in air but a high degree of uncertainty is associated to the estimation of its atmospheric half life. However, it is not volatile enough to perform an experimental measurement of its atmospheric photochemical stability.
   The risk assessment followed the Guidance Document on Risk Assessment for Birds and Mammals (SANCO/4145/2000). It is not considered necessary to calculate the risk to herbivorous birds and mammals in potatoes as potato leaves are considered unpalatable. Therefore the risk to herbivorous birds and mammals is considered to be low. Based on the first tier risk assessment the risk to insectivorous birds and mammals can be regarded as low for the representative use of fluazinam evaluated. As the Log Pow of fluazinam exceeds 3, the risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning was assessed. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals can be considered as low. Also the risk to earthworm eating birds can be considered as low, whereas as further refinement is still required to identify low risk for earthworm eating mammals No risk is expected for birds or mammals from the ingestion of contaminated drinking water.
   Fish was the most sensitive aquatic organisms on an acute and chronic time scale in the standard dataset. All scenarios were acceptable at FOCUSsw step 4, including a buffer zone of 10 m. The risk to aquatic invertebrates and algae is considered low at FOCUS Step 3 and Step 2 respectively. The risk to HYPA and G-504 is inconclusive due to lack of toxicity data. The risk to sediment dwelling organisms is concluded to be low, but risk assessment based on sediment concentrations is missing. The risk for bees and NTA is considered low from the representative use of fluazinam. As for the earthworms the acute risk assessment indicated indicating a low acute risk to earthworms. Whereas the reproductive study on earthworms did not meet the Annex VI trigger, a field study with earthworms addressed the long term risk to earthworms. Given the DT90field in soil for fluazinam and the observed effects on earthworms and A. rhopalosiphi, a study on the effects on collembolan was submitted. The toxicity to collembolan triggered a litterbag study. At litterbag study was submitted bud not accepted as the exposure was to low. A data gap was identified for a new litterbag study, in which the new PECplateau is covered. In this study the presence of and effects on macro organisms should be checked.
   The risk to soil non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants is considerer to be low for both fluazinam and HYPA.

AB  - Benfluralin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review program covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on benfluralin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 16 February 2006. The peer review was initiated on 1 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroScience. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in May - June 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on lettuce and chicory (salad and root production) full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Bonalan", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).
   Adequate methods are available to monitor benfluralin in plants, soil water and air. However for water and plants the residue definition has not been concluded on and further data may be required. For products of animal origin it is currently not clear if a residue definition is required and therefore further methods may be required in the future. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are still some outstanding issues related to a relevant impurity, R65 classification, emulsion stability, efficiency of the tank cleaning procedure and testing at different pH for various parameters.
   In mammalian metabolism studies, benfluralin showed a rapid but incomplete oral absorption, rapid excretion, mainly via faeces, and no potential for accumulation.
   Benfluralin has a low acute toxicity, but showed irritating and sensitizing properties, which require classification with R36/38 irritating to eyes and skin and R43 may cause sensitisation by skin contact. Main target organs in short term and long term studies were the liver and kidneys. Classification with R40 limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect is proposed, based on neoplastic changes observed in the liver of rats and mice and thyroid tumours in rats upon long term exposure. Benfluralin showed no potential for genotoxicity or neurotoxicity. No effects on fertility or on reproductive parameters were observed as well as any adverse effects on development or teratogenicity.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set at 0.005 mg/kg bw/day considering an assessment factor of 100; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.05 mg/kg bw/day set using an assessment factor of 100 with a correction of 30 % for oral absorption (overall assessment factor of 333); no acute reference dose (ARfD) is allocated. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL if personal protective equipment (PPE) as gloves is used, at least during the mixing and loading operations. No risk is anticipated for workers or bystanders derived from benfluralin applications.
   The plant metabolism of benfluralin was investigated in lettuce (category leafy crops), alfalfa and peanuts (pulses/ oilseed crop category). The Meeting of experts considered that the detailed information on the undertaken preliminary work on the metabolites characterisation/ identification should be submitted in order to conclude on the validity of these studies. No metabolism study was submitted to support a use in root and tuber crops. The experts in residues have concluded that further data is necessary to finalise the residue definition for primary and rotational crops, the livestock exposure assessment and eventually the consumer risk assessment. At the current stage, a residue definition and MRLs can only provisionally be proposed, but need to be reconsidered upon receipt of the necessary data. Based on the presumption that the only relevant residues for consumer exposure is parent benfluralin in primary crops, the estimated chronic intake would be less than 1% of the ADI of benfluralin for the considered consumer groups. The consumer risk assessment will have to be revised when the outstanding data and information was evaluated.
   Available data demonstrate that under aerobic conditions the degradation of benfluralin in soil did not lead to any major (> 10% of the applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolite, although the minor non transient metabolite B12 was formed in amounts > 5% AR at two consecutive sampling points. Benfluralin is moderate to medium persistent in soil under aerobic conditions with half-lives ranging from 20 to 86 days. No reliable DT50 values for metabolite B12 are available. Field dissipation studies were conducted in northern Europe only and resulted in moderate half-lives of 34 to 73 days for benfluralin.
   Two major metabolites B36 (max. 23.2% AR at day 1) and U6#1 (max. 25.0% AR at day 2) were formed under anaerobic conditions. The peer review concluded that, if applied for intended uses, no further assessment was necessary for these metabolites.
   Soil photolysis is not expected to be a significant route of degradation in the environment.
   Data indicate that benfluralin is strongly adsorbed to soil and could be classified as immobile. No reliable data on adsorption properties of metabolite B12 are available.
   Benfluralin is hydrolytically stable under environmental conditions. Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of benfluralin producing the major metabolites des-alkyl benfluralin diamine (max 11.5% AR), propyl benzimidazole (max. 16.4% AR), methyl benzimidazole (max 11.5% AR), ethyl propyl benzimidazole (max 19.5% AR). Because of the rapid photodegradation of benfluralin in water, a data gap was identified by the fate experts to address the potential surface water contamination of the photolysis metabolites.
   Parent benfluralin is not expected to contaminate ground water at levels above 0.1 mu g/L under the proposed conditions of use. The meeting of Member State experts identified a data gap with respect to metabolite B12 for the necessary information (including experimentally derived Koc values and degradation rates) to produce revised FOCUS groundwater assessment.
   The water/sediment study, the aerobic soil metabolism study and Henry's Law constant indicated the high volatility of benfluralin. However, the calculated photochemical oxidative degradation half-life of benfluralin in air is rapid (<6 hrs) and therefore significant amounts of benfluralin are not expected to be present in air.
   Benfluralin is applied pre-sowing or pre-planting by broadcast spray followed by incorporation in soil to control weeds. Hence no leafy crops or weeds are present in the field after the application. Benfluralin is not systemic and the uptake of plants is limited. A potential high risk was identified for earthworm eating-birds and mammals. The suggested refinements were not accepted in the expert meeting and a data gap was identified for a new refined long-term risk assessment for earthworm eating birds and mammals. The risk to algae and higher aquatic plants was assessed as low. A 20m non-spray buffer zone was included in the PECsw values used in the aquatic risk assessment for the water bodies stream and ditch. The TERs for fish were above the trigger of 100 in all drainage scenarios (D3, D4, D6) and in the run-off scenarios R1 and R4 but were below the trigger in the runoff scenarios R2 and R3. No full FOCUS scenario resulted in TERs above the trigger of 100 for aquatic invertebrates. Only the TERs for the part scenarios D4 (pond) and R1 (pond) exceeded the trigger of 100. The chronic TER values for fish and daphnia were calculated with 50 d twa-PECsw instead of initial PECsw. The experts agreed that time weighted average PECsw values can be used in the TER calculations for endpoints based on growth effects (fish early life stage study) but the rapid dissipation from the water phase has to be considered and the time period should not be longer than 5 times the DT50 (in this case 7days). The chronic endpoint for daphnids is based on reproduction and therefore should be compared to initial PECsw concentrations. A data gap was identified in the expert meeting for the applicant to provide a new chronic aquatic risk assessment taking into account the suggestions of the expert meeting and to refine further the acute risk to invertebrates. No final conclusion can be drawn on the risk to aquatic organisms from the photolysis metabolites at this stage and should be addressed in the new aquatic risk assessment in line with the data gap identified in the section on fate and behaviour. The risk assessment for soil non-target arthropods resulted in a TER of 4.8 based on an initial PEC soil of 1.14 mg benfluralin/kg from the worst case application in lettuce. Since the TER value is close to the trigger of 5 and based on initial PECs it was agreed in the expert meeting that the risk to soil non-target arthropods is sufficiently addressed for most environmental conditions but Member States could ask for further risk refinement if benfluralin is expected to degrade slowly under their local environmental conditions.
   The risk to bees, earthworms, non-target arthropods, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Fenpropimorph is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenpropimorph in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 17 March 2005. The peer review was initiated on 11 July 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed on during a written procedure in July September 2006. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January and March 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises foliar spraying to cereals, sugar beet and sunflower against several agriculturally important phytopathogens. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Corbel", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 750 g/L fenpropimorph.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant and animal origin and for environmental matrices.
   With regard to the rat metabolism during the toxicological studies, fenpropimorph is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, largely distributed, extensively metabolised and without bioaccumulation in the body. In the acute toxicity studies, the compound was shown to be harmful if swallowed (R22) and irritating to the skin (R38). In the short term studies, the liver was the target organ and the body weight was decreased in all species. A battery of tests for mutagenicity did not demonstrate a genotoxic potential in vivo, and long term studies in rats and mice didn't show carcinogenic effects.
   No effects on the reproductive parameters were observed in a multigeneration study in rats, but teratogenic findings in rats and rabbits led to the proposed classification Repro Cat.3 R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child. In specific neurotoxicity studies, adverse effects were only observed in the functional observational battery. Changes in serum acetyl cholinesterase activity were not considered as relevant adverse effects. In mechanistic studies, fenpropimorph was shown to induce hepatic drug metabolising enzymes and to inhibit the cholesterol biosynthesis.
   The agreed ADI (acceptable daily intake) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day, the agreed AOEL (acceptable operator exposure level) 0.007 mg/kg bw/day and the agreed ARID (acute reference dose) 0.03 mg/kg bw. The agreed dermal absorption value was 10%, and the operator exposure assessment is below the AOEL only within the German model with the use of PPE (personal protective equipment).
   The plant metabolism of fenpropimorph has been elucidated and appropriate residue definitions can be proposed for monitoring and risk assessment. All representative uses are not supported by appropriate residue data and further data should be submitted. No residues are expected in rotational crops under practical conditions above analytical limit of quantification. Fenpropimorph residues are not altered under processing conditions.
   A transfer of residues to livestock consuming treated feedstuffs may result in measurable residue levels in animal commodities.
   MRLs are proposed for plant and animal commodities. The resulting consumer exposure has been assessed and found to be below the toxicological reference values. However it should be noted that there is uncertainty related to the isomer ratio the consumer is actually exposed to.
   If MRLs need to be raised as a consequence of the results of the required residue trials, the consumer risk assessment should be reconsidered.
   In soil under aerobic conditions fenpropimorph exhibits low to very high persistence forming the minor non transient soil metabolites fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2)(2) (accounting for up to 9.7% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low persistence and BF-421-7' (accounting for up to 9.8%AR) which also exhibited low persistence in the single soil where peer reviewed information was available. Mineralisation of both the phenyl and morpholine rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 33 and 46 % AR respectively after 91 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 65 and 50 % AR respectively after 91 days. Fenpropimorph is immobile or exhibits slight mobility in soil, fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) exhibits very high to high mobility in soil. A data gap was identified for information on the soil mobility of BF 421-7. There was no indication that adsorption of fenpropimorph was pH dependent. The adsorption of fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) is pH dependent, with adsorption decreasing as soil pH increases. The assessment of soil accumulation potential under conditions represented by one of the German field trial sites has not been finalised.
   In dark natural sediment water systems fenpropimorph partitioned relatively rapidly to sediment, where it exhibited moderate persistence degrading to the metabolite fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) which partitioned back to the water accounting for up to 22% AR in water. The terminal metabolite, carbon dioxide, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 6.3-8.5 % AR (mean of the phenyl and morpholine ring radiolabels) at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 20-37 % AR (mean of both radiolabels) at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for fenpropimorph at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation factors being appropriately applied at step 4. Volatilisation short range transport and redeposition of fenpropimorph to surface water using the results of field and wind tunnel experiments were included in the step 4 calculations, due to the potential for volatilisation of fenpropimorph which has a relatively high vapour pressure compared to many active substances. For the metabolite fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2), appropriate FOCUS step 1 calculations were agreed. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by fenpropimorph and fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However for the soil metabolite BF-421-7, a data gap was identified for a groundwater exposure assessment. It was concluded that fenpropimorph is unlikely to be subject to long range atmospheric transport as a consequence of its likely indirect photooxidation intermediated transformation (half life estimated at 2.9 hours).
   The acute and short-term risk to birds and the acute risk to mammals were assessed as low in a first tier risk assessment for the representative uses in cereals, sugar beet and sunflower. The long term TER values for insectivorous and herbivorous birds and for herbivorous mammals were below the Annex VI trigger value of 5 for all representative uses. The refined risk assessment was discussed in the expert meeting. A new risk assessment was presented in the not peer-reviewed addendum 4. The long-term trigger of 5 was exceeded for the uses in cereals and sugar beet. The risk assessment presented deviated for skylark from the recommendations in the experts meeting. It was assumed that skylark feeds only on large insects (RUD of 5.1 instead of 29 for small insects) based on data from a PhD theses. This refinement step was not peer-reviewed and without this refinement the TER for skylark would be below the trigger of 5. However it is likely that a certain percentage of the insect prey consist of large insects. The long-term endpoint is based on a NOEC where no effects were observed at the highest tested dose. Therefore it may be possible to agree in a weight of evidence approach that the long-term risk to skylark can be regarded as sufficiently addressed. No accepted risk refinement is available for the use in sunflower. The refined long-term risk assessment for the uses in sugar beet and sunflower based on hare (medium herbivorous mammal) resulted in TERs above the trigger of 5 and were accepted by the experts. The vole (Microtus arvalis) was rejected as a focal species for the use in cereals. The risk assessment provided in addendum 4 (not peer-reviewed) was conducted according to the recommendations of the expert meeting (wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus as a focal species and refinement of PD). The resulting TERs were above the trigger of 5 indicating a low risk. The risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning from uptake of contaminated earthworms and fish was assessed as low. Potential endocrine disrupting properties of fenpropimorph were discussed in the meeting. On the basis of the available information it was agreed that endocrine disrupting effects due to aromatase inhibition are unlikely to occur. Overall it is concluded that the risk to birds and mammals is expected to be low for the uses evaluated except for the use in sunflower where the long-term risk to birds needs further refinement.
   The long-term toxicity to fish was driving the aquatic risk assessment. In the expert meeting it was agreed to use the NOEC of 1.95 lag a.s./L from an early life stage study (ELS) conducted under a realistic exposure situation. The endpoint (NOEC) of 1.95 g a.s./L was suggested to be used in the risk assessment in combination with the maximum peak PECsw value. A new risk assessment was presented in the not peer-reviewed addendum 4 from February 2008. The TER calculation presented in the addendum combined no-spray buffer zones with drift reduction nozzles and run-off mitigation to achieve TERs above the trigger of 10. No spray buffer zones of >20 metres alone are not sufficient to achieve a full FOCUS step4 scenario with TERs >10. The risk assessment for aquatic organisms needs to be refined further. The major metabolite in the water-sediment system fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) is of low acute toxicity to fish, daphnids and algae. The risk from BF 4212 to aquatic organisms is considered as low.
   A short-term impact on sensitive arthropod species is likely to occur in the in-field area after application of fenpropimorph. However given the rapid residue decline in plants it is likely that the treated area is recolonised within a short period of time from unaffected off-crop areas. Therefore it was agreed by the experts that the risk to non-target arthropods is low for the representative uses evaluated.
   The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. However, the first-tier long-term (reproduction) TERs were <5. A field study with earthworms was made available by the applicant. No effects were observed on abundance and total biomass of earthworms. The observation period in the study was too short to detect potential effects on the reproduction of those earthworm species with long reproductive cycles. However the study gives an indication that the long term risk to earthworms is low. The experts agreed to the assessment of the RMS and considered the risk to earthworms as sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated. However as the soil exposure assessment is not finalised (as the accumulation potential in soil is not finalised), the risk assessment to earthworms cannot be finalised.
   Statistical significant effects of 7.4 % to 19.3 % were observed in the litterbag study. The experts considered the effects as relevant and the study was too short to exclude adverse effects on organic matter breakdown. The experts considered a new study in accordance with the latest guidance as necessary.
   The risk to bees, soil micro-organisms (subject to finalisation of the soil exposure assessment), non target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Buprofezin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR with the title buprofezin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 7 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 2 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Nihon Nohyaku Co., Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2007 and in December 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on tomato, lettuce and citrus. Full details of the gap can be found in the attached end points. It should be noted that only the use as an insecticide has been considered during the peer review process, the acaricide use has not been considered.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Applaud 25 WP", a wettable powder formulation (WP). It was concluded during the peer review process that the name buprofezin can not be used for this active substance.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor NNI-750 in all matrices.
   Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-methodslike the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 are not applicable due to the nature of the residues.
   Sufficient analytical methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   However, the suspensibility and wettability results were poor and a sprayability study was requested.
   In mammals, NNI-750 acute oral, dermal or inhalation toxicity is low (oral and dermal LD50 >2000 mg/kg bw, LC50 4.57 mg/L air /4h). NNI-750 is not a skin or eye irritant nor a skin sensitiser.
   Target organs in subchronic and chronic studies are liver and thyroid, showing increased weights and histological and clinical chemistry findings. The relevant short term NOAEL in rats is 13 mg/kg bw/day while in dogs, the relevant NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant long term toxicity NOAEL in rats is 0.90 mg/kg bw/day while in mice, it is 1.82 mg/kg bw/day.
   Genotoxicity of NNI-750 was discussed in an opinion of the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) based on a new micronucleus test in the bone marrow of mouse showing the induction of micronuclei in the erythrocytes of mouse bone marrow when administered by oral gavage once daily for two consecutive days. The Panel considered NNI-750 non genotoxic and the recent in vivo micronucleus test on bone marrow as not interpretable. The PPR Panel re-evaluated also the long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity studies on NNI-750 and concluded that NNI-750 is not carcinogenic in rats or mice.
   NNI-750 did not show any reproductive toxicity potential: the relevant parental and offspring NOAELs are 6.46 mg/kg bw/day f and 9.21 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The reproductive NOAEL is 66 mg/kg bw/day. As for teratogenicity studies, overall, the NOAEL for both maternal and foetal effects is 50 mg/kg (based on decreased food consumption and increased water intake, skeletal effects and subcutaneous oedema, respectively),It was agreed not to propose any classification.
   NNI-750 does not have potential to induce neurotoxicity in mammals.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day is based on the relevant NOAEL of 0.9 mg/kg bw/day from the 24 month study in rats, with an SF of 100. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level is 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, based on a NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day, with an SF of 100 and a correction for oral absorption of 40%. The Acute Reference Dose is 0.5 mg/kg bw based on the NOAEL from the developmental toxicity study and applying an SF 100.
   The operator exposure was below the AOEL-value for tractor mounted spraying with personal protective equipment for tomato and citrus calculated with the German model. For hand-held application exposure was under the AOEL with PPE for tomato outdoors (UK-POEM) and in glasshouse, as for lettuce (Dutch model), and for citrus (German model). The bystanders showed estimated exposure levels below the AOEL (<15%) for both applications on tomato and citrus. Worker exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL with gloves when handling tomato or lettuce in glasshouse or tomato outdoors. Instead, exposure was above the AOEL even with gloves when handling citrus.
   The metabolism of NNI-750 in plants has been elucidated. The parent compound is the major constituent of the final residue. Minor plant metabolites were identified. Their structures differ significantly from that of NNI-750 and their toxicological properties have not been sufficiently investigated. Also under processing conditions degradation products are formed with unknown toxicological potential. Therefore, although a residue definition can be proposed for monitoring (NNI-750), the residue definition for risk assessment has not been set. For this reason a consumer risk assessment is currently not possible.
   A potential transfer of residues to rotational crops has been noted.
   No residues are expected in animal commodities.
   In soil under aerobic conditions NNI-750 exhibits medium to high persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 19-51% applied radioactivity (AR) after 90-98 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 23-33 % AR after 90-98 days. Only minor (<5%AR) metabolites were formed. NNI-750 exhibits slight mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of NNI-750 was pH dependant.
   In dark natural sediment water systems NNI-750 degraded exhibiting moderate persistence in both water and sediment forming the metabolite NNI-750 sulfoxide (BF-10)2 in water (max. 12%AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 18 % AR at 91 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 14-15 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for NNI-750 at steps 1-3 and for citrus steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolite NNI-750 sulfoxide (BF -10) appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by NNI-750 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low for the outdoor uses assessed in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. An assessment of the potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended protected (glasshouse) uses with higher rates and numbers of applications than in outdoor uses is not available, though the potential for groundwater exposure from these uses is also likely to be low.
   The acute toxicity of NNI-750 is low to birds and mammals Following the principles of SANCO/ 4145/2000 the acute and long-term risk to birds and mammals were assessed to below. For the small herbivorous mammal in citrus an interception of 70% was taken in to account to reach a TER-value above the Annex IV trigger. Low risk is foreseen for earthworm- and fish-eating birds and mammals, as the risk to birds and mammals ingesting contaminated drinking water is also considered too be low.
   NNI-750 is as very toxic to aquatic organisms. TER values for use in tomatoes indicate low risk without any risk mitigation. Buffer zones of 20 m are required for use in citrus to identify low risk. Further data are needed to address the risk to sediment dwelling organisms from NNI-750. NNI-750 is not considered to bioaccumulate in fish.
   Low risk was identified for all other non-target organism groups, except for a data gap on a reproduction test with Collembola, to address the risk of use in citrus.

AB  - Napropamide is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on napropamide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 September 2005. The peer review was initiated on 17 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant United Phosphorus. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in April May 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a pre-planting herbicide on head cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, calabrese, tomatoes and oilseed rape. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Devrinol SC 450", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC) registered under different trade names in Europe.
   Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of napropamide. For surface water the supplied method does not have a LOQ that is low enough and therefore a new data gap has been identified. In addition to this it should be noted that the residue definition for water is not finalised and therefore further methods could be required in the future.
   Due to various reasons the minimum purity of the active substance and the impurity specification can not be concluded on.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   In mammalian metabolism studies, napropamide was rapidly and extensively absorbed (> 90 %), and widely distributed. Extensive metabolism and enterohepatic circulation were observed, as biliary excretion was a major pathway, and then excretion was rapid trough urine and faeces. Fifteen metabolites were identified and only < 0.5 % of the dose was recovered as parent compound.
   Napropamide has low acute toxicity and no classification is proposed related to acute toxicity testing including irritancy and sensitisation. Critical effect observed through short term and long term studies was decreased body weight. Two out of six in vitro gene mutation assays showed positive effects, as well as one weak positive effect for DNA damage and repair in mammalian cells out of five chromosomal tests, but three in vivo tests were all negative. So, overall, no genotoxic potential is attributed to napropamide. No potential for carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed; no adverse effect on fertility or on reproductive parameters was observed either, except for a higher abortion rate at maternally toxic doses in the rabbit which could not be ruled out from being a substance related effect. No foetotoxicity or teratogenicity was evidenced. Relevant short term NOAEL was the dose level of 50 mg/kg bw/day from the 1-year oral toxicity study in dog and 90-day oral study in rat, and the overall relevant long term NOAEL was 30 mg/kg bw/day derived from both 2-year, rat studies.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set at 0.3 mg/kg bw/day; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day considering an assessment factor of 100 and no acute reference dose is allocated.
   The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL if personal protective equipment (PPE) is used. No risk is anticipated for workers or bystanders derived from napropamide applications.
   Napropamide is extensively metabolised in plants. More than 10 metabolites have been identified but their individual concentration levels are not expected to exceed 0.01 mg/kg. Considering the low consumer exposure and the toxicological profile of the compound, the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring is proposed to be restricted to the parent compound on a provisional basis. Further information is needed to conclude on the toxicological relevance of 3 metabolites which are not covered by the toxicological studies performed with the parent compound.
   Supervised residue trials confirmed that MRLs can be set at the analytical limit of quantification (0.01 mg/kg) for all representative uses.
   Investigation of the effect of processing on residues is not needed. Livestock exposure is minimal and a residue definition for animal commodities is not necessary. A potential transfer of soil residues of napropamide above 0.01 mg/kg is present for root crops for plant back intervals up to 180 days.
   Provisionally, no risk for the consumer has been identified.
   In soil under aerobic conditions napropamide exhibits moderate to very high persistence forming the minor non transient soil metabolite NOPA(2) (accounting for a maximum of 5.8% of applied radioactivity (AR) in 30 degrees C incubations and 1.1%AR in 20 degrees C incubations) which exhibits moderate persistence. Note the database is limited and further data are necessary to further clarify the persistence of both napropamide (southern European field studies) and NOPA. Mineralisation of 1-naphthyl radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for only 5% AR after 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 13.2 % AR after 90 days. Napropamide exhibits medium to low mobility in soil, NOPA exhibits high mobility in soil. The adsorption behaviour of NOPA was pH dependant (lower adsorption as soil pH increased).
   In dark natural sediment water systems napropamide partitioned relatively slowly from water to sediment where it degraded exhibiting high to very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 3.6 AR at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were the major sink representing 11-19 % AR at study end. In a laboratory aqueous photolysis study napropamide was photolysed to 4 major metabolites (all identified). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach are not available so the risk assessment to aquatic organisms is not finalised.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by napropamide above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low under the more northern European geoclimatic situations that are represented by the FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However further field DT50 reflecting southern European conditions are required before the groundwater exposure assessment for parent napropamide can be finalised. For the metabolite NOPA further soil DT50 and kinetic formation fraction data are required to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment. However based on the available simulations, that use too favourable input parameters, it is clear that a groundwater non relevance assessment is triggered and NOPA concentrations will be > 0.75 g/L. From the mammalian toxicological point of view NOPA is not relevant, but biological screening data against target plants and a consumer risk assessment would be required before a conclusion on groundwater non relevance of NOPA could be finalised.
   The risk to birds was assessed as low for all representative uses evaluated. The first-tier long-term TER value of 4.6 was below the trigger of 5 for the use in tomato. It was agreed that the risk to insectivorous birds is likely to be low because the endpoint (NOEC reproduction) is based on the highest tested dose and that a certain proportion of the insect prey would consist of large insects (lower residues compared to small insects). The risk to birds from secondary poisoning for earthworm-eating birds was assessed as low. The TER values were in the range of 46-103 indicating some margin of safety. The risk assessment the Southern European use (tomato) can be finalised once updated PECsoil values are available.
   The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals needs to be assessed after reliable PECsw values are established. The risk to mammals is considered to be low for the representative uses evaluated, except the risk to insectivorous mammals and earthworm-eating mammals for the use in Southern Europe (tomato). The risk from plant metabolites was considered to be addressed by the risk assessment for the parent napropamide. The risk from plant metabolites was considered to be addressed by the risk assessment for the parent napropamide.
   Napropamide is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The risk assessment for aquatic organisms is driven by the toxicity to Lemna gibba. The refinement based on a study containing sediment in the test system was not accepted by the experts in the PRAPeR meeting. The endpoints to be used in the risk assessment were discussed since several studies with Lemna species and different aquatic invertebrate species were available. The experts suggested using in the aquatic risk assessment the endpoints of 0.067 mg a.s./L and a geometric mean value of 5.4 mg a.s./L for macrophytes and invertebrates, respectively. No conclusion can be drawn on the risk to aquatic organisms since no reliable PECsw values were established. A high risk to aquatic organisms cannot be excluded for the representative uses of napropamide. No major metabolites in surface water were identified in the water/sediment study. However, the fate experts agreed that the parent as well as 5 different photolysis metabolites and NOPA (where groundwater becomes surface water) should be considered for risk assessment The risk of bioconcentration in fish was assessed as low. The risk to earthworms and soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed as low for the uses in Northern Europe but is not finalised for the use in Southern Europe. A high risk to soil functioning (organic matter breakdown) was indicated by the available litter-bag study since effects of >10% were observed until one year after application of napropamide and further refinement of the risk assessment is necessary.
   The risk to bees, non-target arthropods and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.

AB  - Fenpropidin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenpropidin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 24 June 2005. The peer review was initiated on 23 March 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in January - February 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 14 November 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on cereals full details of the gap can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Tern 750 EC", an emulsifiable concentrate formulation (EC). Fenpropidin is a racemic mixture. It has been identified that more information is necessary to enable the impact of potential different isomer ratios on the risk assessments to be better characterised.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor fenpropidin (and its salts expressed as fenpropidin) in products of plant origin, soil water and air and fenpropidin (and its salts expressed as fenpropidin) and CGA 2892672 in products of animal origin. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There is an outstanding data requirement for a sprayability study to address the poor emulsion stability of the formulation.
   In mammalian toxicity testing, fenpropidin is acutely toxic via ingestion and inhalation (LD50 1452 mg/kg bw and LC50 1.22 mg/L). It is not acutely toxic via dermal route. It is irritant to skin and eyes but not corrosive. It is a skin sensitiser in both the Buehler and Maximization tests. Classification with Xn R20/22 (harmful by inhalation and if swallowed), Xi R38 (irritating to skin), R41 (risk of serious damage to eyes) and R43 (may cause sensitisation by skin contact) is proposed. According to a 28-day inhalation study showing irritating effects to the respiratory system, classification of fenpropidin as R37 ("irritating to the respiratory system") is warranted. The relevant NOAEL for short term toxicity in rats is 1.14 mg/kg bw/day, whereas in dogs is 2 mg/kg bw/day, based irritative effects and liver effects, respectively. Fenpropidin does not show any potential for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and potential toxicity. The relevant long term NOAEL is 2.27 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight; maternal and offspring NOAELs are 8 and 18 mg/kg bw/day, respectively, whereas the reproductive NOAEL is 9 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant maternal and developmental NOAELs are 90 and 12 mg/kg bw/day in rats and rabbits, respectively. Fenpropidin showed a neurotoxic potential in the repeated dose studies, expressed as spinal chord demyelination at the maximum doses tested in a 90-day rat and 1-year dog study. The NOAELs were 5 mg/kg bw/day in dogs and 10.1 mg/kg bw/day in rats. The ADI, AOEL and ARfD are 0.02 mg/kg bw/day (SF 100). The operator exposure of fenpropidin in field crop scenario with a tractor mounted hydraulic boom sprayer shows exposure levels below the AOEL when appropriate PPE is worn (gloves during mixing/loading and sturdy footwear and coveralls during application). Workers and bystanders show exposure levels below the AOEL under worst case assessments (67% with PPE and 4.5%, respectively).
   The metabolic pathway of fenpropidin in cereals has been elucidated. Several routes of metabolism have been identified but the metabolic pattern in wheat grain and straw at plant maturity is clearly dominated by the parent compound. Therefore the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring in cereals is restricted to fenpropidin.
   Supervised residue trials conducted in Northern Europe support the setting of MRLs of 0.1 mg/kg in wheat, rye and triticale and of 0.3 mg/kg in barley and oats. High residue levels were found in straw. Under processing the nature of fenpropidin residues is not affected and residues are preferentially transferred to bran during the milling process. The transfer factor from barley to beer could not be determined exactly but is below 0.4.
   A transfer of soil residues to rotational crops after cereal use is not expected.
   A significant exposure of livestock mainly resulting from consumption of straw is expected. Animal metabolism studies in lactating goats and laying hens show that fenpropidin is extensively metabolised in livestock and a complex residue pattern is found in edible tissues. The residue definition for monitoring animal commodities consists in the sum of fenpropidin and one of its major animal metabolites (CGA 289267). For risk assessment, further major metabolites need to be considered and conversion factors between both definitions have been proposed. A feeding study in dairy cows has been conducted and can be used for MRL setting in animal products. Chronic and acute consumer exposure assessments were conducted and, under restriction of an uncertainty related to the isomer ratio consumer is actually exposed to, did not show any indication of dietary risk.
   In soil under aerobic conditions fenpropidin exhibits moderate to high persistence and has the potential to accumulate when used in successive years. When it degrades it forms the major soil metabolite CGA 289267 (accounting for a maximum 10.6% of applied radioactivity (AR) at 8 degrees C) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of the benzylic bridge radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for 16-32% AR after 90-92 days (22 degrees C). The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 9-19 % AR after 90-92 days. Fenpropidin is immobile or exhibits slight mobility in soil, CGA 289267 exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either fenpropidin or CGA 289267 was pH dependant.
   In dark natural sediment water systems fenpropidin degraded exhibiting moderate to medium persistence to the metabolite CGA 289267 found primarily in the water of the system (maximum 1314% AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for 11-60 % AR at 84 days (study end, benzylic bridge radiolabel). Unextracted sediment residues a minor sink representing around 8 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for fenpropidin at steps 3 & 4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolite CGA 289267 appropriate FOCUS step 3 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. There is the potential for short range atmospheric deposition to surface water from fenpropidin that may volatilise at the time of application and from plant surfaces for around 24 hours after application.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by fenpropidin and its soil metabolite CGA 289267 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   The first-tier risk assessment for birds resulted in TERs below the Annex VI trigger for the acute scenario in the Northern European GAP and in the long-term scenarios in the Northern and Southern European GAPs. Measured residue values and the focal skylark (Alauda arvensis) and yellowhammer (Motacilla flava) were agreed by the experts to be used in the refined risk assessment but not the suggested PT values. The acute TER for herbivorous birds was > 10 based on maximum initial measured residues. The meeting agreed to take into account in the long-term risk assessment that cereals would become not attractive as a food source for herbivorous birds and mammals soon after the first application when stem elongation starts. The reduction of residues in insects based on general considerations of growth of insect populations was not accepted since it was not based on measured residues. A more detailed consideration of insect populations in the relevant crop would be required before a scientifically sound and robust estimation of residue decline could be made. The FOCUS based interception factor of 0.5 for residues on weed seeds was rejected since weeds may have a similar or larger height as the crop during early cereal growth stages and extrapolation from deposition on soil surface was considered as not correct. A data gap was identified to refine the longterm risk assessment for herbivorous birds and insectivorous birds (Northern and Southern European uses).
   The Annex VI trigger was met for insectivorous mammals but breached in the first-tier acute and long-term risk assessment for herbivorous mammals. The suggest PT to refine the risk was not sufficiently supported by data and hence rejected. However based on accepted measured residue values the refined risk assessment resulted in TERs above the trigger indicating a low risk from the representative uses evaluated.
   The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low. The acute TERs for exposure to contaminated drinking water based on the 5-fold dilution of the sprayed solution resulted in TERs < 10 for birds. Further information on the drinking behaviour of birds was not submitted leaving some uncertainty via this route of exposure. However the application is to cereals and hence the formation of leaf puddles is unlikely.
   Algae were the most sensitive group of aquatic organisms driving the aquatic risk assessment. The risk assessment was based on an endpoint from a mesocosm study. The proposed NOEAEC of 6.8 mu g fenpropin/L was not agreed because long-lasting effects on Chlorophyceae were observed at a concentration of 1.4 mu g fenpropidin/L. The meeting agreed on a NOEC of 0.39 mu g fenpropidin/L (based on mean measured initial concentrations). It was suggested by the meeting of experts that an assessment factor of 1-3 should be applied at Member State level depending on the representativeness of the mesocosm to the local environmental conditions in the agricultural landscape. In the updated addendum of September 2007 (not peer-reviewed) the RMS recalculated the TERs based on FOCUS step 4 PECsw. With a no-spray buffer zone of 50 metres the TERs were above 1 in all drainage scenarios out of 6 but below 1 in all run-off scenarios. No full FOCUS step 4 scenario resulted in TERs > 3. The risk from metabolite CGA 289267 to aquatic organisms was assessed as low.
   Predatory mites were the most sensititve group of non-target terrestrial arthropods tested. Extended laboratory studies indicated a high in-field risk but also a potential of recolonisation due to rapid residue decline. The available studies did not cover the off-field exposure rates for Phytoseilus persimilis. An in-field no-spray buffer zone of 5 metres is required to achieve a rate low enough to conclude on a low risk to predatory mites based on the available studies.
   The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. The long-term TER for the Northern European use was calculated as 4.6. Since the TER value is not far below the trigger of 5 and the TER is based on very conservative PECsoil calculations (accumulation for 20 years) the experts agreed that the longterm risk to earthworms is low. The risk from the major soil metabolite CGA 289267 was assessed as low.
   The risk to bees, other soil non-target macro-organisms (collembola), soil non-target microorganisms, biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses in cereals.

AB  - Quinoclamine is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on quinoclamine in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 June 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 11 January 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Agro-Kanesho Co. Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October-November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 25 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide/algaecide on ornamentals, turf, lawns and nursery stock plants as proposed by the applicant, full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Mogeton", a wettable powder (WP) containing 250 g/kg of active substance. Methods are not required for food of plant or animal origin as the use is on ornamentals, turf, lawns and nursery stock plants. Adequate methods are available to monitor quinoclamine in soil, drinking water and air. A confirmatory method for surface water was identified as a data gap in the meeting of experts. A confirmatory method for surface water has been provided by the applicant but it has not been evaluated and therefore is not peer reviewed.
   Some analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, a method of analysis for the relevant impurity dichlone (2,3-dichloro-1,4naphthoquinone) is not available.
   The acute oral toxicity of quinoclamine is moderate (R22 Harmful if swallowed) but the acute toxicity by inhalation or dermal application is low. The substance is irritating to the eyes (R36 Irritant to eyes) but not to the skin, and has sensitizing properties (R43 May cause sensitization by skin contact). Indications of haemolytic anaemia are observed in the short term studies in rats and dogs. Quinoclamine does not show a genotoxic or carcinogenic potential, but some teratogenic effects were observed and lead to the proposed classification Repro cat. 3, R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.002 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.03 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.05 mg/kg bw. The dermal absorption values are 6.52% for the concentrate and the low dilution, and 10% for the high dilution. The operator exposure estimates in field or greenhouse are below the AOEL only when personal protective equipment is used. Preliminary estimates of children exposure show that the AOEL might be exceeded when the exposure occurs on the day of treatment.
   Very high residue levels are present on grass directly after application of quinoclamine. A metabolism study demonstrated that parent compound is the main constituent of the residue on grass up to 2 weeks after application. Therefore only quinoclamine needs to be considered for risk assessment related to humans and terrestrial vertebrates in contact with treated lawn and turf. One decline study demonstrated that residues decrease rapidly in favourable condition of grass growth. Also grass clipping results in low residues in regrown grass. Nevertheless it cannot be excluded that the decline of residues in grass may be significantly slower when growth rate of grass due to environmental conditions is weak. The need for further studies should therefore be considered at national level.
   As a risk-mitigation measure related to human and wildlife exposure, label should give the user clear recommendations to apply the product in strong growing conditions of grass, and practical instructions to irrigate efficiently the treated area in case of low precipitation level, in accordance with the biological efficiency of the product.
   Quinoclamine is moderately persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C and produces a number of minor metabolites (< 5 % AR). Quinoclamine ultimately degrades to non extractable residues and mineralizes to CO2.
   Under dark anaerobic conditions at 20 degrees C, quinoclamine is low persistent and yields two main metabolites: AN and DHN.
   Light may enhance the degradation of quinoclamine but its contribution to overall degradation in soil is deemed low due to the rapid microbiological degradation.
   A field study is available where Mogeton 25WP (15 Kg /ha; 3.75 Kg a. s. /ha) was applied in four sites (two in spring and two in autumn) in Germany on bare soil. Only data from the spring trials was found relevant for the representative uses applied at EU level (spring application). PEC soil were calculated based on the field worst case spring application half life (DT50 = 29 d). The expert's meeting agreed that for uses in autumn longer dissipation pattern observed in autumn field trials would need to be considered. In that case, new kinetic analysis of the two autumn field studies would be necessary.
   Quinoclamine may be considered low mobile in soil according the batch adsorption/desorption studies available.
   According the available study quinoclamine is expected to be stable to hydrolysis under environmental conditions (pH 4-9, 20 degrees C).
   According the aqueous photolysis study available in the original dossier quinoclamine has a short half life in water under irradiated conditions (2.2 d, corresponding to 4.2 d with 12 h irradiation per day in UK). A data gap was identified during the peer review for further information on non identified photolysis metabolites. In a new study, photolysis was slower. Two major photolysis metabolites were identified: phthalic acid and 2-carboxybenzaldehide. The two major photolysis metabolites were considered by the RMS in the updated risk assessment presented in the addendum. According the available study quinoclamine is not ready biodegradable.
   In dark water /sediment at 20 degrees C, quinoclamine partitioned to the sediment and degraded in whole system with a first order half life of 14-15 d. Metabolite AN reached levels above 10 % AR in the sediment.
   For the assessment of the representative use in lawns/turf, PECSW were calculated with the FOCUS SW scheme up to Step 3 using whole water /sediment degradation half lives. Only global maximum PECSW have been used in the risk assessment. Based on this PECSW calculation a risk for aquatic organisms was identified.
   The FOCUS SW Step 4 calculations presented by the notifier were not found acceptable because input parameters employed deviated from those recommended by the RMS and agreed by the peer review and/or due to the implementation of additional mitigation by VFS or by spray shields. Also the experts in the meeting agreed that for uses on turf (particularly golf courses and other sport facilities) drainage should be considered a potential route of entry to surface water. However, the meeting agreed that available Step 4 calculations give an indication that significant mitigation regarding run off and spray drift will be necessary to mitigate risk to aquatic environment for the proposed representative use in turf /lawn. Applicant proposed that potential surface water contamination due to use in ornamental plants in pots may be managed in a way that contamination of surface water will be negligible. RMS calculated spray drift PECSW for the use on pots outdoor. During the experts meeting, it was indicated that in the case of pots standing in a hard surface high potential of surface water contamination as a consequence of run off is also possible. As there is not agreed way of dealing with run off from hard surfaces at EU level, it was agreed that this issue would have to be addressed a MS level.
   Potential contamination of ground water for the use in turf was addressed following the FOCUS GW scheme with FOCUS PRZM (v 3.2.1. b). The resulting 80th percentile annual average concentrations of quinoclamine at 1m depth were below 0.001 mu g / L in all the FOCUS GW scenarios. Due to the low potential of volatilization and the estimated rapid photochemical transformation, the environmental concentrations in air and the transport through air are considered negligible.
   The representative uses of quinoclamine are against algae and mosses in lawns/turf, ornamentals (outdoors) and nursery stock plants (out-and indoor). The risk assessment was focussed on the use in lawns and turf. Exposure of birds and mammals from the outdoor use in ornamentals was considered as negligible. The first-tier TERs for large herbivorous and small insectivorous birds were below the triggers of 10 and 5. The risk refinements based on residue decline in grass was accepted by the experts. However other suggested refinements were rejected and further data are required to refine the short-term risk to herbivorous birds, the short-term and long-term risk to insectivorous birds. The acute and long-term TERs for herbivorous mammals were below the triggers of 10 and 5. The refined long-term TER based on residue decline was calculated as 5.8. However the acute risk to mammals needs to be addressed further. Fish and daphnids were the most sensitive aquatic organisms triggering the acute and long-term risk assessment. No-spray buffer zones of up to 100 m are not sufficient as a risk mitigation measure to achieve TERs above the Annex VI triggers for the use in lawns/turf. The TER calculation of the RMS for the outdoor use in ornamentals and nursery stock plants indicated that a distance of 20m is not sufficient to mitigate the risk. However no agreed exposure scenario exists for the outdoor use in ornamentals and nursery stock plants. Therefore it was agreed that a risk assessment should be conducted at Member state level. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil-micro organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low.

AB  - Antarctic marine bacteria were screened for their ability to degrade polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) as the sole carbon and energy source at both 4 degrees C and 15 degrees C. PCB-degrading isolates (7.1%) were identified by sequencing their 16S rDNA as Pseudoalteromonas, Psychrobacter and Arthrobacter members.
   One representative isolate per genera was selected for evaluating the biodegradative potential under laboratory scale and phenotypically characterized. Removal of individual PCB congeners was between 35.6% and 79.8% at 4 degrees C and between 0.4% and 82.8% at 15 degrees C. Differences in the removal patterns of PCB congeners were observed in relation to the phylogenetic affiliation: Arthrobacter isolate showed similar biodegradation efficiencies when growing at 4 degrees C and 15 degrees C while Pseudoalteromonas better degraded PCBs at 15 degrees C. No biodegradation was detected for Psychrobacter isolate at 4 degrees C.
   Results obtained highlight the occurrence of PCB-degrading bacteria in Antarctic seawater and suggest the potential exploitation of autochthonous bacteria for PCB bioremediation in cold marine environments. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Livestock and aquaculture production is under political and social pressure, especially in the European Union (EU), to decrease pollution and environmental damage arising due to animal agriculture. The EU has banned the use of antibiotics and other chemicals, which have been shown to be effective in promoting growth and reducing environment pollutants because of the risk caused to humans by chemical residues in food and by antibiotic resistance being passed on to human pathogens. As a result of this, scientists have intensified efforts in exploiting plants, plant extracts or natural plant compounds as potential natural alternatives for enhancing the livestock productivity. This paper discusses work on the effects of various phytochemicals and plant secondary metabolites in ruminant and fish species. The focus is on (i) plants such as Ananas comosus (pine apple), Momordica charantia (bitter gourd) and Azadirachta indica (neem) containing anthelmintic compounds and for their use for controlling internal parasites; (ii) plants containing polyphenols and their applications for protecting proteins from degradation in the rumen, increasing efficiency of microbial protein synthesis in rumen and decreasing methane emission; for using as antioxidants, antibacterial and antihelmintic agents; and for changing meat colour and for increasing n-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid in meat; (iii) saponin-rich plants such as quillaja, yucca and Sapindus saponaria for increasing the efficiency of rumen fermentation, decreasing methane emission and enhancing growth, for producing desired nutritional attributes such as lowering of cholesterol in monogastric animals; for increasing growth of fish (common carp and Nile tilapia) and for changing male to female ratio in tilapia; and for use as molluscicidal agents; (iv) Moringa oleifera leaves as a source of plant growth factor(s), antioxidants, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and various glucosinolates and their degraded products for possible use as antibacterial, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic and antipest agents, (v) Jatropha curcas toxic variety with high levels of various phytochemicals such as trypsin inhibitor lectin, phytate and phorbol esters in seeds limiting the use of seed meal in fish and livestock diets; and the use of phorbol esters as bio-pesticidal agent, and (vi) lesser-known legumes such as Entada phaseoloides seeds containing high levels of trypsin inhibitor and saponins, Sesbania aculeate seeds rich in non-starch polysaccharides and Mucuna pruriens var. utilis seeds rich in L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and their potential as fish feed; Cassia fistula seeds as a source of antioxidants; and the use of Canavalia ensiformis, C. gladiata and C. virosa seeds containing high levels of ttypsin inhinitor, lectins and canavanine. The paper also presents some challenges and future areas of work in this field.

AB  - Prosulfocarb is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on prosulfocarb in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 April 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 7 October 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed during a written procedure in August September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 27 June 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a pre emergence or early post -emergence herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprise conventional field crop spraying to control grass weeds (Apera spica-venti, Poa annua, Poa trivialis, Alopecurus myosuroides, Lolium multi/Thrum) and broad-leaved weeds (Galium aparine, Stellaria media, Lamium purpureum, Fumaria officinalis, Solanum nigrum, Atriplex patula, Chenopodium album, Thlaspi arvense, Veronica spp., Capsella bursa-pastoris, Myosotis arvensis, Anthemis spp., Viola arvensis) in winter wheat and potatoes (a maximum rate of 4 kg as/ha). The representative formulated products for the evaluation was "Boxer", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 800 g/L prosulfocarb.
   The technical specification is still open waiting for confirmatory data.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor prosulfocarb in the respective residue definitions. Residues of prosulfocarb in food and feed of plant origin can be determined by a multi method (DFG Method-S19) using GC-MSD and in soil, water and air by GC-MSD. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   The acute oral toxicity of prosulfocarb is moderate while the acute dermal or inhalation toxicity is low. Slight signs of skin-and ocular irritation were noted in rabbits, and skin sensitisation was shown in mice. In short-term toxicity studies, liver and kidney were found to be the target organs in rats and dogs. In addition, haemolytic anaemia was observed in dogs, with associated histopathological findings in the bone marrow and spleen. Available data do not support evidence of genotoxic or carcinogenic effects. In long-term toxicity studies, mainly reduced food consumption and decreased body weights were noted. No toxic effect on the reproductive parameters was demonstrated. However, there was some evidence of teratogenic potential but no convincing evidence for classification and adequate margins of safety were shown for the reference values. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/d, the Acceptable Operator Exposure (AOEL) is 0.007 mg/kg bw/d and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.1 mg/kg bw. The level of operator exposure is below the AOEL with the use of personal protective equipment according to a field study.
   Applied according to the representative uses in wheat and potatoes, prosulfocarb is extensively metabolised and in mature commodities no metabolite structurally related to the compound was identified. The ultimate degradation products are expected to be incorporated in the endogenous metabolism of the plant. The residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment is proposed to consist per default in prosulfocarb. MRLs for wheat and potatoes can be set at the Limit of Quantification. No residues are expected in rotational crops, processed plant commodities and in animal commodities. No risk for the consumer resulting from the use of prosulfocarb according to the representative uses is expected.
   In soil under aerobic conditions prosulfocarb exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the minor soil metabolite prosulfocarb sulfoxide2 (observed in studies at a maximum of 7.2% of prosulfocarb on a mass basis) which exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 38 % of applied radioactivity (AR) after 96 days. The formation of unextractable residues was also a significant sink accounting for 27 % AR after 96 days. Under anaerobic soil conditions degradation was slower than under aerobic conditions but no novel breakdown products were identified. Prosulfocarb exhibits low to slight mobility in soil, prosulfocarb sulfoxide exhibits high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either prosulfocarb or prosulfocarb sulfoxide was pH dependant.
   In natural sediment water systems prosulfocarb dissipated quite rapidly from water by partitioning to sediment where it subsequently degraded slowly exhibiting high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was the only significant degradation product accounting for 15-25 % AR at 70-107 days. Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink for radioactivity representing 7.3-23 % AR at study end (107 days). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for prosulfocarb at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. Additionally at step 4, for the runoff scenarios the applicant presented calculations where both spray drift and runoff were mitigated.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.41g/L by parent prosulfocarb and its minor soil metabolite prosulfocarb sulfoxide, was concluded to be low, in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   The first-tier acute and short-term TERs for birds were above the trigger value of 10 but the longterm trigger of 5 was breached. The suggested risk refinements based on rate of decline of residues in plants, focal species and proportion of different food items in the diet (PD) were agreed in the meeting of experts. For mammals, the first tier acute TER was below the trigger of 10 for the small herbivore and all first tier long-term TERs were below the trigger of 5. As for birds, the refined risk assessment for mammals, based on rate of decline of residues in plants, focal species and proportion of different food items in the diet (PD), were agreed in the meeting of experts. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was considered to be low since exposure of birds and mammals from contaminated drinking water was expected to be low. The accumulation of water in leaf axils and puddle formation were considered as unlikely since the product is applied at very early growth stages and sprayed at low volumes. A potential high risk was indicated for earthworm-eating birds and mammals. The refined risk assessment based on measured residues in earthworms resulted in TERs above the trigger of 5. The TERs for fish, daphnids and algae were about one order of magnitude below the trigger values of 100 and 10 based on FOCUS step 2 PECsw. No full FOCUS step3 scenario resulted in PECsw values low enough to achieve TERs above the Annex VI triggers for all groups of aquatic organisms.
   Based on endpoints from laboratory studies, TERs below the Annex VI triggers were observed with FOCUS step 4 PECsw (10 m no spray buffer zone) in the scenarios D1, D2, D4, D5, D6, R1, R3, R4 (8 out of 9) for the use in winter wheat and in the scenarios R1, R2, R3 (3 out of 6) for the use in potato. Therefore it is concluded that a 10 m no-spray buffer zone is not sufficient as a risk mitigation measure in the majority of geoclimatic conditions represented by the FOCUS scenarios. Two mesocosm studies were submitted to refine the risk to aquatic organisms. The robustness of the results of the first study was questioned during the peer-review process. The experts in the PRAPeR meeting agreed that a NOEAEC of 15 fig prosulfocarb/L could be derived from the new mesocosm study. No agreement was reached during the expert meeting on the safety factor which should be applied to the endpoint. If a safety factor of >3 is applied then the NOEAEC of 15 fig prosulfocarb/L would become the critical endpoint driving the risk assessment. The HQ values indicated a potential high in-field and off-field risk to non-target arthropods. Extended laboratory studies resulted in LR50s below the suggested application rate of 4 kg prosulfocarb/ha but the LR50s were higher than the expected exposure at lm distance from the treated field. Therefore it was concluded by the expert meeting that recolonisation of the in-field area is likely to occur and the overall risk to non-target arthropods is sufficiently addressed. The TER values for non-target plants were calculated as 3 and 28 for pre-and post-emergence treatment. The use of an interception factor to estimate the pre emergence exposure and the suggested lowering of the safety factor was not agreed by the expert meeting. Risk mitigation measures such as an in-field no spray buffer zone of 5 m was recommended. The risk to bees, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.

AB  - Concern has been raised that the increased use of pesticides in intensive aquaculture practices may cause adverse sublethal effects to non-target aquatic species. Azamethiphos is an organophosphate (OP) pesticide used to combat sea lice infestations in farmed salmonids. Here, the sublethal impact on the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, of short term exposure to azamethiphos was determined. The testing regime included biomarkers of exposure (acetylcholinesterase activity), cytotoxicity (neutral red retention), immune function (phagocytic index) and physiological condition (feeding rate). The distribution and sensitivity of M. edulis acetylcholinesterase to inhibition by azamethiphos was first determined, yielding IC50 values of 0.736 and 1.30 mg l(-1) for gill and haemolymph, respectively. Exposure of mussels to 0.1 mg l(-1) azamethiphos for periods of up to 24 h caused a significant reduction in acetylcholinesterase activity in both the haemolymph (P < 0.0002) and the gill (P < 0.002), alteration in cell viability (P < 0.02) and decrease in phagocytic index (P < 0.03). The feeding rate remained unaffected. The results support the hypothesis that, in addition to its neurotoxic effects, azamethiphos can modulate haemocyte function and immune defence in M. edulis at environmentally relevant concentrations after only a few hours.

AB  - Although, in general, the Commission is using the ISO common names for the active substances, in this case the synonym haloxyfop-R (introduced by DOW AgroSciences) is used, which is in common use, but has no official status. However, to minimise confusion and misunderstandings the name haloxyfop-R is used in the EFSA conclusion, being aware that this is not in compliance with the general approach of the Commission.
   Haloxyfop-R is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on haloxyfop-R in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 21 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 26 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.

Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 26 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control annual and perennial grasses in carrots, fodder legumes (peas and beans), rape seed, soy bean and sugar beet at a maximum application rate up to 0.104 kg haloxyfop-R per hectare. Only the use as herbicide was evaluated during the EU peer review process.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "EF-1400", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe.
   Whether or not sufficient enforcement methods are available for monitoring purposes depends on the final residue definitions. The reason is that none of the submitted method is enantio selective. The residues are determined as a sum parameter of both, the R- and the S-isomer. This means that for the determination of haloxyfop-R no specific enforcement method would be available.
   Furthermore, it should be noted that with the available analytical methods for food, soil and water it is not possible to differentiate between residue of the acid and its salts, esters and conjugates.
   Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   The toxicological studies were generally performed with pure (>98%) racemic haloxyfop or haloxyfop-R methyl ester or with neat substances. The toxicokinetic studies indicate that absorbed methyl ester will rapidly be hydrolysed to the parent acid and the S-form haloxyfop present in racemic haloxyfop will instantaneously undergo stereochemical inversion to haloxyfop-R. Therefore, the various compounds used for testing are assumed to elicit the same systemic effects following administration and these effects can be attributed to haloxyfop-R. The absorption is rapid (> 80%) and the excretion extensive. The acute oral toxicity is moderate i.e. LD50 is around 300 mg/kg bw and the dermal toxicity low LD50> 2000 mg/kg bw, proposed classification of Xn, R22 "Harmful if swallowed". No acute inhalation toxicity studies are available. Neither racemic haloxyfop nor haloxyfop-R methyl ester was irritating to skin and haloxyfop-R methyl ester was not a sensitizer. Haloxyfop-R methyl ester is not irritating to the eye whereas racemic haloxyfop induced signs of irritation in the conjunctival sacs and iris and caused corneal opacity covering up to 100% of the cornea in all animals. Signs of irritation (corneal opacity) persisted for 21 days in un-rinsed eyes racemic haloxyfop is therefore irritating to the eye and the classification of Xi; R41 "Risk of serious damage to eyes" is proposed. The relevant short term NOAEL is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study which would also be said to cover the effects observed in the 90-day studies in the dog and monkey at 2 mg/kg bw/day.
   There is no mutagenic or genotoxic potential for haloxyfop-R. Haloxyfop is not carcinogenic in the rat but there are hepatocellular adenomas in the highest dose in the mice associated with peroxisome proliferation.
   No reproductive effects were observed at the highest dose level of 1 mg/kg bw/day, thus being a NOAEL for reproductive effects, the NOAEL for offspring toxicity is 0.065 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight of f(1a) pups after 21 days at 1 mg/kg bw/day.
   The NOAEL for maternal effects is 7.5 mg/kg bw/day and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 7.5 mg/kg bw/day in the first study and 15 mg/kg bw/day in the second study.
   No specific studies are available for the metabolites.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.00065 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.075 mg/kg bw/day, with the safety factor of 100 applied.
   The operator exposure was estimated using the standard models UK-POEM and the German model. The dermal absorption is 7% and 12% for the concentrate and the diluted product, respectively. The AOEL is exceeded (169%) according to the UK-POEM even with PPE (coverall) but is below according to the German model if PPE (coverall and gloves) is applied (12%). The estimated worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL.
   To investigate the residue behaviour of haloxyfop-R in plants and livestock either the haloxyfop R-isomer or the unresolved isomeric mixture or ester variants of both compounds were used.
   Plant metabolism was studied following foliar application to crops representing leafy crops, root vegetables, pulses and oilseeds. Irrespective of the ester variant or whether the racemic mixture or only the R-isomer was applied, the metabolism in all the studied crops was found to be similar commencing by a rapid and almost complete degradation to haloxyfop (R,S) very soon after application, followed by conjugation with carbohydrates and triglycerides. These conjugates appeared to be unstable under alkaline and acidic conditions, releasing haloxyfop (R,S) again.
   Metabolism studies with goats and hens indicated that haloxyfop (R,S) is excreted unmetabolised by livestock animals. In tissue and organs residues were present as haloxyfop (R,S) in either form, free and conjugated.
   Due to the lacking isomeric specificity of the pre-registration analytical methods any possible stereochemical inversion in either direction in food of plant and animal origin could not be detected, even though it is assumed based on available data in soil and in rats that if such inversion occurs it will be most likely from the S- to the R-isomer.
   A sufficient number of residue trial data with haloxyfop-R methyl according to the GAP proposed for the representative uses is available to conclude the risk assessment for consumers and to propose MRLs. From crop rotation studies it can be concluded that no significant residue levels are expected in rotational and succeeding crops following application of haloxyfop-R methyl according to the critical GAP. The residue levels that could occur in food of animal origin when crops treated with haloxyfop-R methyl are fed to animals were assessed based on livestock feeding studies and MRLs have been proposed.
   The dietary risk assessment performed for different consumer groups indicates that there are no chronic and acute concerns related to dietary exposure resulting from the representative uses assessed within the peer review procedure.
   Soil degradation studies suggested a possible main degradation route for haloxyfop-R methyl ester under aerobic conditions. Haloxyfop-R methyl ester degraded rapidly (DT50 < 0.6 d at 20 degrees C) in six soils to produce the acid metabolite haloxyfop-R-3 (maxima concentrations ranged from 53 to 91% AR), which further degraded to DE-535 pyridinol(4) (max. 29-52% AR). Other two metabolites, DE-535 pyridinone(5) and DE-535 phenol(6), exceeded the trigger value of 10% AR on a limited number of occasions: DE-535 pyridinone reached a maximum of 11.0% AR after 120 days, and DE-535 phenol with maximum concentration of 12.6% AR after 14 days. Final degradation ended up in minor unidentified metabolites, non-extractable soil residues (max. 44% AR after 90 days) and carbon dioxide (max. 35% AR after 90 days). Haloxyfop-R can be considered as very low to low persistent, DE-535 pyridinol as medium to high persistent, DE-535 phenol as moderate to high persistent and DE-535 pyridinone as high persistent.
   Sorption characteristics indicated that haloxyfop-R, DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone are very high to high mobile in soil, whereas DE-535 phenol can be classified as low mobile. Haloxyfop-R and the metabolite trifluoroacetic acid exceeded the limit value of 0.1 mu g/L on individual occasions in some lysimeter studies, but the annual average concentrations were < 0.1 mu g/L for haloxyfop-R methyl ester and all its metabolites.
   Because the calculation model for PECsoil was not consistent with the method used for the degradation rates values, soil concentrations at later time points for haloxyfop-R, DE-535 phenol and DE-535 pyridinone should be recalculated. However, the new PECsoil values will not have an impact on the risk assessment for terrestrial organisms as safe uses have been shown using the reliable initial PECsoil.
   The hydrolysis rate of haloxyfop-R methyl ester was directly correlated with pH (stable at pH 4, DT50=43 days at pH 7 and DT50= 0.63 days at pH 9). The photolysis of haloxyfop-R methyl ester and haloxyfop-R was investigated in pH 5 sterile buffer and natural water (pH 8.5). A new metabolite, with a chemical structure similar to dibenzofuran, was identified up to 18.6% AR in the sterile buffer system. Because a final conclusion on the ecotoxicological and toxicological relevance of this metabolite can not be drawn, the aquatic exposure of DE-535 furan needs to be addressed.
   Two natural water-sediment systems under controlled laboratory conditions showed that haloxyfop-R methyl ester was rapidly hydrolyzed to haloxyfop-R, the concentrations of which were in the range of 63.8 - 81.5% AR after 1-30 days. At the same time the concentration of the metabolite DE-535 pyridinol increased up to 19.7% AR after 59 days. The same two metabolites were also found in the sediment phase up to 33.7% AR (haloxyfop-R) and 16.4% AR (DE-535 pyridinol). Haloxyfop-R methyl ester degraded rapidly in both the water and sediment phases with first order DT50 values < 0.3 days. The calculated DT50 values for haloxyfop-R ranged from 39.2 - 51.7 d (whole system) and from 31.5-54.6 d (water phase).
   The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route on entry to surface water for haloxyfop-R methyl ester, haloxyfop-R and DE-535 pyridinol. Additional calculations were performed including a worst-case contamination contribution from run-off and drainage of 15% of the application rate.
   The available FOCUS groundwater modelling indicated that there is a high potential of groundwater contamination from the metabolites DE-535 pyridinol (80th percentile annual average concentrations: 0.55-2.87 mu g/L) and DE-535 pyridinone (0.26-0.90 mu g/L) under vulnerable situations for all the 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However, the DT50 values used in the modelling were derived with a method not compatible with the method assumed by the PELMO model as recommended by the FOCUS group. Therefore, the values presented in this conclusion should be taken with caution and should be confirmed by an appropriate FOCUS groundwater modelling. Pending the outcome, an evaluation of the relevance of the metabolites following the guidance document on relevant metabolites has to be completed. In the case the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L or 0.75 mu g/L is exceeded there is a need to provide information on the toxicological properties and possibly consumer risk assessment.
   Based on the available volatilisation experiment and the calculated atmospheric half-life, contamination of the air compartment and long range transport through air are not expected.
   The first tier risk assessment for herbivorous and insectivorous birds resulted in TER values above the Annex VI trigger indicating a low risk. For medium herbivorous and insectivorous mammals the acute risk is considered to be low, while a first tier high long-term risk was identified. The MS experts did not accept a proposed refinement using a higher endpoint from a 16-week dietary study. It was agreed to use the endpoint of 1 mg/kg bw/day from a 2-generation reproduction study. Furthermore, since the half-life for residues in vegetation was observed to be longer than the default value, residue decline data for each crop should be used in the risk assessment. The resulting TER values are foreseen to be below the Annex VI trigger indicating a high risk, and the risk to mammals needs to be further addressed.
   Haloxyfop-R methyl ester is very toxic to aquatic organisms, fish being the most sensitive group of organisms. Risk mitigation comparable to 5 m buffer zones is required to meet the Annex VI trigger. The risk to aquatic organisms from the surface water metabolites haloxyfop-R and DE-535 pyridinol is considered to be low, except for sediment dwelling organisms for which a reproduction study with Chironomus riparius using DE-535 pyridinol is required before a full conclusion can be drawn. No information on the toxicity of the photolysis metabolite DE-535 furan is available. If an assumption of ten times higher toxicity compared to haloxyfop-R methyl ester were applied, the resulting TER value would be below the Annex VI acute trigger. Thus data to address the toxicity of this metabolite to aquatic organism is considered necessary. Two metabolites were found in concentrations >0.1 mu g/L in the FOCUS ground water modelling. DE-535 pyridinol is considered to be of no ecotoxicological relevance. A conclusion regarding the relevance of DE-535 pyridinone can only be drawn once available studies have been evaluated.
   The risk to bees and other non-target arthropods is low. The risk to earthworms, other soil macro-organisms and soil micro-organisms from haloxyfop-R methyl ester and haloxyfop-R is considered to be low. However, the risk to soil organisms from exposure to the persistent soil metabolites DE-535 pyridinol, DE-pyridinone and DE-535 phenol needs to be addressed. The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low. No evaluated studies are available to conclude on the risk to non-target plants.

AB  - Phosmet is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on phosmet in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 23 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 03 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Margarita Internacional. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6 April 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an acaracide and insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises tractor-mounted spraying and airblast assisted sprayers in orchards. Application is made to citrus fruit at a rate of 0.5 kg phosmet per hectare, pome fruit at 0.3 kg phosmet per hectare and potatoes at 0.5 kg phosmet per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Imidan 50 WP a wettable powder (WP) registered under different trade names in Europe. The representative uses assessed were located in southern Europe only as stated in the application for annex 1 listing. No conclusion on the equivalence of the two sources could be made as some mammalian toxicology data were missing.
   In the main adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. The residue definition for water can not be finalised due to outstanding ecotoxicology data. The method for body fluids and tissues is currently only validated for phosmet and as the oxon is in the residue definition further validation data will be required. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Limited analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are some outstanding issues related to the relevant impurities.
   The toxicological risk assessment is based on the assumption that the studies have been performed with a test material that covers the current technical specification. The absorption is rapid and almost complete, there is no accumulation in tissues and the excretion is mainly via urine. Phosmet is toxic by oral administration and the proposed classification is T, R25. It is non-irritant to skin and eyes and does not cause sensitisation by skin contact. The critical effect after repeated exposure is depression of the plasma, erythrocyte and brain acetylcholinesterase activities. The most sensitive species is the dog. Phosmet is an in vitro but not in vivo genotoxic agent. Increased incidence of liver tumours is observed in mice at the highest dose level (14 mg/kg bw/day), higher than controls but within the same range as historical control data. In a two-generation study with rats, the fertility parameters and the offspring are not directly affected. Phosmet shows no evidence of teratogenicity in rat or rabbits, and no potential to induce delayed neurotoxicity. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.003 mg/kg/day, based on a LOAEL of 1 mg/kg bw/day and an additional safety factor of 3. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.045 mg/kg bw/day and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) 0.02 mg/kg bw/day. For the use on potatoes and pomes, exposure estimates according to the German model are below the AOEL for operators wearing personal protective equipment and respiratory protective equipment. In spite of these high protection measures, the operator exposure is above the AOEL during application on citrus fruits. Estimates of worker and bystander exposure are below the AOEL for all the supported uses.
   Plant metabolism studies with 14C-phosmet in cherries, potatoes and corn are available covering the representative uses. A common metabolic pathway is proposed. Phosmet is able to penetrate through the plant surface where the main metabolic reactions take place. Within the plant tissues only a limited transport is observed. The primary metabolic reactions are hydrolysis and conjugation reactions which produce phthalic acid and a range of related compounds, none of them containing the phosphorodithioate group. Oxidation reaction leading to the oxygen analogue phosmet oxon is a minor metabolic reaction. Considering the fact that oxygen analogue compounds are of high toxicity and the fact that no specific information on the toxicological significance of this compound is available, it was concluded to include phosmet oxon in the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring purposes. However, pending on the outcome of the study aimed to address the relative potency of phosmet oxon in comparison with the parent compound, it might be necessary to reconsider the residue definitions.
   Supervised residue trials in oranges, apples and potatoes have been submitted, which allow the proposal of the following MRLs: oranges and pome fruit: 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, potatoes: 0.02* mg/kg. No MRLs are proposed for other citrus fruit as the available trials in oranges are not suitable for extrapolation to the whole crop group.
   The effects of processing on the nature and the level of residues were investigated. Under conditions simulating pasteurisation, baking/brewing/boiling and sterilisation, phosmet degraded to less toxic compounds or compounds that occurred also in animal metabolism studies. The transfer factors to apple juice, apple pure and canned apples were very low, with residues essentially left in the pomace and peel fractions.
   Studies on succeeding or rotational crops are not required due to the fast degradation of phosmet in soil.
   Livestock can be exposed to residues of phosmet through consumption of fruit pomace and potatoes. Metabolism studies in lactating goat and laying hens demonstrated that phosmet will not occur in animal tissues, milk and eggs when livestock is fed with feed produced according to GAP for the supported use.
   The consumer risk assessment was carried out taking into account chronic and acute exposures according to the provisional residue definition (sum of phosmet and phosmet oxon, expressed as phosmet). The calculations indicate that the exposure will be below the ADI and the ARfD, respectively.
   In aerobic laboratory soil degradation studies (20 degrees C, 21-50% soil maximum water holding capacity) phosmet exhibited low persistence and did not form any major (> 10% AR) extractable non volatile soil metabolites. The major sink for the radiolabels used in the experiments was mineralisation to CO2 (53-77% applied radioactivity (AR) at 120-150 days). Residue not extracted by acetone /acidified acetone accounted for 17-38% AR at 150 days. In field dissipation studies carried out in the USA phosmet also exhibited low persistence. Under laboratory (23 degrees C) anaerobic soil conditions the major (14.5% AR) metabolite N-hydroxymethyl phthalamic acid was identified.
   Based in the results of laboratory batch adsorption studies phosmet exhibited low mobility being considered immobile in one of the four soils tested. In a BBA guideline lysimeter study carried out in Switzerland that covers the applied for representative uses if applications are made in July, there was no leaching of radioactivity (excluding CO2) in collected leachate samples > 0.06 mu g/L, confirming the results of FOCUS scenario groundwater modelling for parent phosmet and indicating leaching of the soil metabolites that are formed at low levels is unlikely to be significant. All this information indicates, that for the applied for intended uses, the potential for groundwater exposure above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is negligible.
   In laboratory (20 degrees C) natural sediment water systems phosmet both dissipated rapidly by partitioning to sediment and degraded rapidly, resulting in it exhibiting very low persistence. The major (> 10% AR) metabolites identified were: phthalamic acid phthalic acid and N-hydroxymethyl phthalimide. Based on the available sterile hydrolysis studies and laboratory aqueous photolysis study O, O-dimethylphosphorodithioc acid and O, O-dimethylphosphoric acid may also be formed as major metabolites in natural surface waters. In sediment the only major component of the residue in addition to phosmet was phthalamic acid. All these identified breakdown products were themselves relatively labile. CO2 from the carbonyl radiolabel used in the natural sediment water studies was the major sink for the applied radioactivity (accounting for 80-92% AR at 100 days). FOCUS step 2 to 4 surface water assessments have been completed for parent phosmet (with step 4 just considering spray drift mitigation) but only southern European scenarios and then only early season application timings were simulated. As the applied for representative southern European uses assessed are not restricted to applications only being made later in the growing season, if phosmet is included in annex 1, then southern member states where later season uses are applied for, should carry out national assessments of the potential for surface water exposure and associated aquatic risk assessments from the drainage and runoff routes of entry to surface water, as it is not clear that the available EU level assessment covers these situations. Also the current assessment identifies that for the early season application southern European scenarios assessed, only 1 scenario for each crop (D6 potatoes, R4 citrus and pome fruit), represented a low risk to aquatic organisms without mitigation to reduce runoff input to surface water being considered. For all other geoclimatic situations assessed high risk was identified when only the spray drift risk was mitigated.
   A high acute risk to insectivorous birds was identified for all evaluated uses and also for herbivorous birds in potatoes. The initially identified high long-term risk to birds for all evaluated uses was reassessed based on measured residues in insects and grass. The refined long-term TER values for birds are above the Annex VI trigger. For a generic herbivorous mammal a potential high long-term risk was identified for all uses. The refined assessment based on selected focal mammalian species needs to be further justified.
   Phosmet is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Since data on acute toxicity to seven fish species are available the safety factor was lowered from 100 to 20. Risk mitigation measures to reduce spray drift input corresponding to 40 m in orchards and 20 m in potatoes are needed in order to meet this trigger for one FOCUS scenario in each crop. Based on data from an available mesocosm study, the same buffer zones will also be sufficient to protect aquatic invertebrates in southern Europe in case of early application for one FOCUS scenario in each crop. The risk assessment for the aquatic environment needs to be complemented with scenarios for later in the season, when drainage and runoff routes of entry are likely to contribute to the concentration in surface water from the assessed uses in southern Europe. Phosmet is very toxic to bees. The high risk needs to be managed at Member State level. Application should be avoided when there are likely to be any bees in the crop and a withholding period needs to be established. The risk to non-target arthropods is high. A potential for in-field recolonisation has been demonstrated, however further data is required to address the impact off-field and the potential for recolonisation from off-field areas.
   The risk to earthworms, other non-target soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.

AB  - Ethoprophos is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on ethoprophos in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 19 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 18 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Bayer CropScience (the original notification was made by Aventis CropScience which merged with Bayer AG in 2002 to form Bayer CropScience).. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 8 November 2004. Remaining issues, as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide and nematicide, as proposed by the applicant. This comprises direct overall or band/row application followed by soil incorporation to control a broad spectrum of insects and nematodes in potatoes at application rate up 11 kg ethoprophos per hectare. Ethoprophos can be used as insecticide and nematicide.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Mocap 10G" ("AE F034142 00 FG10 A1" or "EXP05806A"), a granule formulation (GR), registered in the South and the North of the EU. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, i.e. ethoprophos in food of plant origin (potatoes, only) in soil, water and air.
   A validated analytical method for the determination of ethoprophos in blood and animal tissues is also available.
   Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Ethoprophos has a high acute toxicity and is a skin sensitizer. The proposal for classification is T+, R26/27 "Very toxic by inhalation and in contact with skin"; T, R25 "Toxic if swallowed"; Xi, R43 "May cause sensitisation by skin contact".
   The most sensitive endpoint during short term exposure was cholinesterase inhibition in all species. Considering available evidence, there is no genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. The classification Xn, R48/22 "Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed", based on the high mortality in the first weeks of the long term rat study, is proposed. There is no evidence of reproductive toxicity, and ethoprophos was not shown to be teratogenic. Delayed neurotoxicity in acute studies with hens has not been demonstrated.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) 0.01 mg/kg bw/day. All reference values were set using a safety factor of 100. The agreed dermal absorption value of 10% represents a worst case assumption.
   The measurements of operator exposure in a field study are above the AOEL, even assuming the use of personal protective equipment and respiratory protective equipment. Only the use of Surefill containers might reduce the extent of exposure below the AOEL. Based on an air monitoring study, worker and bystander exposure are clearly below the AOEL.
   The metabolism of ethoprophos in plants after soil application has been investigated in potatoes, cabbage and sweet corn. The degradation involves the hydrolysis of the S-propyl and O-ethyl ester links and further degradation to compounds later integrated in the structure of natural plant components. The major metabolite observed in plants is ethyl phosphate. This compound has no toxicological relevance. Other compounds were identified at lower levels: EPPA (O-ethyl-S-propylphosphorothioate), OME (O-ethyl-O-methyl-S-propyl-phosphorothioate) and SME (O-Ethyl-Smethyl- S-propyl-phosphorothioate). These metabolites have a level of toxicity similar to that of ethoprophos. In rotational crops metabolism data suggest a similar degradation pathway. A residue definition for risk assessment is proposed as the sum of ethoprophos, EPPA, OME and SME expressed as ethoprophos. This definition is proposed taking the available information on all crops into consideration because the data on potato tubers are not conclusive enough for a reliable residue definition for that crop. The residue definition for monitoring purposes is ethoprophos only.
   Supervised residue trials on potatoes were conducted in accordance with the representative uses supported by the notifier. They lead to a proposal for a MRL of 0.02 mg/kg for potatoes, covering potatoes harvested in an early stage of their growth to be specifically marketed as small size potatoes. These trials were carried out with analysis of ethoprophos only and therefore are not appropriate to be used for risk assessment for the health of the consumer. Additional supervised residue trials in potatoes are necessary with analysis of residues according to the residue definition for risk assessment. Such studies are currently ongoing and a first set of results has already been submitted to the RMS. Before finalising acute and chronic risk assessments, further information on the nature of extractable residues in rotational crops and, depending on that information, field trials on rotational crops are also necessary.
   Due to the very low exposure of livestock to residues of ethoprophos, residues in animal commodities are expected to be extremely low and do not need to be monitored and taken into consideration for assessment of the risk for the health of the consumer.
   The route of degradation in soil of ethoprophos was studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using ethyl-or propyl-labelled compound. Ethoprophos was degraded to the minor metabolite Oethyl- S-propylphosphorothioic acid (AE 0592496) with final degradation products CO2 and unextracted residues. The route of degradation of ethoprophos under anaerobic conditions was comparable to that under aerobic conditions. The rate of degradation under laboratory conditions indicate that ethoprophos is moderately to highly persistent in soil. There is some indication (1 laboratory and two field soils) that at the low end of the soil pH range (pH 5.3 and 4.5) ethoprophos may degrade more slowly. Adsorption studies have shown that ethoprophos has very high to medium potential for mobility in soil. These data combined with groundwater modelling, indicate under European conditions there is generally a negligible risk that ethoprophos will reach ground water when applied in accordance with usual Good Agricultural Practice for potatoes, except when grown in vulnerable scenarios (i. e. FOCUS groundwater scenarios of Piacenza and Hamburg). Chemical hydrolysis and photodegradation are not considered to be relevant degradation pathways under natural environmental conditions. The metabolic pattern in water/sediment system under aerobic conditions was similar to that observed in soil. In sediment with high organic carbon content, up to 44% of ethoprophos partitioning to sediment can be observed. Estimated concentrations of ethoprophos in surface water, arising from sub surface flow, indicate that except in very vulnerable situations, there is no cause for concern. Concentrations of ethoprophos in the air compartment will be negligible, due to the method of application (soil incorporation) and short persistence in the atmosphere. There were no major metabolites identified in any of the fate and behaviour studies.
   The consumption of contaminated soil organisms (earthworms) and systemic residues in volunteer plants growing in potato fields were assumed as the main routes of exposure for birds and mammals. Uptake of granules as grit was identified to be a main route of exposure for birds. The acute risk, short-term risk and long term-risk to small granivorous birds from intentional uptake of granules is high. Further risk refinement steps and risk mitigation measures to ensure high incorporation efficiency are required. The refined acute risk assessment for herbivorous birds is low but needs Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, i. e. ethoprophos in food of plant origin (potatoes, only) in soil, water and air.

Further risk refinement steps and risk mitigation measures to ensure high incorporation efficiency are required. The refined acute risk assessment for herbivorous birds is low but needs further support by data. The short term risk and the long-term risk to herbivorous birds were considered to be low. A high acute, short-term and long-term risk to earthworm eating birds was indicated and further data are required to support the suggested risk refinement steps. The acute and long-term risk to herbivorous mammals such as the hare was assessed as low. The long-term risk to earthworm eating mammals is high. Further risk refinement steps are required. The chronic risk to aquatic invertebrates and the potential risk of bioaccumulation is high under vulnerable conditions where contamination of surface water arises. The study with Chironomus riparius needs to be evaluated in order to draw a final conclusion on the risk to sediment dwelling organisms. A potential risk of bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms was identified if contamination of aquatic habitats arises. For conditions where contamination of surface water arises the risk of biomagnification in aquatic food chains and the risk of secondary poisoning of fish eating birds and mammals needs to be addressed. Severe acute and sublethal effects were observed in tests with non-target arthropods and a high risk was indicated. The higher tier risk assessment for non-target arthropods was discussed in the EPCO expert meeting. It was concluded that the potential of recovery was sufficiently demonstrated taking into account that the field margins remain unaffected and thus providing a reservoir for recolonisation. A high acute and long-term risk was indicated for earthworms in the first tier risk assessment. In a field study severe acute effects were observed. However the effects full recovery was observed within 5 months after the application and it is concluded that the risk to earthworms is sufficiently addressed. The risk to bees, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target flora and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.

AB  - Fenitrothion is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenitrothion in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 4 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 24 November 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Sumitomo Chemical Agro Europe S.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in July 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January - March 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying in tomato and grapevine at application rates up to 750 g per hectare. Fenitrothion can be used only as insecticide.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "IPM 400", a capsule suspension concentrate (CS), registered under different trade names in southern Member States of the EU.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of fenitrothion.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Fenitrothion (FNT) is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. It is mainly distributed to the liver, blood and carcass. Elimination is very rapid. The main metabolites are the phosphate fenitrothion (FNO), the mono methyl analogues of FNT and FNO (DM-FNT and DM-FNO respectively) and 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol (NMC) and its corresponding sulphate and glucuronide.
   The oral LD50 is 330-1700 mg/kg bw.The dermal LD50 is 890 mg/kg bw, therefore the classification R21 (Harmful in contact with the skin), is proposed. FNT acute inhalatory toxicity is low. FNT is not a skin or an eye irritant in rabbits, but it is a skin sensitiser. Therefore, the classification R43 (May cause sensitisation in contact with the skin), is proposed.
   The critical effect is decreased erythrocyte and brain cholinesterase. The relevant short term toxicity NOAEL is 1.32 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day study in rats. No evidence of delayed neurotoxicity was found in hens following acute and subacute exposures.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) are 0.013 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor (SF) of 100. The estimated operator exposure in grapes exceeds the AOEL, as well as re-entry exposure estimates for workers not wearing PPE. In outdoor tomatoes: the estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL only for field crop spraying with the use of PPE; re-entry exposure estimates for workers not wearing PPE exceed the AOEL. A biomonitoring study in greenhouse tomatoes not fully representative of the intended uses showed exposure below the AOEL (maximum 25%). The exposure to harvesters without PPE would be acceptable. Exposure estimates for general re-entry activities exceed the AOEL for workers not wearing PPE.
   Metabolism studies of fenitrothion in tomatoes and grapes indicate that the major metabolic pathway proceeds through the hydrolysis of the compound leading to 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol and dimethylphosphorothioic acid. 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol is further conjugated and has no anticholinesterase activity. Due to the labelling position, the fate of dimethylphosphorothioic acid was not further investigated. Another minor pathway consists in O-demethylation of fenitrothion leading to desmethylfenitrothion. The proposed residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment is fenitrothion only. However the possible contribution of desmethylfenitrothion and dimethylphosphorothioic acid to the toxicological burden is not known and should be investigated before the residue definition for risk assessment can be finalised.
   Sufficient supervised residue trials were submitted in accordance with the representative uses and supporting the establishment of MRLs at 3 and 0.1 mg/kg in grapes (table and wine grapes) and tomatoes respectively. The behaviour of residues through processing was investigated and it was shown that fenitrothion is degraded into desmethylfenitrothion under hydrolysis conditions. Low transfer factors of fenitrothion were calculated for the processing to grape juice, wine, tomato puree and tomato juice.
   Metabolism studies in livestock were submitted although not required as the representative uses do not imply animal exposure to residues of fenitrothion through feedingstuffs. These studies were not sufficient to build a complete picture of the nature of the residues to be expected in all animal commodities.
   Acute and chronic risk assessments have been carried out taking into account fenitrothion residues only. These assessments have demonstrated a potential for acute risk for the consumer resulting from the consumption of treated table grapes. For the other commodities, although the exposure to fenitrothion residues is below the trigger toxicological values, a robust conclusion is not possible at this stage, given the lack of information on the toxicological relevance and the actual levels in commodities of desmethylfenitrothion and dimethylphosphorothioic acid.
   In soil under dark aerobic conditions fenitrothion yields the major metabolite NMC. Substantial formation of unextractable residues and mineralization was observed. Under dark anaerobic conditions AM-FNT and AA-FNT were found to be the major metabolites.
   Photolysis in soil is unlikely to contribute to the environmental degradation of fenitrothion.
   Fenitrothion is low persistent in soil under aerobic conditions when applied directly or formulated as and emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Half life is significantly longer for the encapsulated formulation proposed for the representative uses (CS: DT (50 lab CS) = 82.3 d). Additional laboratory and field dissipation studies with the CS formulation were required and have been presented but have not been evaluated by the RMS. The experts' meeting agreed to propose a restriction to use only in green houses until the data requirements for the CS formulation are fulfilled.
   The major metabolite NMC is low persistent in soil under aerobic conditions (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 2.8 -3.3 d).
   PECs in soil presented in the DAR can not be regarded as worst case. Therefore, risk assessment for the EU representative uses may not be considered concluded and reassessment will be necessary once the data requirement for further soil studies with the CS formulation is fulfilled.
   Fenitrothion is medium mobile (K-oc = 252- 384 mL / g) and NMC is medium mobile (K-foc = 270-303 mL / g) in soil. Fenitrothion shows a slow hydrolytic degradation. The release rate of the CS formulation was investigated in sterile aqueous buffer solutions. It is reasonable to expect that the further soil studies already required for the CS formulation will provide additional information on the release rate of fenitrothion in soil.
   Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of fenitrothion in water. However, this contribution is deemed to be low for the fenitrothion applied as an encapsulated formulation. Fenitrothion is not readily biodegradable in water.
   In water-sediment systems fenitrothion (pure active substance) dissipated rapidly from the water phase. NMC, AM-FNT, Unk 2 (tentatively identified as DM-AM-FNT), Unk 6 (tentatively identified as A-NMC and considered an analytical artefact of NMC) were the major metabolites in the water phase. In the sediment phase only NMC was measured at levels above 10 % of AR. All metabolites declined to very low levels until the end of the study. Most of the applied radioactivity accumulated in the NER fraction of the sediment that undergoes slow further mineralization with CO2 release. An aerobic water-sediment study compares the degradation of fenitrothion applied as the CS formulation with an EC formulation. When applied as CS formulation the capsules tend to settle in the sediment phase. The DT50 for the CS formulated fenitrothion was beyond the duration of the study and estimated to be 84 97 days for the whole system.
   The PECSW and PECSED were calculated for the field uses with spray drift as the only entry route into surface water. PECSW values were also provided for the metabolites AM-FNT, DM-AM-FNT and NMC. These PECSW/SED may need to be revised on basis of new information on the release rate. The applicant submitted PECSW / PECSED calculation for the use in glasshouses based on the Netherlands scheme. However, this calculation was not evaluated by the RMS which proposed a non exposure situation for this use. Experts' meeting concluded that potential surface water contamination arising from glasshouse representative use needs to be assessed taking also into account the high potential risk to aquatic organisms and the potential for volatilization (see chapter 5.2.). However, the difficulties to perform this risk assessment at this stage, due to the lack of EU agreed procedure, were recognized by the meeting.
   On basis of the FOCUS ground water calculations, concentrations of fenitrothion and the metabolite NMC were not expected to exceed 0.1 mu g / L in ground water, irrespective to the release rate from the capsules (DT50 release = 0 - 250 d were simulated).
   According the Henry Law constant there is some potential for volatilization of fenitrothion. The use as a microencapsulated formulation will reduce this potential for volatilization. Furthermore, half life in air was calculated to be 6 h indicating that long range transport is not likely.
   The acute, short-term and the long-term risk to birds and the long term risk to mammals from uptake of contaminated food items was assessed as high from the representative outdoor uses (tomato and grapevine). Consequently further risk refinement steps are necessary to address the risk to birds and mammals. A high long term risk to birds and mammals was identified from the uptake of contaminated earthworms. The applicant submitted new information on the risk to birds and mammals from fenitrothion residues in earthworms and further information to address the risk of secondary poisoning from consumption of contaminated fish and a statement on the risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water. This new information was not evaluated by the RMS.
   Daphnia magna was the most sensitive tested aquatic species. A high acute and chronic risk from the representative outdoor uses was identified. The relevant acute Annex VI TER trigger values are exceeded only if buffer zones of 200 m (tomato) and 175 m (grapevine) are taken into account. However, even with buffer zones as large as 250 m the chronic TER values are still below the Annex VI trigger value of 10. The applicant submitted a risk assessment based on the Netherlands scheme for calculating emissions from greenhouses. This risk assessment was not evaluated by the RMS. Instead a no exposure situation was proposed. The Experts' meeting agreed that PECsw water calculations for the greenhouse use are needed. A final conclusion on the risk to aquatic organisms from the representative use in greenhouses cannot be drawn. However, taking into account the very high toxicity to daphnids, a high risk to aquatic organisms from the greenhouse use cannot be excluded if exposure of aquatic organisms from greenhouse use is possible. The acute risk of the major metabolites in the water-sediment system, NMC and AM-FNT were assessed as low. Testing with the metabolite DM-AM-FNT was considered as not necessary because it is very unstable and the precursor AM-FNT is three orders of magnitude less toxic than fenitrothion. A mesocosm study was submitted by the applicant prior to the Experts' meeting to refine the risk to aquatic invertebrates. The mesocosm study was not evaluated by the RMS because it was considered as not relevant by the RMS for the greenhouse use.
   A high risk to bees was shown from oral and contact exposure to fenitrothion (technical) and for contact toxicity of the formulation IPM 400 CS. Higher tier studies with bees were available. However, the studies were conducted for other uses than the representative uses. It was not clear whether the available studies address the risk from the representative uses in tomato and grapevine. Therefore a high risk to bees from the representative outdoor uses cannot be excluded. Risk mitigation measures like labelling were suggested by the RMS. It was agreed at the EPCO Experts` meeting that risk mitigation measures for pollinating insects have to be set at MS level for the representative use in greenhouses.
   Higher tier tests were conducted to address the risk to non-target arthropods. Freshly dried residues of an application of IPM 400 at a dose rate similar to the GAP led to significant mortality in the tested non-target arthropods. Aphidius rhopalosiphi was the most sensitive species. No significant effects on mortality or fecundity of A. rhopalosiphi were observed in tests with 42 d aged residues showing the potential of recolonisation. An elaborated risk assessment for the off-field risk from the representative outdoor uses (tomato and grapevine) to non-target arthropods is considered necessary. A final conclusion on the risk to non-target arthropods from the outdoor use can be drawn when the off-field risk assessment is made available. Because of the high toxicity to non-target arthropods the meeting proposed a labelling for the greenhouse use to protect species which are used for biological pest control.
   The acute risk to earthworms was assessed to be low but the long-term risk to earthworms was assessed as high. Further information to address the long-term risk to earthworms was submitted by the applicant in September 2004 but not evaluated by the RMS. The chronic risk from the soil metabolite NMC posed to earthworms is considered to be low.
   No information was available on the toxicity of fenitrothion to other soil non-target organisms. Fenitrothion is formulated as a slow release micro-capsule and the DT90lab for the formulation was estimated to be 283 days. A high long term risk was observed for earthworms and for non-target arthropods in the higher tier studies. Therefore a data requirement was set by the RMS to address the risk to other soil non-target macro-organisms. Further information to address the risk to soil non-target macro-organisms was submitted by the applicant in September 2004 but was not evaluated by the RMS. The risk from fenitrothion from the representative uses to soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed to be low. Further information submitted by the applicant to address the risk of the soil metabolite NMC was not evaluated by the RMS. Therefore a final conclusion on the risk of the soil metabolite NMC to soil non-target micro-organisms cannot be drawn.
   The risk of fenitrothion to other non-target organisms (flora) and biological methods of biological sewage treatment is considered to be low.
   Further data/information to address the risk from the outdoor uses to birds and mammals, aquatic organisms, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms was submitted prior to the EPCO Experts' meeting. This data/information was not evaluated by the RMS and no further risk assessment was conducted. As far as the risk from the representative outdoor uses was assessed (not taking into account the new information/data and further risk refinement steps) it is preliminary concluded that the outdoor uses pose a high risk to birds and mammals, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms and soil-non target micro-organisms. The risk from the greenhouse use (provided it is a permanent construction and no natural soil is used) posed to birds and mammals, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms and soil non-target micro-organisms is considered to be low. Risk mitigation measures are suggested for the greenhouse use for pollinating insects, non-target arthropods (species used in biological pest control). A risk assessment for aquatic organisms should be conducted for the representative use in greenhouses at Member State level.

AB  - Pyrimethanil is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Austria being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on pyrimethanil in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 15 April 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 18 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 8 November 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control Botrytis cinerea in grape (wine), Venturia inaequalis in apples and Botrytis spp. in protein peas, respectively. The application rates are up to 1 kg pyrimethanil per hectare in grape (wine)(3) and up to 600 g per hectare in apples and protein peas. Pyrimethanil can be used only as fungicide.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Scala" ("CQ 1294", "EXP 10588A"), a suspension concentrate (SC), registered in most of the EU Member States.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of pyrimethanil.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Pyrimethanil is rapidly orally absorbed (70 - 80 %), and also quickly excreted. There is no potential for bioaccumulation. The metabolic degradation of pyrimethanil in rats occurs primarily via oxidation on one or both rings of the molecule and subsequent conjugation. Pyrimethanil has a low acute toxicity and is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a skin sensitizer. In short term toxicity studies in rats and mice, main target organs were liver (increased weight, histopathological changes) and thyroid (histopathological changes). In dogs, a dose-related marked decrease in water intake was observed. The relevant oral no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for short term toxicity is 5.4 mg/kg bw/day (90-days rat study). There is no evidence from the available studies of a mutagenic, genotoxic or carcinogenic potential of pyrimethanil. The relevant oral NOAEL for long term toxicity is 17.3 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study. Pyrimethanil did not show any adverse effects on reproduction parameters. Pyrimethanil is not teratogenic. No signs of neurotoxicity were observed in any test. Supplementary studies were conducted with the soil metabolite AE F132593. The metabolite was of moderate acute oral toxicity and was found of no genotoxic potential and it can be considered of no toxicological relevance. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that enhanced hepatic metabolism induced by pyrimethanil resulted in an increased thyroid hormone clearance resulting in a chronic stimulation of the thyroid.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.17 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL from the 2-year rat study with a safety factor of 100; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.12 mg/kg bw/day based on the overall NOAEL of 17.4 mg/kg bw/day from the collective results of the 90-day and the 104 week rat study. An additional correction factor was applied due to the limited enteral absorption rate of approx. 72%. From the evaluation of the available toxicological data base of pyrimethanil it was concluded that there is no need to establish an acute reference dos (ARfD). Based on the results of an in vitro study with human skin samples performed with a SC-formulation, a dermal absorption rate of pyrimethanil of 1% for the concentrate and 20% for the spray dilution was proposed for human risk assessment.
   According to UK POEM model as well as German BBA model the estimated operator exposure for most of the intended uses is below the AOEL only when appropriate PPE (gloves, coverall) is considered. The estimated worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL.
   The metabolism of pyrimethanil has been investigated in a large range of crops and it was shown that the parent compound is forming the major part of the residue even for PHI as long as 42 days. The metabolites identified do not cause any concern due to their nature and their amount. The residue definition in plant commodities can be limited to pyrimethanil for both monitoring and risk assessment. The supervised residue trials submitted are sufficient to propose the setting of MRLs at 1 and 3 mg/kg for apples and wine grapes respectively. Pyrimethanil is not degraded under processing conditions. The transfer factors to wine, apple juice and puree are below 1, indicating that the compound is preferably transferred to the non food processed fractions. Under field conditions the presence of residues of pyrimethanil and its metabolites in rotational crops is limited to low amounts below 0.05 mg/kg and do not represent a significant toxicological burden.
   In cattle pyrimethanil is extensively metabolised and 2 metabolites were identified as major (2-(4-hydroxyanilino)-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine and 2-anilino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-5-ol), but their presence at measurable levels under practical condition, taking into account the exposure of livestock through apple pomace and protein peas, can be excluded. Therefore no residue definition for animal commodities is needed.
   No dietary risk was identified due to residues resulting from the use of pyrimethanil according to the representative uses in apples, wine grapes and protein peas supported by the manufacturer.
   Pyrimethanil is moderate to medium persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions. The major transformation product was 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine. This metabolite is moderate to high persistent in soil. Mineralization after 90 -100 d was in the range of 4 - 7 % AR and the bounded residues reached levels between 42 - 62 % AR. The half lives used on the FOCUS ground water modelling were derived from a separated kinetic multicompartmental analysis with TopFit 2.0. Degradation is much slower under anaerobic conditions (DT50 > 300 d). Dissipation in field trials in Germany confirms that pyrimethanil is a moderate persistent substance in soil (DT50 field = 23 54 d).
   PEC soil were calculated for the representative uses based on worst case field half life (DT50 = 54 d). As metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine was not detected in field studies the PECmax in soil was estimated from the LOD (LOD <= 0.02 mg/kg).
   Pyrimethanil is low to high mobile in soil (K-oc = 75 751 mL / g) and 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine is medium to high mobile in soil (K-oc = 56 240 mL / g).
   A three years lysimeter study in Germany on two lysimeters with vines is available. No pyrimethanil was found in both lysimeters at any sampling date. Most of the radioactivity in the leachate was found as not extractable from the water phase.
   Pyrimethanil is hydrolytically stable in sterile buffer solutions at environmental relevant pH and temperature. Direct photolysis does not contribute to the environmental degradation of pyrimethanil in water. Pyrimethanil is not ready biodegradable.
   Degradation of pyrimethanil in dark aerobic water environment at 20 degrees C was investigated in two water sediment systems. Dissipation of pyrimethanil from the water phase took place with half lives of 8.9 and 24 d, mainly due to adsorption to the sediment. Degradation in the whole system proceeds slowly (DT50 whole system = 40 121 d or DT50 whole system = 29 114 d with TopFit multicompartmental kinetic evaluation) with the formation of 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine (max 10.4 % AR after 100 d in the whole system) and the formation of non extractable sediment residues (max 27.3 47.7 % AR). Mineralization was low to moderate (CO2 = 2.4 9.1 % AR).
   PECSW and PECSED were calculated using the Top Fit derived kinetic constants assuming the application pattern proposed in the table of GAP for the representative uses but only including the spray drift route of entry to surface water. Worst case parameters were selected in the calculation. Peak concentration reached after repeated applications were taken as initial PECSW / PECSED for the risk assessment. Member States should assess the potential for soil residues to reach surface water as a result of the drainage and runoff.
   Potential for ground water contamination was assessed for pyrimethanil and metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine based on FOCUS PELMO 1.1.1. The trigger of 0.1 mu g/L was not exceeded for any of the nine scenarios neither by pyrimethanil nor by the metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine.
   Significant volatilization from leave surface (27 %) and soil surface (10 %) was observed in the study provided. However, the potential for photochemical degradation of pyrimethanil in air is high (DT50 air Atkinson = 1.8 h), indicating very low potential for long transport in air.
   The acute and short term risk to birds can be regarded as low for all the representative uses evaluated. Also the long term risk to birds for the representative uses in apples and protein peas and the long term risk to large herbivorous birds in grapes can be regarded as low. The long term risk to insectivorous birds in grapes is high in the first tier risk assessment but based on a weight of evidence approach the EPCO experts' meeting considered the long term risk to insectivorous birds in grapes addressed. The acute risk to mammals is considered to be low but a potential high long term risk to mammals was identified in the first tier risk assessment for all representative uses evaluated. After refinement of these assessments, the long term risk to mammals can be regarded as low for all representative uses evaluated. The EPCO experts' meeting agreed to refine the long term risk to mammals for the use in apples for Annex I inclusion based on the diet composition data for voles as no such data for the most appropriate focal species wood mouse was available. Particular attention should be paid at MS level on the choice of focal species to refine the long term risk to mammals in orchards.
   The risk to aquatic organisms is driven by the chronic risk to fish. The EPCO experts' meeting did not accept the available fish ELS study and set a data gap for a new fish ELS study and in addition considered an argumentation for the use of the PECtwa-value necessary. Based on the next most pivotal endpoint the risk to aquatic organisms for the representative use in protein peas and vines can be considered as low without the need for risk mitigation measures. For the representative uses in apple orchards the risk can be regarded as low if risk mitigation measures such as a 10 meter buffer zone are taken into account. The EFSA would like to point out that the risk to aquatic organisms can only be concluded once the new fish ELS study becomes available and that most likely more risk mitigation measures will be needed once this study becomes available.
   The risk for bioconcentration in fish from the metabolite AE F132593 cannot be concluded as the LogPow is not known. Therefore the EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to make the LogPow of AE F132593 available.
   The risk to bees and non-target arthropods can be regarded as low.
   The acute risk to earthworms can be regarded as low. Also the long term risk to earthworms for the uses in protein peas and grapes can be regarded as low but a high long term risk to earthworms from the use in apple orchards was identified. The refinement of this risk was not accepted by the EPCO expert's meeting and therefore the meeting set a further data gap for an additional long term toxicity study to earthworms with the lead formulation Scala with more doses and lower organic material. Furthermore a long term study on earthworms with the soil metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine is requested. No adverse effects on organic matter breakdown are expected from pyrimethanil from the representative uses evaluated.
   The risk to soil non-target micro-organisms from the lead formulation Scala is considered to be low, but a study on soil micro-organisms with the metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine is still required.
   The risk from pyrimethanil on non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low for all representative uses evaluated.

AB  - Triclopyr is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000', as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Ireland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triclopyr in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 21 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 January 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in July 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January March 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 29 September 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying or spot treatment to control a wide spectrum of broad-leaved weeds in pasture, forestry, grassland, railways and set -a -side at application rate up 1.44 kg triclopyr per hectare. Triclopyr can be used only as herbicide.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Garlon 4" ("XRM-4714"), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe.
   Due to the fact that the butoxyethyl ester (BEE, also refer to butotyl ester), a variant of triclopyr, is used in the formulated product, it should be noted that the evaluated data belong to the variant triclopyr-butoxyethyl ester, unless otherwise specified.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for soil and ground water. For food of animal origin not method is available, for air a method for the determination of residues of the butoxyethyl ester is missing. Whether or not sufficient methods are available for surface water depends on the final residue definition. The methodology used is GC with MS or EC detection. A multi -residue method like the Dutch MM1 or the German S19 is not applicable to due the nature of the residues. No analytical method for the determination of triclopyr alone is available, other analytes will always be determined in parallel. Triclopyr and the ester have shown to be pharmacologically equivalent.
   Triclopyr is rapidly and extensively absorbed; it is mainly excreted as unchanged in urine (>80%). Only 1-2% of the administered dose is metabolised, to produce 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol in urine. Four minor metabolites were found in rats: 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, glucuronide and sulphate conjugates of pyridinol and triclopyr conjugates. Both triclopyr and BEE are characterised by a moderate acute oral toxicity, they are not acutely toxic via dermal route, the acute inhalation toxicity of BEE is low, while data on triclopyr are not available. Both triclopyr and BEE are not skin irritant; the acid shows irritating potential to the eyes. Both of them are skin sensitiser at the modified Buehler test. Therefore, the following classification is proposed: Xn, R22 (harmful if swallowed), Xi, R36 irritating to eyes, Xi, R43 may cause skin sensitisation by skin contact. The overall relevant NOAEL from short term toxicity studies is 5 mg/kg bw/day. Neither triclopyr nor its ester have shown genotoxic potential in a battery of in vitro and in vivo test. The relevant NOAEL for long term studies is 3 mg/kg bw/day. Triclopyr did not show any carcinogenic potential. The lowest parental NOAEL was 5 mg/kg bw/day, while the reproductive NOAEL was 25 mg/kg bw/day, based on a reduction in mating indices and an increase in time to mating at 250 mg/kg bw/day in rats. The relevant developmental NOAELs were: rats: ester = 100 mg/kg bw/day (LOAEL 300 mg/kg bw/day); acid = 100 mg/kg bw/day (LOAEL 200 mg/kg bw/day); rabbits: NOAEL ester = 30 mg/kg bw/day (LOAEL = 100 mg/kg bw/day), developmental NOAEL acid = 75 mg/kg bw/day (highest dose tested). In the rats, retarded ossification of skull bones was observed at 200 mg/kg bw/day and an increased incidence of malformations and skeletal anomalies at 300 mg/kg bw/day. Therefore, Cat 3 R63 was agreed by the experts. The developmental toxic effects in pups in the multigeneration studies are already covered by this classification. Triclopyr did not give any indication of neurotoxic potential. TCP oral LD50 is 794 mg/kg bw in rats, 380 in mice, >1000 mg/kg bw in dogs; short term relevant NOAEL is 12 mg/kg bw/day. TCP did not show any genotoxic potential. In the rabbit the maternal NOAEL is 100 mg/kg bw/day and the developmental NOAEL is 25 mg/kg bw/day based on dose dependent increases in the incidence of foetal and litter CNS malformations at 100 and 250 mg/kg bw/day if compared to controls and historical control incidences. In the rat study the maternal NOAEL was 50 mg/kg bw/day, while the developmental NOAEL is 150 mg/kg bw/day representing the highest dose tested.
   The ADI of triclopyr is 0.03 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2 -year oral study in rats with a SF 100.
   The AOEL is 0.05 mg/kg bw/day based on the 13 -week oral study in rats with a SF 100 An ARfD of 0.3 mg/kg bw/day was set by the experts based on the developmental toxicity study in rabbit, with a NOAEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day and applying a SF 100.
   Estimated exposure is above the AOEL both with the German and UK POEM models if no PPE is worn. The AOEL is not exceeded with the German model once appropriate PPE is worn (gloves during mixing/loading, gloves, coveralls and sturdy footwear during application), either for use with boom sprayer or the knapsack application.
   AOEL is not exceeded both for re-entry workers (< 3.6%) and bystander (14.8%).
   The metabolism of triclopyr and its butoxyethyl ester in plants is adequately elucidated. Triclopyr is the major compound of the residue in vegetal tissues. This is confirmed by supervised residue trials in pasture indicating that the highest potential levels of triclopyr are in the range of 40 mg/kg, while its only identified metabolite, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, never exceeds 10 % of the triclopyr levels. Triclopyr, its conjugates and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol are considered as the only significant compounds in terms of toxicological burden present in plants that can be transferred to animals. In animal metabolism, triclopyr (major residue in milk) and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (major residue in bovine muscle, liver, fat and kidneys) were identified as compounds of toxicological relevance. 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol is not specific of trichlopyr and can be produced by animal metabolism from other pesticides. This situation makes the establishment of a residue definition quite complex for enforcement reasons. 3 options for residue definition were examined during the peer review process. The first was proposed by the RMS in the DAR and consisted only in triclopyr. This option was considered by the expert meeting (EPCO 19) not protective enough of the consumer because the toxicological burden of the metabolite was not covered and a proposal consisting in the sum of triclopyr, all metabolites containing the 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol moiety and their conjugates was submitted. This option was also difficult to apply in practice due to the non specificity of the metabolite. A third proposal consisting in dissociating triclopyr on one hand and 3,5,6-trichloro-2pyridinol on the other hand in 2 separate residue definitions was proposed by EFSA, to allow regulators to consider the potential contribution of other pesticides in setting MRLs for the metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol. This last option required the establishment of specific toxicological end points for this metabolite and tentative ADI and ARfD have been set based on the toxicological package submitted for 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol.
   The approaches for residue definition of the expert meeting (EPCO 19) and of the EFSA were further considered for proposing MRLs and conducting the risk assessment for the consumer. These 2 approaches resulted in MRLs proposals in animal commodities which are mainly influenced by the generally higher levels of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol in these matrices. The outcome of the risk assessment was also quite similar between the 2 approaches, demonstrating the absence of risk for the consumer. Sufficient data were available to demonstrate that in soil triclopyr butoxyethyl ester has very low persistence rapidly degrading to triclopyr which exhibits moderate persistence and subsequently degrades further to the major metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol which is also moderately persistent. Mineralization of the 2,6-14C radiolabel in the ring accounted for 8-66% of the applied radioactivity (AR) in dark aerobic laboratory studies after 100 days. The formation of unextracted residues in the soil organic carbon was another significant sink (accounting for 22-46% AR at 100 days). Triclopyr butoxyethyl ester is predicted to exhibit low mobility in soil (Quantitative structure activity relationship calculations, measurement not possible due to rapid degradation). In soil triclopyr exhibits very high to high mobility and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol high mobility.
   In natural surface water systems (dark laboratory studies) mineralization of the 2,6-14C radiolabel in the ring was minimal (maximum 1.6% of the applied radioactivity at 100 days), unextracted residues in the sediment organic carbon were a small sink (accounting for 8-13% AR at 100 days). The major contribution to the mass balance in these studies was the formation of metabolites. Triclopyr butoxyethyl ester exhibited very low persistence degrading (primarily in the water phase) to triclopyr (max 88-95%AR in water, 14-20%AR in sediment) which further degraded with moderate persistence to 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol which was also moderately persistent (max 5-19%AR in water, 14-23%AR in sediment). The major metabolites 3,6 -dichloro-2-pyridinol (max 8-38%AR in water, 15-26%AR in sediment) and 6 -chloro-2-pyridinol (max 13 %AR in water of only one of the two systems studied) were also identified. In aqueous photolysis experiments with natural water (no sediment present, with simulated summer sunlight conditions) the degradation of triclopyr and 3,6 dichloro-2-pyridinol was more rapid than in the dark experiments. In these experiments in the presence of light the only major breakdown product produced was oxamic acid (accounting for up to 16%AR).
   The environmental exposure assessments available are sufficient to complete appropriate EU level estimates of Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) for the intended uses on Pasture and non recreational amenity grassland. Assessments are absent for the other intended uses (forestry, railways and set aside). FOCUS groundwater modelling indicates a high potential for groundwater contamination in vulnerable situations over a wide range of geoclimatic conditions across the EU for triclopyr (with 8 out of 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios indicating annual average concentrations leaving the top lm soil layer >0.1m/1.). Modelling also indicates that the major soil metabolite 3,5,6trichloro-2-pyridinol may also contaminate groundwater but the range of vulnerable geoclimatic conditions where this might happen is less wide spread (2 out of 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios indicating annual average concentrations leaving the top lm soil layer >0.1[1g/L.). A lysimeter study indicates that when applications are made in the summer to acidic soils under vulnerable north western European conditions groundwater contamination >0.1 g/L (measure annual average leachate concentrations) for triclopyr and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol is unlikely. Further data would need to be assessed on the adsorption of triclopyr over a wide soil pH range to confirm whether adsorption of triclopyr is pH dependant or not, before it was possible to confirm if the lysimeter study results could be read across to a larger range of soil pH conditions. Even then the lysimeter study covers summer application conditions only. Whilst the available data indicate the intended use on grass may be carried out without contaminating vulnerable groundwater, the data also indicate there are a wide range of conditions across Europe under which any authorised use would have to be very strictly managed to safeguard groundwater from contamination with triclopyr above the parametric legal limit (0.1[Ig/L).
   Only a risk assessment for the representative use in pasture is presented in the section on ecotoxicology in the DAR and the addenda. EFSA considers that this risk assessment also covers the ecotoxicological risk assessment necessary for the representative use in non -recreational amenity grassland. No risk assessment is available for the representative uses in forestry, railways and set -aside.
   The risk to bees, soil micro-organisms and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low. The acute risk to herbivorous and insectivorous birds from exposure to triclopyr is considered to be low. Also the acute risk to herbivorous birds from exposure to triclopyr BEE is low. A high acute risk to insectivorous birds from exposure to triclopyr BEE was identified in the first tier risk assessment and the EPCO experts' meeting did not agree with the presented refined acute risk assessment. Therefore a data requirement was set for the notifier to submit a refined acute risk assessment for insectivorous birds. The short term risk to insectivorous and herbivorous birds from exposure to triclopyr and triclopyr BEE can be considered as low. The long term risk to insectivorous and herbivorous birds is high. Therefore EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to address this risk. The long term risk to birds was only identified by the RMS after revision of the risk assessment as requested by the EPCO experts' meeting and therefore this data requirement was not discussed in an EPCO Expert meeting. A low acute and short term risk to herbivorous and insectivorous birds and a low acute risk to herbivorous mammals from exposure to the metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol was identified.
   A high acute risk to mammals from exposure to triclopyr BEE and triclopyr was identified. The EPCO experts' meeting decided to set a data requirement for the notifier to submit data to support the assumptions, besides the residue data, used in the presented refined acute risk assessment for herbivorous mammals. It is noted by the EFSA that a second oral acute toxicity study with rats and the formulation Garlon 4 is available which leads to a lower endpoint than the endpoint which was taken into account in the DAR. If the endpoint of this study with the formulation Garlon 4 is expressed in triclopyr BEE equivalents the toxicity is higher than the toxicity from triclopyr BEE alone. Therefore EFSA proposes to take the LD50 of 900 mg Garlon 4/kg bw into account when refining the acute risk to herbivorous mammals (see data requirement above). Also a high long term risk to herbivorous mammals is identified. The RMS did not present a refined risk assessment in the addendum of June 2005 as requested by the EPCO experts' meeting but proposes a data requirement for the notifier to address this long term risk to mammals.
   A high risk to birds and mammals from consumption of contaminated drinking water was observed in the first tier risk assessment by EFSA (see addendum). Therefore EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to refine the risk to birds and mammals from exposure to contaminated drinking water. This assessment was neither discussed at the EPCO experts' meeting nor peer reviewed. A high acute risk to aquatic invertebrates was identified as the TER values (15-434) are below the Annex VI trigger value of 100 for 9 out of 11 FOCUS Step 3 scenario's. EFSA does not find it appropriate to refine a risk, which is based on a flow -through study with C. virginica, with a static study which was performed with D. magna. Therefore EFSA proposes that risk mitigation measures are taken into account at MS level to address the acute risk to aquatic invertebrates or a static study with C. virginica should be requested at MS -level.
   A low long term risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to triclopyr but a high long term risk to fish from exposure to triclopyr BEE was observed. The EPCO experts' meeting considered a long term risk assessment for triclopyr BEE necessary because of contamination of surface water by drainage. This was discussed internally in EFSA after the EPCO Expert meeting. EFSA considers that with the intended use of only 2 applications a year with a minimum 6 month interval and the fact that soil and water half lives of the ester are < 1 day, long term exposure to aquatic organisms from drainage to the ester will not occur at least for the notified representative uses. Therefore EFSA proposes that risk mitigation measures should be envisaged at MS level to address the long term risk to fish from exposure to triclopyr BEE if the local conditions are very sensitive to drainage or if local uses have shorter intervals than assessed in the DAR. Furthermore EFSA proposes that also risk mitigation measures are taken into account at MS level to address the long term risk to D. magna from exposure to 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol for the D2 ditch scenario. The acute risk to aquatic organisms from the metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol can be regarded as low.
   The EPCO experts' meeting set a further data requirement for the notifier to submit at least an algae study with this metabolite 3,6- dichloro-2-pyridinol or to submit the validation of the ECCOSAR model (used by the notifier to address the risk from this metabolite) or another suitable model for this substance class. Furthermore the metabolite 6-chloro-2-pyridinol was identified as a major metabolite by the section on Fate and behaviour. No studies with this metabolite are available. Therefore EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to address the risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to the metabolite 6-chloro-2-pyridinol. The need for this data was not discussed at an EPCO Expert meeting. The metabolite oxamic acid is considered to be not ecotoxicologically relevant by EFSA. The risk to Lemna gibba can be considered as low but the EPCO experts' meeting decided to set a data requirement for the notifier to submit the full study reports of all studies referred to in the DAR regarding dicotyledonous higher aquatic plants as it was questioned that Lemna gibba is an appropriate indicator plant. The risk to aquatic higher plants can only be concluded when this data becomes available.
   Based on the available studies the risk to non target arthropods is considered to be addressed. The risk to non -target plants can be considered as low if risk mitigation measures such as a bufferzone of 5 metres are taken into account.
   The acute risk to earthworms is considered to be low. The long term risk to earthworms from exposure to the metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol is also regarded to be low. The EPCO experts' meeting decided to set a data requirement for the notifier to submit an argumentation if the concentration of 9.6 acid equivalent per kg dry soil, at which the NOEC for earthworms was set, was reached during the study. The long term risk to earthworms can only be concluded once this argumentation becomes available. At the moment no final conclusion can be drawn regarding the need for a litter bag study with triclopyr due to the outstanding data requirement regarding the long term risk to earthworms. EFSA considers a collembolan reproduction study or a study on gamasid mites with triclopyr necessary given the effects seen on Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri in the standard laboratory toxicity studies. The need for this data was not discussed at an EPCO Expert meeting.
   As 3,5,6- trichloro-2-pyridinol is a major ground water metabolite, a study on the herbicidal activity of this metabolite is considered necessary by EFSA. The need for such a study was not discussed in an EPCO Expert meeting.

AB  - Cyprodinil is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on cyprodinil in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 16 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January -March 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 September 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control fungi from the classes Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes in winter wheat and apple at application rates of 750 g (wheat) and 225 g (apple) cyprodinil per hectare. Cyprodinil can be used only as fungicide. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were "UNIX 75 WG" and " CHORUS 50 WG", both water dispersible granules (WG), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, except for food of animal origin. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multimethod (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of cyprodinil. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Cyprodinil is absorbed to a high degree (> 80%) within 48 hours, based on rat excretion data. The acute oral and dermal toxicity is low as well as during inhalatory exposure. It is not a skin or an eye irritant but is a skin sensitizer (Magnusson and Kligman test). Classification for sensitization properties is needed and the proposed risk phrase is Xi; R43 "May cause sensitization by skin contact". Reduced body weight some minor changes in haematological and blood parameters were observed at the top dose during repeated exposure. There is no genotoxic, carcinogenic or neurotoxic potential for cyprodinil and no adverse effects were seen on reproduction parameters. None of the metabolites (3CGA 249287, 4CGA 275535, 5NOA 422054, 6CGA 321915, and 7CGA 232449) were of toxicological concern.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.03 mg/kg bw/day with a safety factor of 100 used and no acute reference dos (ARfD) was allocated due to the low acute toxicity of cyprodinil.
   The dermal absorption values are 0.5% for the concentrate and 6% for the dilution and the estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL for both UNIX and CHORUS without PPE according to the German model.
   The metabolic fate of cyprodinil in plants has been fully elucidated for the representative uses supported by the applicant. Based on the persistence of the product and the absence of metabolite of concern, the residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in plant commodities is limited to cyprodinil. Residue studies were conducted in apples and wheat, supporting the setting of MRLs at 0.05 and 0.02* mg/kg respectively (*indicates that the LMR is set at the limit of quantification of the method of analysis.). In succeeding crops, no residues are expected at measurable level under normal conditions of use of the product and normal cropping practices. In animals a major metabolite of cyprodinil (CGA 304075) was identified and should be included in the residue definition. Feeding studies were carried out without analysis of this metabolite, and it is therefore not possible to propose MRLs for animal commodities. However, despite this lacking information, a consumer risk assessment was carried out taking into account the residues in plant commodities only, indicating that the exposure of the consumer is far below the ADI of cyprodinil. Based on the metabolism data, the expected residue levels in animal commodities are expected to be very low and not of a nature to significantly influence the outcome of the intake calculations based on plant commodities only.
   The available data demonstrate that in soil cyprodinil degrades to the major (> 10% applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolites CGA 275535 and CGA 249287. The minor breakdown products 8CGA 304075, 9CGA 304076 and CGA 321915 were also identified. Mineralization of the phenyl and pyrimidyl rings accounted for only 6-14% AR and 0.3-11% AR respectively after 90-112 days incubation at 20-25 degrees C. The corresponding values for residues not extracted by acetonitrile including Soxhlet extraction were 36.8 -61.2 % AR and 10.6 -68.3 % AR. In most studies Cyprodinil exhibited moderate persistence in soil with the major metabolites CGA 275535 and CGA 249287 exhibiting very low persistence and moderate to high persistence respectively.
   In field studies this pattern of soil persistence was confirmed with there being evidence that the analysed extractable breakdown products (CGA 275535, CGA 249287 and CGA 321915) declined in concentration after their maximum measured concentrations. However it was observed in the 1 laboratory experiment with a more acidic soil (pH 5.2) and in a very acidic (pH 4.9) soil in 1 German field experiment, that cyprodinil exhibited very high persistence. Cyprodinil could therefore be more persistent in very acid soils (around pH 5 and below), though the available database (2 acidic soil experiments) is too small to confirm this hypothesis. Member States which have significant areas of acidic soils in arable or horticultural production should request additional information to confirm if this is a real correlation and if it is confirmed, further information to address the consequences of higher persistence in acidic soils.
   In guideline batch soil adsorption studies cyprodinil and CGA 275535 exhibited low mobility. CGA 249287 exhibited medium to low mobility in soil, with adsorption of CGA 249287 appearing to be pH dependent (lowest adsorption at highest soil pH).
   In sediment water systems cyprodinil dissipated from water relatively rapidly, partitioning to sediment where it exhibited high persistence. It did degrade to the metabolite CGA 249287 which was a major sediment but minor water metabolite. This metabolite exhibited moderate persistence. The major sink in the mass balance was the formation of residues not extracted by acetonitrile: water Soxhlet extraction. Mineralization of the pyrimidyl ring to CO2 was low < 5% AR after 260 days. This value for the phenyl ring was slightly higher at up to 11% AR.
   The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for assessing the spray drift route of entry to surface water for the representative uses applied for, for annex 1 listing. The drainage and runoff routes of entry have not been assessed. These routes of entry should be taken into account by MS when these routes of entry to surface water are relevant and the pertinent risk assessment to aquatic organisms should be completed.
   The available FOCUS groundwater modelling indicates that the potential for groundwater contamination as a consequence of the representative uses applied for, for annex 1 listing for cyprodinil and its major soil metabolites CGA 249287 and CGA 275535 is minimal when soil pH is above 5. This assessment appropriately covered the observed lower soil adsorption of CGA 249287 at higher soil pH. As there is evidence cyprodinil might be more persistent in very acidic soils, MS that have significant areas of such soils associated with pertinent plant production and vulnerable groundwater leaching situations should require applicants to provide groundwater exposure assessments to cover this situation.
   A high long term risk was identified for insectivorous birds for the representative use in cereals (application to late growth stages). The EPCO experts' meeting agreed that a risk assessment for early growth stages in cereals should be conducted since it is not fully justified that growth stage BBCH 32 of wheat can be regarded as a late growth stage. The RMS presented a risk assessment for early growth stages in addendum 2. The TER values for the long term risk to insectivorous birds, herbivorous birds and herbivorous mammals were 2.8, 4.8 and 1.7, respectively, indicating a high risk to birds and mammals from the intended use in wheat if the product is applied to early growth stages. A refined long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds and a refined long-term risk assessment for herbivorous mammals was provided by the notifier and summarized in addendum 3. Addendum 2 and addendum 3 are not peer reviewed. The RMS considers the risk to herbivorous birds as low since the first tier TER value of 4.8 is close to the trigger of 5 and based on the NOEC from the highest tested dose in a reproduction study. However, it should be taken into account that the argumentation provided in addendum 2 is not peer reviewed.
   A high risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated drinking water was shown in a first tier risk assessment for the representative use in cereals and a high long term risk to birds for the representative use in orchards.
   The risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated earthworms and fish is considered to be low. The risk to birds and mammal of secondary poisoning and the risk from uptake of plant metabolites is considered to be low.
   Crustaceans (Cladocera) were the most sensitive group of aquatic organisms. The first tier risk assessment for the representative use in apples indicated a high acute and chronic risk to fish and daphnids. For the representative use in cereals a high acute and chronic risk was identified only for daphnia. Additional single species tests were used to reduce the acute TER trigger value from 100 to 10 in the higher tier risk assessment. The risk assessment based on the endpoints from single species tests resulted in TER values which meet the relevant acute and chronic Annex VI trigger values taking into account buffer zones of 40 m (orchards) and 10 m (cereals). Depending on the outcome of the PPR opinion on the use of the microcosm study, the results of the microcosm study could be taken into account at MS level for further risk refinement. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms, soil nontarget micro-organisms, other non-target-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Trifluralin is one of the 52 substances of the second stage covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on trifluralin in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 11 July 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 24 July 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier, the European Union Trifluralin Taskforce comprising of Agan Chemical Manufacturers Ltd. and Dintec Agroquimica Produtos Quimicos Lda. at the time of finalisation of the conclusion. Subsequently, the comments received were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 15 January 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April, May and June 2004.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from Member States on 10 February 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises spraying to bare soil to control grass and broad-leaved weeds in oilseed rape, sunflowers, cotton and winter cereals at application rate up 1.2 kg trifluralin per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "EF-1521" ("Treflan"), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe. In case of oilseed rape, sunflowers, cotton, incorporation into soil takes place after the application. Trifluralin can be Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition.
   Trifluralin is extensively and rapidly metabolised and absorbed. It has a low acute toxicity, but has sensitising properties (proposed classification: R43). Trifluralin induced neoplastic changes and carcinogenic effects were seen in rats such as Leydig cell tumours, thyroid tumours and renal carcinoma (proposed classification: R40). A no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) could not be established but the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 30 mg/kg bw/day in the rat was assigned as the most relevant effect level. There were no direct effects on reproductive performance or fertility.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the LOAEL in the rat carcinogenicity study with a margin of safety between LOAEL and ADI of 2000. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.026 mg/kg bw/day and no acute reference dose (ARfD) was allocated. The estimated operator exposure was below the AOEL only if personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn both during mixing/loading and during application.
   The metabolism of trifluralin in cereals is extensive and does not yield metabolites of toxicological concern. No residues of trifluralin were quantified in any of the cereal grain or straw samples from field trials conducted according the critical good agricultural practise (GAP) in Northern Europe. Further information is needed to conclude on the residue situation in cereals for Southern European uses.
   For oilseed crops the present studies do not fully address consumer exposure via seeds. Therefore a further metabolism study is required for oilseeds to support uses on these crops. Subsequently the applicability of the submitted residue trials in oilseed crops has to be reviewed. Due to the above mentioned requirements a final conclusion on the livestock dietary burden and on the possibly occurrence of residues in food of animal origin cannot be drawn at this stage. The chronic dietary exposure assessment for consumers based on the currently available information in line with the Northern European GAP on cereals leads to estimated intakes less than 4% of the proposed ADI for the consumer subgroups of infants and young children. However, this assessment needs to be reviewed upon receipt of the outstanding data. An ARfD was not allocated, thus there is no acute risk for consumers arising from trifluralin residues in food.
   In aerobic conditions degradation of trifluralin in soil did not lead to any major metabolite. Under flooded anaerobic conditions a major metabolite TR-43 is formed. Furthermore, metabolite TR-144 was formed at amounts above 5 % at the end of the study in all three anaerobic soils tested. Due to its potential degradation under aerobic conditions, TR-4 may be addressed by Member States where anaerobic conditions are envisaged to be relevant. Whereas not discussed in particular during the Peer Review, it is EFSA's opinion that the same conclusion may be reached for metabolite TR-14.
   Under aerobic laboratory conditions trifluralin is medium to highly persistent with half-lives between 81 to 356 d at 22 degrees C. The degradation under anaerobic conditions was faster than under aerobic conditions. Data indicate that trifluralin is strongly adsorbed to soil and could be classified as immobile. Trifluralin is hydrolytically stable under environmental relevant conditions. Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of trifluralin producing TR-65 and TR-156 metabolites. Trifluralin is not readily biodegradable. During the Peer Review, it was agreed that worst case DT50 = 13 d should be employed for the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion and that a DT50 = 2 d could be used to refine risk assessment when appropriate. Due to the potential contribution of photolysis to the dissipation of trifluralin in water, the fate and behaviour in the environment expert meeting confirmed the need of a water sediment study conducted in the presence of light that could be used by MS to refine the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion. Neither trifluralin nor its anaerobic metabolite TR-4 are expected to contaminate ground water at levels above 0.1 mu g / L under the proposed conditions of use.
   Trifluralin was designated as a "priority substance" under the Water Framework Directive7 but has not been identified as a "priority hazardous substance". However, trifluralin has been added to the OSPAR (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) List of Chemicals for Priority action in 2002 because it is considered to be a PBT substance fulfilling the criteria for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity.
   Because of its high volatility the occurrence of trifluralin in air and transport trough air is possible. However, photochemical half life in air is estimated to be short.
   The risk to insectivorous and fish-eating birds and mammals, bees, ground dwelling arthropods, soil micro-organisms, including earthworms is low with respect to trifluralin and the metabolites as far as investigated. High risks were identified for aquatic organisms, in particular the chronic risk to fish, which require consideration of appropriate risk mitigation measures. Using the initial predicted environmental concentrations (PEC's) together with the no observed effect level (NOEC) of 0.3 mu g/L leads to a toxicity exposure ratio (TER)-value of 0.38 when a bufferzone of 15 metres is taken into account which is below the Annex VI trigger value of 10 (without detailed calculations, a bufferzone of 50 m should lead to a TER-value of approximately 1). Further data to address this risk is needed and the risk assessment can only be concluded when the outstanding data is evaluated.
   The EPCO expert meeting (section ecotoxicology, June 2004) considered the risk to earthworm eating birds and mammals as low, based on the TER value reflecting the soil accumulation plateau. EFSA would like to highlight that the risk to earthworm eating birds and mammals should be considered further at MS-level when the product is applied after this plateau value is reached. EFSA proposes that a new litterbag study should be made available in which the tested dose rate reflects the concentration in the soil after a single application when the accumulation plateau has been reached as the study which is available at present was performed at a lower dose rate. This data requirement has not been discussed in an EPCO expert meeting
   The risk to non-target plants could not be calculated with the appropriate endpoint (median emergence rate (ER50) value) as this value is not reported in the DAR. Based on a conservative no observed effect concentration (NOEC), the risk to non-target plants can be certainly regarded as low if a bufferzone of 5 metres is taken into account.
   Regulation (EC) No 850/20048 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC9 entered into force when the Peer Review of trifluralin was in an advanced stage. For this reason, EFSA's conclusion does not specifically assess trifluralin against the criteria set in the paragraph 1 of Annex D of the Stockholm Convention(10). However, available information assessed during the Peer Review and provided in this conclusion should allow the Commission and the Member States to conduct the assessment of trifluralin with respect to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004. As this conclusion only considers a limited range of representative uses, other information may need to be considered by the Commission and the Member States when assessing trifluralin with respect to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004.

   Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tolylfluanid in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 13 June 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 30 July 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Bayer AG. Subsequently, the comments received were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 12 March 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2004.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from Member States on 9 February 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a foliar fungicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprises spray treatment to foliar to control a wide range of fungicidal diseases such as apple scab, grey mould, leaf spot diseases and powdery and downy mildew in different fruits, vegetables and hops at application rate up 3 kg tolylfluanid per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was " Euparen M WG 50", a water dispersible granule (WG), registered in almost all Member States of the EU.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition apart from food of animal origin.
   Tolylfluanid is extensively and rapidly absorbed (> 90%). Oral and dermal toxicity is low. However, toxicity during inhalation exposure was low to high which was related to the particle size leading to a differentiated proposal for classification i.e. tolylfluanid containing >= 0.1% particles < 50 mu m (T+; R26). Tolylfluanid has irritating properties in both eyes and skin (proposed classification: Xi; R36/37/38) and has sensitizing properties (proposed classification: R43). Main effects during short term oral exposure were functional disturbance of the thyroid, increased liver weights and decreased liver enzyme levels in the rat and dog and slight histopathological changes in the kidney in the dog at high dose levels. During inhalation exposure severe respiratory tract irritation including deaths was observed. Depending on the particle size, tolylfluanid containing >= 0.1% particles < 50 mu m is classified as toxic (proposed classification: T, R48/R23). Tolylfluanid is neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic. There were no effects on reproductive or developmental toxicity observed and no evidence of neurotoxicity was observed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set to 0.1 mg/kg, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) to 0.3 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) to 0.25 mg/kg bw/day. The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL for proposed uses of Euparen M 50 WG.
   The metabolism of tolylfluanid in plants proceeds through degradation to DMST3, being the main metabolite in the majority of investigated crops. Moreover, under processing conditions tolylfluanid degrades rapidly and almost completely to DMST, that has a similar toxicity compared to tolylfluanid. The residue situation in food of plant origin was proved with a sufficient number of trials according to the critical GAP for a wide range of fruit and vegetable crops and for hops; and also with studies determining the level of residues in processed products.
   In livestock tolylfluanid is rapidly metabolised to DMST that was detected in all organs and tissues as well as in eggs. Assuming fruit pomace as the only relevant feed item possibly containing residues from tolylfluanid treatment, no quantifiable residues are expected in edible products of animal origin. The chronic and acute dietary exposure assessment for adult consumers indicates that the intake of residues via the total diet for food of plant origin or any individual food item considered does not exceed the ADI and the ARfD, respectively.
   For toddlers and children the theoretical maximum daily residue intake from fruit and vegetables (TMDI) occupies no more than 70% of the ADI, indicating that long-term exposure to residues from tolylfluanid treated crops does not pose an adverse health risk to these consumer subgroups. The estimation of the short term exposure revealed that the ARfD is slightly exceeded (102%, WHO/GEMS Food data) for children consuming table grapes. However, Germany pointed out during the last discussion of tolylfluanid that a greater exceedance of the ARfD (121%) was obtained based on national consumption data for children.
   Under aerobic conditions, tolylfluanid yields DMST that is subsequently degraded to other minor metabolites (none > 10 % AR) and ultimately bound residue and CO2. Photolysis will not significantly contribute to the overall degradation of tolylfluanid under environmental conditions. Tolylfluanid is between very low to low persistent in soil and metabolite DMST is low persistent. Tolylfluanid should be classified as a slightly to low mobile compound and DMST can be classified as a medium to high mobile compound.
   Hydrolysis of tolylfluanid is rapid and slightly pH dependent. DMST is stable in all range of environmental relevant pH. Direct photodegradation is not expected to contribute to the degradation of tolylfluanid or its metabolite DMST in the aqueous environment. Tolylfluanid is not ready biodegradable. In water sediment systems, tolylfluanid completely disappear from water phase in about three days mainly due to degradation. Levels of tolylfluanid found in the sediment never attained the 10 % of AR. Major metabolite, both in water and sediment, was DMST. DMST dissipates from the water phase by degradation and adsorption to the sediment. On the basis of FOCUS-PELMO model simulations neither tolylfluanid nor DMST are expected to exceed the 0.1 mu g /L trigger in ground water.
   The risk to birds, bees, soil micro-and macro-organisms, including earthworms and non-target terrestrial plants is low with respect to tolylfluanid and the metabolites as far as investigated. A high long term risk to mammals was identified. The toxicity exposure ratio (TER) values range from 0.84 to 2.78 depending on the representative use evaluated and therefore breaching the Annex VI trigger value of 5 for all the representative uses evaluated. Further data to address this risk is needed and the risk assessment can only be concluded when the outstanding data is evaluated. High risk is identified for fish (being the most sensitive aquatic organism), which requires consideration of appropriate risk mitigation measures. Pending on the representative use, bufferzones of 5-20 metres are needed to respect the Annex VI trigger value. The toxicity to fish is higher at lower pH-values therefore it is proposed that Member States with surface water bodies of low pH (< 6) associated with agricultural landscapes should consider the effect of pH on toxicity to fish at the local level.
   Also for non-target arthropods (other than bees) a high risk was identified in-field however a recovery before the start of next season is considered possible.

AB  - Human natural killer (NK) lymphocytes play a central role in immune system defense against viral infection and against the formation of primary tumors. Organotin (OT) pesticides have been used in industrial and agricultural applications, and OT contamination has been reported in water, sediment, and fish. Carbamate pesticides are currently used in agricultural chemicals. Two specific carbamates used in agriculture are ziram and maneb; ziram also is used as an additive in rubber products including latex gloves. In previous studies we demonstrated that at concentrations in the 150-200 nM range, the OTs tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) were capable of disrupting the function of human NK cells after incubations to as short as 24 h. Previously, we also examined the effects of ziram and maneb at higher concentrations on the cytotoxic function of human NK cells. The current study examined the effects of exposure of up to 6 days to lower concentrations of each of these compounds on the cytotoxic function of NK cells. The OTs were studied at concentrations ranging from 200 to 10 nM; ziram was studied at concentrations of 2.5 muM-125 nM and maneb at concentrations of 10-1 muM. These conditions were studied both in highly purified NK cells and in a mixture of lymphocytes containing both T and NK cells. As little as 25 nM TBT decreased the function of purified NK cells after 24 and 48 h, whereas 10 nM TBT was effective after 6 days. The lowest level of TPT that was effective at 24 h was 50 nM whereas the results after 48 h and 6 days were similar to those seen with TBT. The presence of T lymphocytes diminished the effects of both TBT and TPT on NK cytotoxic function. A concentration of ziram as low as 125 nM produced significant loss of cytotoxic function in highly purified NK cells (65% decrease in function after 6 days). The toxicity of each of the compounds studied increased very significantly with length of exposure. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - dThe present study evaluated the effect of oral administration of three types of glucan on the resistance of gilthead seabream to Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida and on the activity of its phagocytes. Groups of fish were fed with a basal diet (controls) or with the basal diet supplemented with glucan for two different periods of time before being bath challenged with the bacterium. Groups of fish fed with 1 and 10 g kg(-1) of glucan for a short period (2 weeks with glucan and 1 week with the basal diet) showed a higher degree of protection against pasteurellosis than the control group. This was especially pronounced in groups of fish fed with the higher concentrations of glucan. The respiratory burst and phagocytic activity of spleen phagocytes varied with time but no significant differences were found between groups in the third week when the challenge was carried out. The group of fish fed with 1 g kg(-1) of glucan for longer periods of time (2 weeks with glucan, 1 week with the basal diet, 2 weeks with glucan, and I week with the basal diet) also showed enhanced protection against P damselae. However, the group fed with 5 g kg(-1) had mortality rates comparable to the control group, and protection in the group fed with 10 g kg(-1) of glucan was significantly lower than in the control group. These results suggest that glucans can be used in the diet to prevent or reduce mortalities in gilthead seabream due to pasteurellosis, and they show the importance of the concentration and the period of administration of glucan to obtain optimal protection against this disease.

AB  - Changes in the frequency of individuals with gross abnormalities can be used as an indicator of changes in the occurrence of biologically significant levels of developmental toxicants in the habitats of natural populations. The precise nature of the defects and their relative distribution can often provide clues as to the type of contamination. Such inferences clearly require baseline data on the frequency of such deformities, and that is the purpose of this paper. For Mid-continent lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) nesting at La Perouse Bay, the current rate of gross external abnormalities among embryos and near-hatch goslings at hatch is 3.937 X 10(-4) per egg (95% confidence limits 1.7053 X 10(-4) to 6.507 X 10(-4)) and is consistent with estimates made for other species in minimally or uncontaminated habitats. Among the abnormal specimens, however, the relative distribution of defects of the beak and eye is not consistent with rates of spontaneous abnormalities reported for chickens. If the higher relative frequency of beak defects persists in future or other geographic samples displaying overall levels of abnormalities higher than our benchmark, then contaminants acting as type 1 teratogens should be suspected. Of the compounds this increasingly agriculturally dependent species is exposed to, insecticides rather than herbicides would be the more likely class of candidates. We urge others who may have similar data on other species to make it more broadly available since such benchmarks are crucial for the use of birds as bioindicators of environmental conditions. To that end, we offer our web site as a place where data on and images of abnormal specimens can be posted and, within certain constraints, will curate submitted specimens.

AB  - P-glycoproteins (P-gps) encoded by multidrug resistance 1 (mdr 1) genes are ATP-dependent transporters located in the cytoplasmic membrane which mediate the efflux of a broad spectrum of hydrophobic compounds from the cell. The tissue distribution of P-gps suggests their role in the organismal defense against xenobiotics by effecting xenobiotic excretion and reducing xenobiotic uptake. In the present work, the interaction of P-gp(s) in the liver and in primary cultured hepatocytes of rainbow trout with two model pollutants was studied - the imidazole fungicide prochloraz and the alkylphenolic surfactant nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP2EO). Using a monoclonal antibody (mAB C219) directed against a conserved P-gp epitope, an immunoreactive protein of 160 kDa was detected in immunoblots of liver extracts from control trout. In sections of control trout livers, immunohistochemistry with the mAB C219 resulted in specific staining of bile canaliculi. In juvenile trout exposed for 7 days to sublethal concentrations of prochloraz (0.027 muM; 0.27 muM) or NP2EO (0.32 muM; 1.30 muM). no changes in levels of hepatic P-gp(s) were found in immunoblot and immunochemical investigations. The efflux of the fluorescent mdr1 substrate rhodamine 123 (Rh123) from cultured isolated trout hepatocytes was partly inhibited by verapamil and vinblastine, compounds known to interfere with mdr1-dependent transport. This demonstrates the presence of a mdr1-like mechanism in trout liver which is probably involved in the biliary excretion of hydrophobic xenobiotics. Non-cytotoxic concentrations of prochloraz and NP2EO were tested for effects on the efflux of Rh123 from trout hepatocytes. Prochloraz was a potent inhibitor of the mdr1-like mechanism, being effective at 0.3 muM and above. NP2EO inhibited Rh123 efflux only at the highest concentration tested (31.6 muM). The accumulation and elimination of C-14-prochloraz by cultured trout hepatocytes was not affected by mdr1-type substrates (Rh123, vinblastine) and a mdr1 inhibitor (verapamil). This shows that prochloraz is, despite its inhibitory potency, not a substrate of the mdr1-like mechanism in trout liver. The inhibition by prochloraz and NP2EO of the mdr1-like mechanism in trout hepatocytes suggests that water pollutants can interfere with P-gp-function in fish and thus may impair the organismal defense against xenobiotics.

AB  - Animal clinical biochemistry at large is a very efficient tool to contribute to the diagnosis of disaeses. It can also be used in toxicology and for environment monitoring. Information thus provided lead to postulate the existence of a chemical defense system.
   In toxicology, clinical biochemistry can be used to search for diverse toxic effects in laboratory animal species through experiments about the evaluation of the toxicity of xenobiotics such as pesticides, human or veterinary drugs. As environment is concerned, animal clinical biochemistry can be used to investigate the possible effects of endocrine modulators in various species, which is currently a major environmental concern. It can also help evaluate the effects of pollution in fish.
   All the results obtained with clinical biochemistry lead to an evidence : in all animals, there is a system of chemical defense based on a large number of mechanisms, which allow to fight efficiently against this type of aggression. This system of defense has many similarities with the immune system : immaturity at birth, inducibility, specificity, overflow by toxic effects when doses are too high. Moreover, the actions of this system allow to better understand the concept of hormesis, elaborated in the latest years, which shows that in many cases low doses of toxicants can have beneficial effects on vital processes.

AB  - Xenobiotic metabolising enzymes, namely the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system and glutathione S-transferase, as well as antioxidant enzymes were determined in the liver of 3 deepsea fish species (Lepidion lepidion, Bathypterois mediterraneus and Coryphaenoides guentheri). These organisms were collected from 3 stations along the NW Mediterranean, at depths ranging from 1500 to 1800 m. The enzymatic activities detected in deep-sea fish indicated the ability of these organisms to cope with pollutants and oxidative stress. Differences among the studied species may be related to habitat and diet, viz, the highest monooxygenase and antioxidant enzyme activities were observed in L. lepidion, a typical middle slope species, whereas the lowest activities were recorded for B. mediterraneus, an organism adapted to live at greater depths. Tissue concentration of persistent organochlorinated compounds, Like polychlorinated biphenyls, DDTs and hexachlorobenzene, were in the lower range of those reported for coastal fish, and significant differences among sampling stations were not observed. Overall, the obtained results contribute to the knowledge of the NW Mediterranean deepsea basin and reflect the chronic contamination of the area in terms of organochlorinated compounds, rather than the influence of coastal discharges.

AB  - In light of heightened consumer apprehension regarding food safety & environmental stewardship coupled with increasing orchard production costs, this multi-faceted research project strives to fine tune input resources while addressing 'quality assurance' to the consumer and enhancing loyalty to locally grown fruit. Integrated pest management (IPM) monitoring methods, including immunoassay, are used to resolve need & timing of control measures. Where possible alternatives to organophosphorus insecticides are employed if biocontrol agents cannot adequately control key pests. A pesticide resistant strain of Typhlodromus pyri is employed to control European red mite. Pest injury and fruit quality grade are assessed annually. A developmental Integrated Fruit Production (IFP) production system is under study comparing impact on beneficial species of selective pest control measures gr conventional pesticide practices. The apple varieties 'Summerland' McIntosh and 'Royal Court' Cortland each comprise 50% of the 3.5 ha study area. Within each of the two production systems, three vegetation management options, mowing, herbicides and organic mulch were evaluated for impact on horticultural attributes and potential to enhance populations of beneficial ground dwelling arthropods.
   Significant production input savings ($500.00/hectare) have been realized in the IFP system. Replicated pit fall traps have revealed a significant abundance & diversity of ground dwelling beneficial species. Carabidae are represented by no less than 19 genera (greater than or equal to 40 species) dominated by nearly 70% of European origin. Genus representation comes from Carabus, Clivina, Bembidion, Chlaenius, Pterostichus, Agonum, Poecilus, Amara, Harpalus, Stenolophus, Anisodactylus, Notiophilus and Bradycellus.

AB  - Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (formerly Pasteurella piscicida) is the causative agent of pasteurellosis or pseudotuberculosis in warm water marine fish. Enzymes which neutralize reactive oxygen species, produced during aerobic metabolism or during respiratory burst in fish macrophages, are important virulence factors in many pathogens. This study characterizes a periplasmic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and a cytoplasmic catalase in P. damselae. Purification and partial amino-terminal sequencing confirmed the SOD to be iron-cofactored, with a high degree of homology to other bacterial FeSODs. The SOD was common to all strains analysed in terms of type, location and activity, whilst the catalase varied in activity between strains. The catalase was constitutively expressed, but the SOD appeared to be repressed under low oxygen conditions. In spite of the presence of a periplasmic SOD, P. damselae was susceptible to killing by exogenous superoxide anion generated in a cell-free system. Addition of exogenous SOD to this system did not abolish the bactericidal effect; however, addition of catalase was protective. These results suggest that lack of periplasmic catalase may be implicated in susceptiblity to killing by reactive oxygen species.

AB  - Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is basically a liquid extraction of the compounds present in a solid or semisolid matrix, that takes place above the critical point. Solvents in supercritical state work as liquid solvent but maintains the mass transfer properties of real gases. CO2 is the most commonly used supercritical fluid due to its no flammability, no toxicity, is non corrosive and presents low critical point characteristics, besides it has been regarded as GRAS (generally recognised as safe) by the USFDA.
   All the social and legal tendencies allow us to present this technology as an extraordinary tool for the revalorization of agrofood by-products obtaining high added value raw materials for different productive cycles. Some of the most outstanding examples can be the extraction and fractionation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from fish oil, obtaining of aromatic extracts and essential oils from different natural sources as orange peels, or the production of natural antioxidants from plants and vegetable by-products. All these products have a great market in pharmaceutical and cosmetic sector.
   On the other hand, SFE can also be used for the recovery of contaminated soils and detoxification of hazardous wastes. Among the different contaminants capable of being removed from different matrix. are the PAHs, PCB's and organoclorinated pesticides. Some of these applications, as detoxification of industrial waste waters, or treatment of petrol refinery wastes are implanted at industrial levels in some countries like USA.
   Applications in these two fields will be presented with some preliminary results of the fractionation and purification of PUFAs from different fish oils and the removal of organochlorine compounds from different environmental matrixes.

AB  - During the past 20 years there has been a dramatic global expansion in fish farming, with both positive and negative consequences. Although commercial aquaculture has contributed positively to the economies of many producing countries, there are considerable negative environmental and social impacts. In intensive and semi-intensive systems, artificial feeds supplemented with antibiotics are used to prevent the spread of disease and to improve feed conversion ratios. Current knowledge of the health and environmental impact of antibiotics used in aquaculture is poor, particularly in tropical regions. Residues may remain in fish used for human consumption and antibiotics released into the environment can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the food chain. The accumulation of waste feeds in ponds stimulates the growth of bacteria, including human pathogens, which can contaminate products and lead to foodborne disease and the rejection of products in export markets, In extensive systems, where fish are produced mainly for the domestic market, different food safety concerns exist. The consumption of aquatic plants and raw or partially cooked freshwater fish has been associated with foodborne trematode infections, These are a major public health problem in East and South East Asia and occur when products that are contaminated by the infective stages of the parasites are consumed. This paper reviews food safety hazards associated with products from aquaculture and proposes the application of principles of the hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) system as a general strategy to control the hazards identified.

AB  - The mechanism by which the fertilization envelope (FE) is able to protect the embryo of fish until hatching is almost unknown, except for its function as a physical barrier. FE extract from activated or fertilized eggs of the fish Salmo gairdneri was demonstrated to contain enzyme activities using an agar plate enzyme assay. The enzymes apparently active were carboxymethylcellulase (cellulase; EC 3.2.1.4), laminaranase (endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase; EC 3.2.1.6), carboxymethylchitinase (chitinase; EC 3.2.1.14), xylanase (endo-1,4-beta-xylanase; EC 3.2.1.8), mannanase (mannan 1,2-(1,3)-alpha-mannosidase; EC 3.2.1.77), dextranase (EC 3.2.1.11), a protease and lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17). The FE extract exerted an antifungal or fungicidal action on the fungus Saprolegnia parasitica, whereas an extract from the vitelline envelopes (VE) has no apparent enzyme activity nor antifungal or fungicidal action. Enzymes acquired by the FE through the cortical reaction may have an important defensive role, protecting the embryo against invaders or pathogens.

AB  - Maintenance of the glutathione (GSH) pathway is critical in guarding against the toxic effects of a variety of pollutants. However, despite their importance as an initial line of defense against waterborne toxicants, little is known regarding the role of fish gills in GSH-mediated xenobiotic metabolism. In these studies, the role of channel catfish gills in the detoxification of 2,4,5,6-tetrachloroisophthalonitrile (chlorothalonil), an electrophilic fungicide, was examined Chlorothalonil was metabolized in vitro by gill cytosolic and microsomal glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Chlorothalonil metabolism by cytosolic fractions was reduced markedly when GSH was omitted from reaction mixtures. Microsomal metabolism of chlorothalonil did not occur in the absence of GSH and in the presence of an NA DPH-regenerating system lacking GSH. Channel catfish exposed in vivo to chlorothalonil had increased gill GSH and cysteine concentrations after 72 h exposure, and increased gill gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) activity at 144 h of exposure. Our results show that the gills play an important role in the metabolism and detoxification of chlorothalonil in the channel catfish. Catfish can maintain elevated gill GSH concentrations in the presence of chlorothalonil by increasing gill cysteine concentrations.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES
LA  - English
KW  - MALACHITE GREEN
AB  - The life-cycle of Saprolegnia parasitica was considered in relation to the use of protective fungicides against it in salmonid fish hatcheries.  Malachite green oxalate was the example fungicide, and all experiments were at 10-degrees-C.  If the fungicide is to be used as a continuous addition to the water, as a protectant, then target stages of the fungus are identified as zoospores and secondary zoospore cysts; the latter, although physically sedimentary, have a remarkably high degree of buoyancy in the water and hence pose a constant threat to the fish.  Continuous addition to the water, to give 0.25 mg l-1 malachite green oxalate, would be expected to kill zoospores and zoospore cysts, but 0.05 mg l-1, while allowing zoospore cyst germination, was a strong inhibitor to fungal growth and, aided by natural defences of the fish, might well succeed in disease prevention.  If the fungicide is to be used as an intermittent addition to the water (every 24 h), then target stages of the fungus are small mycelia on the fish in addition to zoospores and zoospore cysts in the water.  An experimental model was made to consider the vulnerability of these small mycelia, growing on the fish over the preceding 24 h, to malachite green oxalate.  If mycelia are of narrow diameter, as expected, then 0.25 mg l-1 malachite green oxalate, applied for 15 min, should control their growth and protect the fish.

TI  - Effects of different field management systems on the carabid coenosis in oil seed rape with special respect to ecology and nutritional status of predacious <i>Poecilus cuprous</i> L. (Col., Carabidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANGEWANDTE ENTOMOLOGIE
LA  - English
KW  - FOOD
AB  - It could be shown, that the differences between two carabid populations on rape fields under intensive management and reduced management (50% N-input, no insecticide application) were not as striking as one might expect. Despite the fact that total individual numbers of the carabid populations, total species numbers, and number of dominant species were clearly higher in the field under reduced management, RENKONEN'S R, showed only a slight difference between the fields with nearly three-quarter correspondence in dominance structure. The presence of five more carabid species on the field under reduced management is underlined by the low values Of JACCARD'S species identity and WAINSTEIN's K-w index of similarity. On the other hand, according to SHANNON-WEAVER's H-s for species diversity and SHANNON's E-s for evenness, the differences between the fields are minor. Even if only the dominant species were taken into account, the similarity between both fields was obvious, despite the fact that in the field under reduced management two more dominant carabid species were found, In both fields, phytophagous Amara similata was the most abundant species. Nevertheless, a special oil seed rape carabid coenosis seems to exist as well, as one was found for cereal crops and for root crops, which might consist of A. similata, Amara aenea, Harpalus affinis, Poecilus cupreus, Pseudophonus rufipes, and Pterostichus melanarius.
   For P. cupreus, which was chosen as a typically predacious and beneficial carabid species in oil seed rape, biomass, fecundity and determination of the degree of gut filling also showed no differences for the fields. Even the length of elytrae as an indicator for nutritional situation in the preceding year showed no difference. Only the phenology of P. cupreus showed an obvious shift of the peak in activity-density in the intensively managed field, to a later date in the season, compared with the field under reduced management. The latter reflects the usual spring peak. No sufficient explanation was found for the peak 4 weeks later on the intensively managed field. It can be assumed that a less sufficient food supply (higher numbers of potential food, e.g. larvae of Meligethes spp. in the field under reduced management), due to insecticide input, or long-term biocide impact on P. cupreus, or a faster growth of rape plants due to high nitrogen input resulting in a less favourable microclimate on the intensively managed field, was responsible for this later peak in activity-density.
   To conclude, the relations between the predacious carabids, their potential prey, and the abiotic factors in the habitats seem to be much more complicated than assumed. There is a strong hint that the impact of single parameters such as field management influencing the phenology change obviously over the carabids activity period.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the antifungal, antibacterial and antimycobacterial properties of methanol extract of Entada abysinnica steudel ex. A. Rich (Fabaceae) leaves used by herbalists from the Lake Victoria region, Kenya. The extract was tested against four strains of mycobacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium smegmatis) using BACTEC Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 system and the proportional method. Standard procedures were used to determine the zones of inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations (MBCs/MFCs) for Candida albicans, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The extract showed activity against some mycobacteria strains, especially M. tuberculosis. It also showed strong antimicrobial activity (zones of inhibition were between 9.00 and 14.10 mm) against C. albicans, Sa. typhi, and St. aureus. The extract gave a better zone of inhibition against C. albicans than fluconazole whose zone of inhibition was 13.00 mm. The MICs and MBCs for C. albicans and Sa. typhi were good. The crude extracts were also analyzed for the presence of phytochemicals. Phytochemical screening indicated that the extract most abundantly contained tannins, saponins, and flavonoids. The data suggest that the methanolic leaves extract of E. abysinnica could be a rich source of antimicrobial agents, especially antifungals. The results further show that there is some merit in the use of the plant in alternative medical practices. However, bioassays of isolated compounds are underway and will be reported during subsequent communications.

AB  - Semiochemicals are substances or mixtures that carry messages and are used for communication between individuals of the same or different species. Semiochemicals that are used in pest control are called biopesticides. Conventional pesticides, which are generally synthetically derived and unnatural, inactivate or kill the pests, whereas biopesticides are naturally occurring compounds that attract insects to a trap or interfere with their reproduction. There are several advantages to biopesticides. Compared with conventional pesticides, biochemical-based pesticides are often less toxic and therefore have a significantly lower impact on human health and the environment. Moreover, biopesticides are pest-selective and as such do not negatively impact other organisms such as insects, mammals, or birds. Other advantages of biopesticides include high potency, meaning that smaller amounts of biopesticide are required, less resistance by target organisms, and the ability to biodegrade more quickly than conventional pesticides. Although biochemical-based pesticides are very promising materials, their production is often cumbersome, and their application is often limited. To date, most biopesticides have been synthesized by multistep, classical organic reactions that are not economical and have high environmental impact. However, in recent decades many efforts have been made to implement cost-effective and safer chemical procedures for the widespread application of biochemical-based pesticides. The purpose of this Perspective is to draw the attention of the green chemistry community to the applicability of olefin metathesis reactions in environmentally benign and cost-effective biopesticide synthesis. We review seminal work on the total synthesis of biopesticides using olefin metathesis as a key reaction step, and in doing so, we hope to inspire new ideas for forthcoming olefin-metathesis-based biopesticide development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, there is no effective vaccine or no effective drug for mass chemoprophylaxis against malaria. Thus, proper know-how and use of prevention methods is crucial. This study aims to assess the knowledge and practice of malaria prevention methods among the residents of Arba Minch area, Southern Ethiopia.
   METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study that utilized a two-stage sampling was conducted from January 22 to February 1, 2007 on a sample of 454 household heads or their deputies. SPSS 16 for windows was used for data analysis. Chi-square and Fisher's exact probability tests were used to assess the association of selected variables with place of residence.
   RESULTS: Majority (86.8%) of the respondents mentioned fever as a symptom of malaria, and 98.2% of the respondents reported mosquito bite as the cause of malaria. Three hundred and eighty four (84.6%) of the respondents mentioned mosquito nets as protective measures against mosquito bites. The protective measure mostly used by the respondents or other household members in the last 12 months was mosquito net (73.3%) followed by aerosol insecticide (13%) with the former being used more in rural areas and the latter in urban areas.
   CONCLUSION: The study subjects' awareness regarding the cause, symptoms and preventive measures of malaria was high. Use of mosquito net as protective measure against mosquito bites in the last 12 months was high. However, use of other preventive measures was low. Behavioral change communication is required to increase the use of other preventive measures along with mosquito nets.

AB  - Recent evidences have suggested the involvement of phosphoryl transfer, catalyzed by creatine kinase (CK), adenylate kinase (AK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), to metabolic alterations and impairment of bioenergetics homeostasis linked to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and utilization during exposure to pesticides. It is recognized that sublethal concentrations of trichlorfon alter hepatic and branchial metabolism, but the pathways involved in this process remains unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether phosphoryl transfer network can be a pathway involved in the hepatic and branchial metabolic alterations during exposure to sublethal concentrations of trichlorfon. Hepatic and branchial CK (cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms) and PK activities were inhibited after 48 h of exposure to 11 and 22 mg/L trichlorfon compared to control group, while AK activity did not differ between groups. In addition, sodium-potassium pump (Na+, K+-ATPase) activity was lower after 48 h of exposure to 22 mg/L trichlorfon compared to control group. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were higher in liver samples after 24 h of exposure to 22 mg/L trichlorfon compared to control group, as well as after 48 h of exposure to 11 and 22 mg/L trichlorfon in liver and gills. Finally, hepatic and branchial non-protein thiol (NPSH) levels were lower after 48 h of exposure to 11 and 22 mg/L trichlorfon. All evaluated parameters did not recover after 48 h in clean water. Based on these evidence, the impairment of phosphoryl transfer network can be considered a pathway involved in the hepatic and branchial metabolic alterations during exposure to sublethal concentrations of trichlorfon. Moreover, alterations on CK and PK activities provoke an impairment on Na+, K+-ATPase activity, which can be mediated by lipid oxidative damage and reduction of NPSH content.

AB  - Coastal acidification in southeastern U.S. estuaries and coastal waters is influenced by biological activity, run-off from the land, and increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Acidification can negatively impact coastal resources such as shellfish, finfish, and coral reefs, and the communities that rely on them. Organismal responses for species located in the U.S. Southeast document large negative impacts of acidification, especially in larval stages. For example, the toxicity of pesticides increases under acidified conditions and the combination of acidification and low oxygen has profoundly negative influences on genes regulating oxygen consumption. In corals, the rate of calcification decreases with acidification and processes such as wound recovery, reproduction, and recruitment are negatively impacted. Minimizing the changes in global ocean chemistry will ultimately depend on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, but adaptation to these changes and mitigation of the local stressors that exacerbate global acidification can be addressed locally. The evolution of our knowledge of acidification, from basic understanding of the problem to the emergence of applied research and monitoring, has been facilitated by the development of regional Coastal Acidification Networks (CANs) across the United States. This synthesis is a product of the Southeast Coastal and Ocean Acidification Network (SOCAN). SOCAN was established to better understand acidification in the coastal waters of the U.S. Southeast and to foster communication among scientists, resource managers, businesses, and governments in the region. Here we review acidification issues in the U.S. Southeast, including the regional mechanisms of acidification and their potential impacts on biological resources and coastal communities. We recommend research and monitoring priorities and discuss the role SOCAN has in advancing acidification research and mitigation of and adaptation to these changes.

KW  - IFAKARA
AB  - To accelerate malaria elimination in areas where core interventions such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are already widely used, it is crucial to consider additional factors associated with persistent transmission. Qualitative data on human behaviours and perceptions regarding malaria risk was triangulated with quantitative data on Anopheles mosquito bites occurring indoors and outdoors in south-eastern Tanzania communities where ITNS are already used but lower level malaria transmission persists. Each night (18: 00h-07: 00h), trained residents recorded human activities indoors, in peri-domestic outdoor areas, and in communal gatherings. Host-seeking mosquitoes were repeatedly collected indoors and outdoors hourly, using miniaturized exposure-free double net traps (DN-Mini) occupied by volunteers. In-depth interviews were conducted with household representatives to explore perceptions on persistent malaria and its control. Higher proportions of people stayed outdoors than indoors in early-evening and early-morning hours, resulting in higher exposures outdoors than indoors during these times. However, exposure during late-night hours (22: 00h-05: 00h) occurred mostly indoors. Some of the popular activities that kept people outdoors included cooking, eating, relaxing and playing. All households had at least one bed net, and 83.9% of people had access to ITNs. Average ITN use was 96.3%, preventing most indoor exposure. Participants recorgnized the importance of ITNs but also noted that the nets were not perfect. No complementary interventions were reported being used widely. Most people believed transmission happens after midnight. We conclude that insecticide-treated nets, where properly used, can still prevent most indoor exposures, but significant risk continues unabated before bedtime, outdoors and at communal gatherings. Such exposure is greatest for rural and low-income households. There is therefore an urgent need for complementary interventions, particularly those targeting outdoor-biting and are applicable for all people including the marginalised populations such as migratory farmers and fishermen. Besides, the differences in community understanding of ongoing transmission, and feedback on imperfections of ITNs should be considered when updating malaria-related communication and interventions.

AB  - Background: The Timor-Leste Ministry of Health has recently finalized the National Malaria Control Strategy for 2010-2020. A key component of this roadmap is to provide universal national coverage with long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) in support of achieving the primary goal of reducing both morbidity and mortality from malaria by 30% in the first three years, followed by a further reduction of 20% by end of the programme cycle in 2020 [ 1]. The strategic plan calls for this target to be supported by a comprehensive information, education and communication (IEC) programme; however, there is limited prior research into household and personal usage patterns to assist in the creation of targeted, effective, and socio-culturally specific behaviour change materials.
   Methods: Nine separate focus group discussions (FGDs) were carried out in Dili, Manatuto, and Covalima districts, Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, in July 2010. These focus groups primarily explored themes of perceived malaria risk, causes of malaria, net usage patterns within families, barriers to correct and consistent usage, and the daily experience of users (both male and female) in households with at least one net. Comprehensive qualitative analysis utilized open source analysis software.
   Results: The primary determinants of net usage were a widespread perception that nets could or should only be used by pregnant women and young children, and the availability of sufficient sleeping space under a limited number of nets within households. Both nuisance biting and disease prevention were commonly cited as primary motivations for usage, while seasonality was not a significant factor. Long-term net durability and ease of hanging were seen as key attributes in net design preference. Very frequent washing cycles were common, potentially degrading net effectiveness. Finally, extensive re-purposing of nets (fishing, protecting crops) was both reported and observed, and may significantly decrease availability of nighttime sleeping space for all family members if distributed nets do not remain within the household.
   Conclusions: Emphasizing that net usage is acceptable and important for all family members regardless of age or gender, and addressing the complex behavioural economics of alternative net usages could have significant impacts on malaria control efforts in Timor-Leste, as the country's programmes make progress towards universal net coverage.

TI  - Inventory and action plan for PFOS and related substances in Suriname as basis for Stockholm Convention implementation
T2  - EMERGING CONTAMINANTS
LA  - English
AB  - Within the framework of the Stockholm Convention implementation in Suriname, the first inventory of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) has been developed. The major stocks of PFOS are firefighting foams with minor stocks in pesticides (ant baits) and possibly carpets. The inventory of firefighting foams assessed the import, current stocks and major use sites and recent releases. Considerable amount of PFOS and potentially PFOS containing firefighting foams are stored at the military base, the oil company and small firefighting departments throughout the country. The total amount of stored PFAS firefighting foam in Suriname is estimated to be at least 275.6 tonnes, where the major stockpile of 206 tonnes is at the oil storage facilities. For some of these foams PFOS content is confirmed and for others it is not clear if the foam contains PFOS or other per- or polyfluorinated alkylated substances (PFAS). The upper estimate of PFOS content is 4133 kg in these foams. Additionally, PFOS or other PFAS has also been discovered in fire extinguishers in institutions. The total amount of PFOS related substance EtFOSA imported with the pesticide sulfluramid was 75 kg. The imports were banned in 2014 and is controlled. A considerable amount of synthetic carpets are in stores even produced before 2003 where main use of PFOS from 3 M took place possibly containing PFOS related substances. A compilation of potentially PFOS contaminated sites has been made. Potentially contaminated sites result from firefighting foam use, dumpsites and sulfluramid use. The airport where firefighting foam was applied is above a major drinking water reservoir, where an urgent assessment is needed. Due to the lack of analytical capacity for PFOS and precursors, drinking water, firefighting foam or impacted carpets, could not been analysed.
   An action plan for the control of PFOS and other PFAS has been developed considering the synergy of the Stockholm Convention and the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) addressing this emerging pollution issue for developing countries.

AB  - A palaeoecological investigation of a sediment core obtained from an artificial lake - the fishpond Vajgar (40 ha) near the town of Jindfichuv Hradec, southern Bohemia, has been carried out in connection with extensive multidisciplinary research preceding the removal of its sediment. Samples from selected standard profile were subjected to chemical, pollen, and palaeoalgological analyses in order to study the chronology of vegetation development, anthropogenic impact on the landscape, and the development of an artificial fishpond ecosystem. The palaeoecological record under study comprises the period of extensive change from pre-cultural, silver fir-dominated forest vegetation into managed, agricultural landscape dominated by cereal fields and pastures. After Medieval colonization, the proportion between wooded and open landscape changed, and the composition of original forests shifted to pine. Pollen spectra from the High Middle Ages are characterized by high percentages of anthropogenic indicators and closely resemble the results from urban deposits (cesspits, wells, communication horizons, etc.). This period can be subdivided into a first phase correlated with the High and Late Middle Ages and a second phase correlated with the post Medieval period and partly maybe also with the agricultural collectivization of the 20th century. The earlier phase has a rather uniform character with a significant presence of grazing indicators and cereal weeds. After the collectivization of the 1950s and later, a substantial change in agricultural practices can be detected: the large-scale use of herbicides affecting the composition of agricultural ruderal species (e.g. decline of cornflower (Centaurea cyanus), rye (Secale), etc.).
   The development of the aquatic system of the fishpond Vajgar was studied by means of chemical and palaeoalgological analyses. On the basis of observed changes in the composition of subfossil algal communities, the fishpond history can be split into four distinct phases. It is assumed that the progression over individual phases was caused by changes in water chemistry that can be interpreted as shifts in water quality caused by the urbanization of the surrounding areas as well as by changes in agricultural practices. The results of the investigation of some chemical elements (especially heavy metals) show stratigraphic patterns that can be related to historical events. These results show that the mixing and bioturbation of the sediment was not so significant as might be expected.

AB  - Background: Uncertainty remains about urinary bladder cancer (UBC) risk for many occupations. Here, we investigate the association between occupation, industry and UBC.
   Methods: Lifetime occupational history was collected by in-person interview for 604 newly diagnosed UBC patients and 604 cancer-free controls. Each job title was assigned a two-digit industry code and a three-digit occupation code. Odds ratios (ORs) for UBC associated with ever being employed in an industry or occupation were calculated by unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age, gender and smoking status. We also examined UBC risk by duration of employment (>0 to <10, >= 10 years) in industry or occupation.
   Results: Significantly increased risk of UBC was observed among waiters and bartenders (OR 2.87; 95% CI 1.05 to 7.72) and occupations related to medicine and health (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.21 to 3.92), agricultural production, livestock and animal specialties (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.03 to 3.49), electrical assembly, installation and repair (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.07 to 2.65), communications (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.00 to 3.01), and health services (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.44). For these occupations we also observed a significant excess risk of UBC for long-term work (i.e. >= 10 years), with the exception of waiters and bartenders. Employment for 10 years or more was associated with increased risk of UBC in general farmers (OR 9.58; 95% CI 2.18 to 42.05), agricultural production of crops (OR 3.36; 95% CI 1.10 to 10.27), occupations related to bench working (OR 4.76; 95% CI 1.74 to 13.01), agricultural, fishery, forestry & related (OR 4.58; 95% CI 1.97 to 10.65), transportation equipment (OR 2.68; 95% CI 1.03 to 6.97), and structural work (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.95).
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence of increased risk of UBC for occupations that were previously reported as at-risk. Workers in several occupation and industry groups have a significantly higher risk of UBC, particularly when duration of employment is 10 years or more.

AB  - Centruroides tecomanus is a medically important scorpion of the state of Colima (Mexico). This communication reports the identification of venom components of this scorpion with biological activity over insects/crickets (Acheta domestica), crustaceans/fresh water shrimps (Cambarellus montezumae), and mammalians/mice (Mus musculus, strain CD1). It also describes the pharmacological effects on cell lines in culture (L5178Y cells, HeLa cells, HuTu cells and Jurkat E6-1 cells), as well as on several types of bacteria (see below). The soluble venom of this scorpion was fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and collected separately in twelve independent fractions collected over 60 min run (5 min time apart each other). The HPLC components of fraction VII were lethal to all three species used for assay. The IVth fraction had a toxic effect on freshwater shrimps. In this species, fractions VI, VII and VIII were all lethal. For crickets, fractions V and VI were toxic and fraction VII was lethal. In mouse, the lethal components were found in fraction VII, whereas fraction VIII was toxic, but not lethal, at the doses assayed. The molecular weight of peptides from the various group of fractions were identified by mass spectrometry determination. Components lethal to mice showed molecular weights from 7013 to 7487 Da. Two peptides were obtained in homogeneous form and shown to be lethal to the three species of animal used for assay. The soluble venom tested on L5178Y cell line survival was shown to be cytotoxic, at 10-100 mu g/mL concentration, when compared to control murine splenocytes (p = 0.007). The soluble venom applied to Hela, Hutu and Jurkat cell lines did not show cytotoxic effects at these concentrations. On the contrary, it seems to have a proliferative effect. However the HPLC fractions I, III, VI and XII do have a cytotoxic effect on Jurkat E06-1 cells in culture at 200 mu/mL concentration. The antimicrobial activity of the venom fractions on Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa y Salmonella spp (gram-negative) was measured, using the liquid inhibition growth system. The four strains of bacteria used were susceptible to fractions III and IV, affecting all four bacterial strains at concentrations below 5 mu g/mL. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyanobacteria have been recognized for their advantageous impact on plant growth and development. The application of certain techniques has the potential to enhance various aspects of plant development, including growth, yield, proximate content (such as protein and carbohydrate levels), as well as the ability to withstand abiotic stresses such as herbicide exposure. The current investigation focused on examining the influence of bioactive compounds derived from the cyanobacterium Neowestiellopsis persica strain A1387 on enhancing the antioxidant and anyimicrobial activity of wheat plants in their defense against the plant pathogenic Sunn pest. The findings of the study indicate that the levels of H2O2 and GPx in wheat plants that were infected with aphids were significantly elevated compared to the treatments where aphids and cyanobacteria extract were present. The confirmation of these results was achieved through the utilization of confocal and fluorescent microscope tests, respectively. Furthermore, the findings indicated that the constituents of the cyanobacterial extract augmented the plant's capacity to withstand stress by enhancing its defense mechanisms. In a broader context, the utilization of cyanobacterial extract demonstrated the ability to regulate the generation and impact of oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), while concurrently enhancing the functionality of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzymes within wheat plants. This facilitation enabled the plants to effectively manage oxidative stress. Moreover, the findings of the antibacterial activity assessment conducted on the extract derived from cyanobacteria demonstrated notable susceptibility. The bacteria that exhibited the highest sensitivity to the extract of cyanobacterium Neowestiellopsis persica strain A1387 were staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conversely, salmonella typhi demonstrated the greatest resistance to the aforementioned extract. The potential impact of cyanobacteria extract on the antioxidative response of wheat plants to sunn pest infestation represents a novel contribution to the existing body of knowledge on the interaction between wheat plants and aphids.

AB  - Over 42 million people rely on Lake Victoria as their primary source of food, employment, and clean drinking water. The lake's fisheries have produced around one million tonnes in recent years, but the lake's growing population has resulted in a lower catch rate per capita. And the lake and its catchment have been negatively impacted by a wide variety of human activities, such as overfishing, oil spills, discharge of untreated waste, spread of invasive species, over-abstraction of water from the lake basin, and climate change, among other drivers of change. This paper presents existing research gaps, existing capacity, and presents a way forward for priority research on issues ranging from fish and fisheries, biodiversity, pollution, invasive species, aquaculture, human population growth and socio-economics, land use changes, habitat degradation, climate change and skills and knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to document: information that is currently available from previous research; the existing scientific capacity; and the resources required to guarantee that Lake Victoria becomes a heathy and biologically diverse resource for the millions of people who are dependent on it. It is clear from this synthesis that the biological, social, and economic benefits that can be derived from Lake Victoria can only be accomplished through the utilization of multi-disciplinary approaches in the research and monitoring of both basinwide and lake-wide biophysical processes, as well as the modeling of all potential interactions between the ecology of the basin and the lake.

AB  - Weeds can negatively impact crop yields and the ecosystem's health. While many weed management strategies have been developed and deployed, there is a greater need for the development of sustainable methods for employing integrated weed management. Gene drive systems can be used as one of the approaches to suppress the aggressive growth and reproductive behavior of weeds, although their efficacy is yet to be tested. Their popularity in insect pest management has increased, however, with the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, which provides specificity and precision in editing the target gene. This review focuses on the different types of gene drive systems, including the use of CRISPR-Cas9-based systems and their success stories in pest management, while also exploring their possible applications in weed species. Factors that govern the success of a gene drive system in weeds, including the mode of reproduction, the availability of weed genome databases, and well-established transformation protocols are also discussed. Importantly, the risks associated with the release of weed populations with gene drive-bearing alleles into wild populations are also examined, along with the importance of addressing ecological consequences and ethical concerns.

AB  - The suboptimal efficiency in pesticide utilization may elevate residues, posing safety risks to human food and non-target organisms. To address this challenge, delivery systems, such as pathogen infection stimuli-responsive carriers, can be employed to augment the efficiency of fungicide utilization. The bursting of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common defense response of host plants to pathogenic infections. In this study, ROS-responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) modified with phenyl sulfide (PHS) as azoxystrobin (AZOX) carrier (MSN-PHS-AZOX) were fabricated. Results demonstrated that MSN-PHS-AZOX exhibited fungicide release kinetics dependent on ROS. In vitro inhibition experiments confirmed the fungicidal effect of MSN-PHS-AZOX on Botrytis cinerea, relying on external ROS. In vivo leaf experiments showcased the superior persistence of MSN-PHS-AZOX in compared to AZOX SC. Furthermore, MSN-PHS-AZOX exhibits favorable biosafety and lower toxicity to aquatic zebrafish compared to AZOX SC, with no adverse impact on cucumber leaf growth. These findings suggest the potential application of this ROS-responsive nano fungicide in managing plant disease in agricultural fields.

AB  - Background: The etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is multifactorial, involving genetic and environmental contributors such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs).Objective: To evaluate the association between perinatal exposure to 27 potential EDCs and ASD among Norwegian children, and to further examine the neurodevelopmental toxicity of associated chemicals using zebrafish embryos and larvae.Method: 1,199 mothers enrolled in the prospective birth-cohort (HUMIS, 2002-2009) study. Breastmilk levels of 27 chemicals were measured: polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and perfluoroalkyl substances as a proxy for perinatal exposure. We employed multivariable logistic regression to determine association, utilized elastic net logistic regression as variable selection method, and conducted an in vivo study with zebrafish larvae to confirm the neurodevelopmental effect.Results: A total of 20 children had specialist confirmed diagnosis of autism among 1,199 mother-child pairs in this study. beta-Hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) was the only chemical associated with ASD, after adjusting for 26 other chemicals. Mothers with the highest levels of beta-HCH in their milk had a significant increased risk of having a child with ASD (OR = 1.82, 95 % CI: 1.20, 2.77 for an interquartile range increase in ln-transformed beta-HCH concentration). The median concentration of beta-HCH in breast milk was 4.37 ng/g lipid (interquartile range: 2.92-6.47), and the estimated daily intake (EDI) for Norwegian children through breastfeeding was 0.03 mu g/kg of body weight. The neurodevelopmental and social behavioral effects of beta-HCH were established in zebrafish embryos and larvae across various concentrations, with further analysis suggesting that perturbation of dopaminergic neuron development may underlie the neurotoxicity associated with beta-HCH.Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to beta-HCH was associated with an increased risk of specialist-confirmed diagnoses of ASD among Norwegian children, and the EDI surpasses the established threshold. Zebrafish experiments confirm beta-HCH neurotoxicity, suggesting dopaminergic neuron disruption as a potential underlying mechanism.

AB  - Edwardsiellosis causes severe economic losses in the aquaculture industry worldwide. Accurate identification of the fish pathogenic Edwardsiella species is crucial for preventing disease spread and providing effective treatment strategies in the aquaculture industry. These species have high phenotypic and genetic similarities (> 99% in 16S rRNA sequences), which makes their differentiation challenging. In this study, we developed a multiplex realtime PCR diagnostic assay based on the single-copy DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) gene using a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe to discriminate among four fish pathogenic Edwardsiella species, E. tarda, E. piscicida, E. anguillarum, and E. ictaluri. Through phylogenetic analysis based on gyrB sequences (1462 bp), 57 Korean Edwardsiella isolates were affiliated to E. piscicida, E. anguillarum, and E. tarda, accounting for host and geographical origin specificity. The assay targeted a conserved region in gyrB, and designed four probes, each capable of distinguishing among the four Edwardsiella species, even in cases of 1-3 nucleotide mismatch, based on differences in melting temperature. The assay exhibited high specificity and sensitivity, with reaction efficiency in the range 85-100% and a reliable quantifiable limit of 10(2) copies per reaction for all fluorescence signals. In addition, it could detect and quantify the four species, even in mixed infections, allowing accurate identification within 2 h in a single reaction. This PNA probe-based multiplex qPCR assay could be a practical and reliable diagnostic tool in the field and provide correct taxonomic assignment for further research on the widened host range and niche, pathogenicity, and susceptibility of each Edwardsiella species, to help establish appropriate treatment and vaccine strategies.

AB  - Tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) has been receiving great concerns owing to its ubiquitous occurrence in various environmental compartments and potential risks to wildlife and humans. Gill is structural basis for ion regulation and homeostasis in fish and susceptible to xenobiotics. However, current knowledge on the impacts of long-term exposure to TCEP on the structure and physiological function of fish gills are insufficient. In this work, zebrafish were exposed to environmental realistic concentrations (0.8, 4, 20 and 100 mu g/L) of TCEP from 3 h post ferterlization (hpf) till 120 days post ferterlization (dpf). Our results demonstrated that life-cycle exposure to TCEP significantly decreased the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST), but elevated the activities of anti -oxidative enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content in zebrafish gills. Gene transcription analysis implied that the mRNA expressions of antioxidant-related genes (nrf2, cat and nqo1) were induced, while the transcription of gst alpha 1, hmox1, keap1 were down-regulated, indicating that Nrf2-Keap1 pathway might be activated to defend the oxidative stress induced by TCEP. Additionally, the ion homeostasis was disrupted by TCEP exposure, evidenced by reduced activities of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), Ca2+-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase and downregulated transcription levels of ncc,nkcc, cftr and clc-3. Besides, whole-life exposure to TCEP resulted in a series of structural damages to gills, including epithelial lifting, epithelial rupture, telangiectasis, vacuolation, edema and shortened gill lamellae. Overall, our results demonstrated that long-term TCEP exposure could induce oxidative stress, affect ion regulation and cause histological changes in zebrafish gills.

AB  - Veterinary drug residues present in foods can pose severe health threats to the population. The present study aims to develop a high-resolution mass spectral library of 158 veterinary drugs of 16 different classes for their rapid identification in food samples through liquid chromatography-high-resolution electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HR-ESI-MS/MS). Standard drugs were pooled according to their log P values and exact masses before analysis. Spectra were collected at system automated collision energy, i.e., of 25-60 eV and four predetermined collision energies (10, 20, 30, and 40 eV) for each compound using a schedule precursor list of [M + H](+), [M + Na](+), and [M + NH4](+) ions. The utility of the developed database was checked by analyzing food samples. A total of 17 veterinary drugs based on the reference standard retention times (RTs), HR-MS spectra, and MS/MS spectra were identified in the analyzed samples. Moreover, five veterinary drugs were selected for quantitative analysis, including doxycycline hyclate, lincomycin, sulfasalazine, moxifloxacin, and diphenoxylate, using liquid chromatography-ion trap mass-spectrometry (LC-IT-MS). Concentrations of the drug were obtained to vary from 0.0805 to 0.9731 mg/kg in food samples and were found to be exceeded in most of the cases as per the maximum residue levels described by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO). The MS data were submitted to the MetaboLights online database (MTBLS2914). This study will help in the high-throughput screening of multiclass veterinary drugs in foodstuffs.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) play a strong role in sustaining millions of livelihoods, food security, nutrition, and income globally but the fishers engaged in this sector simultaneously experience high levels of vulnerability and processes of marginalisation. Several factors are attributed to the multidimensional vulnerabilities the small-scale fishers experience, spanning both natural (e.g., natural disasters, ecosystem change) and anthropogenic (e.g., policy change, hydrological interventions, aquaculture) pressures. While there is much literature on various natural and human drivers of vulnerability in small-scale fishery communities, an absence of research connecting vulnerability with water quality is evident. Fisher communities often talk about fish in relation to the health of their aquatic habitats wherein water quality is seen as a key parameter. The link between healthy fish and good quality water has significant implications for strong and viable fishing communities. This paper examines these links further by focusing on the nature of vulnerabilities caused by water quality changes in the small-scale fishery system of Chilika Lagoon in India. We undertake detailed analysis of the invasive shrimp aquaculture activities and hydrological interventions for opening of a lagoon inlet with the Bay of Bengal as two dominant drivers adversely impacting water quality and increasing vulnerabilities of the entire small-scale fisheries social-ecological system. Our analysis suggests that there are strong interconnections between changes in water quality and the levels of vulnerabilities in the SSFs of Chilika Lagoon. Pollutants such as pesticides, and organic compounds accumulate in fish tissues and affect their growth, reproduction, and overall health. This led to declines in fish populations, making it more difficult for fishers to make a living. In addition to direct impacts on fish populations, poor water quality also has indirect effects on the social and economic vulnerability of SSFs. For example, contamination of water sources led to the reduced number of fish species reducing the amount of time fishers can spend on fishing activities. This also affected the marketability of fish products, reduced income and increased poverty. To fully understand the interconnections between water quality and vulnerability in SSFs in Chilika Lagoon, it is important to consider both environmental and social factors, as well as the complex feedback loops between these factors. The study helps in bridging a crucial gap in our understanding of the role of water quality in vulnerability analysis within resource dependent communities. We conclude with key insights on possible coping responses and adaptive capacity necessary for the small-scale fisheries communities to transition toward viability.

AB  - Microplastics and pesticides are emerging contaminants in the marine biota, which cause many harmful effects on aquatic organisms, especially on fish. Fish is a staple and affordable food source, rich in animal protein, along with various vitamins, essential amino acids, and minerals. Exposure of fish to microplastics, pesticides, and various nanoparticles generates ROS and induces oxidative stress, inflammation, immunotoxicity, genotoxicity, and DNA damage and alters gut microbiota, thus reducing the growth and quality of fish. Changes in fish behavioral patterns, swimming, and feeding habits were also observed under exposures to the above contaminants. These contaminants also affect the Nrf-2, JNK, ERK, NF-?B, and MAPK signaling pathways. And Nrf2-KEAP1 signalling modulates redox status marinating enzymes in fish. Effects of pesticides, microplastics, and nanoparticles found to modulate many antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione system. So, to protect fish health from stress, the contribution of nano-technology or nano-formulations was researched. A decrease in fish nutritional quality and population significantly impacts on the human diet, influencing traditions and economics worldwide. On the other hand, traces of microplastics and pesticides in the habitat water can enter humans by consuming contaminated fish which may result in serious health hazards. This review summarizes the oxidative stress caused due to microplastics, pesticides and nano-particle contamination or exposure in fish habitat water and their impact on human health. As a rescue mechanism, the use of nano-technology in the management of fish health and disease was discussed.

AB  - People in coastal cities around the world harvest seafood from local bays despite well-documented health risks. In cities such as San Diego, California, USA, much information about contaminants and human consumption patterns exists for finfish but is largely lacking for shellfish. This study sought to better understand shellfish contamination risks and human vulnerability to inform management and advisories. In summer 2018 and winter 2019, we sampled crustaceans for chemical contaminants and anthropogenic debris and throughout the year surveyed people harvesting from three public fishing piers around San Diego Bay. Of the emerging contaminants found, pyrethroids, benzylbutyl phthalate, PFOS and anthropogenic debris were in differing concentrations in the muscle and viscera of the California spiny lobster and two species of crabs. Combined with previous metal and organic contaminant data from the lobster, 22 contaminants were detected with 5 exceeding consumption thresholds and 8 lacking defined thresholds. California spiny lobster was the main crustacean harvested from piers, attracting shellfishers from a range of ages, incomes, home locations and self-identified racial/ethnic groups. Consumption preferences (e.g., muscle or viscera) were non-discriminant, making lobster contamination a community-wide risk. More monitoring of emerging contaminants and different shellfish species (and tissues) of interest is recommended to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of health risks, especially because the use of bivalves as sentinels may not reveal the same risks (e.g., PFAS, phosphate flame retardants).

AB  - As the lowest organisms possessing T cells, fish are instrumental for understanding T cell evolution and immune defense in early vertebrates. This study established in Nile tilapia models suggests that T cells play a critical role in resisting Edwardsiella piscicida infection via cytotoxicity and are essential for IgM(+) B cell response. CD3 and CD28 monoclonal antibody crosslinking reveals that full activation of tilapia T cells requires the first and secondary signals, while Ca2+-NFAT, MAPK/ERK, NF-kappa B, and mTORC1 pathways and IgM(+) B cells collectively regulate T cell activation. Thus, despite the large evolutionary distance, tilapia and mammals such as mice and humans exhibit similar T cell functions. Furthermore, it is speculated that transcriptional networks and metabolic reprogramming, especially c-Myc-mediated glutamine metabolism triggered by mTORC1 and MAPK/ERK pathways, underlie the functional similarity of T cells between tilapia and mammals. Notably, tilapia, frogs, chickens, and mice utilize the same mechanisms to facilitate glutaminolysis-regulated T cell responses, and restoration of the glutaminolysis pathway using tilapia components rescues the immunodeficiency of human Jurkat T cells. Thus, this study provides a comprehensive picture of T cell immunity in tilapia, sheds novel perspectives for understanding T cell evolution, and offers potential avenues for intervening in human immunodeficiency.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) uses the in vivo fish acute toxicity test to assess potential risk of substances to non-target aquatic vertebrates. The test is typically conducted on a cold and a warm freshwater species and a saltwater species for a conventional pesticide registration, potentially requiring upwards of 200 or more fish. A retrospective data evaluation was conducted to explore the potential for using fewer fish species to support conventional pesticide risk assessments. Lethal concentration 50% (LC50) values and experimental de-tails were extracted and curated from 718 studies on fish acute toxicity submitted to USEPA. The LC50 data were analysed to determine, when possible, the relative sensitivity of the tested species to each pesticide. One of the tested freshwater species was most sensitive in 85% of those cases. The tested cold freshwater species was the most sensitive overall among cases with established relative sensitivity and was within 3X of the LC50 value of the most sensitive species tested in 98% of those cases. The results support potentially using fewer than three fish species to conduct ecological risk assessments for the registration of conventional pesticides.

AB  - Anthropogenic landscape transformations have promoted the provision of ecosystem services (ES) at the expense of other ES, biodiversity, and human well-being. We analysed the transformation portfolios of ES provisions, the costs of transformation, and the rivalry between ES categories and biodiversity conservation during the pre-communist and communist eras. We also examined EU influences in Romania's Danube River lowlands. The environmental history of social-ecological systems was used to: (1) map transformations of natural environments; (2) analyse the outputs of human modes of production, including crops, fish, timber, and livestock, using economic valuation methods and by appropriating the primary means of production; and (3) describe ideologies and values as drivers of ES transformations. During the communist era, the surface area of the agricultural land increased at the expense of natural ecosystems. This resulted in increased provisions being made for crops and timber at the expense of the fish supply; it also caused a reduction in livestock. The costs of land reclamation, hydrotechnical works, and the use of fertilizers and pesticides, resulted in a net annual loss of EUR 36 million for the entire case study area, disregarding the losses of other ES. Achieving a balanced portfolio of ES requires a discussion about the need for nature restoration, transdisciplinary social-ecological research, and the identification of key leverage points.

AB  - The severity of infectious diseases associated with the resistance of microorganisms to drugs highlights the importance of investigating bioactive compounds with antimicrobial potential. Therefore, nineteen synthetic cinnamides and cinnamates having a cinnamoyl nucleus were prepared and submitted for the evaluation of antimicrobial activity against pathogenic fungi and bacteria in this study. To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the compounds, possible mechanisms of antifungal action, and synergistic effects, microdilution testing in broth was used. The structures of the synthesized products were characterized with FTIR spectroscopy, (1) H-NMR, (13) C-NMR, and HRMS. Derivative 6 presented the best antifungal profile, suggesting that the presence of the butyl substituent potentiates its biological response (MIC = 626.62 mu M), followed by compound 4 (672.83 mu M) and compound 3 (726.36 mu M). All three compounds were fungicidal, with MFC/MIC <= 4. For mechanism of action, compounds 4 and 6 directly interacted with the ergosterol present in the fungal plasmatic membrane and with the cell wall. Compound 18 presented the best antibacterial profile (MIC = 458.15 mu M), followed by compound 9 (550.96 mu M) and compound 6 (626.62 mu M), which suggested that the presence of an isopropyl group is important for antibacterial activity. The compounds were bactericidal, with MBC/MIC <= 4. Association tests were performed using the Checkerboard method to evaluate potential synergistic effects with nystatin (fungi) and amoxicillin (bacteria). Derivatives 6 and 18 presented additive effects. Molecular docking simulations suggested that the most likely targets of compound 6 in C. albicans were caHOS2 and caRPD3, while the most likely target of compound 18 in S. aureus was saFABH. Our results suggest that these compounds could be used as prototypes to obtain new antimicrobial drugs.

AB  - Edwardsiella tarda (ET) and Edwardsiella anguillarum (EA) are the most harmful bacterial fish pathogens in Taiwan. However, there is confusion regarding the genotypic identification of E. tarda and E. piscicida (EP). Therefore, we used a novel Nanopore MinION MK1C platform to sequence and compare the complete genomes of E. piscicida and E. anguillarum. The number of coding genes, rRNA, and tRNA recorded for E. anguillarum and E. piscicida were 8322, 25, and 98, and 5458, 25, and 98, respectively. Ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST) for E. piscicida indicated 35 rps. The shared clusters between E. anguillarum and E. piscicida indicated several unique clusters for the individual genomes. The phylogenetic tree analysis for all complete genomes indicated that E. anguillarum and E. piscicida were placed into two species specific genotypes. Distribution of subsystems for annotated genomes found that genes related to virulence, defence, and disease for E. anguillarum were 103 and those for E. piscicida were 60 and pathogenic islands (PI) were 498 and 225, respectively. Vaccine candidates were identified in silico from the core genes using high antigenic, solubility, and secretion probabilities. Altogether, the genome data revealed distinctive features between E. anguillarum and E. piscicida, which suggest different pathogenicity and thus the need for separate preventive strategies.

AB  - Cyhalofop-butyl and pyribenzoxim are commonly used herbicides in rice-crayfish co-culture fields. In actual produc-tion, weed control in paddy fields is inseparable from cyhalofop-butyl and pyribenzoxim, while its risk to P. clarkii is still unclear. The present study investigated the risk of acute and subchronic toxicity of cyhalofop-butyl and pyribenzoxim to P. clarkii. The results showed that cyhalofop-butyl and pyribenzoxim exposure for 28 days could ac-cumulate in P. clarkii muscle and inhibit P. clarkii growth. Further research found that the malondialdehyde (MDA) level and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in muscle of P. clarkii were significantly increased after exposure to cyhalofop-butyl and pyribenzoxim (4 days and 28 days), and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were significantly altered. Histological results also confirmed cyhalofop-butyl and pyribenzoxim-induced muscle damage in P. clarkii. Additionally, after 28 days exposure to 1.02 mg/L cyhalofop-butyl and 10.4 mg/L pyribenzoxim, transcriptome analysis identified 2029 and 4246 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. Exposure to 1.02 mg/L cyhalofop-butyl significantly altered metabolism-related pathways, such as drug metabolism-other enzymes, glutathione metabolism, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, fatty acid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation. While the pathways related to antioxidant system and nutrient substances synthesis and meta-bolic were significantly enriched after exposure to 10.4 mg/L pyribenzoxim. This research has significant implications for scientific and rational use of herbicides under rice-crayfish co-culture and will contribute to the development of the highly productive agricultural model.

AB  - The adhesion molecule CD44 drives host defence in zebrafish by regulating apoptosis and autophagy.
   The cell adhesion molecule CD44 has been implicated in diverse biological functions including the pathological responses to infections and inflammatory diseases. The variable forms of CD44 contribute to functional variations, which are not yet defined in teleost. Here, we show that zebrafish CD44a plays a protective role in the host defense against Edwardsiella piscicida infection. Zebrafish CD44a deficiency inhibits cell growth and proliferation, impairs cell growth and death pathways, and regulates the expression levels of many genes involved in p53 signaling, apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, CD44a gene disruption in zebrafish leads to inhibition of apoptosis and induction of autophagy, with the increased susceptibility to E. piscicida infection. Furthermore, we show that zebrafish CD44a variants including CD44a_tv1 and CD44a_tv2 promote the translocation of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and interact with p53 in the cytoplasm. Mechanistically, zebrafish CD44a_tv1 mediates the beneficial effect for larvae survival infected with E. piscicida is depending on the CASP8-mediated apoptosis. However, the antibacterial effect of zebrafish CD44a_tv2 depends on the cytoplasmic p53-mediated inhibition of autophagy. Collectively, our results identify that different mechanisms regulate CD44a variants-mediated antibacterial responses.

AB  - Pesticides are the primary defending strategy against major biological invaders and important for ensuring national food security. Intelligent nanopesticides with precise controlled release modes are currently an emerging area of interest in the field of green, safe, and sustainable pesticide formulation. In this study, beta- cypermethrin (beta-CYP) was loaded into ZIF-8 by the one-pot method, which successfully prepared a pH-responsive delivery nanoparticle (beta-CYP/ZIF-8) to control termites. Results demon-strated that beta-CYP/ZIF-8 had a mean diameter of 188 +/- 2 nm and a loading capacity of approximately 21%. In vitro release experiments showed that beta-CYP/ZIF-8 releases better in acidic than in neutral conditions due to the presence of intermediate acid-unstable imidazole organic compounds. The acidic microenviron-ment in which termites thrive can promote beta-CYP release due to ZIF-8 decomposition, thus improving pesticide targeting and reducing toxic side effects. The bioactivity survey confirmed that beta-CYP/ZIF-8 could control termites (Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki) for a longer duration compared to commercial wettable powder (WP) and emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Moreover, an acute toxicity test showed an over 2-and 10-fold reduction in the acute toxicity of beta-CYP/ZIF-8 to earthworms and zebrafish, respectively, compared to that of commercial WP and EC. Finally, the cytotoxicity assay of beta-CYP/ZIF-8 showed higher safety to human hepatocyte LO2 cells. Overall, these beta-CYP/ZIF-8 nanoparticles, prepared using the one-pot method, have great application potential in sustainable pest management and protection of the ecological environment.

AB  - Climate change is affecting Antarctica and the Southern Ocean and effects have been already reported for the abiotic compartments of the ecosystems, e.g. ice loss and iceberg calving. Global warming can alter also the distribution of persistent organic pollutant (POPs) both at a global scale and in the Antarctic Region, due to their physical-chemical characteristics. Effects of climate changes have been already reported on feeding behaviour and reproductive process of organisms. Another consequence for organisms includes the POP bioaccumulation. Here we review the literature reporting the linkage between recorded effects of climate changes and POP bioaccumulation in resident marine Antarctic species (fish and penguins). Notwithstanding Antarctica is a final sink for persistent contaminants due to the extreme cold climate, a general decreasing POP trend has been observed for some POPs. Their concentrations in biota are reported to be linked to ice melting and large iceberg calving; the peculiar marine Antarctic ecosystems and the pelagic-benthic coupling may also contribute to alterations in the bioaccumulation processes. These effects are similar in polar regions, although the comparison with the Arctic biota is not possible due to the lack of data in the Antarctic Region. It remains an open question if the POP amount accumulated in the Antarctic ecosystems is decreasing or not.

AB  - Chemical pollution is among the fastest-growing agents of global change. Synthetic chemicals with diverse modes-of-action are being detected in the tissues of wildlife and pervade entire food webs. Although such pollutants can elicit a range of sublethal effects on individual organisms, research on how chemical pollutants affect animal groups is severely lacking. Here we synthesise research from two related, but largely segregated fields - ecotoxicology and behavioural ecology - to examine pathways by which chemical contaminants could disrupt processes that govern the emergence, self-organisation, and collec-tive function of animal groups. Our review provides a roadmap for prioritising the study of chemical pollutants within the context of sociality and highlights important methodological advancements for future research.

AB  - Organic food-waste is an ever growing environmental, economic, and social problem. One way to address this problem is to find new ways to valorise food waste in a circular economical manner. In this study, the concept of separating food from waste at its source in eateries was applied to obtain separated fish waste residues from the general waste of our university's canteen. This study is the first known attempt to use separated fish residues as soil amendments for soil biosolarization (SBS), a soil treatment method which is an environment-friendly alternative to chemical fumigation of soil. In this study a unique laboratory simulation system was used which mimics the conditions of field temperature, monitors the soil respiration and the follows the temporal profile of emitted volatile organic compounds. The fish waste residues were used as soil amendment in 2% wt. and the results showed elevated levels of aerobic soil respiration without unwanted CH4 emission. A different profile of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was also identified in the soils treated with fish residues. The profile of volatiles found in the soil with fish residues included changes in the amounts of compounds such as: Dimethylsulfide, Methanethiol and C9-aldehydes that have been found to supress soilborne plant pathogens. This is the first indication that VOCs can be used as indicators for the SBS process. Greenhouse studies and analyses of soils treated by fish residues showed no soil residual phytotoxicity affecting later growth of lettuce seedlings while not hindering the herbicidal effect of SBS on unwanted Bidens (Bidens pilosa) weeds. These results indicate that fish waste residues can be used as a soil amendment in the SBS process.

AB  - The host NF-KB signaling pathway plays critical role in defensing against bacterial infection. However, bacteria also evolve strategies to escape from host clearance. Edwardsiella piscicida is a threatening pathogen in aquaculture, while the molecular mechanism of E. piscicida in inhibiting NF-KB signaling remains largely unknown. Herein, using E. piscicida transposon insertion mutant library combined with a NF-KB luciferase reporter system, we identified forty-six genes of E. piscicida, which were involved in inhibiting the NF-KB signaling activation in vitro. Moreover, we further explored the top 10 significantly changed mutants through zebrafish larvae infection model and validated that six genes were involved in inhibiting NF-KB activation in vivo. Specifically, we identified the adenylosuccinate synthase mutated strain (Delta purA) infection exhibited a robust activation of NF-KB signaling, along with higher expression of cxcl8a and cxcl8b to mediate the recruitment of neutrophils in vivo. Taken together, these results identified the key factors of E. piscicida in inhibiting NF-KB activation, which will contribute to better understanding the pathogenesis of this important pathogen.

AB  - Background Social-ecological systems are based on particular species and on their direct and human-mediated interactions. The 'golden humped tench' or tinca gobba dorata, a variety of tench-Tinca tinca (L., 1758)-traditionally bred in artificial ponds called peschiere in Poirino highlands, northwest Italy, is one of such species. The aim of the study is to investigate the traditional farming of the golden humped tench, the associated knowledge, practices, and gastronomy, and to discuss the changes that the tench, the ponds, and their role in the local social-ecological system are going through. Methods The data analyzed were collected in different locations of Poirino highlands during May-September 2021. Fieldwork included semi-structured interviews (n = 23) with current and former tench farmers about the breeding and gastronomy of the tench and the management of the peschiere. The interviewees' selection occurred through an exponential non-discriminative snowball sampling, and interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed through inductive thematic content analysis. Results The golden humped tench has been farmed for centuries in ponds used also to water livestock and to irrigate cultivated fields, and managed by every peasant household in the area. This integrated aquaculture system is underpinned by detailed knowledge on the peschiera ecosystem and on the tench life cycle and supports a gastronomic knowledge that is part of the local heritage. The ongoing process of gastronomic valorization of the tench is sustaining the role of the fish in locals' livelihoods and as a marker of regional identity, but it is also transforming tench farming, already threatened by livelihood change, pesticides, and invasive species, in controversial ways. Conclusions We argue that ponds and tenches are core elements of the local social-ecological system, defining the cultural landscape and engendering a form of regional identity around them. Studying integrated aquaculture systems and associated knowledge and practices is relevant to design sustainable systems of food production and to address possibilities of conservation of biodiversity and livelihoods in aquatic environments.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the socio-environmental and health effects of sugarcane crops in a county in the Zona da Mata of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. A collective mapping was carried out with use of social cartography. The issues investigated were plotted on maps, whose final versions were elaborated by means of the ArcGIS 10.2 software. The study was carried out in the district of Tejucupapo, located in the mu-nicipality of Goiana, selected due to its proximity to the sugarcane fields. In the environment there was an increase in deforestation, mangrove de-gradation, silting of rivers, reduction of fish and contamination of water and other crops by pes-ticides and sewage. For health, respiratory pro-blems were pointed out by sugarcane burning, pesticide poisoning and the precariousness of the governmental health care. In the socio-cultural dimension, conflicts related to land use and oc-cupation were identified, with loss, expropriation and destruction of historical objects and symbols of the community, reflecting the loss of cultural identity. The problems related to sugarcane pro-duction severely affect human health and destroy the territory both in its environmental aspects and the very identity construction of the community, threatening traditional livelihoods.

AB  - Triphenyltin (TPT) is a representative organotin often used in marine antifouling coatings, herbicides, and pesticides. However, leaching of TPT into water may be toxic to aquatic life. In this study, environmental concentrations of TPT were used to explore reproductive toxicity of TPT to Brachionus plicatilis, a representative marine rotifer. Toxicity was examined at individual, biochemical, and molecular levels and via phenotypic traits. Rotifers exposed to 10 ng/L TPT group showed increased population size, improved reproductive rate, and a higher weekly growth rate. At 100 ng/L TPT group, the greatest degree of oxidative damage was seen. Exposure to 200 ng/L TPT group shorten generation time, delayed reproduction, and obscured the reproductive peak. Expression of the Vasa gene associated with reproduction was increased after exposure to 10 and 200 ng/L TPT group and decreased at 100 ng/L TPT group. High concentrations of TPT reduced rotifer body length and width and slowed swimming speed. Findings provide a better understanding of the adverse effects of changing TPT concentrations on marine rotifer, by the life cycle parameters, oxidative stress defense mechanisms, expression of a gene related to reproduction, and phenotypic traits. This paper firstly analyzed the reproductive toxicity of environmental levels of organotin compounds to zooplankton, which provided new data support for the comprehensive evaluation of its marine ecological toxicity.

AB  - Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a hallmark inflammatory cytokine that can induce a variety of cells to produce immune related factors, and plays a critical role in host defend itself against invasion by pathogens, which signals through a distinct receptor subclass-IL-17R. In our study, seven IL-17 and eight IL-17R family members were identified in black rockfish. Subsequently, phylogenetic relationships, gene structures and syntenic analysis were performed to confirm the annotation and homology of these genes during evolution. Except for eight positive selection sites were detected in IL-17RA1, IL-17RC1 and IL-17RD, most of gene sites were underwent purification selection. The mRNA levels of IL-17 and IL-17R genes were higher in immune-related tissues. Additionally, the expressions of IL-17RA1 and IL-17RE1 in spleen were dramatically induced by A. salmonicida treatment, as well as IL-17RA1, IL17RB, IL-17RC1 and IL-17RE1 in liver, which indicated their important roles in antimicrobial infections. Furthermore, the expression patterns of IL-17 and IL-17R genes in mucosal tissues in response to E. piscicida infection were investigated, of which some members were dramatically induced, particularly for IL-17A/F1 and IL-17A/F3 in skin, IL-17A/F2 in gill, IL-17RB in intestine, IL-17RA1 and IL-17RC1 in skin and gill, suggests their potential essential roles in innate immune response. In summary, this study provides a systemic overview of the IL-17 and IL-17R gene families in black rockfish, which is of great importance to further study the functional characteristics of these genes.

AB  - IntroductionWe aimed to develop a comprehensive risk assessment tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and any dementia, that will be applicable in high and low resource settings. MethodRisk factors which can easily be assessed in most settings, and their effect sizes, were identified from an umbrella review, or estimated using meta-analysis where new data were available. ResultsSeventeen risk/protective factors met criteria for the algorithm to estimate risk for any dementia including age, sex, education, hypertension, midlife obesity, midlife high cholesterol, diabetes, insufficient physical activity, depression, traumatic brain injury, atrial fibrillation, smoking, social engagement, cognitive engagement, fish consumption (diet), stroke, and insomnia. A version for AD excluded atrial fibrillation and insomnia due to insufficient evidence and included pesticide exposure. There was insufficient evidence for a VaD risk score. DiscussionValidation of the tool on external datasets is planned. The assessment tool will assist with implementing risk reduction guidelines.

AB  - Exploring the contamination profile of multi-class emerging contaminants (ECs) in wastewater is highly desirable. To this end, the occurrence, removal, mass loading and risks associated with a large panel of pharmaceuticals and personal care products, illicit drugs, perfluorinated compounds and organophosphate flame retardants in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the region of Thessaloniki (Greece) after a survey is illustrated. Influent and effluent wastewaters were submitted to solid phase extraction on Oasis HLB cartridges, followed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Orbitrap MS). Influent concentrations in both WWTPs were notably higher than effluent, with caffeine, acetaminophen, irbesartan and valsartan being the most ubiquitous compounds, exhibiting elevated concentrations. Average effluent concentrations ranged from below the method quantification limits (mu L-1 scale), such as for caffeine, acetaminophen, diclofenac, irbesartan and valsartan, among others. Removal efficiencies ranged between -273% for lamotrigine and 100%, i.e., for the UV filter BPI. Notably, the polar compounds such as cytarabine, methotrexate and capecitabine were removed at a rate >80% in both WWTPs, allowing the correlation between logK(ow) and removals. Interesting trends for the illicit drugs were revealed by means of mass loading estimation, as in the case of benzoylecgonine (71.6 mg/day/1000 inhabitants). Ecotoxicological risk assessment was evaluated for both single components and mixture, using three approaches: risk quotient (RQ), risk quotient considering frequency (RQ(f)) and toxic units (TU). Irbesartan and teimisartan posed a high risk in all trophic levels, while fish was the most sensitive taxa for diclofenac. This work aspires to intensify the surveillance programs for the receiving water bodies, as well as to motivate the investigation of toxicity to non-target organisms. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Malaria parasites are transmitted to humans by infectious female Anopheles mosquitoes. Chemical-insecticide-based mosquito control has been successful in reducing the burden of malaria. However, the emergence of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors and concerns about the effect of the chemicals on the environment, human health, and non-target organisms present a need for new or alternative vector control intervention tools. Biocontrol methods using aquatic invertebrate predators have emerged as a potential alternative and additional tool to control mosquito populations. Ecological control specifically makes use of species insights for improving the physical habitat conditions of competitors and predators of vectors. A first step towards this is to gain knowledge on the predation potential of several typically present macroinvertebrates. Hence, this study aimed at (1) examining the influence of the predation of hemipterans on the number of emerging adult mosquitoes and (2) detecting Anopheles mosquito DNA in the gut of those predators. The prey and predators were collected from a range of water bodies located in the Gilgel Gibe watershed, southwest Ethiopia. A semi-field study was carried out using mesocosms which were constructed using plastic containers mimicking the natural aquatic habitat of immature Anopheles mosquitoes. Adult mosquitoes that emerged from the mesocosms were collected using a mechanical aspirator. At the end of the experiment, predators were withdrawn from the mesocosms and identified to genus level. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was employed to identify sibling species of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and to detect Anopheles mosquito DNA in the gut of the predators. Data were analysed using R software. Giant water bugs (belostomatids) were the most aggressive predators of Anopheles larvae, followed by backswimmers (notonectids) and water boatmen (corixids). All female Anopheles gambiae s.l. emerged from the mesocosms were identified as Anopheles arabiensis. Anopheles arabiensis DNA was detected in the gut content of hemipteran specimens analysed from the three families. The number of the adult mosquitoes emerging from the mesocosms was affected by the presence of predators. The findings of this study provide evidence of the potential use of aquatic macroinvertebrate predators as biocontrol agents against immature Anopheles mosquitoes and their potential to be considered as a component of integrated vector management for insecticide resistance and the combined restoration of aquatic ecosystems via smart ecological engineering.

AB  - One of the major goals in aquaculture is to protect fish against infectious diseases as disease outbreaks could lead to economic losses if not controlled. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a class of highly conserved peptides known to possess direct antimicrobial activities against invading pathogens, were evaluated for their ability to protect Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus and hybrid catfish (female Channel Catfish x male Blue Catfish I. furcatus) against infection caused by the fish pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila ML09-119. To identify effective peptides, the minimum inhibitory concentrations against bacterial pathogens Edwardsiella ictaluri S97-773, Edwardsiella piscicida E22-10, A. hydrophila ML09-119, Aeromonas veronii 03X03876, and Flavobacterium columnare GL-001 were determined in vitro. In general and overall, cathelicidins derived from alligator and sea snake exhibited more potent and rapid antimicrobial activities against the tested catfish pathogens as compared to cecropin and pleurocidin AMPs and ampicillin, the antibiotic control. When the peptides (2.5 mu g of peptide/g of fish) were injected into fish and simultaneously challenged with A. hydrophila through immersion, increased survival rates in Channel Catfish and hybrid catfish were observed in both cathelicidin (alligator and sea snake) treatments as compared to other peptides and the infected control (P < 0.001) with alligator cathelicidin being the overall best treatment. Bacterial numbers in the kidney and liver of Channel Catfish and hybrid catfish also decreased (P < 0.05) for cathelicidin-injected groups at 24 and 48 h after challenge infection. These results show the potential of cathelicidin to protect catfish against bacterial infections and suggest that an approach overexpressing the peptide in transgenic fish, which is the long-term goal of this research program, may provide a method of decreasing bacterial disease problems in catfish as delivering the peptides via individual injection or feeding would not be economically feasible.

AB  - The giant otter, Pteronura brasiliensis, (Zimmermann, 1780), is a semiaquatic carnivore that feeds mainly on fish. Mercury has high toxicity and high potential for bioaccumulation in tissues and biomagnification in organisms through food chains. Thus, as a top predator in the trophic chain, the giant otter has the potential to accumulate mercury by biomagnification. The objective of the present study was to measure the total mercury concentration in giant otter fur samples from an area in the southern Brazilian Pantanal. Fur samples from 19 otters from different social groups were collected from captured animals or were sampled with biopsy darts. Total mercury determination was performed by cold steam spectrophotometry. Mercury concentrations found in the giant otter fur were 7.15 +/- 3.41 mu g g(-1) (2.01-12.06 mu g g(-1)) dry weight. The values are above to the upper limit found in fur samples of otter species not exposed to contamination sources, which typically range from 1 to 5 mu g g(-1). The concentrations found in the study area indicate that even in the southern Pantanal, which is approximately 475 km from gold mining activity, mercury can be considered a threat for giant otters, as well as for riverside populations. It is also important to consider that other anthropogenic sources of mercury, such as pesticides used in agriculture, could affect this population.

AB  - Annona mucosa Jacq. (Annonaceae) is an edible plant whose fruit is appreciated in the Amazon region of Brazil. The seeds of this plant are rich sources of acetogenins, substances that have antimicrobial, anticancer, repellent, insecticide and larvicidal activities. However, studies on larvicidal evaluation of these substances are almost always limited to the species Aedes aegypti, with few studies with the species Aedes albopictus. In this research, it was investigated the larvicidal effect and mechanisms of action of the ethanolic extract and of the main constituents of Annona mucosa against Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The compounds were isolated from the ethanolic seed extract by successive silica gel chromatographic columns and characterized by NMR and Infrared spectroscopic analysis, as well as by comparison with literature data, as the acetogenins rolliniastatin 1 and rollinicin. Third- and fourth-instar larvae were submitted to different concentrations of ethanolic extract, rolliniastatin 1 and rollinicin to estimate the LC50 and LC90 after 24 h exposure. The ethanolic extract and rolliniastatin 1 were more active against Ae. albopictus, with LC50 values of 0.55 and 0.20 mu g.mL-1, respectively, compared with Ae. aegypti, on which they exhibited values of 2.60 and 0.43 mu g.mL-1, respectively. Rollinicin was, on the contrary, more active against Ae. aegypti (LC50 of 0.78 mu g.mL-1) than against Ae. albopictus (LC50 of 1.13 mu g.mL-1). Significant differences were observed among enzymatic activities of larvae treated with natural products obtained from Annona mucosa and histopathological analysis of the midgut of treated larvae suggested the existence of two action mechanisms. EEAM and main acetogenins, rolliniastatin 1 and rollinicin did not present toxicity against zebrafish. The results demonstrate the larvicidal potential of seeds ethanolic extract and acetogenins from A. mucosa as green larvicidal agents for the control of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus.

AB  - Tebuthiuron (TBU) is a phenylurea herbicide that is extensively used in sugarcane fields. Owing to the low degradation rate, highwater solubility, and leaching potential, TBU is believed to have harmful effects on aquatic organisms, such as anuran tadpoles. Contaminant effects can be influenced by temperature since increases in temperature are often associated with increased metabolic reactions. In this study, we evaluated the influence of temperature on the negative effects of TBU in bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) through a multibiomarker approach. Tadpoles were exposed to 0 (control) 10, 50, and 200 ng L-1 of TBU for 16 days at 25 and 32 degrees C. TBU increased the transcript levels of genes involved in biotransformation (glutathione S-transferase, GST, and sulfotransferase, SULT) and antioxidant (superoxide dismutase, SOD, and catalase, CAT) enzymes. TBU exposure also increased CAT and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, whereas SOD and carboxylesterase activities were decreased. The highest temperature caused a decrease in the activities of ethoxyresorufin-Odeethylase and SOD but increased the activities of GST, GPx, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and acetylcholinesterase. No effects of temperature or TBU exposure were observed in genotoxic markers (frequencies of micronucleous and nuclear abnormalities) or in lipid peroxidation levels. Tadpoles exposed to TBU at all tested concentrations presented a higher index of biomarker responses than that of the control groups. Higher values of severity scores from histological analyses were found in the liver of tadpoles exposed to 50 and 200 ng L-1 of TBU at 32 degrees C compared with those of the control group at the same temperature.

AB  - Among fifty fables featuring animals, birds, and insects, the least attention was paid by the Kalmyk poets to ichthyological and insecticidal characters. The relevance of the article is determined by the lack of knowledge of the bestial aspect of the fable in the 20th century Kalmyk poetry. The author's target is the bestial material with characters primarily from the world of fish and insects on the samples of the representative fables by M. Erdniev, G. Shalburov, B. Dordzhiev, D. Kugultinov, T. Bembeev, S. Baidiev, M. Khoninov. The purpose of the article is to identify the specific and quantitative composition of ichthyological and insecticide characters in the plot of the selected fables, to reveal the features of the conflict and the dialogic strategy of the authors, to determine the structure and function of the maxim or morality in the didactics of the genre, to show the connection between the literary fable and national folklore, namely a fairy tale, a proverb, as well as with modernity. The historical, literary, comparative and comparative approaches have shown the following: 1) there are no fantastic creatures in the fables, just ordinary representatives from the world of fish (predatory and non-predatory, rivers and seas), from the world of insects (the gadfly, the fly, the ant, the dragonfly), in addition, the worm and the frog; 2) the conflict conveys the opposition: truth and lies, good and evil, power and impotence, the sublime and the base, word and deed, stupidity and wisdom, greed and selflessness; 3) the production theme is associated with meetings, courts, careerism; 4) typologically, the Kalmyk fables, while retaining their originality, partially correlate with the Russian fable classics.

AB  - Advances in proteomics have greatly improved chemical toxicity assessment and predictions of adverse out-comes in organisms. Ecotoxicoproteomics has been employed to elucidate biological pathways affected by chemicals and provide data that can be incorporated into adverse outcome pathways (AOP) to better define the ecological risk of emerging pollutants. Microplastics (MPs) and plastic additives have raised global concern due to their widespread use in aquatic environments, bioaccumulation in tissues, and toxic effects in aquatic organisms. Despite showing sublethal toxicity in many cases, mechanisms underlying these emerging pollutants are underexplored. In this review, adverse effects and recent ecotoxicoproteomic studies of MPs and typical additives (i.e. plasticizers, flame retardants, antioxidants, and UV stabilizers) in aquatic organisms are summarized. Proteomics data show that MPs adversely affect ingestion and reproduction via disrupting pathways related to energy metabolism, stress-related defense, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Biological processes including lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, skeletal development, neurotransmitter signaling, and immune response are modulated by additives and induce developmental malformations in fish embryos/larvae. Furthermore, plastic additives also exert reproductive toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity in invertebrates (e.g. mussel, abalone, and oyster) and fish by disrupting detoxification/oxidative stress, hormonal modulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis. Additional studies are needed to complement the omic knowledge of chemical additives that are not well documented (e.g. UV stabilizers) for improving understanding into toxic mechanisms and for characterizing ecological risk linked to plastic contaminants.

AB  - The mode of persistence of Phytophthora cinnamomi, a highly aggressive soil- and water-borne pathogen, remains unclear. This study investigated the survival of viable oospores and chlamydospores of P. cinnamomi when present as free propagules in untreated soil, or in soil subject to four exogenous treatments: smoke water, fish emulsion and two fungicides (ridomil and furalaxyl). The exogenous treatments were applied under moist and dry soil conditions. Spore viability was determined by the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining technique, with a qPCR assay used to compare general patterns of decline. Over 96% of oospores lost viability over a period of 48 weeks irrespective of soil moisture conditions. The mean percentage viability for oospores decreased from 91% at time zero to 72, 35, 20 and 1% after 6, 12, 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. Reduction in viability of chlamydospores was more rapid than oospores, with viability declining from 92% to zero after 12 weeks. There was no significant difference between untreated soil and the exogenous treatments. The RNA-based qPCR assay indicated a strong presence of viable oospores of P. cinnamomi up to week 12 for moist soil and week 3 for dry soil, but thereafter failed to detect RNA even though viable oospores could be detected by MTT staining. Based on the MTT staining, this study indicated that viability of P. cinnamomi oospores may be entirely lost within 1 year and that of chlamydospores within 3 months for the soil type tested. Therefore, oospores and chlamydospores when existing as free propagules in soil appear unlikely to be involved in the long-term survival of P. cinnamomi.

AB  - Streptococcus iniae (S. iniae) is a Gram-positive bacterium associated with disease in several commercial species and other animals including humans. This zoonotic pathogen has led to high worldwide morbidity and mortality and huge economic losses in aquaculture. Here a S. iniae ghost (SIG) vaccine was successfully generated with a chemical method, and its immunogenicity and protective efficacy were examined in this study. The results showed that the titres of immunoglobulin M (IgM) in serum were significantly higher in group A (SIG-immunized) than group B (formalin-inactivated S. iniae, FSI-immunized), which was significantly higher than the control group (PBS-treated). Also, the phagocytic activity was significantly higher in group A than group B, which was significantly higher than the control group. Moreover, AKP activity and lysozyme activity of serum in group A were significantly higher than group B, which was significantly higher than the control group. Also, IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma and HSP70 in the head kidney of fish immunized with SIG and FSI showed significantly higher than the control group throughout the whole experimental period. In addition, IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma in the spleen of fish immunized with SIG showed significantly higher than that of in the FSI-immunized fish. Most important, the survival rate and relative per cent survival of group A were higher than group B, and both of them were all significantly more protected against the S. iniae challenge compared to the PBS-treated group. These results suggest that immunization with SIG induces immune responses and provides protection against a virulent S. iniae challenge.

AB  - Objective:This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and factors potentially associated with the development of actinic cheilitis (AC) in Brazilian rural workers.
   Subjects and methods: A professional performed all physical examinations and evaluations using semi-structured questionnaires in 240 rural workers.
   Results: Eighty-three participants were diagnosed with AC (34.6%). It was more prevalent among workers older than 45 years (3.29-10.96 95% IC; OR = 3.30;p = .0018), Caucasians (phototypes I and II) (4.78-16.12 95% IC; OR = 10.81;p < .0001), illiterate individuals (2.16-21.59 95% IC; OR = 10.43;p = .0037), those with 6 or fewer years of formal schooling (2.03-7.89 95% IC; OR = 4.63;p = .0013), those regularly using pesticides (1.58-6.64 95% IC; OR = 2.79;p = .0260) and those who used the private health service in their last appointment (1.17-3.54 95% IC; OR = 2.72;p = .0083).
   Conclusion: There was a substantial prevalence of AC among rural workers with advanced age, white skin, and illiteracy, those with lower levels of education, those who regularly use pesticides, and those who utilised private health services in their last appointment. Thus, healthcare strategies that include rural workers are required for the control and prevention of AC in both public and private health services.

AB  - In addition to environmental pollution issues, social concerns about the sustainability, safety, and quality of conventionally grown fruits and vegetables have been increasing. In order to evaluate if there were any microbiological differences between samples of organic and conventional lettuce, a wide range of parameters were tested, including pathogens and indicator organisms: the enumeration of Escherichia coli; the detection of Salmonella spp.; the detection/enumeration of Listeria monocytogenes; the enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. yeasts and molds, and Enterobacteriaceae. This study also evaluated the chemical safety of the lettuce samples, quantifying the nitrate concentration and 20 pesticides (14 organochlorine and 6 organophosphorus pesticides). Significant differences (p < 0.05) between the conventional and organic samples were only detected for the counts of total microorganisms at 30 degrees C. Pathogens were absent in all the samples. The analytical method, using the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) approach for pesticide extraction, was suitable for detecting the targeted analytes; the limit of quantification (LOQ) was between 0.6 and 1.8 mu g/kg (lower than the Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) established by EU legislation). In three organic lettuce samples, one organochlorine pesticide (alpha-HCH) was observed below the MRLs. For the samples analyzed and for the parameters investigated, except for the total mesophilic counts, the organic and conventional lettuces were not different.

AB  - Food allergies are a global food challenge. For correct food labelling, the detection and quantification of allergens are necessary. However, novel product formulations and industrial processes produce new scenarios, which require much more technological developments. For this purpose, OMICS technologies, especially proteomics, seemed to be relevant in this context. This review summarises the current knowledge and studies that used proteomics to study food allergens. In the case of the allergenic proteins, a wide variety of isoforms, post-translational modifications and other structural changes during food processing can increase or decrease the allergenicity. Most of the plant-based food allergens are proteins with biological functions involved in storage, structure, and plant defence. The allergenicity of these proteins could be increased by the presence of heavy metals, air pollution, and pesticides. Targeted proteomics like selected/multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) have been very useful, especially in the case of gluten from wheat, rye and barley, and allergens from lentil, soy, and fruit. Conventional 1D and 2-DE immunoblotting have been further widely used. For animal-based food allergens, the widely used technologies are 1D and 2-DE immunoblotting followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF, and more recently LC-MS/MS, which is becoming useful to assess egg, fish, or milk allergens. The detection and quantification of allergenic proteins using mass spectrometry-based proteomics are promising and would contribute to greater accuracy, therefore improving consumer information.

AB  - Continued population growth could lead to protein deficiency in the human diet. To counteract this risk, attempts are being made to identify new edible sources of protein. The aim of this paper was to review the existing literature and to analyse the current state of yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) rearing for food and feed, especially in Europe. The yellow mealworm is the most widely bred and traded insect species in Europe that has high feed conversion ratio; 3.4 to 6.1 kg of feed ingested per kg of harvested larvae. Mealworms could compete with livestock due to their high protein and fat content and low environmental impact. Mealworms have been extensively researched as a source of feed for animals, including poultry, fish, pets and birds. Its nutrient content depends on the processing method, where thermal processing is least desirable. Mealworms are characterised by a high and variable microbial load which has to be reduced before consumption. The antibiotics, pesticides and other substances should also be analysed to ensure that mealworms are a safe protein source for human consumption. The nutritional benefits of mealworms have to be communicated to European consumers who are generally averse to eating insects.

AB  - In artisanal fishing communities in Chile, the access to occupational safety and health (OSH) is limited by factors such as the informality of employment. Our objective was to analyze the working and health conditions of workers in a coastal town in Southern Chile, under a community-based participatory approach. We carried out two independent social dialogue workshops within the community. The first one (N of participants = 25) was aimed to identify the strengths, weaknesses and challenges for preventing decompression sickness among divers. The second workshop (N of participants = 10) was set to identify the work processes and to map the occupational risks during seafood harvesting and processing in the community. Community members' training for handling and preventing decompression sickness among divers, and the collaboration between a local health representative, stakeholders and authorities, were identified as contributing factors in reducing fatalities and sequels among divers in the past. Technology and safety on board the vessels, training of healthcare personnel in OSH, and access to health programs, were identified as remaining challenges. Through risk mapping, the participants identified the relationship between working and health conditions in the community, reinforcing the necessity of improving access to health and social security. The community participation in identifying and analyzing working and health conditions could be the first step for a strategy to address OSH through primary health care in rural communities. Community empowerment and involvement in action plans, training on basic OSH for health care workers, and public policies are required.

AB  - Sulfated polysaccharides derived from green seaweeds exhibit many beneficial biological activities and have great potential to be used as nutraceutical in aquaculture. In this work, we evaluated the effects of the sulfated polysaccharide ulvan from Ulva ohnoi on Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) juveniles at the transcriptomic level. Cytotoxicity assay performed in liver primary cell cultures from sole determined that the different ulvan concentrations assayed did not impair cell viability. Juveniles were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with ulvan (0.5 mg/fish) followed by a challenge with Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) at 7 days. RNASeq analyses at 2 days post injection (dpi) revealed that 402 transcripts were differentially expressed in liver between ulvan IP injected and control groups before the challenge. Genes related to bacterial and antiviral defence, complement system, chemokines, proteasomes and antigen presentation were upregulated in ulvan treated groups. A detailed expression analysis of sixteen genes related to innate and adaptive immune system was performed in two systemic tissues: liver and spleen. Ulvan injection provoked the upregulation of tlr22 and a transient inflammatory response was initiated in both liver and spleen at 2 dpi. As consequence, expression of acute phase proteins, antimicrobial peptides and complement genes was induced. Moreover, expression of mhcI, mhcII, psmb10 and bcl6 was also induced 2 dpi. M 2 dpi with Phdp, inflammatory cytokines and genes related to bacterial and antiviral defense, iron metabolism, complement system and antigen presentation were differentially modulated in survival juveniles previously IP injected with ulvan. Moreover, mortality was retarded in ulvan treated juveniles. These results provide new evidence about the role of ulvan as a bioactive compound with immunomodulatory activity in Senegalese sole as well as its possible use as vaccine adjuvant against Phdp. This is the first published study that evaluates the transcriptomic response of Senegalese sole IP injected with ulvan.

AB  - Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is an organophosphate ester (OPE) used as a flame retardant (FR) and plasticizer. TPHP has previously been shown to disrupt behaviour in fish and mammals, but to our knowledge, this is the first study on the behavioural effects of TPHP in birds. Early life stage Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were exposed to nominal doses of 0 ng/g (vehicle-control), 5 ng/g (low dose), 50 ng/g (mid dose), and 100 ng/g (high dose) TPHP, both as embryos (via air cell injection prior to incubation) and as chicks (via daily gavage until 5 days post-hatch). The low dose reflects TPHP levels recorded in wild avian eggs, but actual environmental exposure levels may be higher given that TPHP is known to be rapidly metabolized in birds. We previously reported that the chicks exposed to TPHP in this study experienced reduced growth and resting metabolic rate, and sex-specific changes in thyroid function. The current study focuses on behavioural endpoints. We found that high-TPHP chicks exhibited less neophobia than vehicle-controls, and low-TPHP chicks exhibited more aggression towards conspecifics. No differences were observed in the responses of Japanese quail chicks to activity or tonic immobility (fear response) tests. These data add weight of evidence to previous findings suggesting that TPHP, among other OPEs, can disrupt ecologically-relevant behaviours in exposed vertebrates.

AB  - Interest in behavioural ecotoxicology is growing, partly due to technological and computational advances in recording behaviours but also because of improvements of detection capacity facilitating reporting effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. The peer-reviewed literature now contains studies investigating the effects of chemicals, including pesticides and pharmaceuticals, on migration, dispersal, aggression, sociability, reproduction, feeding and anti-predator behaviours in vertebrates and invertebrates. To understand how behavioural studies could be used in regulatory decision-making we: (1) assessed the legal obstacles to using behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation; (2) analysed the known cases of use of behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation; and (3) provided examples of behavioural endpoints of relevance for population level effects. We conclude that the only legal obstacle to the use of behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation is whether an endpoint is considered to be relevant at the population level or not. We also conclude that ecotoxicity studies investigating behavioural endpoints are occasionally used in the EU chemicals regulation, and underscore that behavioural endpoints can be relevant at the population level. To improve the current use of behavioural studies in regulatory decision-making contribution from all relevant stakeholders is required. We have the following recommendations: (1) researchers should conduct robust, well-designed and transparent studies that emphasize the relevance of the study for regulation of chemicals; (2) editors and scientific journals should promote detailed, reliable and clearly reported studies; (3) regulatory agencies and the chemical industry need to embrace new behavioural endpoints of relevance at the population level.

AB  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) has been detected in various environmental media and has been implicated as a weak mutagen or carcinogen, but whether TDCIPP can promote the progression of liver tumor remains unclear. In this study, kras(V12) genetically modified zebrafish, Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2; TRE2:EGFP-kras(G12V)), a model system in which liver tumors can be induced by doxycycline (DOX), was used to evaluate the liver tumor promotion potential of TDCIPP. Briefly, kras(V12) transgenic females were exposed to 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP, 20 mg/L DOX or a binary mixture of 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP with 20 mg/L DOX, and liver size, histopathology, and transcriptional profiles of liver were determined. Treatment with TDCIPP resulted in increased liver size and caused more aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Compared with the exposure to DOX, TDCIPP in the presence of DOX up-regulated the expression of genes relevant with salmonella infection and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. These results implied an occurrence of inflammatory reaction, which was sustained by the increase in the amount of infiltrated neutrophils in the liver of Tg(lyz:DsRed2) transgenic zebrafish larvae whose neutrophils were labelled by red fluorescent protein under the lysozyme C promoter. Furthermore, compared with the binary exposure of DOX and TDCIPP, treatment with a ternary mixture of TDCIPP, DOX and inflammatory response inhibitor (ketoprofen) significantly decrease the liver size and the amounts of neutrophils in the livers of kras and lyz double transgenic zebrafish larvae. Collectively, our results suggested that TDCIPP could promote the liver tumor progression by induction of hepatic inflammatory responses. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chemical analysis of a cultivation of an Australian Mugil mullet gastrointestinal tract (GIT) derived fungus, Scopulariopsis sp. CMB-F458, yielded the known lipodepsipeptides scopularides A (1) and B (2). A comparative global natural product social (GNPS) molecular networking analysis of x63 co-isolated fungi, detected two additional fungi producing new scopularides, with Beauveria sp. CMB-F585 yielding scopularides C-G (3-7) and Scopulariopsis sp. CMB-F115 yielding scopularide H (8). Structures inclusive of absolute configurations were assigned by detailed spectroscopic and C-3 Marfey's analysis, together with X-ray analyses of 3 and 8, and biosynthetic considerations. Scopularides A-H (1-8) did not exhibit significant growth inhibitory activity against a selection of Gram positive (+ve) and negative (-ve) bacteria, a fungus, or a panel of three human carcinoma cell lines.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the organophosphorus pesticide dimethoate and cadmium on biochemical parameters of a freshwater snail, Galba truncatula, in laboratory conditions. In 14 days, snails were exposed to 0, 100, 200, and 400 mu g L-1 of dimethoate and 0.0 and 1000 mu g L-1 of cadmium chloride. The results evidenced that dimethoate induces oxidative stress and alters biochemical parameters in freshwater snails. Cadmium also induced significant changes in biochemical parameters. The combination of the dimethoate and cadmium markedly increased the effects on G. truncatula. Dimethoate and cadmium mixture caused a decrease in Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activities, glycogen, and total antioxidant capacity (TAN) levels, and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) activities, and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in exposed snails. The increased toxicity and bioaccumulation of cadmium after the exposure to the highest concentration of dimethoate indicates a synergistic effect leading to a reduced performance of the detoxification system in the snail. Dimethoate contributed to the bioconcentration of cadmium in snails and increased its toxic effects evidenced in biomarkers of oxidative stress and cell damage.

AB  - Conventional agriculture has been widely used to overcome food scarcity in Egypt, but in turn created new environmental, social, and economic problems. Aquaponics has a huge potential as a sustainable solution since it demonstrates promising results for urban food development while providing new entrepreneurship and start-up opportunities. Although it presents a big opportunity especially for developing countries like Egypt, it still requires further studies and researches to fully overcome foreseen challenges. This study discusses the possibility of implementing aquaponics as an alternative to conventional agriculture in Egypt through a comparison between aquaponics and conventional agriculture. The first section of this investigation analyzes the economic feasibility of aquaponics in terms of capital and operational expenditure costs. Then, an experimental comparative study is carried out examining two pilot-scale aquaponics systems (Deep water Culture system and Integrated Aqua-Vegaculture system), where crop quality (vitamins, heavy metals, and pesticides residues) of the two systems has been compared among each other, as well as to that of the commercially available organic food available in supermarkets. Results indicated that both systems produce high-quality safe organic food. The economic feasibility analysis indicated that Integrated Aqua-Vegaculture System is producing more crops with a wider variety of almost 20% less capital expenditure and operational expenditure costs. Fish production for both systems was close, yet slightly higher in Deep Water Culture. Although, on the short term, aquaponics entails relatively high capital and operational expenditure costs compared with conventional agriculture; yet, on the long term, it is more profitable, while saving up to 85% of the water wasted by conventional farming techniques. Finally, the study discusses the main limitations, drawbacks, and future of aquaponics in Egypt where public awareness and a new mindset are needed to highlight the link between agriculture and sustainability.

AB  - Thioredoxins (Trxs) play an important role in defending against oxidative stress and keeping disulfide bonding correct to maintain protein function. Edwardsiella piscicida, a severe fish pathogen, has been shown to encode several thioredoxins including TrxA, TrxC, and TrxH, but their biological roles remain unknown. In this study, we characterized TrxH of E. piscicida (named TrxH(Ep)) and examined its expression and function. TrxH(Ep) is composed of 125 residues and possesses typical thioredoxin H motifs. Expression of trxH(Ep) was upregulated under conditions of oxidative stress, iron starvation, low pH, and during infection of host cells. trxH(Ep) expression was also regulated by ferric uptake regulator (Fur), an important global regulatory of E. piscicida. Compared to the wild type TX01, a markerless trxH(Ep) in-frame mutant strain TX01trxH exhibited markedly compromised tolerance of the pathogen to hydrogen peroxide, acid stress, and iron deficiency. Deletion of trxH(Ep) significantly retarded bacterial biofilm growth and decreased resistance against serum killing. Pathogenicity analysis shows that the inactivation of trxH(Ep) significantly impaired the ability of E. piscicida to invade host cells, reproduce in macrophages, and infect host tissues. Introduction of a trans-expressed trxH gene restored the lost virulence of TX01trxH. There is likely to be a complex relationship of functional complementation or expression regulation between TrxH and another two thioredoxins, TrxA and TrxC, of E. piscicida. This is the first functional report of TrxH in fish pathogens, and the findings suggest that TrxH(Ep) is essential for coping with adverse circumstances and contributes to host infection of E. piscicida.

AB  - Edwardsiella piscicida is an important pathogen that infects a wide range of hosts from fish to human. Recent studies demonstrated that E. piscicida can invade and survive within multiple nonphagocytic cells, but the internalization mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we used HeLa cells as a nonphagocytic cell model to investigate the endocytic strategy used by the pathogenic E. piscicida isolate EIB202. Using a combination of optical and electron microscopy, we observed obvious membrane ruffles and F-actin rearrangements in HeLa cells after EIB202 infection. We also revealed that EIB202 internalization significantly depended on the activity of Na+/H+ exchangers and multiple intracellular signaling events related to macropinocytosis, suggesting that E. piscicida utilizes the host macropinocytosis pathway to enter HeLa cells. Further, using inhibitory drugs and shRNAs to block specific endocytic pathways, we found that a caveolin-dependent but not clathrin-dependent pathway is involved in E. piscicida entry and that its entry requires dynamin and membrane cholesterol. Together, these data suggest that E. piscicida enters nonphagocytic cells via macropinocytosis and caveolindependent endocytosis involving cholesterol and dynamin, improving the understanding of how E. piscicida interacts with nonphagocytic cells.
   IMPORTANCE Bacterial internalization is the first step in breaking through the host cell defense. Therefore, studying the mechanism of bacterial internalization improves the understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of bacteria. In this study, the internalization process on nonphagocytic cells by Edwardsiella piscicida was evaluated. Our results showed that E. piscicida can be internalized into nonphagocytic cells via macropinocytosis and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and that cholesterol and dynamin are involved in this process. These results reveal a new method for inhibiting E. piscicida infection, providing a foundation for further studies of bacterial pathogenicity.

AB  - This assessment summarises the current state of knowledge on the interactive effects of ozone depletion and climate change on aquatic ecosystems, focusing on how these affect exposures to UV radiation in both inland and oceanic waters. The ways in which stratospheric ozone depletion is directly altering climate in the southern hemisphere and the consequent extensive effects on aquatic ecosystems are also addressed. The primary objective is to synthesise novel findings over the past four years in the context of the existing understanding of ecosystem response to UV radiation and the interactive effects of climate change. If it were not for the Montreal Protocol, stratospheric ozone depletion would have led to high levels of exposure to solar UV radiation with much stronger negative effects on all trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems than currently experienced in both inland and oceanic waters. This "world avoided" scenario that has curtailed ozone depletion, means that climate change and other environmental variables will play the primary role in regulating the exposure of aquatic organisms to solar UV radiation. Reductions in the thickness and duration of snow and ice cover are increasing the levels of exposure of aquatic organisms to UV radiation. Climate change was also expected to increase exposure by causing shallow mixed layers, but new data show deepening in some regions and shoaling in others. In contrast, climate-change related increases in heavy precipitation and melting of glaciers and permafrost are increasing the concentration and colour of UV-absorbing dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulates. This is leading to the "browning" of many inland and coastal waters, with consequent loss of the valuable ecosystem service in which solar UV radiation disinfects surface waters of parasites and pathogens. Many organisms can reduce damage due to exposure to UV radiation through behavioural avoidance, photoprotection, and photoenzymatic repair, but meta-analyses continue to confirm negative effects of UV radiation across all trophic levels. Modeling studies estimating photoinhibition of primary production in parts of the Pacific Ocean have demonstrated that the UV radiation component of sunlight leads to a 20% decrease in estimates of primary productivity. Exposure to UV radiation can also lead to positive effects on some organisms by damaging less UV-tolerant predators, competitors, and pathogens. UV radiation also contributes to the formation of microplastic pollutants and interacts with artificial sunscreens and other pollutants with adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. Exposure to UV-B radiation can decrease the toxicity of some pollutants such as methyl mercury (due to its role in demethylation) but increase the toxicity of other pollutants such as some pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Feeding on microplastics by zooplankton can lead to bioaccumulation in fish. Microplastics are found in up to 20% of fish marketed for human consumption, potentially threatening food security. Depletion of stratospheric ozone has altered climate in the southern hemisphere in ways that have increased oceanic productivity and consequently the growth, survival and reproduction of many sea birds and mammals. In contrast, warmer sea surface temperatures related to these climate shifts are also correlated with declines in both kelp beds in Tasmania and corals in Brazil.
   This assessment demonstrates that knowledge of the interactive effects of ozone depletion, UV radiation, and climate change factors on aquatic ecosystems has advanced considerably over the past four years and confirms the importance of considering synergies between environmental factors.

AB  - With rapidly increasing investment in water control infrastructure (WCI) and a recently ratified agriculture development strategy that promotes integrated farming of high-value products such as fish, agricultural production, already fundamental to Myanmar's economy, will be central to driving the countries' socioeconomic transformation. Water planners and managers have a unique opportunity to design and manage WCI to incorporate fish and, in so doing, reduce conflicts and optimise the benefits to both people and the ecosystem services upon which they depend. Results from rice-fish culture experimental trials in Myanmar's Ayeyarwady Delta are providing an evidence base for the importance of integrating fish into WCI, highlighting a range of both environmental and social benefits. By using less than 13% of paddy land area and through best management practices, existing rice productivity is sustained, alongside a 25% increase in economic returns for the same land area from fish. In addition, there are considerably more protein and micronutrients available from the fish produced in the system. Should these farming system innovations be adopted at scale, Myanmar stands to benefit from increased employment, incomes and nutritional value of farm plots (alongside associated reductions in pesticide pollution) and water use benefits.(1</SUP)

AB  - Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Since 2005, malaria cases have been declining globally with many countries having eliminated malaria and several other countries heading towards malaria elimination. The World Health Organization's Global Technical Strategy for malaria targets at least 90% reduction in case incidences and mortality rates, and elimination in 35 countries by 2030. India along with other Asia-Pacific countries has pledged to eliminate malaria by 2030. Sustainable vector control and case management interventions have played a pivotal role in malaria control leading to elimination. Malaria is complex in India due to the presence of multiple parasites and vectors species, asymptomatic cases, resistance against antimalarials and insecticides, social, demographic, cultural and behavioural beliefs. Therefore, maintaining zero indigenous malaria transmission and preventing malaria through importation of cases requires well-planned multi-pronged intervention strategies. This article provides insights into the past and present malaria control and elimination efforts that may be useful for the national programme for eliminating malaria from India by 2030.

AB  - Edwardsiella piscicida is an Enterobacteriaceae that is abundant in water and causes food and waterborne infections in fish, animals, and humans. The bacterium causes Edwardsiellosis in farmed fish and can lead to severe economic losses in aquaculture worldwide. E. piscicida is an intracellular pathogen that can also cause systemic infection. Type III and type VI secretion systems are the bacterium's most lethal weapons against host defenses. It also possesses multiantibiotic resistant genes and is selected and enriched in the environment due to the overuse of antibiotics. Therefore, the bacterium has great potential to contribute to the evolution of the resistome. All these properties have made this bacterium a perfect model to study bacteria virulence mechanisms and the spread of antimicrobial genes in the environment. We summarize recent advance in E. piscicida biology and provide insights into future research in virulence mechanisms, vaccine development and novel therapeutics.

AB  - Detoxifying pathways of mosquitoes against the neem (Azadirachta indica) extracts are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in this process in Anopheles stephensi, one of the main malaria vectors in southern Asia. Third-stage larvae of An. stephensi were fed with fish food alone or in combination with neem extract at 0.5%, 1%, 5%, and 10%. Six ABC-transporter genes from 3 different subfamilies (B, C, and G) were analyzed to assess their relative expression compared with controls. A bioassay was also performed to assess larval mortality rate at different concentrations and in combination with verapamil, an ABC-transporter inhibitor. No significant variation in the expression levels of any transporter belonging to the B, C, and G subfamilies was detected. Furthermore, the use of verapamil did not induce an increase in mortality at any of the tested neem extract concentrations, indicating that ABC transporters are not involved in the detoxification of neem extracts in An. stephensi larvae.

AB  - As the older class of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are phased out of commercial use because of findings of neurotoxicity with developmental exposure, a newer class of flame retardants have been introduced, the organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). Presently, little is known about the potential for developmental neurotoxicity or the behavioral consequences of OPFR exposure. Our aim was to characterize the life-long neurobehavioral effects of 4 widely used OPFRs using the zebrafish model. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control); or one of the following treatments; isopropylated phenyl phosphate (IPP) (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mu M); butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate (BPDP) (0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 3 mu M); 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDP) (0.03, 0.3, 1 mu M); isodecyl diphenyl phosphate (IDDP) (0.1, 0.3,1, 10 mu M) from 0- to 5-days postfertilization. On Day 6, the larvae were tested for motility under alternating dark and light conditions. Finally, at 5-7 months of age the exposed fish and controls were tested on a battery of behavioral tests to assess emotional function, sensorimotor response, social interaction and predator evasion. These tests showed chemical-specific short-term effects of altered motility in larvae in all of the tested compounds, and long-term impairment of anxiety-related behavior in adults following IPP, BPDP, or EHDP exposures. Our results show that OPFRs may not be a safe alternative to the phased-out BFRs and may cause behavioral impacts throughout the lifespan. Further research should evaluate the risk to mammalian experimental models and humans.

AB  - Effective management of wetlands often involves the suppression of invasive species, and understanding the ecological consequences of management efforts is an important goal. A non-native strain of Phragmites australis (Common Reed; hereafter Phragmites) is aggressively invading North American wetlands, and the species has been shown to alter hydrology and impact aquatic organisms. Clear Creek Wildlife Management Area, in Kentucky, is heavily impacted by Phragmites invasion. Portions of the Wildlife Management Area with Phragmites were treated with herbicide to restore wetland flora, and in this study, we evaluated the effects of both the presence and management of Phragmites on wildlife populations and ecosystem function. We selected 3 locations (treated Phragmites, untreated Phragmites, and Phragmites-free) and surveyed each for water chemistry, wildlife populations, and stable-isotope signatures over a 2-y period. Water chemistry varied with the presence or absence of Phragmites, suggesting differences in nutrient cycling. Fish diversity did not differ among sites, but individual species varied in distribution and abundance between the Phragmites sites and the Phragmites-free site. Turtles showed significant differences in both diversity and body size based on the presence or absence of Phragmites, but not herbicide treatment. We detected no significant differences in frog diversity across treatments. We recorded 8 Kentucky Species of Greatest Conservation Need, but there were few differences in the distribution of these species across sites. Stable-isotope analysis revealed variation in food-web structure based on the presence of Phragmites. These results indicate that herbicides had little effect on fish and herpetofaunal communities in the short term, but potentially significant ecological changes may occur if Phragmites were eradicated. Our conclusions highlight the importance of monitoring habitat restoration to guide future management. A holistic, ecosystem-level approach is necessary to understand the impacts of both invasive species and their management.

AB  - Little is known regarding the impact of penoxsulam, a fluorinated benzenesulfonamid rice herbicide, on Oreochromis niloticus (O. niloticus). Therefore, the current study was undertaken to highlight the effects of penoxsulam exposure on O. niloticus and to evaluate the advantages of Chlorella vulgaris (CV) dietary supplementation against the induced effects. The 96-h lethal concentration 50 (LC50) penoxsulam value for O. niloticus was estimated at 8.948 mg/L by probit analysis in a static bioassay experiment. Next, 360 healthy fish were randomly allocated into 6 treatment groups. The Ti group served as the negative control and was fed a basal diet. The T2 group served as the positive control and was fed a basal diet supplemented with 10% CV. The fish in the T3 and T4 groups were exposed to 1/10 the 96-h LC50 of penoxsulam (0.8948 mg/L) and were fed the basal diet alone or the basal diet supplemented with 10% CV, respectively. The fish in the T5 and T6 groups were exposed to 1/5 the 96-h LC50 of penoxsulam (1.7896 mg/L) and fed the basal diet alone or the basal diet supplemented with 10% CV, respectively. Sub-acute penoxsulam exposure significantly altered hematological indices, as well as compromised the fish's immune defense mechanisms, including the phagocytic percentage, phagocytic index, nitric oxide production, immunoglobulin M levels and lysozyme, anti-trypsin and bactericidal activities subsequently decreasing O. niloticus's resistance to the Aeromonus sobria challenge and increasing disease symptoms and the mortality rate. Furthermore, sub-chronic penoxsulam exposure markedly altered growth performance, oxidant/antioxidant status and liver status and down-regulated the expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis-alpha (TNF-alpha). Interestingly, incorporating 10% CV into the diet protects fish against sub-acute penoxsulam-induced immunotoxicity via improvement of immune responses that increases the resistance against bacterial infection. Further, it improved the growth performance, oxidant/antioxidant status, liver status and markedly up-regulated immune-related gene expression, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, in the spleens of fish sub-chronically exposed to penoxsulam. These outcomes showed that dietary CV supplementation can protect the commercially valuable freshwater fish O. niloticus against penoxsulam toxicity and may be a potential feed supplement for Nile tilapia in aquaculture.

AB  - The herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is applied directly to aquatic and conventional farming systems to control weeds, and is among the most widely distributed pollutants in the environment. Non-target organisms are exposed to 2,4-D via several ways, which could produce toxic effects depending on the dose, frequency of exposure, and the host factors that influence susceptibility and sensitivity. An increasing number of experimental evidences have shown concerns about its presence/detection in the environment, because several investigations have pointed out its potential lethal effects on non-target organisms. In this review, we critically evaluated the environmental fate and behavior of 2,4-D along with its eco-toxicological effects on aquatic, plants and human life to provide concise assessment in the light of recently published reports. The findings demonstrate that 2,4-D is present in a low concentration in surface water of regions where its usage is high. The highest concentrations of 2,4-D were detected in soil, air and surface water surrounded by crop fields, which suggest that mitigation strategies must be implanted locally to prevent the entry of 2,4-D into the environment. A general public may have frequent exposure to 2,4-D due to its wide applications at home lawns and public parks, etc. Various in vivo and in vitro investigations suggest that several species (or their organs) at different trophic levels are extremely sensitive to the 2,4-D exposure, which may explain variation in outcomes of reported investigations. However, implications for the prenatal exposure to 2,4-D remain unknown because 2,4-D-induced toxicity thresholds in organism have only been derived from juveniles or adults. In near future, introduction of 2,4-D resistant crops will increase its use in agriculture, which may cause relatively high and potentially unsafe residue levels in the environment. The recent findings indicate the urgent need to further explore fate, accumulation and its continuous low level exposure impacts on the environment to generate reliable database which is key in drafting new regulation and policies to protect the population from further exposure.

AB  - Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are widely used volatile pesticides that have harmful effects on the liver in acute and chronic exposures. This review article summarises and discusses a wide collection of studies published over the last 40 years reporting on the effects of OPs on the liver, in an attempt to propose general mechanisms of OP hepatotoxicity and possible treatment. Several key biological processes have been reported as involved in OP-induced hepatotoxicity such as disturbances in the antioxidant defence system, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial and microsomal metabolism. Most studies show that antioxidants can attenuate oxidative stress and the consequent changes in liver function. However, few studies have examined the relationship between OP structures and the severity and mechanism of their action. We hope that future in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials will answer the remaining questions about the mechanisms of OP hepatotoxicity and its management.

AB  - AIP56 (apoptosis-inducing protein of 56 kDa) is a key virulence factor of Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp), the causative agent of a septicaemia affecting warm water marine fish species. Phdp-associated pathology is triggered by AIP56, a short trip AB toxin with a metalloprotease A domain that cleaves the p65 subunit of NF-B, an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that regulates the expression of inflammatory and anti-apoptotic genes and plays a central role in host responses to infection. During infection by Phdp, AIP56 is systemically disseminated and induces apoptosis of macrophages and neutrophils, compromising the host phagocytic defence and contributing to the genesis of pathology. Although it is well established that the secretion of AIP56 is crucial for Phdp pathogenicity, the protein secretion systems operating in Phdp and the mechanism responsible for the extracellular release of the toxin remain unknown. Here, we report that Phdp encodes a type II secretion system (T2SS) and show that mutation of the EpsL component of this system impairs AIP56 secretion. This work demonstrates that Phdp has a functional T2SS that mediates secretion of its key virulence factor AIP56.

AB  - The present study reports the diversity of culturable bacteria associated with the puffer fish Gastrophysus spadiceus. During the study, a total of 31 strains affiliated to the genera Pseudomonas, Janthinobacterium, Rahnella, and Psychrobacter were isolated from liver, intestines, and flesh of G. spadiceus. These strains exhibited a diverse range of metabolites as indicated by the HPLC and TLC profiles of the chemical extracts of their fermentation products. Some of these crude extracts showed strong antimicrobial activities against pathogenic bacterial strains. In addition, few crude extracts exhibit insecticidal activity against Artemia salina.

AB  - Food futurists accept that sustainability-minded humanity will increasingly incorporate insects as alternative protein. The most studied and easily reared species are not necessarily the most sustainable, acceptable, or delicious. Here, we review the literature on the black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens, which is capable of efficiently converting a wide variety of organic materials, from food waste to manure, into insect biomass. They can be grown and harvested without dedicated facilities and are not pestiferous. Their larvae are 42% crude protein and 29% fat, although they are higher in saturated fats than most insects. They do not concentrate pesticides or mycotoxins. They are already grown and recommended for use as animal feed, but with regional legal restrictions on how this is done. For commercial use in human foods, larvae could potentially be milled and converted into a textured protein with a strong flavor. Their biggest advantage over other insects is their ability to convert waste into food, generating value and closing nutrient loops as they reduce pollution and costs. This general advantage is also their greatest disadvantage, for the social stigmas and legal prohibitions against eating organisms that eat waste are added to extant taboos facing insect consumption.

AB  - The increased rice production in the Mekong Delta during the last two decades has improved agricultural income and reduced poverty, but it has also had negative impacts on the environment and human health. This study shows that integrated rice-fish farming and integrated pest management strategies provide sustainable options to intensive rice farming, because of a more balanced use of multiple ecosystem services that benefit the farmers' health, economy and the environment. The study investigates and compares farming strategies among 40 rice and 20 rice-fish farmers in two locations in the Mekong Delta. Production costs and income are used to compare the systems' financial sustainability. The farmers' perception on how their farming practices influence on ecosystem services and their livelihoods are used as an indication of the systems' ecological and social sustainability. Although rice-fish farmers used lower amount of pesticides and fertilisers than rice farmers, there were no statistical differences in their rice yields or net income. Rice was seen as the most important ecosystem service from rice fields and related wetlands, but also several other ecosystem services, such as water quality, aquatic animals, plants, habitats, and natural enemies to pests, were seen as important to the farmers' livelihoods and wellbeing. All farmers perceived that there had been a general reduction in all these other ecosystem services, due to intensive rice farming during the last 15 years, and that they will continue to decline. The majority of the farmers were willing to reduce their rice yields slightly for an improved quality of the other ecosystem services.

AB  - One reason for doing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is that experiments can be convincing. Early epidemiological experimenters, such as Jenner and the smallpox vaccine and Snow and his famous Broad Street pump handle, already knew the answer they were demonstrating; they used the experiments as knowledge translation devices to convince others.
   More sophisticated modern experiments include cluster randomised controlled trials (CRCTs) for experiments in the public health setting. The knowledge translation value remains: RCTs and CRCTs can potentially stimulate changes of practice among stakeholders. Capitalising on the knowledge translation value of RCTs requires more than the standard reporting of trials. Those who are convinced by a trial and want to act, need to know how the trial relates to their own context, what contributed to success, and what might make it even more effective. Implementation research unpacks the back-story, examining how and why an intervention worked.
   The Camino Verde trial of community mobilisation for control of dengue reported a significant impact on entomological indices of the Aedes aegypti vector, and on serological dengue virus infection and self-reported dengue cases. This important study should lead to studies of similar interventions in other contexts, and ultimately to changes in dengue control practices. This supplement is the back-story of the trial, providing information to help researchers and planners to make use of the trial findings.
   Background articles include the full protocol, a systematic review of CRCTs of approaches for Aedes aegypti control, epidemiological and entomological findings from the baseline survey, and how baseline findings were used to set up the intervention. Secondary analyses of the entomological findings examine associations with the use of the larvicide temephos, and the impact of the intervention in different conditions of water supply and seasons. Other articles describe implementation and other impacts: the underlying approach; implementation in the trial's different social contexts; the different impact in women and men; the effects of using fish for vector control; the impact on household costs of personal protection and of cases of dengue illness; and ethical issues. We hope this supplement will increase the knowledge translation value of the Camino Verde trial.

AB  - A Laboratory study was carried out to assess the toxic effects of aqueous extracts of Piptadeniastrium africanum bark on Clarias gariepinus juveniles using the static bioassay with continuous aeration method. Phytochemical analysis of the P. africanum aqueous bark extract revealed the presence of tannins (1.95 %), saponin (2.95 %), flavonoid (5.63 %), Glycosides (1.05 %), Steroid (2.35 %), Terpens, (2.70 %). 0 (control), 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 mg/L concentrations were then applied to Clarias gariepinus juveniles (Mean weight: 18.26 +/- 0.04 g) to determine the acute toxicity. The result obtained revealed the 96 h LC50 values to be 42.21 mg/L with 95 % confidence limit of 30.37-58.67 mg/L. Fish exposed to acute toxicity test exhibited behavioural changes such as discolouration, air gulping, erratic swimming, aggression, excessive mucus secretion, and settling at the bottom motionless just before death. Histological assessment of the gills showed that acute exposure of P. africanum bark led to degeneration of primary and secondary lamellae, lamellae with marginal channel dilation, blanketing of the lamellae, hyperplasia of epithelial cells, epithelial lifting and haemorrhage, oedema, necrosis and malformed secondary lamellae of the African catfish. The liver also showed focal necrosis, bile stagnation, nuclear degeneration, hepatocytes with irregular shaped nucleaus, cytoplasmic vacuolation, vascular congestion, bile pigment disintegration and cytoplasic degeneration Hyperplasia of epithelial cells and fusion of secondary lamellae. The toxic effect of the aqueous extract of the plant on C. gariepinus juveniles was both time and dose dependent.

AB  - As a leading pathogen, Edwardsiella piscicida can cause hemorrhagic septicemia in fish and gastro-intestinal infections in humans. The two-component regulatory system EsrA-EsrB plays essential roles in pathogenesis through the type III and type VI secretion systems, and hemolysin production in E. piscicida. It is unclear whether other virulence-or stress response-associated genes are regulated by EsrA-EsrB. In this study, the proteomes of wild-type E. piscicida EIB202 and esrB mutant strains were compared to reveal EsrB regulon components after growth in Luria-Bertani broth (LB). Overall, the expression levels of nine genes exhibited significant changes, and five of them required the presence of EsrB, while others exhibited higher levels in the esrB mutant. The diverse functions of these proteins were identified, including amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress defense and energy production. Interestingly, superoxidase dismutase and thiol peroxidase were the most significantly down-regulated by EsrB. Furthermore, other reported reactive oxygen species (ROS) resistance-related genes were also down-regulated by EsrB as revealed by quantitative real-time. Compared with the wild-type and the complement strain esrB(+), Delta esrB displayed a significantly enhanced ROS resistance. These results demonstrated that EsrB plays important roles in the ROS resistance pathway in E. piscicida grown in LB conditions.

AB  - One of the frequently encountered problems of power plant small cooling ponds is rapid eutrophication and related intensified development of phytoplankton ("hyperflow") and overgrowing of ponds by higher aquatic vegetation. As a result of hyper-flowering, an enormous amount of detritus settles on the condenser tubes, reducing the efficiency of the power plant operation. The development of higher aquatic vegetation contributes to the appearing of the shoals. As a result the volume, area and other characteristics of the cooling ponds are getting changed. The article describes the environmental problems of small man-made ponds of power plants and coal mines in mining regions. Two approaches to the problem of eutrophication are considered: technological and ecological. The negative effects of herbicides application to aquatic organisms are experimentally proved. An ecological approach to solving the problem by fish-land reclamation method is shown.

AB  - The excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides required by intensified agriculture has caused a significant damage to the environment. However, deploying effective measures to reduce fertilizer and pesticide use without decreasing grain yield has been challenging. This study reviews the history, benefits, and weaknesses of the classical farming technology in China. We explain how using animals to control and reduce pathogens, pests, and weeds is beneficial, and why the rice-fish/rice-duck (RF/RD) system requires less chemical fertilizer and pesticide. Finally, we present a new planting and breeding model to overcome the weakness of the RF/RD with a ridging design to increase water level for fish/duck. This new model could further improve the economic, social, and ecological benefits of classical farming technology. This study suggests that further development of Chinese traditional rice farming method under the context of the modern intensification of agriculture is of high ecological and economic values.

AB  - This research aims to analyze the sustainability of two types of fishery pond polyculture of milkfishtiger shrimp with and without mangrove integration on small-scale farms. Sustainability dimensions considered in this research included are the ecology, economy, social-culture, technology-infrastructure, and laws-institutions as the dimensions analyzed. The performance of each aspect was analyzed by using Multi-dimensional scaling (Rapfish) and leverage analysis. The result shows that the current multidimensional sustainability status of the fishery pond polyculture both with and without mangrove integration was less sustainable (sustainability index of 44.98 and 36.18 respectively). The result of leverage analysis indicates that out of 73 attributes, there were 16 and 23 sensitive attributes respectively that affect the sustainability of polyculture fishpond with and without mangrove integration. These attributes should be managed immediately in order to improve the sustainability index of fishery pond polyculture, this includes organic pesticides application, source of capital, the availability of seeds of milkfish and tiger shrimp, market location, selling price, waste treatment technology, availability of agribusiness facilities and infrastructure, aquaculture technology, information technology, standardizing the quality of fishery products, availability of micro finance institution and others.

AB  - Dublin, the capital city of Ireland, was developed by the Vikings in the 9th century. Today, Dublin Port is the busiest port in Ireland, handling 31 million tonnes of cargo a year and over 1.6 million ferry passengers and covering an area of 260 hectares in the centre of Dublin Bay, which encloses an area of about 296 km(2). Close to the port there are wetlands that are home to internationally important populations of birds and a range of coastal, intertidal and subtidal habitats, many of which are protected under EU and other legislation. The bay has been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere.
   Dublin has a population of over a million people. The bay has high cultural value and is extensively used for recreation. There is a power station and a waste water treatment plant close to the port, together with oil storage, scrap metal recycling and cement manufacture. There were some shell and fin-fish fisheries in the past but commercial fishing is very limited today, although there are some important nursery areas for fish species harvested in the Irish Sea. Levels of contaminants have reduced in sediments due to reductions in shipbuilding, although concentrations of PAHs, metals and a range of pesticides are high in some areas. Dublin is a major oil trans-shipment port and oil exploration has been proposed in the bay, so there is risk of further oil contamination. Water quality is generally good, but sewage infrastructure and treatment capacity need further enhancement to sustain recent improvements. Sea level rise will bring increased risk of coastal flooding and threatens some of the wetland habitats. Additional sea-defences will further add to the extent of artificial structures along the foreshore. Dublin Port is set to expand and there are concerns over invasive species and climate change, particularly given lack of knowledge of potential impacts of invaders and the complex combined effects of multiple local and global stressors.
   Coastal management is currently characterised by a sectoral approach; greater integration is needed. It is beginning to develop, partly due to recent EU directives and stakeholder engagement will be facilitated by the Dublin Bay Biosphere partnership. Having expanded at the expense of the coastal environment, Dublin City and Port are now beginning to reconnect with nature and with people who are increasingly recognising the value of natural capital and ecosystem services.

AB  - This study sought to assess the relationship between regulatory and educational approaches to nutrient management and homeowner behaviors, perceptions, and knowledge of best management practices (BMPs). Fertilizers, and pesticides applied in excess by homeowners and landscapers can impair stormwater ponds and cause nuisance algae blooms, eutrophication and fish kills. They can also affect water quality in downstream creeks, and bays. To reduce the potential for nutrient-laden runoff to the aquatic environment, local and state governments passed different regulatory mechanisms that govern the use of BMPs and a fertilizer black out period. Interviews, surveys, and participant observation were used to gather quantitative and qualitative data in order to establish social indicator scores and evaluate knowledge and attitudes surrounding the fertilizer ordinance in a Master Planned community in Manatee County Florida. Results showed that most residents (69%) had not seen any materials related to the blackout period and lacked awareness of the components of the ordinance, including its restrictions on phosphorous and nitrogen applications and disposal of grass and landscape debris. The findings reveal the importance of social dimensions in sustainable stormwater management and suggest target areas for increasing awareness of the fertilizer ordinance and strengthening the link between social norms and environmental stewardship.

AB  - Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) are commonly known as dioxins and are the most toxic members of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) because present a variety of health effects especially as promoting agent of growing and transformation of cancer cells. They are bio-accumulate in humans primarily via the diet, specifically by ingestion of foods that have high lipid content which are generally associated with foods of animal origin such as oils and fats and with fishery and dairy products. In Colombia the Ministry of Health and Social Protection which is the entity responsible for surveillance food conditions, has established maximum levels for dioxins and dl-PCBs in oils from animal and vegetable origins. Oils of vegetable and animal origin represent an appreciable intake in the country thus the presence of dioxins and dl-PCBs in these materials is a matter of concern because they can bioaccumulate in fat. In this contribution the levels of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in olive, soybean, fish oil, butter and shrimp consumed in Colombia were determined using HRGC-HRMS and were compared with the maximum levels permitted in oil samples according to both the Colombian and European regulations. WHO-TEQ concentrations for PCDD/Fs and dioxin like PCBs ranged from 0.24 to 1.710 pgWHO-TEQ PCDD/F g(-1) of fat and from 0.050 to 3.000 pg WHO-TEQ PCB g(-1) of fat, respectively. As expected, fish oils and shrimp present the highest WHO-TEQ PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs values followed by butter and soybean oil sample, while the olive oil shows the lowest levels. In general, the vegetable oils show levels below the limits established by both the Colombian and European regulations. The levels from soybean oil found in this study were slightly higher than the threshold established both by the Commission Regulation European Union (EU) and the Colombian legislation, while fish oils showed concentrations above the European regulations. Furthermore, shrimp exhibited values below the maximum concentration levels established by the EU and Colombian regulation. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: There is contradictory evidence of the effects that environmental factors-dietary habits (ingestion rates of red meat, soy products, fish, etc.) and work environment (exposure to metals, pesticides, several toxic products, etc.)-and KLK3, AR, RNASEL, MSR1, and ELAC2 expression patterns have on prostate cancer (PCa). In our study, we investigated the potential association between KLK3, AR, RNASEL, MSR1, and ELAC2 polymorphisms, expression patterns, exposure to environmental factors, and PCa in a Spanish cohort. Blood and fresh tissue samples were collected from 322 subjects with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >4ng/ml to determine their genotypes (RNASEL, MSR1, and ELAC2) and assess messenger ribonucleic acid expression levels (by quantitative amplification testing).
   Main findings: Among clinical parameters, a 63.6% of patients with CC variants in rs11545302 (ELAC2) had PSA > 20ng/ml (P = 0.008), and rs486907 (RNASEL), with 52.8% of patients with CT variants with Gleason score > 7. Regarding TNM stage, patients with GG variants, rs4792311 (ELAC2) generally had stage 1 tumors. Genetic expression analysis revealed RNASEL (P = 0.007) was underexpressed in PCa tissue, whereas KLK3 (P = 0.041) was overexpressed. As to environmental factors, the intake of dried fruits (P = 0.036) and practice of sports (P = 0.024) revealed an effect in PCa. Moreover, environmental factors were observed to affect gene expression patterns. Thus, RNASEL (P = 0.018) and ELAC2 (P = 0.023) were found to be underexpressed in patients who ate processed foods frequently; MSR1 (P = 0.024) and AR (P = 0.004) were underexpressed in patients who did not practice sports; and KLK3 (P = 0.039; P = 0.046) underexpressed in patients exposed to dust and toxic products.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to analyze the correlation between RNASEL, MSR1, and ELAC2 genotypes and messenger ribonucleic acid expression in PCa. RNASEL and KLK3 show different expression patterns in normal vs. tumor tissue, which supports their reported relevance in human cancer. The results obtained confirm that RNASEL plays a crucial role in PCa. Environmental factors such as exercise, exposure to toxic agents, and intake of processed foods are associated with PCa.

AB  - A microextraction technique based on ultrasonic emulsification and demulsification was developed for detecting pesticides at trace levels in environmental water samples. In this ultrasound-assisted microextraction (UAME), chloroform was emulsified with an aqueous sample solution containing trace fenitrothion (MEP) by ultrasonic irradiation (48 kHz) for 5 min. The emulsion was then demulsified by ultrasonic irradiation (2.4 MHz) for 10 min. This resulted in phase separation of the water and chloroform without centrifugation. The demulsified chloroform was collected by a microsyringe and submitted to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In conventional extraction with mechanical stirring, the extraction recovery (ER) of MEP was strongly dependent on the sample/chloroform volume ratio. However, in UAME, the ER was independent of the volume ratio and the ER was > 80 % when the enrichment factor was 40. In UAME, MEP was rapidly extracted into the chloroform because of the large specific surface areas of the small chloroform droplets in the oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion. This gave a high extraction efficiency for MEP. UAME is a simple method requiring only a change in the ultrasound frequency and with no pretreatment steps that could contaminate the sample. The suitability of UAME was demonstrated by application to the detection of trace levels of pesticides in a spiked water sample from a fish tank.

AB  - One hundred and twenty bacterial isolates were obtained from the intestinal mucus of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and screened for antagonistic activity and adherence abilities. Based on in vitro antagonism against two pathogens (Streptococcus iniae and Edwardsiella piscicida), five isolates were selected and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. All antagonistic isolates were affiliated to the genus Bacillus, which showed inhibitory activity against S. iniae. Only the isolate B191 (closely related to Bacillus mojavensis) inhibited the growth of both pathogens. Moreover, isolate B191 adhered significantly better to fish intestinal mucus than other antagonistic isolates. According to our results, these bacterial isolates, particularly isolate B191, should be further studied to explore their probiotic effects under in vivo conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In 2008-2011. social attraction (i.e. provision of artificial nests and nocturnal vocalization broadcasting) was used to restore a small colony of Ashy Storm-Petrels Oceanodroma homochroa at Orizaba Rock off Santa Cruz Island. California, United States. This colony had declined 74.1% from 27 nests (1996) to 7 (2005), or -17.5% per year (1995-2004) using a colony size index. In contrast, a nearby reference colony, Cave of the Birds' Eggs, increased 72.7% from 11 (1995) to 19 nests (2005) but colony size index trend (1995-2004) was non-significant. With social attraction, number of nests at Orizaba Rock almost tripled from the baseline mean of 12 (2005-2007) to 33 (2011), reflecting increases of 22.4% per year using the colony size index (2005-2011) or 26.5% per year based on colony size (2005-2011). In 2008, four eggs were laid in artificial nests; by 2011, petrels laid eggs at 11 of 30 (36.7%) artificial nests and visited nine more (30.0%). In comparison. reference colony size increased from the baseline mean of 22 nests (2005-2007) to 24 nests (2011) or 9.3% per year using the colony size index (1995-2011). Relatively high breeding success at both colonies in 2005-2011 apparently reflected reduced organochlorine pollutants, adequate prey resources, relatively low avian predation, and low or no impacts from squid-fishing lights. In 2010, Common Ravens Corvus corax discovered and dismantled 12 artificial nests; modifications were made in 2011 to prevent raven access. Social attraction resulted in restoration of the Orizaba Rock colony to its 1996 size, demonstrating the technique's effectiveness in increasing colony size and encouraging storm-petrel use of artificial sites.

AB  - Our study was designed to evaluate effects of an herbicide, pendimethalin on biochemical biomarkers and histopathological indices of the freshwater fish Channa punctata Bloch. Fish were acutely exposed (96 h) to sub-lethal concentrations (0.5 and 0.8 ppb of pendimethalin). Various oxidative stress indicators such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels and protein carbonyl content, as well as antioxidant defenses parameters, such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH) and non-protein thiols (NP-SH) levels were studied, using the liver, kidney and gill tissues. Pendimethalin exposure increased lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation processes. There was significant inhibition in levels of GSH and NP-SH. The activity of antioxidant enzymes GST and CAT depleted in all the tissues in a dose dependent manner. The histopathological change in the gill showed necrosis and atrophy of primary and secondary gill lamellae. The tissue damages like degeneration of cytoplasm in hepatocytes, atrophy, formation of vacuoles, are some histopathological changes observed in the liver. The changes in histoarchitechture observed in the kidney included necrosis, cellular hypertrophy and granular cytoplasm. The present study demonstrates the disturbances in antioxidant armamentarium and importance of study in the potential risk assessment of herbicides on fish species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)(2)] at different concentrations (1.5, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/kg) on growth, oxidative damage and antioxidant parameters in silver catfish after 30 and 60 days. Fish fed with 5.0 mg/kg of (PhSe)(2) experienced a significant decrease in weight, length, and condition factor after 30 days and these parameters increased after 60 days. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonyl (PC) decreased in the liver of silver catfish supplemented with (PhSe)(2) after 30 days at all concentrations, while after 60 days these parameters decreased in liver, gills, brain, and muscle. Supplementationwith (PhSe)(2) induced a decrease in catalase (CAT) activity fromliver only after 60 days of feeding. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased at 5.0 mg/kg after 30 and 60 days and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was enhanced at 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg after 30 and 60 days. Silver catfish supplemented for 30 days showed a significant increase in liver glutathione S-transferase (GST) at 3.0 mg/kg, while after 60 days GST activity increased in liver at 1.5, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/kg and in gills at 3.0 and 5.0 mg/kg of (PhSe)(2). After 30 days, non-protein thiols (NPSH) did not change, while after 60 days NPSH increased in liver, gills, brain, and muscle. In addition, ascorbic acid (AA) levels after 30 days increased in liver at three concentrations and in gills andmuscle at 1.5 mg/kg, while after 60 days, AA increased at all concentrations in all and tissues tested. Thus, diet supplemented with (PhSe)(2) for 60 days could be more effective for silver catfish. Although the concentration of 5.0 mg/kg showed decreased growth parameters, concentrations of 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg, in general, decreased oxidative damage and increased antioxidant defenses.

AB  - There is limited knowledge on the toxicological, physiological, and molecular effects attributed to organophosphate (OP) compounds currently used as flame retardants or additives in consumer products. This study investigated the effects on oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in juvenile Atlantic salmon liver and brain samples after exposure to two OP compounds, tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). In this study, groups of juvenile Atlantic salmon were exposed using a semistatic experimental protocol over a 7-d period to 3 different concentrations (0.04, 0.2, or 1 mg/L) of TBOEP and TCEP. When toxicological factors such as bioaccumulation and bioconcentration, and chemical structural characteristics and behavior, including absorption to solid materials, are considered, these concentrations represent environmentally relevant concentrations. The concentrations of the contaminants were derived from levels of their environmental occurrence. The expression of genes related to oxidative stressglutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST)and to lipid peroxidationperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)were determined using quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The presence of PPAR proteins was also investigated using immunochemical methods. Levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in liver were used as a measure of lipid peroxidation. Overall, our data show an increase in lipid peroxidation, and this was associated with an augmented expression of genes from the glutathione family of responses. Interestingly, PPAR expression in liver after exposure to TBOEP and TCEP was consistently decreased compared to controls, while expression in brain did not show a similar trend. The results suggest that OP contaminants may induce oxidative stress and thus production of reactive oxygen substances (ROS), and modulate lipid peroxidation processes in organisms.

AB  - Pollinators face many challenges within agricultural systems due to landscape changes and intensification which can affect resource availability that can impact pollination services. This paper examines pigeon pea pollination and considers how landscape context and agricultural intensification in terms of pesticide use affects the abundance of bees characterized by species guilds on crops. The study was conducted on six paired farms across a gradient of habitat complexity based on the distance of each farm from adjacent semi-natural vegetation in Kibwezi Sub-county, Kenya. The study found that farms which do not use insecticides in farm management, but are in close proximity to natural habitat have greater bee guild abundance, but at further distances, overall abundance is reduced with or without insecticide use. At 1 km landscape radius, the complexity of habitats but not patch size had a positive impact on the abundance of cavity nesting bees and mason bees, which can be attributed to the interspersion of the small-holder farms with semi-natural habitats across the landscapes producing mosaics of heterogeneous habitats. The study revealed the strongest relationships between fruit set and bee abundance to be with the carpenter bee, social bee and solitary bee guilds, which are among the most abundant bees visiting pigeon pea flowers in this system. Our findings provide the foundation for conservation efforts by identifying which bee guilds pollinated pigeon peas. From this study, we suggest managing the floral and nesting resources that would best support the most abundant crop pollinators, and also reducing insecticide application to the crop.

AB  - The increasing frequency of multi-drug resistant microorganisms has driven research into alternative therapeutic strategies. In this respect, natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold much promise as candidates for the development of novel antibiotics. However, AMPs have some intrinsic drawbacks, such as partial degradation by host proteases or inhibition by host body fluid composition, potential toxicity, and high production costs. This review focuses on the hepcidins, which are peptides produced by the human liver with a known role in iron homeostasis, as well by numerous other organisms (including fish, reptiles, other mammals), and their potential as antibacterial and antifungal agents. Interestingly, the antimicrobial properties of human hepcidins are enhanced at acidic pH, rendering these peptides appealing for the design of new drugs targeting infections that occur in body areas with acidic physiological pH. This review not only considers current research on the direct killing activity of these peptides, but evaluates the potential application of these molecules as coating agents preventing biofilm formation and critically assesses technical obstacles preventing their therapeutic application.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether neem (Azadirachta indica) seeds oil (NO) induced changes on some oxidative indicators and histopathological alterations in tissues of Oreochromis niloticus fish and the possible protective effects of copper nicotinate (CN) and vitamin E on neem oil-induced changes. Fish were divided into 8 groups and treated with NO alone or in combination with CN, vitamin E and clean water. NO interfered with the antioxidant defense system of O. niloticus, as there was a decrease in GST, CAT and SOD activities in all studied organs as compared to control group. These alterations in antioxidants activities were accompanied with the occurrence of histological lesions and damage in gills, liver and posterior kidney tissues. The addition of CN and Vitamin E in fish diets could protect the fish O. niloticus against NOinduced oxidative damage and histopathological changes showing recovery of fish organs. It was concluded that although botanical pesticides are being considered as less toxic/safe, but it may provoke deleterious changes in vital organs of the fish. Hence, precautions must be taken into account when botanicals are being used in fish production facilities.

AB  - Epigenetics can play a role in interactions between chemicals and exposed species, between species and abiotic ecosystem components or between species of the same or another population in a community. Technological progress and advanced insights into epigenetic processes have led to the description of epigenetic features (mainly DNA methylation) in many ecologically relevant species: algae, plants, several invertebrates and fish. Epigenetic changes in plants, insects and cladocerans have been reported to be induced by various environmental stress factors including nutrition or water deficiency, grazing, light or temperature alterations, social environment, and dissolved organic matter concentrations. As regards chemicals, studies in rats and mice exposed to specific pesticides, hydrocarbons, dioxins, and endocrine disrupting chemicals demonstrated the induction of epigenetic changes, suggesting the need for further research with these substances in an ecotoxicological context. In fish and plants, exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and soluble fractions of solid waste affected the epigenetic status. A novel concept in ecotoxicological epigenetics is the induction of transgenerational stress resistance upon chemical exposure, as demonstrated in rice exposed to metals. Evaluating epigenetics in ecotoxicological field studies is a second relatively new approach. A cryptic lineage of earthworms had developed arsenic tolerance in the field, concurrent with specific DNA methylation patterns. Flatfish caught in the framework of environmental monitoring had developed tumours, exhibiting specific DNA methylation patterns. Two main potential implications of epigenetics in an ecotoxicological context are (1) the possibility of trans-generationally inherited, chemical stress-induced epigenetic changes with associated phenotypes and (2) epigenetically induced adaptation to stress upon long-term chemical exposure. Key knowledge gaps are concerned with the causality of the relation between epigenetic and phenotypic changes, the persistence of transgenerational effects, the implications at population level and the costs of tolerance. Epigenetic changes following exposure to multiple stressors constitute another promising area of further research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A new Edwardsiella taxon was recently described from fishes of Europe and Asia. Phenotypically similar to E. tarda, extensive genetic and phenotypic characterization determined this new strain does not belong to any established Edwardsiella taxa, leading to the adoption of a new taxon, E. piscicida. Concurrent research in the USA also identified 2 genetically distinct taxa within the group of organisms traditionally classified as E. tarda. Comparisons of gyrB sequences between US isolates and E. piscicida from Europe and Asia identified several US isolates with > 99.6% similarity to the gyrB sequence of the E. piscicida type strain (ET883) but < 87% similarity to the E. tarda type strain (ATCC #15947). A discriminatory PCR was developed for the identification of E. tarda and 2 genetic variants of E. piscicida (E. piscicida and E. piscicida-like species). Using these PCR assays, a survey was conducted of 44 archived bacterial specimens from disease case submissions to the Aquatic Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (Stoneville, MS, USA) between 2007 and 2012. All 44 isolates, originally identified phenotypically and biochemically as E. tarda, were identified as E. piscicida by PCR. Repetitive sequence-mediated PCR (rep-PCR) analysis of these archived specimens suggests they are largely homogenous, similar to what has been observed for E. ictaluri. The gyrB sequence data, coupled with the E. piscicida specific-PCR and rep-PCR data, confirms that E. piscicida has been isolated from fish disease cases in the southeastern USA. Moreover, our survey data suggests E. piscicida may be more prevalent in catfish aquaculture than E. tarda.

AB  - Today the United States is plagued by societal issues, economic insecurity, and increasing health problems. Societal issues include lack of community inclusion, pollution, and access to healthy foods. The high unemployment coupled with the rising cost of crude oil derivatives, and the growing general gap between cost of living and minimum wage levels contribute to a crippled consumer-driven US economy. Health concerns include increasing levels of obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. These epidemics lead to staggering economic burdens costing Americans hundreds of billions of dollars each year.
   It is well-known that many of the health issues impacting Americans can be directly linked to the production, availability, and quality of the food. Factors contributing to the availability of food include reduction of United States farmland, an increase in food imported from overseas, and the cost of goods to the consumer. The quality of food is influenced by the method of growth as well as imposed preservation techniques to support food transportation and distribution. At the same time, it has become increasingly common to implement biotechnology in genetically modified crops for direct human food or indirectly as a livestock feed for animals consumed by humans Crops are also routinely dosed with pesticides and hounones in an attempt to increase productivity and revenue, with little consideration or understanding of the long term health effects.
   Research shows that community gardens positively impact local employment, community involvement and inclusivity, and the diets of not only those involved in food production, but all members of their households. The purpose of this work is to determine the feasibility of an energy efficient large-scale aquaponic food production and distribution facility which could directly mitigate growing socioeconomic concerns in the US through applied best practices in sustainability. Aquaponics is a symbiotic relationship between aquaculture and hydroponics, where fish and plants grow harmoniously. The energy efficient facility would be located in an urban area, and employ solar panels, natural lighting, rain water reclamation, and a floor plan optimized for maximum food yield and energy efficiency. Examples of potential crops include multiple species of berries, corn, leafy vegetables, tomatoes, peppers, squash, and carrots. Potential livestock include responsibly farmed tilapia, shrimp, crayfish, and oysters.
   The large scale aquaponic facility shows a lengthy period for financial return on investment whether traditional style construction of the building or a green construction style is used. However many forms of federal government aid and outside assistance exist for green construction to help drive down the risk in the higher initial investment which in the long run could end up being more profitable than going with a traditionally constructed building. Outside of financial return there are many proven, positive impacts that a large-scale aquaponic facility would have. Among these are greater social involvement and inclusivity, job creation, increased availability of fresh food, and strengthening of America's agriculture infrastructure leading to increased American independence.

AB  - Methylmercury (MeHg) has been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease in some but not all epidemiology studies. These inconsistent results may stem from the fact that exposure typically occurs in the context of fish consumption, which is also associated with cardioprotective factors such as omega-3 fatty acids. Mechanistic information may help to understand whether MeHg represents a risk to cardiovascular health. MeHg is a pro-oxidant that inactivates protein sulfhydryls. These biochemical effects may diminish critical antioxidant defense mechanism(s) involved in protecting against atherosclerosis. One such defense mechanism is paraoxonase-1 (PON1), an enzyme present on high-density lipoproteins and that prevents the oxidation of blood lipids and their deposition in vascular endothelium. PON1 is potentially useful as a clinical biomarker of cardiovascular risk, as well as a critical enzyme in the detoxification of certain organophosphate oxons. MeHg and other metals are known to inhibit PON1 activity in vitro. MeHg is associated with lowered serum PON1 activity in a fish-eating population. The implications of lowering PON1 are evaluated by predicting the shift in PON1 population distribution induced by various doses of MeHg. An MeHg dose of 0.3 mu g/kg/d is estimated to decrease the population average PON1 level by 6.1% and to increase population risk of acute cardiovascular events by 9.7%. This evaluation provides a plausible mechanism for MeHg-induced cardiovascular risk and suggests means to quantify the risk. This case study exemplifies the use of upstream disease biomarkers to evaluate the additive effect of chemical toxicity with background disease processes in assessing human risk.

AB  - Context: Male infertility is one of the leading causes of social frustration and marginalization, mainly in the developing world. It is attributed to many factors including exposure to agropesticides such as manganese ethylenebis (dithiocarbamate) (maneb), which is one of the most frequently used fungicides in Cameroon. Previous reports support efficiency of some medicinal plants commonly used in Cameroonian folk medicine for the treatment of this disorder.
   Objective: The present study was aimed at assessing the protective effect of extracts from selected plant species, namely Basella alba L. (Basellaceae) (MEBa) and Carpolobia alba G. Don (Polygalaceae) (AECa), in alleviating the maneb-induced impairment of male reproductive function in Wistar albino rats.
   Materials and methods: The rats were treated with vehicle, plant extract (MEBa or AECa), maneb and maneb plus plant extract, respectively, and their fertility was assessed. Animals were thereafter sacrificed and organs (liver, kidneys and reproductive organs) were dissected out and weighed. Serum androgens together with alanine aminotransferase, liver glutathione and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) were also measured.
   Results and discussion: From this study, both plant extracts stimulated testosterone and improved fertility. Administration of MEBa plus maneb prevented fertility reduction by maneb and minimized the inhibitory effect of maneb on testosterone levels. AECa also improved fertility of the maneb-exposed rats, though without restoring testosterone levels, and other investigated parameters remained unaffected by different treatments.
   Conclusion: These findings emphasized the beneficial effects of B. alba and C. alba extracts on male fertility, and suggest their protective effect against maneb-induced toxicity in male reproductive function.

AB  - Conventional cattle ranching in the lowlands of Chiapas, Mexico typically employs extensive grazing, annual pasture burns and frequent applications of agrochemicals, threatening biodiversity and long-term productivity. A small group of innovative ranchers in the Central Valleys are converting to holistic management through careful land-use planning, rotational grazing, diversified forage, and diminished use of purchased inputs. We compared the sustainability of 18 conventional and seven holistic, dual-purpose ranches, using three sets of sustainability metrics. First, we combined semistructured interviews and field observations to better describe the two productions systems and to calculate an "Organic Conversion Index" (OCI), combining economic, social, technological and environmental indicators. Holistic ranchers have more pasture divisions, higher grazing pressure, greater lengths of time between pasture burns, greater milk productivity, larger forest reserves, lower cow and calf mortality, purchase less hay and feed, and use less herbicides and pesticides than their conventional neighbors (T-tests and Fisher's Exact Tests; all p < 0.05). OCI was greater (T-test, p < 0.0005) for holistic ranches (81.8 +/- 4.6% compliance with organic standards), than for conventional ranches (32.1 +/- 9.0% compliance), with holistic ranches demonstrating superiority for nine of ten OCI indicators. Second, drawing on data from the same interviews, we conducted "emergy" analysis to quantify the embodied energy of inputs, outputs and sustainability of the ranching systems. The Emergy Yield Ratio, an index of a systems emergy throughput relative to the emergy in purchased inputs, was marginally higher in holistic ranches (T-test; p = 0.07), but became significant when only ranches >= 40 ha were analyzed (p = 0.04) and when government assistance (mostly in the form of machinery) was removed from the calculations (p = 0.008). Holistic ranches exhibited marginally higher Emergy Sustainability Indices, a measure of system yield relative to environmental impact, for all ranches combined (p = 0.07) and for ranches >= 40 ha (p = 0.06). Third, we sampled vegetation and soils on seven holistic and seven conventional ranches. We found higher soil respiration, deeper topsoil, increased earthworm presence, more tightly closed herbaceous canopies (all p < 0.05), and marginally greater forage availability (p = 0.053) in holistic ranches. Other variables, including soil compaction, soil chemistry and pasture tree cover, did not differ significantly between groups. These data are a snapshot of long, complex processes. Nonetheless, these complementary metrics combine to suggest that holistic management strategies are leading to greater ecological and economic sustainability. This production model merits further study for potential broader application as well as greater attention from decision makers concerned with ranching and the environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects approximately 35 million people worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that many risk factors for AD are modifiable. AD pathology develops over decades. Hence risk reduction interventions require very long follow-ups to show effects on AD incidence. Focussing on AD risk, instead of diagnosis, provides a more realistic target for prevention strategies. We developed a novel methodology that yields a global approach to risk assessment for AD for use in population-based settings and interventions. The methodology was used to develop a risk assessment tool that can be updated as more evidence becomes available. First, a systematic search strategy identified risk and protective factors for AD. Eleven risk factors and four protective factors for AD were identified for which odds ratios were published or could be calculated (age, sex, education, body mass index, diabetes, depression, serum cholesterol, traumatic brain injury, smoking, alcohol intake, social engagement, physical activity, cognitive activity, fish intake, and pesticide exposure). An algorithm was developed to combine the odds ratios into an AD risk score. The approach allows for interactions among risk factors which provides for their varying impact over the life-course as current evidence suggests midlife is a critical period for some risk factors. Finally, a questionnaire was developed to assess the risk and protective factors by self-report. Compared with developing risk indices on single cohort studies, this approach allows for more risk factors to be included, greater generalizeability of results, and incorporation of interactions based on findings from different stages of the lifecourse.

AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCBI) is an important part of the multixeno-biotic resistance (MXR) defense system in aquatic organisms. The main goal of this study was identification of P-gp inhibitors in contaminated sediments using the effect directed analysis (EDA) approach. The samples were collected from the Gorjak creek (Zagreb, Croatia), a recipient of wastewater effluents from the pharmaceutical hidustry. Sediment samples were extracted and fractionated using a two-tiered approach. Resulting nonpolar, medium polar, and polar fractions were tested on the inhibition of P-gp activity using P-gp overexpressing PLHC-1/dox cells and calcein-AM as model substrate. The obtained ECM) values (up to 757 mu g/g, expressed in toxicity equivalents of model P-gp inhibitor cyclosporine A) revealed high inhibitory potential of polar 1 fractions of investigated sediments and clearly reflected the impact of pharmaceutical wastewater. P-gp specific ATPase assay and the cytotoxicity modulation experiments with colchicine indicated that most of the observed P-gp inhibition was due to the presence of noncompetitive inhibitors. A detailed chemical analysis by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS) revealed nonionic surfactants, including alcohol polyethoxylates (LAEOs) and polypropylene glycols (PPGs), as the major components of the most active subfractions. Testing of several LAEO and PPG commercial mixtures confirmed their potential to inhibit the fish P-glycoprotein and modulate toxicity of other xenobiotics present in complex environmental samples.

AB  - A previous work has indicated that fighting fish behaviour of Betta splendens can be used as a bio-indicator of heavy metal pollution. In this article, the effect of methyl parathion on the fighting behaviour of male Siamese fighting fish was investigated. The frequency and duration of opercular erection were taken as indicators of male aggressiveness towards another male. All male fish were housed in glass jars for 1-2 weeks prior to experiments. Sixteen naive males were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: methyl parathion (5 mg/L) and control. Males were placed in their respective treatment jars for 24 h, and then, each male was paired with another male of matching size in an 30x25x25 cm aquarium. The aquarium had an opaque divider to keep the two males separate for 10 min of acclimation period. The divider was then removed and behavioural measurements were taken for another 10 min. The results showed that fish placed in methyl parathion had significantly lower aggressive behaviour, as indicated by lower frequency and shorter duration of opercular erection. It can be concluded that aggressive behaviour of male Betta splendens is a suitable bio-indicator of organophosphate pollution.

AB  - Background. A World War II defense site at Northway, Alaska, was remediated in the 1990s, leaving complex questions regarding historic exposures to toxic waste. This article describes the context, methods, limitations and findings of the Northway Wild Food and Health Project (NWFHP).
   Objective. The NWFHP comprised 2 pilot studies: the Northway Wild Food Study (NWFS), which investigated contaminants in locally prioritized traditional foods over time, and the Northway Health Study (NHS), which investigated locally suspected links between resource uses and health problems.
   Design. This research employed mixed methods. The NWFS reviewed remedial documents and existing data. The NHS collected household information regarding resource uses and health conditions by questionnaire and interview. NHS data represent general (yes or no) personal knowledge that was often second hand. Retrospective cohort comparisons were made of the reported prevalence of 7 general health problems between groups based on their reported (yes or no) consumption of particular resources, for 3 data sets (existing, historic and combined) with a two-tailed Fisher's Exact Test in SAS (n = 325 individuals in 83 households, 24 of which no longer exist).
   Results. The NWFS identified historic pathways of exposure to petroleum, pesticides, herbicides, chlorinated byproducts of disinfection and lead from resources that were consumed more frequently decades ago and are not retrospectively quantifiable. The NHS found complex patterns of association between reported resource uses and cancer and thyroid-, reproductive-, metabolic- and cardiac problems.
   Conclusion. Lack of detail regarding medical conditions, undocumented histories of exposure, time lapsed since the release of pollution and changes to health and health care over the same period make this exploratory research. Rather than demonstrate causation, these results document the legitimacy of local suspicions and warrant additional investigation. This article presents our findings, with discussion of limitations related to study design and limitations that are inherent to such research.

AB  - Bangladesh achieved her independence in 1971 from the West Pakistan, which was a legacy of the British Colonial authorities as whole. Since the independence, it is observed that the Government of Bangladesh was very aware about the environmental conservation issue. After few years passed, the Government passed 'the Environment Pollution Control Ordinance, 1977. Later on, the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995 due to its inadequacy repealed this law. In nineties, some severe environment pollutions relating to air, water, soil and food, deforestation, soil degradation, biodiversity, loss of ecosystems, draught etc; were found to over population, over harvest and degradation of resources, unplanned industrial development and management, indiscriminate use of pesticides, herbicides and chemical fertilizer, improper management of solid waste in urban areas, unwise use of ground water etc. Therefore, the Government formulated and passed the Environment Policy, 1992; Environment Action Plan, 1992 etc.; covering all sectors such as the forestry, fisheries, agriculture, urbanization, population, science and technology, legal aspects etc. In order to proper implement and execute of the environmental issues, the Government passed the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995; the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Rules 1997 and the Environment Courts Act 2000 etc. The judiciary in Bangladesh is also healthy to the environment by applying and encouraging the public interest litigation and gradually developing in this regard. Some environmental non-governmental organizations also have been working in this field along with the help of civil society. In addition, the Government passed some important international environmental initiatives such as the Rio declaration 1992, the Stockholm Conference 1972; the UNFCCC 1992, Kyoto Protocol 1987, Johannesburg Conference 2002 to tackle the external and internal environmental problems of the country. However, the study finds that there are some constraints and problems such as the non-coordination, shortage of expertise, lack of commitments, corruption etc., in this regard. These problems should be solved by enacting cocoordinating Act and developing other mechanism as suggested in the study. The study examines and provides an overview the development of the environmental laws and policy in Bangladesh including the sectoral laws and based on the primary and secondary sources.

Juvenile Senegalese soles were exposed for 14 days in the laboratory and in situ (field) to sediments from three sites (a reference plus two contaminated) of a Portuguese estuary. Sediment characterization confirmed the combination of metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and organochlorines in the two contaminated sediments. Changes in liver cytosolic protein regulation patterns were determined by a combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis with de novo sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry. From the forty-one cytosolic proteins found to be deregulated, nineteen were able to be identified, taking part in multiple cellular processes such as anti-oxidative defence, energy production, proteolysis and contaminant catabolism (especially oxidoreductase enzymes). Besides a clear distinction between animals exposed to the reference and contaminated sediments, differences were also observed between laboratory- and in situ-tested fish. Soles exposed in the laboratory to the contaminated sediments failed to induce, or even markedly down-regulated, many proteins, with the exception of a peroxiredoxin (an anti-oxidant enzyme) and a few others, when compared to reference fish. In situ exposure to the contaminated sediments revealed significant up-regulation of basal metabolism-related enzymes, comparatively to the reference condition. Down-regulation of basal metabolism enzymes, related to energy production and gene transcription, in fish exposed in the laboratory to the contaminated sediments, may be linked to sediment-bound contaminants and likely compromised the organisms' ability to deploy adequate responses against insult.

Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 302: R000-R000, 2012. First published February 29, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00243.2011.-The specific contribution of each antioxidant enzyme to protection against the reoxygenation-associated oxidative stress after periods of hypoxia is not well understood. We assessed the physiological role of catalase during posthypoxic reoxygenation by the combination of two approaches. First, catalase activity of Nile tilapias (Oreochromis niloticus) was 90% suppressed by intraperitoneal injection of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ, 1g/kg). In ATZ-injected fish, liver GSH levels, oxidative stress markers, and activities of other antioxidant enzymes remained unchanged. Second, animals with depleted catalase activity (or those saline-injected) were subjected to a cycle of severe hypoxia (dissolved O-2 = 0.28 mg/l for 3 h) followed by reoxygenation (0.5 to 24 h). Hypoxia did not induce changes in the above-mentioned parameters, either in saline-or in ATZ-injected animals. Reoxygenation increased superoxide dismutase activity in saline-injected fish, whose levels were similar to ATZ-injected animals. The activities of glutathione S-transferase, selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, and total-GPX and the levels of GSH-eq, GSSG, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances remained unchanged during reoxygenation in both saline-and ATZ-injected fish. The GSSG/GSH-eq ratio in ATZ-injected fish increased at 30 min of reoxygenation compared with saline-injected ones. Reoxygenation also increased carbonyl protein levels in saline-injected fish, whose levels were similar to the ATZ-injected group. Our work shows that inhibition of liver tilapia catalase causes a redox imbalance during reoxygenation, which is insufficient to induce further oxidative stress. This indicates the relevance of hepatic catalase for hypoxia/reoxygenation stress in tilapia fish.

AB  - In the Willamette River Basin (Oregon, USA), various residential, municipal, industrial, and agricultural activities produce physical, biological, and chemical stressors that may impinge on the basin's aquatic ecosystems. For >30 years, numerous water-quality and biological- condition data have been accumulated by often disparate monitoring programs. This diagnostic analysis explored whether these legacy data could be used to correlate the presence of chemical stressors with biological condition impacts with the understanding that association is not necessarily causation. Other natural or anthropogenic stressors that may also impact biological conditions were not considered in this study. Acute-toxicity indices were calculated separately for trace metals and organic chemicals detected in surface waters between 1994 and 2010 and then compared with land-use metrics and vertebrate-and invertebrate-assemblage indices from surveys conducted basin-wide during this same period. Half of the possible relations between land use, biological condition, and toxicity were statistically significant at p <= 0.10. These results suggest that conditions for aquatic receptors improve either as agricultural or urban land decreases or as forested land increases and that chemical mixtures (primarily involving pesticides) may have impacted components of the basin's aquatic ecosystems. There may be a need for strengthened chemical-management practices on agricultural and urban lands and for maintaining undisturbed forested land to limit chemical migration into adjacent waters. Although these results indicate some utility for legacy data, they also suggest that a more defensible assessment of chemical stressors requires a program specifically designed for that purpose.

AB  - Fish oil is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4).
   Fish oil was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 18 December 2008 pursuant to Article 24b of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation') and has subsequently been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009(5), in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011(6), as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/2011(7). In accordance with Article 25a of the Regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 114/2010(8), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2012 its view on the draft review report submitted by the European Commission in accordance with Article 25(1) of the Regulation. This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.
   Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fish oil in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 3 April 2008. The peer review was initiated on 31 July 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the notifier (Fluegel GmbH). The commenting period with Member States was launched on 16 December 2010. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation and EFSA should deliver its conclusions on fish oil. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of fish oil as a game repellent in deciduous and coniferous forests and orchards, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   In the area of identity, physical/chemical/technical properties and methods of analysis data gaps were identified for a specification and supporting data. Data gaps were also identified for further physical-chemical properties of the active substance and the formulation and a translation of some studies. A method of analysis is also required for the formulation.
   No agreed technical specification is available and a data gap is identified in the mammalian toxicology section on the presence and maximum level of impurities and/or contaminants of potential toxicological concern; this issue could not be finalised.
   Fish oil is a natural compound produced from fresh fish. Fate and behaviour of fish oil is expected to follow the normal pathways of dissipation and degradation common to naturally occurring residues of biological origin. Considering the nature of the substance and the limited usage a definition of residue in the environment for risk assessment is deemed to be unnecessary for fish oil.
   The risk to non-target organisms is considered as low for the representative uses.

   Gibberellic acid was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 September 2009 pursuant to Article 24b of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as, the Regulation.) and has subsequently been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/20096, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/20117, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/20118. In accordance with Article 25a of the Regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 114/20109, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2012 its view on the draft review report submitted by the European Commission in accordance with Article 25(1) of the Regulation. This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.
   Hungary being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on gibberellic acid in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 31 March 2008. The peer review was initiated on 22 July 2008 by dispatching the DAR to the notifier The EU Gibberellic Acid Task Force, and on 24 February 2011 to the Member States. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that EFSA should conduct a focused peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on gibberellic acid.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of gibberellic acid as a plant growth regulator on grapes, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   In the area of identity, physical/chemical/technical properties and methods of analysis data for the surface tension and to identify the hydrolysis products for the active substance were identified as data gaps. For the formulation data gaps were identified for storage stability, attrition and a method of analysis.
   Several data gaps were identified in the mammalian toxicology section: to demonstrate the compliance of the batches used in the toxicological studies to the technical specifications (leading to an issue that could not be finalised) and to assess the toxicological relevance of impurities.
   A data gap was identified in the residue section for the submission of information on the natural background level of gibberellins in grapes. MRLs were not proposed as residue levels in treated and control samples were below the LOQ and since it would not be possible to distinguish between exogenous and natural gibberellins.
   The information available on the environmental fate and behaviour in the environment was insufficient to assess the environmental exposure levels of potential transformation products of gibberellic acid. Consequently the potential for groundwater exposure by gibberellic acid transformation products and the risk assessments to aquatic and soil-dwelling organisms from transformation products could not be finalised.
   A data gap was identified to address the risk to aquatic macrophytes, chronic risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates, risk to non-target arthropods and earthworms from exposure to gibberellic acid. Furthermore, the representativeness of the material tested in the ecotoxicological studies to the technical specification should be addressed, leading to a data gap. A low acute risk from exposure to gibberellic acid was concluded for aquatic organisms. A low risk was concluded for mammals, bees, soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment processes.

AB  - Methyl nonyl ketone is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/20043, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074.
   Methyl nonyl ketone was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 September 2009 pursuant to Article 24b of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'), and has subsequently been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/20095, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/20116, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/20117. In accordance with Article 25a of the Regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 114/20108, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2012 its view on the draft review report submitted by the European Commission in accordance with Article 25(1) of the Regulation. This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.
   Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on methyl nonyl ketone in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 18 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 12 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the original notifier Pet and Gardening Manufacturing Ltd (the notifier is now Spotless Punch Ltd). Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation and EFSA should deliver its conclusions on methyl nonyl ketone.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of methyl nonyl ketone as an animal repellent for the protection of home garden and amenity grass, ornamentals and vegetable patches, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   Numerous data gaps have been identified for the physical and chemical properties of the active substance and the formulation. The technical specification for this compound is open because the 5batch analysis was not conducted according to GLP. Data gaps for methods for the technical material, formulation, soil, water and air have been identified.
   A critical area of concern was identified for methyl nonyl ketone in the mammalian toxicology section, as it was not possible to assess the compliance of the batches tested with the proposed specification (both missing). Based on the outcome of the vapour pressure study (data gap identified by physical chemical properties section), an acute inhalation toxicity study might be required.
   No significant residues in plant or animal matrices were expected based on the representative use, and a quantitative consumer risk assessment is therefore not required.
   The information on the environmental fate and behaviour of methyl nonyl ketone in relation to the representative uses assessed was insufficient to complete the necessary environmental exposure assessment at the EU level. The fate and behaviour in soil and natural sediment water systems has not been addressed. Consequently the environmental exposure assessment for soil, surface water and groundwater for any transformation products that might be formed from methyl nonyl ketone could not be finalised. A data gap was also identified for the adsorption/desorption properties of the active substance, and therefore the available predicted environmental concentrations in surface water can not be considered valid. Because of the lack of relevant end points for methyl nonyl ketone the groundwater exposure assessment could not be finalised.
   A critical area of concern was identified for methyl nonyl ketone in the ecotoxicology section, as it was not possible to assess the compliance of the batches tested with the proposed specification (both missing). A data gap was identified to provide acute toxicity studies for fish to fulfil the Annex II data requirements. Data gaps were also identified for a new risk assessment for aquatic organisms, and to further address the risk to soil-living organisms (i. e. earthworms, other soil macro-and microorganisms, soil non-target arthropods).

AB  - The management of urban water resources plays an important role for developing countries. The Tiete and Pinheiros Rivers (Sao Paulo, Brazil) are affected by domestic and industrial effluents and by the diffuse pollution. This research aimed to quantify 134 variables in the water of Tiete and Pinheiros Rivers (approximately 7,200 and 6,600 analyses, respectively) from August 2007 to December 2008. The idea was to verify if the fact that both rivers are located in the same basin is enough to consider the application of a single management plan for both. Data showed that the rivers presented significant anthropogenic interference. The results suggested that such rivers must be subjected to individual management plans since there were exclusive occurrences (variables that were only detected in one of the rivers). Moreover, there was a statistically significant difference between rainy and dry periods for eleven variables (p*<0.05, ANOVA), reinforcing the special importance of the temporal component within the monitoring program. It is expected that this study subsidize environmental recovery programs in the Tiete River, to which is recommendable to focus on prosecution of illegal wastewater releases, and in the Pinheiros River, to which special attention is suggested to the pollution derived from the pesticides load to the water body.

The peer review was initiated on 12 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR to the notifier Gyllebo Godning AB and on 16 December 2010 to the Member States for consultation. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation and EFSA should deliver its conclusions on blood meal.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of blood meal as a repellent on deciduous and coniferous trees in forestry, orchard trees and ornamental plants, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   In the section for identity, physical, chemical and technical properties and methods of analysis data gaps were identified for a specification with supporting data, solubility in water, shelf-life, evidence that the formulation can form a useable solution and a method of analysis for the formulation.
   No data gaps or critical areas of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicology section.
   No data gaps or critical areas of concern were identified in the residue section.
   The fate and behaviour in the environment of blood meal residues is expected to follow the normal pathways of dissipation and degradation common to naturally occurring residues of biological origin. Considering the nature of the substance and most methods of application leading to negligible levels of environmental exposure, further consideration of its fate and behaviour in the environment was concluded to be unnecessary, with the exception of when application is made by less targeted spray application methods such as air-assisted broadcast spraying. In this situation the environmental exposure assessment to aquatic systems was not finalised.
   A data gap was identified in the ecotoxicology section for the mandatory toxicity studies with aquatic organisms (acute toxicity test for fish, acute toxicity test for aquatic invertebrates and chronic study for algae) to fulfil the Annex II data requirements. In addition, due to a missing aquatic exposure assessment when less targeted spray application methods are employed, the risk assessment for aquatic organisms was not finalised.

AB  - Malaria has reemerged in tropical regions with rapid population growth and deforestation. The dynamics of malaria transmission in agricultural settlements of the Amazon have been poorly defined. We studied the spatial distribution of malaria incidence in Roraima, Brazil, using multi regression analysis on 12 parameters that described social, housing, and behavioral variables. Malaria cases were associated with the proximity of Anopheles darlingi breeding sites, the main vector in these areas. During the dry season, transmission was enhanced near a temporary river. Cases occurred throughout the year near fish-farming dams. Epidemiological models derived from urban or riverine malaria are probably inadequate for describing disease transmission in agricultural settlements, where cases are clustered near breeding sites, while the majority of the population remains unaffected. Identification of these areas, associated with residual insecticide spraying or surveillance, may considerably decrease the costs of control efforts. Journal of Vector Ecology 36 (1): 159-169. 2010.

AB  - 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4). In accordance with Article 21(1) of the Regulation, France, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), provided an initial evaluation of 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid in the format of a Draft Assessment Report (DAR), which was received by the EFSA on 30 October 2007. The European Commission examined 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid in accordance with Article 24a of the Regulation and it was concluded that there were clear indications of harmful effects, leading to the adoption of a decision on non-inclusion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC, in accordance with Articles 24f and 25 of the Regulation.
   Following the Commission Decision of 26 January 2009 (2009/65/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant L. Gobbi s.r.l. made a resubmission application for the inclusion of 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/2678/08 - rev. 0).
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Italy, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 21 May 2010.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 28 May 2010. The DAR was also distributed for comments. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 13 July 2010.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the European Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology and ecotoxicology, and deliver its conclusions on 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid as a plant growth regulator on tomatoes, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   Data gaps were identified in the section on physical and chemical properties and analytical methods.
   No data gaps or critical area of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicology section.
   In the residues section a substantial number of data gaps were identified. The residue definitions for risk assessment and for monitoring could not be agreed. Consequently, a consumer risk assessment could not be conducted.
   The data available on fate and behaviour in the environment are essentially sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses. However, the identification of the major aquatic metabolites was not available. Once this data gap is fulfilled the exposure and risk assessments for these metabolites might need to be updated. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by the relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   Various data gaps were included in the ecotoxicology section. A data gap was identified to address the risk to bees from 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid, as well as the long-term risk to earthworms. A data gap also remains to address the risk to non-target soil macro-organisms for the representative field uses. Furthermore, the applicant should submit data to address the acute toxicity of 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid to warm-water fish. Finally, a data gap was identified to address the effects of 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid on biological methods of sewage treatment. An in-field no-spray buffer zone of 5 m is required to obtain a low risk for 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid to non-target plants.

AB  - Propargite is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by Italy, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of propargite in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC.
   Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of propargite in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant (Chemtura Europe Ltd.) made a resubmission application for the inclusion of propargite in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR.
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Italy, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 4 March 2010.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 8 March 2010. The DAR was also distributed to Member States and the applicant for comments in view of the fact that the original peer review had been terminated following the applicant's notification of withdrawal of support. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 22 April 2010.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology, residues, fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on propargite.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of propargite as an acaricide on grapes and tomatoes, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   Two data gaps were identified in the section on identity.
   The technical specification is not supported by the batches used in the toxicological studies leading to a critical area of concern; the toxicological relevance of the impurities has not been adequately addressed and a data gap was identified. In addition, due to the fact that propargite exerts carcinogenic potential on different organs in two strains of rats and a genotoxic mode of action cannot be disregarded, no reliable reference values could be set at this stage until a new valid genotoxicity datapackage with the proposed specification is available. Therefore, the risk assessment could not be conducted leading to a critical area of concern.
   Five data gaps and one critical areas of concern were identified in the residues section. The consumer risk assessment could not be conducted.
   The information on the environmental fate and behaviour of propargite in relation to the representative use assessed was insufficient to complete the necessary environmental exposure assessment at the EU level. The fate and behaviour of the cyclohexyl ring moiety of propargite in soil and natural sediment water systems has not been addressed. Consequently the environmental exposure assessment for soil, surface water and groundwater for any transformation products that might be formed from this proportion of the molecule (e.g. 1,2-cyclohexanediol and derivatives) could not be finalised. For the metabolite TBPC-sulfate and the unidentified metabolite ascribed as "unk 1", the groundwater exposure assessment could not be finalised in respect of comparison to the parametric groundwater drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L. Information was not available on the possible preferential degradation and or conversion of the isomers of propargite or its transformation products in the environment.
   Eight data gaps and four critical areas of concern were identified in the ecotoxicology section. A high risk of propargite to aquatic organisms was identified (even with use of the risk mitigation measures comparable with 30 m non-spray buffer zones). A high long-term risk to mammals and a high risk to mammals from the consumption of contaminated water were identified. The risk from secondary poisoning to birds was identified as high, except for earthworm-eating bird in the grapes. The risk from secondary poisoning to mammals except for fish-eating mammals in the tomato scenario was assessed as high based on the available data.

AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp; abcb1) is one of the major ABC transport proteins that mediates multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) defense in fish. In order to offer a sound evaluation of its ecotoxicological relevance it is critical to characterize substrate specificity of fish P-gp. Measurement of the ATPase activity is a reliable approach often used to discern type of interaction of various drugs with mammalian P-gp. A similar assay has never been used for characterization of P-gp in aquatic organisms and the main goal of this study was to develop a specific ATPase assay for characterization of fish P-gp. For this purpose we have used P-gp enriched membrane vesicles isolated from fish hepatoma PLHC-1/dox cells characterized by high overexpression of P-gp. As additional demonstration of a P-gp specific phenotype, we have quantified transcript expression of a series of eight ABC efflux transporter genes constitutively expressed in PLHC-1 wild type and PLHC-1/dox cells. Transcript expression analysis confirmed high and specific P-gp transcript overexpression in PLHC-1/dox cells. Provided that the transcript abundance is translated to protein, the development of ATPase assay is enabled. Using this model we determined Km(ATP) of 0.4 mM, baseline ATPase activity from 35-50 nmol/mg(PROT)/min, and maximal activation of ATPase activity obtained for fish P-gp in our system was 1.8-2.5-fold over baseline. All these values were in good agreement with data previously reported for mammalian P-gp. In order to perform a more detailed characterization of fish P-gp substrate specificity, in the next step of our study we used the developed ATPase assay to test 50 different compounds for their interaction with fish P-gp. The same set of compounds was also tested with calcein-AM (Ca-AM) transport activity assay both using PLHC-1/dox cells and NIH 3T3/MDR1 fibroblast cells overexpressing human P-gp. Our results showed that there is a clear difference for some substances five compounds specifically interacted only with fish P-gp, while seven compounds exhibited interaction with human P-gp only. Most of the compounds tested in this study showed similar behavior in respect to fish or human P-gp and relatively high correlation in the interaction potency was found between fish and human P-gp. In summary, the described results represent the first in depth insight into substrate specificity of an important xenobiotic efflux transporter in fish. In addition, our study showed that combination of Ca-AM assay and the developed ATPase assay using inside/out vesicles isolated from PLHC-1/dox cells, offers a high-throughput and reliable approach for identification of environmentally relevant pollutants that interact with fish P-gp.

AB  - This article provides a comprehensive survey of models of dynamic games in the exploitation of renewable and exhaustible resources. It includes dynamic games at the industry level (oligopoly, cartel versus fringe, tragedy of the commons) and at the international level (tariffs on exhaustible resources, fish wars, entry deterrence). Among more recent topics are international strategic issues involving the link between resource uses and transboundary pollution, the design of taxation to ensure efficient outcomes under symmetric and asymmetric information, the rivalry among factions in countries where property rights on natural resources are not well established. Various extensions are considered, such as (i) modeling the effects of the concern for relative performance (relative income, relative consumption, and social status) on the over-exploitation of resources, (ii) applying the tragedy of the commons paradigm to the declining effectiveness of antibiotics and pesticides. Outcomes under Nash equilibria and Stackelberg equilibria are compared. The paper ends with some suggestions for future research.

AB  - Photobacterium comprises several species in Vibrionaceae, a large family of Gram-negative, facultatively aerobic, bacteria that commonly associate with marine animals. Members of the genus are widely distributed in the marine environment and occur in seawater, surfaces, and intestines of marine animals, marine sediments and saline lake water, and light organs of fish. Seven Photobacterium species are luminous via the activity of the lux genes, luxCDABEG. Much recent progress has been made on the phylogeny, genomics, and symbiosis of Photobacterium. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates a robust separation between Photobacterium and its close relatives, Aliivibrio and Vibrio, and reveals the presence of two well-supported clades. Clade 1 contains luminous and symbiotic species and one species with no luminous members, and Clade 2 contains mostly nonluminous species. The genomes of Photobacterium are similar in size, structure, and organization to other members of Vibrionaceae, with two chromosomes of unequal size and multiple rrn operons. Many species of marine fish form bioluminescent symbioses with three Photobacterium species: Photobacterium kishitanii, Photobacterium leiognathi, and Photobacterium mandapamensis. These associations are highly, but not strictly species specific, and they do not exhibit symbiont-host codivergence. Environmental congruence instead of host selection might explain the patterns of symbiont-host affiliation observed from nature.

AB  - Flurprimidol is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on flurprimidol in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 April 2007. The peer review was initiated on 17 September 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant SePRO Europe Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March-April 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 31 July 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 151).
   Following the Commission Decision of 13 January 2009 (2009/28/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of flurprimidol in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant SePRO Europe Limited made a resubmission application for the inclusion of flurprimidol in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues and concerns identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/173/08)as follows:
   The risk to operators and workers
   The exceedence of the AOEL (acceptable operator exposure level) for operators and workers in all evaluated scenarios and conditions of use;
   The lack of information on impurities present in the batches used in the toxicological studies.
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Finland, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 10 March 2010.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation ( EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 11 March 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 26 April 2010.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focussed peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on flurprimidol.
   The conclusion of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a plant growth regulator in ornamentals as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in Appendix A.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Topflor', a micro-emulsion ( ME) containing 3.8 g/l flurprimidol.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. There are no adequate methods available to monitor flurprimidol in the environmental matrices and in body fluids and tissues.
   In mammalian metabolism studies, flurprimidol was rapidly but not completely absorbed after oral administration. It was extensively metabolised and distributed through the body. Excretion was rapid, mainly via urine although some excretion was observed via bile and faeces. Moderate acute oral toxicity was found in rat and mouse, requiring classification with Xn, R22 "harmful if swallowed", but no classification was needed related to acute dermal or inhalation toxicity. Flurprimidol was not a skin or eye irritant and no sensitisation potential was found. Main effects observed in short-term and long-term toxicity studies were liver toxicity including enzyme induction and histopathological findings, and uterine and ovary weight changes down to the lowest dose tested, indicative of endocrine disruption effects at low doses. Genotoxicity studies covering all required endpoints (in vitro bacterial and mammalian gene mutation, chromosomal aberration and in vivo micronucleus test) were negative and no carcinogenic potential was observed in either rats or mice upon 2-year oral exposure.
   Flurprimidol was thought to inhibit aromatase activity because the observed effects were similar to those observed with structurally related active substance fenarimol. However, no mechanistic study was performed with flurprimidol and sensitive end points for aromatase inhibition were not measured in studies conducted with flurprimidol. Reproductive toxicity was indicated by increased precoital period, dystocia, progeny mortality, reduced mating performance and fertility which were not considered secondary to parental systemic toxicity. Accordingly, classification as toxic, reproduction toxicity category 2 for fertility, R60 "may impair fertility", was proposed. In the rat developmental toxicity study, the proportion of foetuses with developmental variations and abnormalities was increased and could not be explained by maternal toxicity alone. Accordingly classification as harmful, reproduction toxicity category 3 for development, R63 "possible risk of harm to the unborn child" was proposed. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure ( AOEL) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.09 mg/kg bw. Dermal absorption was 6 % for the concentrate formulation and 15 % for the in-use spray dilution based on an in vitro study performed on human skin. The estimated level of operator exposure calculated for glasshouses' uses on ornamentals with the representative formulation 'Topflor' according to the EUROPOEM II and the Dutch model is below the AOEL when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE, i.e. gloves and protective clothing) is considered. Estimated exposure of workers is below the AOEL after one application of 'Topflor' when the use of gloves and coverall is considered. After 2 applications (assuming that there is no decay in the residues during the 14-days interval between applications), estimated worker exposure exceeds the AOEL (103 %) even when PPE are worn and a critical area of concern was identified. Furthermore, flurprimidol is a racemate and there is no information on the relative toxicity of each isomer or whether there is a shift in the isomer ratio workers are exposed to. A data gap is identified to address this. Bystander's exposure is not relevant for the representative use.
   No data were submitted to study and assess the residue behaviour of flurprimidol in plants and livestock in order to define the relevant residues for dietary consumer risk assessment. The representative use of flurprimidol in containerised ornamentals, pot and bedding plants are normally not expected to result in any dietary exposure to consumers or livestock. Potted herbs or any other edible container plants are not meant to be included in the representative use. A potential transfer of residues from recycled soil and/or compost to crops intended for human or animal consumption should be avoided, by taking appropriate restriction measures. Under conditions excluding any potential consumer exposure to flurprimidol residues through food, there will be no dietary consumer risk related to the representative use.
   All available fate and behaviour into the environment studies have been performed with flurprimidol labelled exclusively at the phenyl ring and / or at the carbinol bridge. The meeting of experts identified a data gap for a full fate and behaviour data package of studies performed with flurprimidol labelled at the pyrimidine ring.
   The data available for fate and behaviour of flurprimidol into the environment are very limited. Information on the fate of the individual enantiomers is not available. Data on the route of degradation in soil are insufficient to assess any use for which exposure could not be completely excluded. The data available show that flurprimidol exhibits medium to high persistence in soil (DT50 = 98 - 183 d) under laboratory aerobic conditions ( no field study available) and that it is not hydrolysed in buffered water in the range of environmental pHs. Photolysis of flurprimidol in water was relatively rapid ( DT50 = 1.4 d) and results in the formation of two photolysis metabolites that would need to be further assessed for the aquatic environment in the situation that exposure could not be completely excluded from the representative use. No water sediment study is available in the dossier. Potential groundwater contamination was precluded from the representative use if it is restricted as proposed by the meeting of experts. In general a number of data gaps for fate and behaviour into the environment were identified during the peer review, however, they were considered not to be essential for the assessment of the representative use if this can be effectively restricted / managed in order to avoid exposure to the environment, including the potential exposure arising from disposal of used soil and residues of plants. Note the PPR panel of EFSA, has questioned the effectiveness of risk management measures such as those proposed here, to limit environmental exposure from uses in glasshouses.
   The environmental risk assessment covers only the use in glasshouses that are permanent structures. No risk assessment was conducted for birds and mammals. Direct exposure of birds and mammals is expected to be negligible for the representative use in glasshouses. The log P-ow of flurprimidol is >3 and therefore a risk assessment should be conducted for secondary poisoning of earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals if treated substrate and plants are disposed of in the environment. The risk to fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae was assessed as low. A study with higher aquatic plants is needed since flurprimidol is a plant growth regulator. However, the study is not required to finalise the EU risk assessment for the representative use if the use is restricted to high technology glasshouse production systems with irrigation/excess water management systems. Effects of >50% on mortality and reproduction were observed in sensitive groups of non-target arthropods at concentrations below the suggested application rate of 60 g a.s./ha. Arthropods used in glasshouses for biological plant protection purpose are likely to be severely impacted by the use of flurprimidol. The risk to non-target arthropods in the environment surrounding the glasshouse was considered to be low due to negligible exposure. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. No study was submitted to investigate long-term (reproductive) effects on earthworms. Such a study was considered not necessary provided that treated soil and plants are not disposed of in the environment. No risk assessment was conducted for other soil non-target organisms and non-target micro-organisms. However, the risk to soil dwelling organisms is assumed to be low for the use in high technology glasshouse production systems with irrigation/excess water management systems and provided that treated substrate and plants are not disposed of in the environment. The risk to non-target plants in the vicinity of glasshouses was considered to be low. The risk to bees and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Meta-analysis is the analysis of the results of multiple studies, which is typically performed in order to synthesize evidence from many possible sources in a formal probabilistic manner. In a simple sense, the outcome of each study becomes a single observation in the meta-analysis of all available studies. The methodology was developed originally in the social sciences by Smith, Glass, Rosenthal, Hunter, and Schmidt, based on earlier pioneering contributions in statistics by Fisher, Pearson. Yates, and Cochran, but this approach to research synthesis has now been embraced within many scientific disciplines. However, only a handful of articles have been published in plant pathology and related fields utilizing meta-analysis. After reviewing basic concepts and approaches, methods for estimating parameters and interpreting results are shown. The advantages of meta-analysis are presented in terms of prediction and risk analysis, and the high statistical power that can be achieved for detecting significant effects of treatments or significant relationships between variables. Based on power considerations, the fallacy of naive counting of P values in a narrative review is demonstrated. Although there are many advantages to meta-analysis, results can be biased if the analysis is based on a nonrepresentative sample of study outcomes. Therefore, novel approaches for characterizing the upper bound on the bias are discussed, in order to show the robustness of meta-analysis to possible violation of assumptions.

AB  - Fenbutatin oxide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007(4) In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by Belgium, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of fenbutatin oxide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC.
   Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 2008/934/EC)(5) concerning the noninclusion of fenbutatin oxide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant BASF Agro B.V. made a resubmission application for the inclusion of fenbutatin oxide in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR.
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Belgium, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 1 December 2009.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 2 December 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 19 January 2010.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology, residues and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on fenbutatin oxide.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of fenbutatin oxide as an acaricide on apples, orange and tomato, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   For physical chemical properties no critical areas of concern were identified. Data gaps were identified for the relevant impurity and methods of analysis for all matrices except products of animal origin.
   A clear conclusion on whether the toxicological batches cover the proposed specification cannot be drawn as sufficient data are not available. Consequently a data gap and a critical area of concern have been identified. One impurity (SD 31723) was considered relevant. A maximum upper limit of 3 g/kg for this impurity is covered by the toxicological dossier. Nevertheless, further data (i.e. genotoxic potential) are needed in order to support the higher proposed specification value of 20 g/kg. Further data are also needed to draw a clear conclusion on the toxicological properties of this compound as residue and data gap is identified.
   In the residues area the consumer risk assessment for the representative uses cannot be finalised. A compound SD 31723 that is deemed to be of higher toxicity than fenbutatin oxide is insufficiently addressed in terms of toxicity data and data on the residue level in the fruit crops. Moreover, further residue data are necessary for fenbutatin oxide in tomatoes and oranges in order to remove uncertainty in the acute consumer risk assessment.
   The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level, for the representative uses assessed. The potential for groundwater contamination by fenbutatin oxide was assessed as low from these representative uses.
   A data gap was identified to provide information on the ecotoxicological relevance of the impurity SD 31723. A data gap was identified to address the long-term risk to mammals and to insectivorous birds, also taking into account all relevant species/feeding guilds, for the representative field uses evaluated. A high risk to earthworm-eating mammals and to fish-eating birds and mammals was not excluded and a data gap was identified. A high risk was identified to aquatic organisms at FOCUS step 4 providing mitigation measures comparable to no-spray buffer zone of up to 30m. A data gap was identified to further address the risk to aquatic invertebrates, taking into account the GAP and the most sensitive group. Further, a data gap was identified to refine the risk to fish, taking into account the behaviour of the substance in aquatic systems. A potential high first tier risk was indicated for nontarget arthropods and earthworms, but was further addressed by the submitted higher tier studies. The risk was low for the other non-target organisms. (C) European Food Safety Authority, 2010

AB  - Background: Mosquitoes that breed in temporary pools in remote areas that dry up seasonally are especially difficult to control through chemical or biological means. The annual killifish has been suggested as a means of eradicating the aquatic stages of mosquitoes in transient pools because they can maintain permanent populations in such habitats by undergoing suspended animation or diapause during the embryonic stages to survive periodic drought. However, very little is known about the predatory activity of annual killifish and their usefulness in mosquito control.
   Results: The annual killifish, Nothobranchius guentheri, native to Tanzania, was used in this investigation. Food preference was tested under laboratory conditions by feeding juvenile killifish with 2(nd) instar mosquito larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus in the presence of alternative food sources, such as rotifers and chironomid larvae. Semi-field tests were conducted by introduction of hibernating killifish embryos and juvenile fish to artificial ponds in an outdoor open environment that allowed natural oviposition of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Food preference studies show that N. guentheri preferred to prey on mosquito larvae than either chironomid or rotifers. When hibernating killifish embryos were added to ponds simultaneously with the addition of freshwater, the embryos hatched and fed on mosquito larval population resulting in complete elimination of the immature stages. The introduction of juvenile fish to ponds with high density of mosquito larvae resulted in total eradication of the mosquito population due to predation by fish. Complete biocontrol of the mosquito larval population was achieved in the presence of 3 fish per m(2) of pond surface area.
   Conclusions: The annual killifish provides yet another tool that may be employed in the eradication diseases carried by mosquitoes through vector control, particularly in temporary bodies of freshwater. The fish can be conveniently transported in the absence of water in the form of hibernating embryos. Once introduced either as embryos or juveniles in ponds, the annual killifish can effectively reduce the larval population because of its aggressive predatory activity.

AB  - Benzoxazinones (BAs) are natural products that are present in Gramineae and represent part of the plant defence system against pests. In recent years, sprouts of maize, wheat and rye have been used for the production of dietary supplements. We have investigated the potential genotoxic activities of a diverse range of synthetic derivatives of the most abundant natural BA, namely DIBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one), proposed for use as a potential herbicide. We have tested 18 synthetic BAs for potential effects in cultured HeLa cells. We found significantly higher micronucleus (MN) induction over the background level, with the solvent DMSO used as an internal control. Concentration-dependent effects were found between I nM and 20 nM for all the synthetic compounds Studied. Immunostaining with an anticentromere antibody showed that >80% of MN induced gave a centromere-positive signal. Similarly, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with alphoid centromere probes showed a positive hybridization signal, indicating that all compounds analyzed are aneugenic. Chemical modification of the N in the heterocyclic aromatic amine served us to suggest a relationship between the structure and the aneugenic effects of the compounds analyzed. Our findings indicate that benzoxazinoids could be potential genotoxins for human cells. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Synthetic musks are ubiquitous contaminants in the environment. Compartmental distributions (dissolved, suspended particle associated and sedimentary) of the compounds throughout an axial estuarine transect and in coastal waters are reported. High concentrations of Galaxolide (R) (HHCB) and Tonalide (R) (AHTN) (987-2098 ng/L and 55-159 ng/L, respectively) were encountered in final effluent samples from sewage treatment plants (STPs) discharging into the Tamar and Plym Estuaries (UK), with lower concentrations of Celestolide (R) (ADBI) (4-13 ng/L), Phantolide (R) (AHMI) (6-9 ng/L), musk xylene (MX) (4-7 ng/L) and musk ketone (MK) (18-30 ng/L). Rapid dilution from the outfalls is demonstrated with resulting concentrations of HHCB spanning from 5 to 30 ng/L and those for AHTN from 3 to 15 ng/L The other musks were generally not detected in the estuarine and coastal waters. The suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sedimentary profiles and compositions (HHCB:AHTN ratios) generally reflect the distribution in the water column with highest concentrations adjacent to sewage outfalls.

AB  - Chlormequat is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on chlormequat in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 27 April 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant task force, comprising BASF AG, CIBA Speciality Chemicals, NUFARM GmbH & Co KG and Taminco SA. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as plant growth regulator in cereals for stem stabilisation as proposed by the applicants. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached endpoints.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Chlormequat-chloride 750 g/L', a soluble concentrate (SL) containing 750 g/l chlormequat chloride.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Adequate analytical methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant origin, soil and air.
   There are no adequate methods available to monitor chlormequat in animal products and in water.
   With regard to the evaluation of the toxicological properties, the studies were performed with chlormequat chloride. The active substance was extensively absorbed, barely metabolised and rapidly excreted mainly by urine. The acute toxicity results with rats (after oral administration) and rabbits (after dermal administration) triggered the classification Xn, R21/22 "Harmful in contact with skin and if swallowed". In repeated dose studies, the dog appeared to be the most sensitive species, showing neuropharmacological effects, with an overall NOAEL of 4 mg/kg bw/day in the 1-year study. In mutagenicity and long-term tests, chlormequat chloride was not shown to have any genotoxic or carcinogenic properties. During the reproductive toxicity testing, fertility was affected at a maternal toxic dose level, leading to an overall parental NOAEL of 75 mg/kg bw/day and a reproductive NOAEL of 74 mg/kg bw/day. However, based on reduced body weight gain and focal muscular dystrophy, the offspring NOAEL was 41 mg/kg bw/day. No variations, retardations or malformations were observed in the developmental studies with rats and rabbits, and the maternal NOAEL was 75 mg/kg bw/day in rats and 20 mg/kg bw/day in rabbits. In mechanistic studies in vitro for neurotoxicity, chlormequat chloride showed a weak agonistic activity on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors.
   With regard to the toxicological reference values, the agreed values reported as chlormequat chloride were 0.04 mg/kg bw/day for the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), 0.04 mg/kg bw/day for the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) and 0.09 mg/kg bw for the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD). The dermal absorption values were 4% for the concentrate and the dilution, based on an in vivo test. The operator exposure estimates were below the AOEL according to the German model with the use of personal protective equipment, but above the AOEL according to the UK POEM even with the use of personal protective equipment. The different exposure estimates for the worker and the bystander led to values below the AOEL.
   With regard to residues, the metabolism of chlormequat chloride was investigated in wheat. The major component in grain and straw at harvest was unmetabolised chlormequat. Rotational crops data show that significant residues in succeeding and rotational crops are not expected to occur except in rotated cereals. However residues should not be higher than in cereals directly treated with chlormequat chloride according to the notified GAP. Currently, according to the conclusion of the expert meeting, only the use of chlormequat chloride on rye and triticale in Northern Europe would be supported by a sufficient number of residue trials to allow at least a provisional proposal of maximum residue levels (MRL) whereas uses have also been notified for wheat, barley and oats and also for use in Southern Europe. It is noted that the rapporteur Member State does not agree with this conclusion. Data gaps for further residue trials for all notified uses have been identified. On the basis of processing studies, processing factors have been calculated. After evaluation of animal metabolism studies and animal transfer studies with ruminants and poultry, MRLs for animal products have been provisionally proposed pending the submission of residue trials on primary crops and the demonstration of the validity of the analytical method used in feeding studies.
   If the use of chlormequat chloride on only rye and triticale is considered in a provisional calculation, then the consumer exposure is expected to be below the toxicological reference values. However it is noted that the risk assessment does not cover the intake of barley, oats and wheat and therefore it is only indicative and the final assessment is pending submission of additional data.
   With regard to the environmental fate and behaviour data, no significant metabolites were identified in laboratory aerobic route and rate of degradation studies using [chloroethyl-U-C-14] labelled chlormequat chloride. However a minor unidentified non-transient metabolite was found above 5% at two consecutive occasions. The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 19-28% of the applied radioactivity (AR) after 112 days, while significant mineralisation was observed (28.3-61.1% after 112 days). Chlormequat chloride exhibited moderate persistency in soil, first-order DT50 values were in the range from 27 to 34 days. The peer review concluded that no reliable data were available regarding the mobility of chlormequat chloride.
   In dark natural water sediment systems chlormequat chloride degraded exhibiting low persistence without forming major metabolites. Peak partitioning of chlormequat chloride to the sediment was measured 30 days after dosing at a maximum of 63.3% AR. Mineralisation was significant and by the termination of the study (CO2)-C-14 represented 55.6-67.0% AR.
   Based on the calculated photochemical oxidative degradation, air is not a likely route of environmental contamination by chlormequat chloride.
   No reliable FOCUS calculations regarding the predicted environmental concentrations in surface water and sediment as well as for the leaching potential were available.
   A potential high risk was indicated in the first-tier risk assessment for birds and mammals except for the long-term risk to insectivorous mammals. The refined risk assessment based on measured residues in plants resulted in TERs above the trigger for herbivorous birds. However the long-term risk assessment to insectivorous birds needs further refinement. The acute risk to insectivorous mammals and small herbivorous mammals and the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals were not sufficiently addressed and need further refinement. The log Pow of chlormequat chloride was less than 3 and therefore no risk assessment is triggered for secondary poisoning of fish-and earthworm-eating birds and mammals. No major metabolites were found in plants and hence no risk assessment for the uptake of plant metabolites was conducted. Daphnia magna was the most sensitive aquatic species tested. The FOCUS step 1 calculations resulted in TERs above the trigger of 100 and 10 for fish, algae and higher aquatic plants but not for daphnids. The TERs for daphnids exceeded the Annex VI trigger values by a factor of 3.5 (acute) and 2.6 (chronic) with FOCUS step 2 PECSW values. However there is some uncertainty with regard to the reliability of the PECSW water values since the adsorption/desorption study was conducted at too low temperatures. If the new PECSW values would be increased by more than 2.6 times then further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment would be needed (e.g. FOCUS step 3 or step 4 calculations). A final conclusion on the risk to aquatic organisms can be drawn once reliable PECSW values are available.
   The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, non-target macro-and micro-organisms, nontarget plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for all representative uses.

AB  - Fenpyroximate is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenpyroximate in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 25 October 2005. The peer review was initiated on 5 May 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Nihon Nohyaku Co. Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed on during a written procedure in April May 2007. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October and December 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was initially finalised on 14 April 2008 (scientific report no. 143 refers) however, following an update to the Residues chapter, the conclusion is revised and re-issued in October 2008.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an acaricide on grapes, apples, pears and beans. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Kiron", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC).
   Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. The method of analysis for products of animal origin is only validated for fenpyroximate but the residue definition includes metabolite M-3(2) and therefore a data gap has been identified. Also the residue definition for surface water has not been finalised. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The technical specification could not be concluded on.
   Regarding the mammalian metabolism, fenpyroximate showed a rapid but incomplete oral absorption and excretion, mainly via faeces; intensive enterohepatic circulation was observed. Fenpyroximate is harmful if swallowed and very toxic by inhalation; eye irritation and skin sensitisation were observed. Based on toxicokinetic properties and different toxicological profile of the substance via oral or inhalation, the meeting of experts concluded that the oral absorption was not representative of the bioavailability of fenpyroximate.
   Critical effects observed through short term and long term studies were decreased body weight and food consumption. The relevant oral short term NOAEL is 1.3 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day, rat study and the relevant inhalation NOAEL is 0.54 mg/kg bw/day from the 4-week study in rats; relevant long-term NOAEL was the dose level of 0.97 mg/kg bw/day. No genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed; neither reproductive nor developmental parameters were affected by treatment with fenpyroximate.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set at 0.01 mg/kg bw/day; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.02 mg/kg bw considering an assessment factor of 100 for all reference values.
   Dermal absorption is 7% when handling the concentrate formulation and 24% when handling the spray dilution. Considering the representative uses of Kiron (pome fruits, grapes and beans), the estimated operator exposure exceeds the AOEL according to the UK POEM model; according to the German model calculations, exposure exceeds the AOEL for high crop, tractor mounted air blast sprayers (pome fruits and grapes); exposure resulting from high crop, hand held applications (grapes) and field crop, tractor mounted hydraulic sprayers (beans) is below the AOEL when the use of PPE as protective gloves during mixing/loading and gloves, protective garment and sturdy footwear during application is considered. Re-entry worker exposure is estimated to be below the AOEL only if additional protective clothing, as gloves, long sleeved shirt and long trousers is considered. Bystander's exposure exceeds the AOEL for high crop applications, either tractor mounted or hand held; however for field crop applications (beans), bystander's exposure is estimated to be below the AOEL.
   The plant metabolism of fenpyroximate is very slow. Only one metabolite, the (Z)-isomer of the active substance (M-1) (3) is included in the residue definition for risk assessment. Further information is required to ensure that the toxicological reference values allocated to fenpyroximate cover its (Z) isomer. Some insufficiencies were identified in the submitted residue trials and further data are required. These deficiencies do not allow proposing an MRL in pome fruits. Studies are also required to investigate the stability of residues under hydrolysis conditions simulating processing. Transfer of soil residues to succeeding crops cannot be excluded for the use evaluated on beans harvested fresh.
   Based on animal metabolism and feeding studies, one animal metabolite is expected to reach quantifiable residue levels in ruminant liver and kidney.
   A provisional consumer exposure assessment has shown potential for children exposure in the range of the ARfD for apples, pears and grapes. This may however be reconsidered on the basis of more appropriate residue data for pome fruits. For grapes an option for decision makers is to consider to set the MRL at 0.2mg/kg instead of 0.3mg/kg.
   In soil under aerobic conditions fenpyroximate exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolite M-3 (accounting for up to 10.8% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits moderate to medium persistence and the minor non transient metabolite M-11(4) (accounting for up to 8.8%AR). Mineralisation of both the pyrazole and benzyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 17% AR and 51-65% AR respectively after 112 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 23.5-58.3 % AR and 21-41%AR respectively after 100-112 days. Fenpyroximate is immobile in soil, M-3 exhibits medium to low mobility in soil whilst M-11 is estimated by quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) calculations to exhibit medium mobility. There was no indication that adsorption of any of these compound was pH dependent.
   In dark natural sediment water systems fenpyroximate degraded exhibiting moderate persistence but partitioned relatively rapidly from water to sediment where the major metabolite M-11 was formed.
   M-3 and M-8(5) were major metabolites in water. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was an insignificant sink for the pyrazole ring radiolabel in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 1.9 % AR at 105 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a more significant sink representing up to 28 % AR at study end. As no experiment is available where the benzyl ring was investigated a data gap is identified for further information on the fate and behaviour of the benzyl moiety in natural sediment water systems. In laboratory aqueous photolysis studies the Z isomer of fenpyroximate (M1) was a major metabolite. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for fenpyroximate at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolites M-3, M-11 and M-8 appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by fenpyroximate and its soil metabolites M-3 and M-11 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   The acute and short term risk to birds can be considered as low for all representative uses evaluated. The blue tit is accepted as a focal species to refine the risk to insectivorous birds in pome fruit and vines. The tier 1 long-term risk assessment to birds did not identify low risk for any of the uses. Both PD and PT were refined in the risk assessment for orchard use and the PD was refined in the vine scenario. However, the TER did not reach the Annex VI trigger and a data gap is identified to refine the risk assessment for insectivorous birds in both orchards and vines. The yellowhammer and the grey partridge are accepted as focal species to refine the assessment of the risk to insectivorous and herbivorous birds respectively in beans. An acceptable risk was identified with refinements of PD in both scenarios.
   Based on the first tier risk assessment the acute risk to herbivorous mammals can be considered as low for all representative uses evaluated.. A refined long term risk assessment was needed for all representative uses. In a refined risk assessment the hare is used as focal species in beans and the bank vole is used for the representative uses in pome fruit and grapevine. The risk to mammals in beans can be considered low based on the hare, unattractiveness of crop, and an interception factor of 0.7. The risk to bank vole is considered low for uses in orchards and vine yard, based on a refined PD. The risk from secondary earthworm and fish poisoning is considered low for both birds and mammals Furthermore the risk to birds and mammals from ingestion of contaminated drinking water is considered low.
   Fenpyroximate is very toxic to aquatic organisms both on an acute as on a chronic time scale. A similar toxicity to fish, algae and aquatic invertebrates was observed. The higher tier toxicity test with fish in the present of sediment was accepted as the relevant endpoint in the aquatic risk assessment.
   Based on the available data the risk to aquatic organisms is considered low in all FOCUSsw Step 4 scenarios for all uses if sufficient non spray buffer zones are included. Buffer zones of 70 m, 45 m and 20 m are required for pome fruit, vine and bean respectively. The conclusion of the aquatic risk assessment may however change, as a data gap was identified for a fish full life cycle study. The risk from M-3 and M-8 to aquatic organisms is considered low. A BCF of 1601 was experimentally derived for whole fish. The risk to bees is considered low. A data gap is identified for a study to address the in-field risk to A. rhopalosiphi. The in-field risk to T pyri is considered to be low, as the off-field risk is considered to be low for all non-target arthropods if buffer zones up to 5 meter are applied. The risk to earthworms is considered to be low both for the parent and the metabolites M-3 and M-11. Also the risk to non-target marcro-organisms, non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants is considered low.

AB  - Flurprimidol is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on flurprimidol in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 April 2007. The peer review was initiated on 17 September 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant SePRO Europe Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March April 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a plant growth regulator in ornamentals as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Topflor", a micro-emulsion (ME) containing 3.8 g/1 flurprimidol.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. There are no adequate methods available to monitor flurprimidol in the environmental matrices and in body fluids and tissues. There is no agreed specification.
   A critical area of concern was raised by the experts in mammalian toxicology on the lack of information on impurities present in the batches used in the toxicological studies. In mammalian metabolism studies, flurprimidol was rapidly but not completely absorbed after oral administration; it was extensively metabolised and distributed through the body; excretion was rapid, mainly via urine although some excretion was observed via bile and faeces. Moderate acute oral toxicity was found in rat and mouse, requiring classification with Xn, R22 "harmful if swallowed", but no classification was needed related to acute dermal or inhalation toxicity. Flurprimidol was not a skin or eye irritant and no sensitisation potential was found. Main effects observed in short term and long term toxicity studies were liver toxicity including enzyme induction and histopathological findings, and uterine and ovary weight changes down to the lowest dose tested, indicative of endocrine disruption effects at low doses. Genotoxicity studies covering all required endpoints (in vitro bacterial and mammalian gene mutation, chromosomal aberration and in vivo micronucleus test) were negative and no carcinogenic potential was observed in either rats or mice upon 2-year oral exposure.
   Flurprimidol was thought to inhibit aromatase activity because the observed effects were similar to those observed with structurally related active substance fenarimol. However, no mechanistic study was performed with flurprimidol and sensitive endpoints for aromatase inhibition were not measured in studies conducted with flurprimidol. Reproductive toxicity was indicated by increased precoital period, dystocia, progeny mortality, reduced mating performance and fertility which were not considered secondary to parental systemic toxicity; accordingly, classification as toxic, reproduction toxicity category 2 for fertility, R60 "may impair fertility", was proposed. In the rat developmental toxicity study, the proportion of foetuses with developmental variations and abnormalities was increased and could not be explained by maternal toxicity alone; accordingly classification as harmful, reproduction toxicity category 3 for development, R63 "possible risk of harm to the unborn child" was proposed. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure (AOEL) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.09 mg/kg bw. Dermal absorption was 10 % for the concentrate formulation (default value, taking into account that measurements were available in an in vivo monkey study with the active substance) and 100 % for the in-use spray dilution (default value for no data). The level of operator exposure calculated for glasshouses' uses on ornamentals with the representative formulation Topflor exceeded the AOEL, even when the use of protective clothing was considered, according to the EUROPOEM II and the Dutch model. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with flurprimidol exceeded also the AOEL, even after only one application and when the use of gloves was considered. Bystander's exposure was not relevant for this type of use.
   No data was submitted to study and assess the residue behaviour of flurprimidol in plants and livestock animals in order to define the relevant residues for dietary consumer risk assessment. The representative uses of flurprimidol in containerized ornamentals, pot and bedding plants are normally not expected to result in any dietary exposure to consumers or livestock animals Potted herbs or any other edible container plants are not meant to be included in these notified uses. A potential transfer of residues from recycled soil and/or compost to crops intended for human or animal consumption should be avoided, possibly by appropriate restriction measures. Under conditions excluding any potential consumer exposure to flurprimidol residues through food, there will be no dietary consumer risk related to the notified representative uses.
   All fate and behaviour into the environment studies available have been performed with flurprimidol labelled exclusively at the phenyl ring and / or at the carbinol bridge. The meeting of experts identified a data gap for a full fate and behaviour data package of studies performed with flurprimidol labelled at the pyrimidine ring. The data available for fate and behaviour of flurprimidol into the environment is very limited. Data on the route of degradation in soil is insufficient to assess any use for which exposure could not be completely excluded. The data available shows that flurprimidol is medium to high persistent in soil (DT50 = 98 183 d) under laboratory aerobic conditions (no field study available) and that it is not hydrolysed in buffered water in the range of environmental pHs. Photolysis of flurprimidol in water was relatively rapid (DT50 = 1.4 d) and results in the formation of two photolysis metabolites that would need to be further assessed for aquatic environment in case exposure could not be completely excluded from the use proposed. No water sediment study is available in the dossier. Potential ground water contamination was precluded from the representative use proposed if it is restricted as proposed by the meeting of experts. In general a number of data gaps for fate and behaviour into the environment were identified during the peer review; however, they were considered not to be essential for the assessment of the representative use if this is restricted / managed in order to avoid exposure to the environment, including the potential exposure arising from disposal of soil used and residues of plants.
   The environmental risk assessment covers only the use in greenhouses that are permanent structures. No risk assessment was conducted for birds and mammals. Direct exposure of birds and mammals is expected to be negligible for the representative use in greenhouse. The log P-ow of flurprimidol is >3 and therefore a risk assessment should be conducted for secondary poisoning of earthworm and fish eating birds and mammals if treated substrate and plants are disposed of in the environment. The risk to fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae was assessed as low. A study with higher aquatic plants is needed since flurprimidol is a plant growth regulator. However the study is not required to finalise the EU risk assessment for the proposed use if the use is restricted to high technology greenhouse production systems with irrigation/excess water management systems. Effects of >50% on mortality and reproduction were observed in sensitive groups of non-target arthropods at concentrations below the suggested application rate of 60 g a.s./ha. Arthropods used in glasshouses for biological plant protection purpose are likely to be severely impacted by the use of flurprimidol. The risk to non-target arthropods in the environment surrounding the greenhouse was considered to be low due to negligible exposure. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. No study was submitted to investigate long-term (reproductive) effects on earthworms. Such a study was considered not necessary provided that treated soil and plants are not disposed of in the environment. No risk assessment was conducted for other soil non-target organisms and non-target micro-organisms. However the risk to soil dwelling organisms is assumed to be low for the use in high technology greenhouse production systems with irrigation/excess water management systems and provided that treated substrate and plants are not disposed of in the environment.
   The risk to non-target plants in the vicinity of greenhouses was considered to be low. The risk to bees and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Blood and epidermal biopsies from free-ranging Tursiops truncatus captured and released during either summer or winter health assessments in Sarasota Bay, FL, were evaluated for concentrations of mercury, selenium, stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15), and blood glutathione peroxidase activity in conjunction with routine hematology and serum chemistry panels. Major objectives were to: 1) quantify and describe relationships among mercury, selenium, glutathione peroxidase, and stable isotopes of C and N in blood and epidermis; 2) elucidate major parameters that influence blood mercury and glutathione peroxidase activity; 3) relate measures of tissue mercury, selenium, and glutathione peroxidase to specific ecological, hematological, morphological, or life history parameters, including season, sex, age, and trophic level. Mercury in both tissues examined is almost exclusively methylmercury. Epidermal concentrations of mercury and selenium reflect their respective amounts in blood, albeit at several times blood concentrations of mercury. The strong association between blood mercury and serum selenium, in conjunction with a lack of significant correlation between blood mercury and glutathione peroxidase, implies that a substantial proportion of blood mercury is affiliated with another selenium-containing moiety or is related to recent dietary intakes (e.g., trophic level, intensive fish consumption). Circulating blood mercury may be described in terms of serum selenium concentration, along with interaction terms among serum selenium, blood delta N-15, and age. Current selenium concentrations in Sarasota Bay dolphins appear adequate for maintenance of blood glutathione peroxidase activity. However, dolphins evidently are subject to seasonal exacerbation of oxidative stress, which might render them more vulnerable to toxic effects of mercury.

AB  - Background: The whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), and the viruses it transmits, are a major constraint to growing vegetable crops worldwide. Although the whitefly is often controlled using chemical pesticides, biological control agents constitute an important component in integrated pest management programs, especially in protected agriculture. One of these agents is the wasp Eretmocerus mundus (Mercet) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae). E. mundus lays its egg on the leaf underneath the second-third instar nymph of B. tabaci. First instars of the wasp hatch and penetrate the whitefly nymphs. Initiation of parasitization induces the host to form a capsule composed of epidermal cells around the parasitoid. The physiological and molecular processes underlying B. tabaci-E. mundus interactions have never been investigated.
   Results: We used a cDNA microarray containing 6,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the whitefly genome to study the parasitoid-whitefly interaction. We compared RNA samples collected at two time points of the parasitization process: when the parasitoid first instar starts the penetration process and once it has fully penetrated the host. The results clearly indicated that genes known to be part of the defense pathways described in other insects are also involved in the response of B. tabaci to parasitization by E. mundus. Some of these responses included repression of a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) and induction of a melanization cascade. A second set of genes that responded strongly to parasitization were bacterial, encoded by whitefly symbionts. Quantitative real-time PCR and FISH analyses showed that proliferation of Rickettsia, a facultative secondary symbiont, is strongly induced upon initiation of the parasitization process, a result that supported previous reports suggesting that endosymbionts might be involved in the insect host's resistance to various environmental stresses.
   Conclusion: This is the first study to examine the transcriptional response of a hemipteran insect to attack by a biological control agent (hymenopterous parasitoid), using a new genomic approach developed for this insect pest. The defense response in B. tabaci involves genes related to the immune response as described in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster. Moreover, endosymbionts of B. tabaci appear to play a role in the response to parasitization, as supported by previously published results from aphids.

AB  - Male genital tract birth defects have been associated in previous studies with several prenatal exposures to environmental and dietary risk factors. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between hypospadias and cryptorchidism, and the dietary habits of an agricultural population in Italy. A population-based case-control study was conducted in the Sicilian Province of Ragusa. Cases (n = 90) and controls (n = 202) included births for the period 1998-2002. Data on dietary habits of the mothers, as well as health-related social, occupational and environmental exposures prior to and during the index birth, were collected through interviews. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated by logistic regression after adjustment for confounding variables.
   Increased ORs were observed for mothers of children with hypospadias who, during pregnancy, frequently consumed fish (OR = 2.33 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 5.31]) and market-purchased fruit (OR = 5.10 [95% CI 1.31, 19.82]). For cryptorchidism, increased risk was observed in mothers consuming liver (OR = 5.21 [95% CI 1.26, 21.50]), and smoked products (OR = 2.46 [95% CI 1.15, 5.29]). For the two malformations pooled together, increased risk was associated with maternal consumption of liver (OR = 4.38 [95% CI 1.34, 14.26]) and with frequent consumption of wine (OR = 1.98 [95% CI 1.01, 3.86]). This study suggests that some maternal dietary factors may play a role in the development of congenital defects of the male reproductive tract. In particular, our data indicate that further research may be warranted on the endocrine-disrupting effects resulting from the bioaccumulation of contaminants (fish, liver), pesticides (marketed fruit, wine) and/or potentially toxic food components (smoked products, wine, liver).

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) were widely used for industrial purposes and consumer products, but because of their toxicity, production was banned by most industrialised countries in the late 1970s. In eastern Slovakia, they were produced until 1985. During 2002-04, a birth cohort of mothers (n = 1057) residing in two Slovak districts was enrolled at delivery, and their specimens and information were collected after birth. Congeners of PCBs were measured in maternal serum by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection. In this study, we used multiple linear regression to examine the effects of prenatal PCB exposure on birthweight adjusted for gestational age, controlling for inter-pregnancy interval, and maternal smoking, age, education, ethnicity, pre-pregnancy body mass index and height.
   The association between total maternal serum PCB levels and birthweight was not statistically significant. However, an interaction model indicated that maternal PCB concentrations were associated with lower birthweight in Romani boys. Based on the fitted regression model, the predicted birthweight of Romani boys at the 90th percentile of maternal PCBs (12.8 ng/mL) was 133 g lower than the predicted birthweight at the 10th percentile of maternal PCBs (1.6 ng/mL). This is a similar magnitude of effect to that observed for maternal smoking and birthweight. These results suggest that higher levels of PCBs in maternal blood sera may inhibit growth in boys, particularly in those already affected by social factors related to ethnicity. This study is consistent with previous findings that boys are more susceptible than girls to growth restriction induced by in utero organochlorine exposures, and further indicates that high PCBs may magnify the influence of social disadvantage in this vulnerable group of boys.

AB  - Coal, Scope and Background. Freshwater bodies which chemistry is dominated by dissolved humic substances (HS) seem to be the major type on Earth, due to huge non-calcareous geological formations in the Northern Hemisphere and in the tropics. Based on the paradigm of the inertness of being organic, direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms are mostly neglected. However, dissolved organic carbon, the majority of which being HS, are natural environmental chemicals and should therefore directly interact with organisms. Major results that widened our perspective on humic substance ecology come from experiments with the compost nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, which behaved contradictorily to textbook knowledge and provoked an in-depth re-consideration of some paradigms.
   Approach. To overcome old paradigms on HS and their potential interactions with organisms, we reviewed recent international literature, as well as 'grey' literature. We also include results from own ongoing studies.
   Results. This review focuses on direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms and disregards indirect effects, such as under-water light quenching. Instead we show with some macrophyte and algal species that HS adversely interfere with photosynthesis and growth, whereby closely related algal species show different response patterns. In addition to this, HS suppress cyanobacteria more than eukaryotic algae. Quinones in the HS appear to be the effective structure.
   Furthermore, HS can modulate the offspring numbers in the nematode C. elegans and cause feminization of fish and amphibians - they possess hormone-like properties. The ecological consequences of this potential remain obscure at present.
   HS also have the potential to act as chemical attractants as shown with C. elegans and exert a mild chemical stress upon aquatic organisms in many ways: induction of molecular chaperons (stress proteins), induction and modulation of biotransformation and anti-oxidant enzymes. Furthermore, they produce an oxidative stress with lipidperoxidation as one clear symptom or even stress defense strategy. Stronger chemical stresses by HS may even lead to teratogenic effects as shown with fish embryos; all physiological responses to HS-mediated stress require energy, which were compensated on the expense of yolk as shown with zebra fish embryos. One Finnish field survey supports the view of a strong chemical stress, as the weight yield in fish species decreases with increasing HS content in the lakes.
   Discussion. HS exert a variety of stress symptoms in aquatic and compost organisms. According to current paradigms of ecotoxicology, these symptoms have to be considered adverse, because their compensation consumes energy which is deducted from the main metabolism. However, the nematode C. elegans looks actively for such stressful environments, and this behavior is only understandable in the light of new paradigms of aging mechanisms, particularly the Green Theory of Aging. In this respect, we discuss the mild HS-mediated stress to aquatic and compost organisms. New empirical findings with HS themselves and HS building blocks appear to be consistent with this emerging paradigm and show that the individual lifespan may be expanded. At present the ecological consequences of these findings remain obscure. However, a multiple-stress resistance may be acquired which improves the individual fitness in a fluctuating environment.
   Conclusions. It appears that dissolved HS have to be considered abiotic ecological driving forces, somewhat less obvious than temperature, nutrients, or light.
   Perspectives. The understanding of the ecological control by dissolved humic substances is still fragmentary and needs to be studied in more details.

AB  - Goals, Scope and Background. Changing environmental conditions and handling stress are well known to cause chronic or acute stress situations in fish with subsequent infections. These requires a therapy by means of antibiotics and chemicals. In contrast to the huge number of pathogens, only a few substances are permitted for application as therapeutics in German aquaculture. Hence, there emerges an urgent need for highly effective and residueless alternatives.
   Main Features. The prophylactic stimulation and training of the defense system of fish by alternative approaches becomes increasingly necessary. One approach is the application of dissolved humic substances (HS) of natural or artificial origin. For example, there exist several reports on the positive effect of HS to fishes. These effects shall be considered in detail. Furthermore, the impact of HS on the constitution of parasites and pathogens will be displayed. The reports on this issue are diverse, if not inconsistent. We try to shed some light on these discrepancies. The last aspect covered by this review is the outdated paradigm that calcium ions act as antidotes. In the presence of HS, even the opposite effect may occur.
   Approach. To overcome old paradigms on HS and their potential interactions with fish and fish parasites, we reviewed recent international literature, as well as 'grey' literature. We also include results from own former and ongoing studies.
   Results and Discussion. HS are able to increase the physiological condition of the individuals and to reduce adverse physiological and histological consequences caused by stress; the mechanism behind remains obscure. HS detoxify heavy metals and organic pollutants. Damages caused by several fish pathogens, such as bacteria and parasites, can be repaired more quickly in the presence of HS. Some parasites - mainly fungi - appear to be directly affected by HS. Comparing the fungicidal effects of HS from various sources, evidence is increasing that the aliphatic moiety may be the effective structures. However, further research is necessary to relate more physiological and anti-pathogenic effects to the chemical characteristics of HS.
   Conclusions. HS are not real alternatives to strong traditional therapeutics. However, they show different advantages in repairing secondary, stress induced damages in fish. The ecophysiological relevance of HS in either aquatic systems or aquaculture is getting conspicuously.
   Perspectives. The lack of therapeutic and antiparasitic substances in aquaculture requires new strategies and ways of thinking. The search for alternatives to the 'traditional' chemical therapeutics calls for the intensive research. Inevitably, this search will lead to an intensive contemplation on HS as 'health promoting substances' and/or even therapeutics. Basic research is needed to detect the functional groups of the HS responsible for the effects observed. Health promoting effects of first investigations made in vitro to affect pathogens via application of HS and several field studies with HS raises hopes for a broader utilisation of HS to reduce stress consequences in fish and fish pathogens residuelessly.

AB  - Antibacterial factors in the epidermal mucus of fish have a potential importance in the first line of the host defense response to bacterial pathogens. We previously isolated a novel antibacterial protein termed SSAP (Sebastes schlegeli antibacterial protein) from the skin mucus of the rockfish S. schlegeli and identified it as a new member of the L-amino acid oxidase (LAO) family. In the present study, the localization of SSAP in S. schlegeli was investigated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, quantitative real time RT-PCR, Western blotting and measurements of LAO and antibacterial activities. SSAP mRNA was expressed dominantly in skin and gill and weakly in ovary or kidney as shown by RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR. The quantity of SSAP mRNA in skin varied among the individuals, ranging from 1.1 to 13.9 ng mu g(-1) total RNA, although no relationship was found between the size of fish and gene expression. SSAP was exclusively detected in skin and gill by Western blotting using a specific anti-SSAP antiserum. In addition, the extracts of both tissues apparently showed LAO activity and antibacterial activity against Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. This study demonstrates that SSAP is predominantly synthesized in skin and gill and probably functions as an antibacterial LAO in both tissues. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this review, recent developments in monitoring toxicological responses in estuarine animals are analyzed, considering the biomarker responses to different classes of pollutants. The estuarine environment imposes stressful conditions to the organisms that inhabit it, and this situation can alter their sensitivity to many pollutants. The specificity of some biornarkers like metallothionein tissue concentration is discussed in virtue of its dependence on salinity, which is highly variable in estuaries. Examples of cholinesterase activity measurements are also provided and criteria to select sensitive enzymes to detect pesticides and toxins are discussed. Regarding non-specific biomarkers, toxic responses in terms of antioxidant defenses and/or oxidative damage are also considered in this review, focusing on invertebrate species. In addition, the presence of an antioxidant gradient along the body of the estuarine polychaete Laeonereis acuta (Nereididae) and its relationship to different strategies, which deal with the generation of oxidative stress, is reviewed. Also, unusual antioxidant defenses against environmental pro-oxidants are discussed, including the mucus secreted by L. acuta. Disruption of osmoregulation by pollutants is of paramount importance in several estuarine species. In some cases such as in the estuarine crab Chasmagnathus granulatus, there is a trade off between bioavailability of toxicants (e.g. metals) and their interaction with key enzymes such as Na+-K+-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase. Thus, the metal effect on osmoregulation is also discussed in the present review. Finally, field case studies with fish species like the croaker Micropogonias furnieri (Scianidae) are used to illustrate the application of DNA damage and immunosuppressive responses as potential biomarkers of complex mixture of pollutants.

AB  - Synthetic musk fragrances have been measured in water, air, sediments, sewage sludge, and biota worldwide. As the study of the environmental fate and impacts of these compounds progresses, the need for Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) for these compounds to facilitate analytical method improvement and interlaboratory comparisons becomes increasingly important. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issues environmental matrix SRMs with certified concentrations for a variety of persistent organic pollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chlorinated pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs). Until now synthetic musk fragrance concentrations have not been reported in NIST SRMs. The objective of this study was to provide reference values for several commonly detected synthetic musk fragrances in several NIST natural matrix SRMs. In this study five polycyclic musk fragrances [HHCB (1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta-gamma-2-benzopyran), AHTN (7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene), ADBI (4-acetyl-1,1-dimethyl-6-tert-butylindane), AHMI (6-acetyl-1,1,2,3,3,5-hexamethylindane), and ATII (5-acetyl-1,1,2,6-tetramethyl-3-isopropylindane] and two nitro musk fragrances [musk xylene (1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethyl-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene) and musk ketone (4-tert-butyl-3,5-dinitro-2,6-dimethylacetophenone)] were measured in selected environmental SRMs. Gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS) was used for all analyses. HHCB was the most frequently detected synthetic musk fragrance and was detected in SRM 2585 Organic Contaminants in House Dust, SRM 2781 Domestic Sludge, SRM 1974b Organics in Mussel Tissue (Mytilus edulis), and SRM 1947 Lake Michigan Fish Tissue. It was not detected in SRM 1946 Lake Superior Fish Tissue or SRM 1945 Organics in Whale Blubber. Concentrations of HHCB in these SRMs ranged from 1.12 ng/g in SRM 1947 to 92,901 ng/g in SRM 2781. All of the polycyclic musk fragrances were detected in SRM 2781 and all of the target compounds were detected in SRM 2585.

AB  - The lethal concentration LC(I) ((50-96h)) and the histopathological effects of the herbicide diquat to the Brazilian fish piaucu (Leporinus macrocephalus) were evaluated in three experiments in laboratorial conditions. The fishes were submitted to concentrations of 0; 12; 18; 24; 30; 36; 42; 48; 54; and 60 mg of diquat/L and the gills and livers histopathology was performed on the surviving fishes. The lethal concentration LC (I) ((50-96h)) was of 34.76 mg/L. In the control treatment, 12 and 18 mg/L, the fishes' gills were covered by a stratified epithelium, which in regular breaks formed the secondary lamellae constituted by two layers of epithelial squamosous cells, pillars cells, chloride cell, and the mucous cell. In the treatments with 24, 30, 36, 42 and 48 mg/L, occurred a hyperplasia of the mucous membranes coating cells, and the chloride cells in the interlamelar space. In the treatment with 54 mg/L a subepithelial edema and apical fusion of the secundary lamellae were verified. The liver of the L. macrocephalus in the control treatment and 12mg/L presented cord-like arrangement of the hepatocytes. In the treatments with 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 e 54 mg/L a congestion inside the sinusoid capillary occurred. In the treatments with 48 e 54 mg/L the presence of glycogen granules inside the cell was observed, the beginning of a necrosis of the hepatopancreas, congestion and cellular fusion. The diquate has revealed itself to be weakly toxic for L. macrocephalus and the histopathological alterations that occurred in the gills and liver of the fishes are reversible.

AB  - 1. This review focuses on direct and indirect interactions between dissolved humic substances (HS) and freshwater organisms and presents novel opinions and hypotheses on their ecological significance. Despite their abundance in freshwaters, the role of HS is still inadequately understood. These substances have been considered too large to be taken up by freshwater organisms. On the contrary, here we present evidence that dissolved HS are indeed taken up and interact directly and/or indirectly with freshwater organisms.
   2. We show that dissolved HS exert a mild chemical stress upon aquatic organisms in many ways; they induce molecular chaperones (stress shock proteins), induce and modulate biotransformation enzymes and modulate (mainly inhibiting) the photosynthetic release of oxygen by freshwater plants. Furthermore, they produce an oxidative stress, which may lead to membrane oxidation. HS modulate the multixenobiotic resistance activity and probably other membrane-bound pumps. This property may lead to the increased bioaccumulation of xenobiotic chemicals. Furthermore, they can modulate the numbers of offspring in a nematode and feminise fish and amphibians. The ecological consequences of this potential remain obscure at present. HS also have the potential to act as chemical attractants (as shown with a nematode).
   3. In some macrophytes and algae we show that HS interfere with photosynthesis and growth. For instance, the presence of HS suppresses cyanobacteria more than eukaryotic algae. By applying a quantitative structure activity relationship approach, we show that quinones in the HS interfere with photosynthetic electron transport. We show that even Phragmites leachate can act as a kind of phytotoxin. HS also have the potential to suppress fungal growth, as shown with the water mould Saprolegnia parasitica and force the fungus to respond by spore production.
   4. In very soft, humic freshwaters, such as the Rio Negro, Brazil, HS stimulate the uptake of essential ions, such as Na and Ca, at extremely low pH (3.5-4.0) and prevent the ionoregulatory disturbance induced by acid waters, thereby enabling fish to survive in these environments.
   5. We discuss whether or not HS are directly utilised by aquatic microorganisms or via exoenzymes, which may be washed in from the terrestrial catchment. There is accumulating evidence that the quality of the HS controls microbial growth. In total, net-heterotrophy may result from HS-mediated suppression of primary production by the quinone structures and/or from HS-mediated support of microbial growth. As there is also evidence that HS have the potential to support photoautotrophic growth and suppress microbial growth, the opposite community effect could result. Consequently, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has to be chemically characterised, rather than simply measuring bulk DOC concentration.
   6. In sum, dissolved HS interact with freshwater organisms in a variety of ways in unenriched humic lakes. In addition to the well known effects of HS on light regime, for example, and the direct and indirect supply with carbon (energy), other interactions may be much more subtle. For instance, HS may induce internal biochemical stress defence systems and have the potential to cause acclimatisation and even adaptation. We are just at the beginning of understanding these interactions between dissolved HS and freshwater organisms.

AB  - The natural and anthropogenic, both continental and marine pressure, due to the geographical position and anthropogenic impact, like hydrotechnical works (road, railway, building works and consolidation, freshening) industrial pollution (chemical agents, detergents, pesticides), waste water products and deposits; agricultural (crops fertilising, private vegetable gardens, zootechnique activities), tourism, (recreation, sailing, nautical sports, seasonal bathing areas), use of therapeutical sludge, overexploitation of natural resources (mainly fish production) have had a big influence on the present ecological statement of the inland water at the Romanian Black sea coast. Adding to these causes, the wrong applying or the lack of environment legislation control it is easy to explain the human impact consequences in the area of coastal inland waters. Samples of water and sediments have been collected from natural lakes net belonging to the Danube delta, central and southern coastal zone (Tasaul, Corbu, Siutghiol, Tabacarie, Agigea, Techirghiol, Costinesti, Tatlageac, Limanu, Mangalia), a swamp Herghelia, and a lagoon Sinoe. The stations were settled on important anthropogenic impact points or on connection places between border areas of interest, as well as between important areas from the point of view of the system, sources, objectives, breaks through important points. The results obtained in Tasaul, Siutghiol, Techirghiol lakes and Sinoe lagoon can be compared with the former years hydrochemical and hydrobiological analyses. The other inland waters have been assessed after more than 15 years of research gaps. Results obtained assessing the ecological statement of coastal inland waters, realised under the NIMRD 'G. Antipa' Constantza and NIMR 'Danube Delta' Tulcea coordination, stress the necessity to take urgent measures of rehabilitation for water) quality and natural resources of coastal inland areas with a huge social and economical importance. Solutions proposed for ecological recovery, according to the European legislation concerning the environment protection, conservation and use, have as the target sustainable development in the coastal zone and human health maintaining improvement.

AB  - A lobster die-off reduced the 1999 fall landings in western Long Island Sound by up to more then 99%. The die-off corresponded in time with the application, of pesticides for the control of mosquitoes that carried West Nile virus, a new emerging. disease in North America at the time. In order to determine the possible implication of pesticide application as a direct cause or contributing factor in the die-off, we studied the effects of experimental exposure to malathion on the health of lobsters. Lobsters were exposed in 20 gallon tanks, and the direct toxicity as well as sub-lethal effects on the immune system were determined. The 96 h LC50 for malathion upon single exposure was 38 mug/l. Malathion degraded rapidly in sea water, with 65-77% lost after I day and 83-96% lost after 3 days. Phagocytosis was significantly decreased 3 days after a single exposure to initial water concentrations as low as 5 ppb, when measured water concentrations were as low as 0.55 ppb. Similarly, effects on phagocytosis were observed at 1, 2 and 3 weeks after the initiation of weekly exposures. Cell counts did not differ significantly upon exposure to malathion. Malathion was not detected in muscle and hepatopancreas of exposed lobsters. Evaluation of phagocytosis is-a sensitive indicator of subtle sub-lethal effects of malathion, and relatively small concentrations of malathion (6-7 times lower than the LC50) can affect lobster defense mechanisms.

AB  - Like hardly any other issue in ecotoxicology, endocrine disruption has given rise to public concern. Reproductive, behavioral, and immunological effects in wildlife were publicly not only understood as possible threats to wildlife populations, but also as early warning signals that human health could be at risk. Above all, the public has been concerned about negative outcomes in reproductive health, and effects like feminization in fish were regarded as evidence for the biological plausibility of the hypothesis that environmental levels of hormonally active chemicals are high enough to affect human reproductive health.
   Public concern has been mirrored by several parliamentary and governmental decisions emphasizing the need for extensive research and rapid measures to reduce the risk associated with endocrine-disrupting substances.
   Endocrine disruption in wildlife is clearly a priority issue. At least in densely populated areas like Europe, symptoms of endocrine disruption in wildlife cannot only be detected in areas with abnormally high levels of pollution, but have also occurred in main river systems, estuaries, and even in the open sea. Imposex in mollusks and feminization in fish that were clearly related to disturbances in the hormonal system of these organisms by exogenous substances have been used as markers in monitoring programs. Though symptoms of endocrine disruption can be clearly identified, it is much more difficult to link these outcomes to causative chemicals or mixtures of substances. Natural and pharmaceutical hormones, phytoestrogens, pesticides, and industrial chemicals may all play a role to a different degree depending on the site under study. This means that several different risk-reduction strategies have to be applied, including bans of substances, use restrictions, and installation and optimization of sewage treatment works embedded in a strategy for the overall reduction of chemical input into the environment.
   It should be noted that, in addition to national and international regulatory actions taken by state authorities, a considerable reduction of the environmental input could be achieved in several countries by voluntary actions taken by industry.
   Regulatory bodies are still facing major problems in the field of risk assessment and risk reduction. Association between effects and causative agents or mixtures are in many cases weak. Important tools for risk assessment such as dose-response relationships or the existence of thresholds are not yet agreed on. These uncertainties are the reason that many national governments and the European Commission have identified precaution as the main element in chemicals policy for the management of endocrine disruptors.

AB  - A variety of stresses, hormones, glucocorticoids and cytokines are known to induce metallothioneins (MTs) in animals. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chemical stress induced by the dicarboximide fungicide procymidone on hepatic structure, MT content and antioxidative defences (catalase and glutathione reductase activities and glutathione content) in the common fish Rutilus rutilus. Catalase and glutathione reductase activities remained stable throughout the experiment. Four days of exposure to 0.2 or 0.4 mg l(-1) of procymidone induced an obvious increase in liver MT content, perturbation of metal MT contents, and an increase in hepatic glutathione content. After 14 days' exposure, obvious and large structural alterations of the hepatic parenchyma occurred simultaneously with a decrease in MT and glutathione content. These events were interpreted as degeneration of the liver. Fish exposed for 14 days to procymidone and then placed for 14 days in clean water showed nearly complete decontamination of the liver, but MT concentrations remained high. The toxicological significance of these events is discussed.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of exposure to persistent organochlorine compounds through the consumption of fatty fish from the Baltic Sea on human fertility.
   Methods Information on time to pregnancy, miscarriages, and subfertility was collected retrospectively by self-administered questionnaires in two cohorts of fishermen's sisters from the Swedish east coast, by the Baltic Sea, and the west coast, where fish are less contaminated. Along with cohort affiliation, fish consumption and growing up in a fishing village or fisherman's family were used as measures of exposure within the eastcoast cohort (ie, the exposed cohort).
   Results There was no support for a negative effect of the consumption of fatty Baltic Sea fish on time to pregnancy, miscarriages, or subfertility. On the contrary, some evidence pointed towards a protective effect of fatty fish consumption within both cohorts.
   Conclusions No evidence of reduced fertility was found for women who could be assumed to have a high lifetime consumption of fatty fish contaminated by persistent organochlorine compounds. A possible explanation for this finding is that a positive effect of some of the constituents in fatty fish could be strong enough to disguise the hazardous effects of exposure to persistent organochlorine compounds.

AB  - Toxic strains of Phesteria spp. produce toxin(s) that can cause finfish death, but much less is known about impacts of Phesteria on shellfish. Here we conducted 4 experiments to examine interactions between shellfish and toxic (actively toxic or TOX-A from finfish-killing cultures and potentially toxic or TOX-B from cultures without finfish) and non-inducible (NON-IND, apparently incapable of killing fish via a toxic effect) strains of P. piscicida. First (Expt 1), we documented direct physical attack by P. piscicida TOX-A, TOX-B, and NON-IND zoospores on larvae of the bay scallop Argopecten irradians (Lamarck, 1819) and the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791). Within 5 min zoospores swarmed around larvae that had discarded their vela, and attached with their peduncles. Within 15 min they had penetrated into the shellfish visceral cavity and had begun to feed aggressively; after 30 min all shellfish tissues except the adductor muscle had been consumed. Second, we tested the response of scallop larvae to P. piscicida (TOX-A or TOX-B) or. cryptomonads (as controls) that were held in dialysis tubing (0.22 mum porosity) to prevent direct contact. After 60 min larval survival was 0% in the TOX-A treatment, 100% in the cryptomonad control, and intermediate in TOX-B and TOX-B+ cryptomonad treatments. The data indicate a toxic effect of P. piscicida zoospores on the larvae, separate from the physical effect shown in Expt 1. Third, we compared grazing by juvenile and adult oysters on TOX-A, TOX-B, and NON-IND P. piscicida zoospores from the medium. After 60 min, grazing by juvenile oysters significantly differed as NON-IND TOX-B TOX-A. In contrast, adult oysters grazed significantly fewer TOX-A zoospores and maintained comparable grazing on TOX-B and NON-IND zoospores. Thus juvenile oysters, but not adults, were sensitive to residual toxicity of TOX-B zoospores, and both life-history stages were sensitive to TOX-A zoospores. The adverse effects of toxic strains on larval survival and juvenile grazing indicate that P. piscicida could potentially affect shellfish recruitment. Fourth, we assessed zoospore survival after passage through the digestive tract of adult oysters. The feces contained many temporary cysts from zoospores, and within 24 h > 75 % of the cysts produced motile cells. The data indicate that adult oysters would be poor biocontrol agents of P. piscicida, given the high survival of ingested zoospores following gut passage and fecal elimination; and that oysters could act as vectors of toxic P. piscicida strains if transported from affected estuaries to other waters.

AB  - Certain populations of killer whales (Orcinus orca) have been extensively studied over the past 30 years, including populations that use Puget Sound, WA, the inside waters of British Columbia, Southeastern Alaska and Kenai Fjords/Prince William Sound, Alaska. Two eco-types of killer whales, 'transient' and 'resident', occur in all of these regions. These eco-types are genetically distinct and differ in various aspects of morphology, vocalization patterns, diet and habitat use. Various genetic and photo-identification studies of eastern North Pacific killer whales have provided information on the male-female composition of most of these resident pods and transient groups, as well as the approximate ages, reproductive status and putative recruitment order (birth order) of the individual whales. Biopsy blubber samples of free-ranging resident and transient killer whales from the Kenai Fjords/Prince William Sound,, AK region were acquired during the 1994-1999 field seasons and analyzed for selected organochlorines (OCs), including dioxin-like CB congeners and DDTs. Concentrations of OCs in transient killer whales (marine mammal-eating) were much higher than those found in resident animals (fish-eating) apparently due to differences in diets of these two killer whale eco-types. Certain life-history parameters such as sex, age and reproductive status also influenced the concentrations of OCs in the Alaskan killer whales. Reproductive female whales contained much lower levels of OCs than sexually immature whales or mature male animals in the same age class likely due to transfer of OCs from the female to her offspring during gestation and lactation. Recruitment order also influenced the concentrations of OCs in the Alaskan killer whales. In adult mate residents, first-recruited whales contained much higher OC concentrations than those measured in non-first-recruited (e.g. second recruited. third recruited) resident animals in the same age group. This study provides baseline OC data for free ranging Alaskan killer whales for which there is little contaminant information. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to quickly assess potential environmental hazards of forwardly deployed military bases, we have focussed our efforts on biochemical and molecular changes in vertebrate cells following exposure to aqueous soil extracts. To this end, we are designing a series of deployable transgenic fish. Fish exhibit many of the same general defenses against toxic chemicals as do mammals, including enzyme induction, and the generation of oxidative stress. In response to many foreign compounds that generate oxidative stress, the transcription of certain protective genes is induced via specific DNA motifs called electrophile response elements (EPREs). We have made a plasmid construct containing a single murine EPRE fused to a minimal promoter and the cDNA encoding firefly luciferase (EPRE LUG). In this paper, we have shown that the treatment of zebrafish cell line ZEM2S with a variety of chemicals known to induce EPRE-dependent transcription in cultured mammalian cells, results in dose-dependent induction of the transiently-transfected EPRE-LUC reporter construct. Compounds tested include aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and organophosphates. We observed similar dose-dependent responses when we treated ZEM2S and human cells in vitro with identical aqueous extracts of soil from hazardous waste sites. This suggests that the mechanism by which these compounds activate transcription is well conserved between mammals and zebrafish, and that transgenic zebrafish lines containing EPRE-driven reporter constructs might be useful as sentinels for the early detection of oxidative stress-inducing chemicals.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of persistent organochlorine compounds through the dietary intake of fatty fish from the Baltic Sea on human fertility.
   Methods Information on time to pregnancy, subfertility, and infertility was collected retrospectively by self-administered questionnaires in 2 cohorts of fishermen's wives from the Swedish east (by the Baltic Sea) and west coasts. In addition to cohort affiliation, current fish consumption and growing up in a fishing village were used as proxies for exposure within the eastcoast cohort.
   Results A decreased success (ie, pregnancy) rate and a tendency towards increased subfertility was found for heavy smokers (greater than or equal to 10 cigarettes/day) in the eastcoast cohort as compared with the westcoast cohort [success rate ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.49-0.89; subfertility odds ratio 1.64, 95% CI 0.91-2.91). However, internal analyses within the eastcoast cohort did not show that growing up in a fishing village or high current fish consumption decreased the success rate. Eastcoast cohort affiliation showed an increased risk for infertility (odds ratio 2.49, 95% CI 1.05-5.92).
   Conclusions The present data give some support for a negative association between exposure to persistent organochlorine compounds and fertility among heavy smokers. However, when the proxy exposure measures are also considered, the findings are not consistent. Better individual exposure assessments should be used before more firm conclusions are drawn.

AB  - The taxonomic relationship between heterotrophic and parasitic dinoflagellates has not been studied extensively at the molecular level. In order to investigate these taxonomic relationships, we sequenced the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA gene of Pfiesteria piscicida (Steidinger et Burkholder), a Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellate, Cryptoperidiniop-soid sp,, and Amyloodinium ocelllatum (Brown) and submitted those sequences to GenBank, Pfiesteria piscicida and Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp, are heterotrophic dinoflagellates, purportedly pathogenic to fish, and A, ocellatum, a major fish pathogen, has caused extensive economic losses in both the aquarium and aquaculture industries. The pathogenicity of the Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellate is unknown at this time, but its growth characteristics and in vitro food preferences are similar to those of P, piscicda. The SSU sequences of these species were aligned with the other full-length dinoflagellate sequences, as well as those of representative apicomplexans and Perkinsus species, the groups most closely related to dinoflagellates. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp,, P, piscicida, and the Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellate are closely related and group into the class Blastodiniphyceae, as does A, ocellatum. None of the species examined were closely related to the apicomplexans or to Perkinsus marinus, the parasite that causes "Dermo disease" in oysters. The overall phylogenetic analyses largely supported the current class and subclass groupings within the dinoflagellates.

AB  - Irgarol 1051 is an algaecide used in copper-based antifoulant paints for controlling fouling organisms on the hulls of recreational and commercial watercraft. Paints containing this algaecide have been used in Europe since the mid-1980s. In 1998, the first antifouling paints containing Irgarol 1051 were registered for use in the U. S. To examine the risk that Irgarol may pose to aquatic ecosystems, a probabilistic ecological risk assessment was conducted using distributions of exposure and toxicity data. Exposure data for this assessment were derived from 11 monitoring studies (146 stations) conducted in marinas, estuaries, and coastal waters from 1992 to 1997 in six European countries. A comparison of 90th percentile concentrations pooled by station types across all regions showed that concentrations in marinas (316 ng/l) were higher than in estuaries and coastal waters (41 and 19 ng/l, respectively). A 90th percentile of 133 ng/l was reported for all pooled stations. Temporal trends showed that Irgarol concentrations typically peaked in early summer after launching of small boats with much lower concentrations occurring during the spring, fall, and winter. Toxicity data used for this risk assessment were derived primarily from unpublished studies submitted to regulatory agencies. Because Irgarol is a photosynthesis-inhibiting herbicide, it is much more toxic to plants than animals. Toxicity values for animals (fish and invertebrates) were much greater than concentrations of Irgarol reported in the environment. Therefore, a conservative approach using a distribution of only plant toxicity data (EC50s for plant growth) was used to derive a 10th percentile of 136 ng/l. This plant toxicity benchmark of 136 ng/l was used for risk characterization. Results from probabilistic analysis showed that ecological risk from Irgarol exposure was low in estuaries, coastal areas, and various open-type marinas. However, 10% or more of the plant species in enclosed marinas with low flushing rates may be exposed to Irgarol concentrations that would reduce photosynthesis activity and growth during the summer. Ecological risk to these sensitive plant species in enclosed marinas will likely be moderated because of the reversibility of Irgarol's inhibition of photosynthesis and the rapid recovery potential of plant communities. The ecological significance of marinas that generally contain numerous stressors such as trace metals, tributyltin, petroleum hydrocarbons, high nutrient concentrations, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations is a management issue that needs to be addressed.

AB  - In 1990, the senior management of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pesticide Programs and Toxic Substances (now called the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances, or OPPTS) directed the two offices forming OPPTS to "harmonize" their human health, environmental/ecological effects, environmental fate, and physical chemistry testing methods into a single set of test guidelines. These two offices, the Office of Toxic Substances, now the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) and the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP), assess risks posed by industrial chemicals and pesticides, respectively. Each office had developed separate testing guidance and methods. Under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, OPPT developed and published an extensive set of environmental effects test guidelines and technical support documents on testing requirements. In a similar manner, OPP published data requirements for registration of pesticides and developed Standard Evaluation Procedures (SEPs) to explain the procedures used to evaluate submitted ecological effects data. Harmonization of OPPT and OPP guidelines is advantageous because it avoids unnecessary testing, conserves resources, and avoids duplicative testing of chemicals being reviewed by more than one office. Also, there is better coordination of test reviews between each office and greater consistency in test interpretation. Harmonization results in increased guideline uniformity between offices, and a more efficient means of revising and updating the OPPTS guidelines. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was similarly engaged in guideline development in the 1970s, and published a set of biotic effects test guidelines in 1981 (second addendum was published in 1984). EPA intends to harmonize OPPTS guidelines with those of the OECD to avoid unnecessary testing of chemicals in international commerce, increase efficiency in reviewing chemicals, use fewer test animals, and reduce nontariff trade barriers. Efforts to date by OPPTS have resulted in developing drafts of ecological effects test guidelines (the "850" harmonized guidelines). These were available as public drafts in 1996; the OPP Scientific Advisory Panel commented on them at that time. Currently the guidelines are being revised and will be available as part 850 in volume 40 of the US Code of Federal Regulations. Examples are discussed of how the harmonized test guideline process between OPPTS and OECD operates and the progress achieved to date. These include development of a revised OECD daphnid chronic test, a new harmonized fish early life stage test, a new OECD aquatic macrophyte toxicity test (Lemna [duckweed] growth inhibition test), and OECD activities in chironomid sediment testing and terrestrial plant toxicity testing. Important harmonization limitations, possible problems, challenges, and future activities are discussed.

AB  - A wide variety of laws and regulations has been instituted at various levels of government to manage, conserve, and protect fish and wildlife resources from over-exploitation. Veterinarians may participate in the conservation of wildlife species in a number of ways, including providing expertise and services supporting law enforcement activities related to wildlife. An overview of the developing field of wildlife forensics (the application of scientific methods of investigation to legal issues) is given, with special emphasis on differentiation of gunshot wounds and illegal pesticide poisoning of wildlife species. Carbofuran, strychnine, avitrol, famphur, fenthion, and aldicarb are found in intentional and secondary poisonings in the United States because of inappropriate usage of these commonly available pesticides. Veterinarians trained in the medical sciences can assist in legal cases involving wildlife by determining the cause of death and assessing factors that contribute to an environment that may be unhealthy or lethal to protected species. The proper handling of evidence and the professional preparation of reports that may be used in a court case are important considerations for a veterinarian who participates in legal cases as an investigator and as an expert witness. This is a US government work. There are no restrictions on its use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To describe environmental health problems encountered in some Ontario family practices and to describe differences between the environmental concerns of urban (small and large) and rural physicians.
   DESIGN A self-completed questionnaire was mailed to 536 family physicians with hospital affiliations in three areas of Ontario.
   SETTING Family practices (rural, small urban, and large urban) in Ontario.
   PARTICIPANTS Of 521 eligible community family physicians with hospital affiliations, 214 returned usable questionnaires for a 41% response rate.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Environmental health problems encountered in practice were measured using questions about physician concerns, reported patient questions, physician-identified high-risk groups, problems related to environmental exposure, self-rated knowledge, and current and preferred sources of information on environmental health effects.
   RESULTS Physicians were highly concerned and reported many patient questions about the health effects of environmental exposures. Pregnant women, agricultural workers, and children were considered important at-risk groups. Self-ratings of knowledge were generally very low. Rural physicians were concerned about agricultural pesticide exposure and their patients about moldy hay. Urban physicians had different concerns about lead and reported patient concerns about exposure to Great Lakes fish. All groups used similar sources of current environmental health information.
   CONCLUSIONS Family physicians who participated in this study identified important patient and professional concerns about environmental health issues and reported a lack of resources to meet those concerns. This study provides information to family medicine residency programs and continuing medical education providers to help them enhance their focus on environmental health.

AB  - Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae) beta-1,3 glucans were used as adjuvant in a Vibrio damsela vaccine for turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.). Turbot were injected with the adjuvant prior, at the same time and after the vaccine. Several immune parameters (inder and rate of phagocytosis, passive haemolytic plaque numbers, and agglutinating antibody titers) were determined at different times postinoculation. The highest activity of all the immune parameters was obtained when glucans were injected after the bacterin. It is concluded that the sequence of glucan administration is critical when used as a vaccine adjuvant. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The cleaning/disinfection procedure should minimize the usually high number of microorganisms (10(7)-10(8) cm(2)) on surfaces to reasonably low levels of about one log per cm2. Aseptic conditions are normally not achieved. Most commercial disinfectants are mixed preparations. The agents used in disinfectants should not provoke changes, neither in chemical pattern, nor in sensoric properties of the food. They should not be the cause for deposition of unhealthy residues or for corrosive influences on premises. The efficacy must be warranted. The disinfection should include bactericidal, fungicidal and possibly virucidal activities with only minimal static effects. The efficacy should be based on a short-term effect even at lower temperatures (about 10 degrees C).
   Mostly in use are QACs, amphoteric surfactants and biguanides which are combined in many variations. Aldehydes in mixtures are used very seldomly and only in small amounts due to sensoric, corrosive or toxicological reactions. Alcohols are suitable for quick applications but they are flammable. Organic acids and peroxygens will deliver no residues but may be aggressive to tools and man. Alkylamines will have higher static effects and chlorine active compounds will suffer from protein load and pH deviations. In daily practice the efficacy has to be proved by microbiological monitoring, e.g. by cultural or, indirectly, by bioluminescence-techniques (with or without somatic ATP).
   Residue levels will remain low on premises if the disinfection is performed correctly, in adequate concentrations and with fresh water rinsing in sufficient amounts (about 8 liters per m(2)). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wildlife populations from contaminated ecosystems display a variety of reproductive alterations, including cryptorchidism in the Florida panther, small baculum in young male otters, small penises in alligators, sex reversal in fish, and altered social behavior in birds. The formation of biologically plausible hypotheses regarding disruption of reproduction in wildlife can be facilitated by mechanistic studies on laboratory animals. To this end, we are investigating the in vivo and in vitro effects of endocrine-disrupting toxicants in rodents. In vitro studies have used receptor binding and transfected cell assays to confirm the suspected mechanism of action, whereas in vivo rodent studies examine altered sexual differentiation. Antiandrogenic pesticides compete with the natural ligands for both rat and human androgen receptors, block androgen-induced gene expression in vitro and in vivo, delay puberty, reduce sex accessory,oland size, and alter male rat sex differentiation. In contrast, xenoestrogens affect female central nervous system sex differentiation and fecundity without producing malformations or infertility in-male offspring. Prenatal administration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or the TCDD-like polychlorinated biphenyls produce yet another profile of effects in the offspring, reducing numbers of ejaculated sperm in male progeny and inducing urogenital malformations in females. Although phthalates are reported to be estrogenic in vitro, in vivo exposure causes developmental alterations that more closely resemble antiandrogenic activity. The mammalian data indicate that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals produces effects that are pathognomonic for mechanisms by which they act. Mechanistic information derived from mammalian studies can enhance our ability to predict toxicant effects on reproduction in fish and wildlife.

AB  - In order to determine the biological impact of contaminants in the Skagerrak and Kattegat, mussels (Mytilus edulis L.) (4.5-6 cm in length) from a clean area (Faroe Islands) were transplanted for 6-8 weeks in 1993 and 1994 to sites in the Faroe Islands (reference control), to the Skagerrak deep-water region between Norway and Sweden, and to suspected contaminant-influx sites near the Hvaler Archipelago (Norway) and Goteborg (Sweden). Similar results were obtained in both years. Whole body total polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were 57-206 % higher in M. edulis from the Skagerrak, Norway and Sweden sites (up to 62 ng g(-1) dry wt) compared with the Faroe Islands reference control, whereas no differences were seen in organochlorines (PCBs, chlordanes, DDTs, hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexachlorobenzene). Digestive gland microsomal benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase (BPH) activity (formation of phenols) was elevated at all the contaminated sites compared with the Faroe Islands reference control (p<0.05). BPH turnover (BPH activity pmol(-1) P450) was elevated 132-288 % compared with the the Faroe Islands (p<0.05) and showed limited correlation with total PAHs (r(2)=0.58). Overall, the results are indicative of impact by PAHs and induction of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system. In contrast to previous studies on M. edulis exposed to higher tissue levels of PAHs or PCBs, no elevation of cytochrome P4501A-immunopositive protein (CYP1A) was detected using antibodies to fish hepatic CYP1A. Little or no differences between any sites were seen in digestive gland glutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18), superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) and catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) activities.

AB  - Efforts to control the spectrum of diseases that affect humans, our crops and our animals pose problems which need to be debated openly. Widespread use of chemicals in such a broad sphere raises important concerns not only about safety for the users, consumers and target species, but especially about the not so obvious effects upon the ecosystems in which they are used. Some undetermined level of biological diversity is necessary to maintain ecological function and resilience. These, in turn, are necessary for generating the biological resources (trees, fish, wildlife, crops) and ecological services (watershed protection, air cleansing, climate stabilisation, erosion control) on which economic activity and human welfare depend, The driving forces behind decline of biodiversity stem entirely from human activities. Underlying causes are those resulting from the cultural and social factors associated with economic activities and lead to direct depletion of species, and degradation or destruction of habitats. The broad spectrum and high efficacy of the macrocyclic lactones against nematode and arthropod parasites of livestock and companion animals are unprecedented. Cattle, horses, sheep, swine, dogs-to varying degrees all are utilised by humans for economic gain. Detrimental impact upon non-target animals is considered acceptable in eradicating parasites because of their economic importance to commercial livestock production. Production will increase when these parasites are eliminated, but we remain oblivious to the long-term consequences of our actions, What are the ecological limits to rural economic activities? Decomposing animal faeces help to maintain our ecosystem by returning valuable nutrients to the soil. Dung fauna-fungi, yeast, bacteria, nematodes, insects and earthworms-play a non-conspicuous but important and varied role in this decomposition process, a role dependent upon many factors, especially environmental ones, Anthelmintics and pesticides are of considerable value in agriculture, but largely at an unevaluated cost to the greater environment, We have insufficient knowledge of the extent to which a spectrum of anthelmintics and pesticides affect ecological function and ecosystem resilience in our commercial plant and animal production systems. It is time we developed a genuine interest in avoiding ''the dialogue of the deaf'' that in the past has minimised interdisciplinary research between environmental ecology and commercial plant and animal production.

AB  - Evaluation of the toxicity of Dicofol was carried out on Astyanax bimaculatus schubarti, a characteristic fish species living in tropical rivers and lakes. Experiments were under laboratory controlled conditions with atmospheric air flow and dilution water at 25 degrees C in the static mode. Fish samples were collected and submitted to appropriate analytical procedure: Soxhlet extraction, clean-up by Florisil adsorbent and finally quantification by GC-ECD. The results showed good recoveries (> 89 %) for the developed method both in water and fish samples. The lethal concentration, LC(50), and the bioconcentration factor, BCF, were 18.13 mg L(-1) and 241.70, respectively for Astyanax bimaculatus schubarti demonstrating the lipophilic nature of the studied compound.

AB  - The availability and use of ED point and NOEL values in ecotoxicological data submitted to the UK Pesticides Safety Directorate is explored. In first tier data normally submitted for pesticide registration, ED points such as EC/LC/LD50s are commonly available from acute laboratory toxicity studies conducted using birds, small mammals, fish, aquatic invertebrates, plants, honeybees and earthworms. These ED points are subsequently used for hazard classification of the pesticide and in toxicity : exposure ratio (TER) calculations required during the acute risk assessment. Although NOELs can often be available from the same first tier data, they are generally not used. However, NOELs commonly available from higher tier chronic toxicity studies such as chronic fish, Daphnia reproduction and avian reproduction studies, are used in TER calculations to assess chronic risk. The statistical limitations of the NOEL are recognized and the regulatory implications of replacing the NOEL with an alternative ED point are discussed.

AB  - Histopathological comparisons were made between ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) and carp (Cyprinus carpio) artificially infected with the causative fungus of mycotic granulomatosis, Aphanomyces piscicida NJM 8997. Ayu showed typical pathology of mycotic granulomatosis. On the other hand, in carp, no gross signs of inflammatory responses were observed during the experimental period of 20 days; however, mycotic granulomatous lesions were observed histologically in the inoculated site of the trunk muscles. It was considered histopathologically that carp responded to the inoculated fungus more quickly and intensively than ayu. In addition, the morphometrical features of fungal hyphae in the lesions of carp also suggested that fungal activities were suppressed by the inflammatory responses. Therefore, it was concluded that lesions in the trunk muscles of carp were restricted to a smaller area by their defense mechanisms, while the hyphae penetrated to the neighboring tissues in ayu because of weaker defense mechanisms.

AB  - The MAIZE expert system was developed by Penn State University to help extension agents and agribusiness personnel identify pest management strategies in field corn for their clientele. NAPRA (National Pesticide Risk Assessment) was developed by the Soil Conservation Service (now the Natural Resource Conservation Service) to assess the relative risk of pesticides contaminating the ground or surface water. A joint project was funded to link the output of the NAPRA program with the MAIZE expert system. By linking the programs, MAIZE could provide extension agents and crop advisors with management alternatives that are efficacious, environmentally sound and low cost. A complete training package was designed to accompany the MAIZE/NAPRA program.
   Standard crop management scenarios for the Pequea-Mill Creek watershed were defined and submitted to SCS, these scenarios were then run through the NAPRA process and an output database was generated. This information included soil characteristics, runoff, organic matter, cropping information, erosion information, and climate information for the appropriate chemicals, this numbered over 49,000 scenarios. MAIZE was modified to access this information and display it in a user friendly format. On the basis of site specific inputs, MAIZE identifies the most efficacious pesticides. MAIZE then searches the output file from NAPRA that contains the relative environmental risk information for the pesticides under the specific site characteristics. A table is created that lists each chemical, its cost, its relative risk of runoff (fish toxicity) and its relative risk to ground water (human toxicity). The output information provided from this merger enables the consultant to make an informed decision about each pest management option, as it pertains to the farm system, and evaluate the tradeoff between minimizing risk to the environment and farm profitability.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of the study was to assess reproductive outcomes, especially birthweight, and the consumption of fatty fish from the Baltic Sea, contaminated with persistent organochlorine compounds, among women from the Swedish east coast.
   Material and methods Cohorts of fishermen's wives from the Swedish east and west coasts were established and linked to the Swedish Medical Birth Register for 1973-1991; 1501 children were born in the eastcoast cohort and 3553 in the westcoast cohort, Comparisons were made with regional populations and between the cohorts. Dietary interviews were made with 69 randomly selected women from the cohorts and 69 referents.
   Results The women interviewed from the east- and westcoast cohorts ate locally caught fish more than twice as often as their referents. Compared with the regional population, the women in the eastcoast cohort gave birth to an increased number of infants with low birthweights (<3000 g), whereas the opposite was seen in the westcoast cohort. Infants in the eastcoast cohort had significantly lower birthweights than infants from the westcoast cohort (median 3530 versus 3610 g, P<0.001). Even after adjustment for potential confounders, eastcoast affiliation showed an increased risk for low birthweight (odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.18-1.76). The effect was more conspicuous for boys (odds ratio 1.95) and heavy smokers (odds ratio 3.00).
   Conclusions The present data support, but do not prove, an association between a high consumption of contaminated fish from the Baltic Sea and an increased risk for low birthweight.

AB  - The O antigens derived from Vibrio damsela and Pasteurella piscicida were evaluated to determine their ability to enhance non-specific defence mechanisms and the specific immune response in turbot.  Intraperitoneal injections of 100 mug V. damsela or P. piscicida O antigen resulted in an increased phagocytic activity of splenic leucocytes 3 days after immunisation, although the level of phagocytosis of sheep red blood cells (SRBC) was always low.  In both groups of immunised fish a peak in the specific plaque-forming cells (PFC) was observed 21 days post-injection.  There were no differences in PFC number induced by the two bacterins in turbot.  Peak antibody titres were 28 and 42 days after immunisation with O antigen from P. piscicida and V. damsela respectively.

AB  - The present paper summarizes key features of time-dependent sensitization (TDS) in neuropharmacology (progressive amplification of behavioral, neuronal, endocrine, and/or immune responses to repeated intermittent exposures to an environmental agent or cross-sensitizing agents) as a possible model for cacosmia (subjective sense of feeling ill from low levels of environmental chemical odors) in nonindustrial and industrial populations; and extends previous cacosmia research in nonpatient populations to an elderly sample. This study examined the symptom and psychological profiles of 263 older adults (aged 60-90 y, 71% women, 29% men); 57% reported that at least one chemical and 17% reported that at least four of five chemicals (pesticide, automobile exhaust, paint, new carpet, perfume) made them feel ill. Cacosmia ratings correlated weakly and negatively with age (r = - 0.19, p = .001) over the whole sample. Cacosmia correlated significantly with self-reported illness from foods that may mobilize or generate opioid peptides (wheat, dairy, eggs) (r = 0.32, p < .0001) and with illness from opiate drugs (r = 0.23, p < .0001). When the sample was divided into four cells on the basis of above- versus below-median total chemical-induced illness score (CI) and total food-induced illness score (FI), the high CI and high FI, high CI only, and high FI only groups had more frequent indigestion, and the high CI group had more frequent difficulty concentrating than the groups below median for illness from both chemicals and foods (NOILL), even after co-varying for age and anxiety. The most cacosmic subjects noted higher prevalence of physician-diagnosed allergies and irritable bowel than did noncacosmic subjects. In contrast with previous young adult cohort studies, the older illness groups did not differ with regard to sex distribution, depression, shyness, or repressive defensiveness. When considered with prior surveys of young adults, the present findings are consistent with the presence of previously established, time-dependent sensitization to multiple xenobiotic agents in susceptible individuals for whom psychological variables do not explain the symptom of cacosmia. If cacosmia is a symptom of TDS, then the neuropharmacology literature suggests the possibility of excitatory amino acid, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, dopaminergic, and/or opioid involvement. Prospective studies with objective measures testing the possible induction of TDS to specific chemicals are indicated.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY

AB  - The sublethal concentration 6 mg.l-1 of a piscicidal flavanoid, 'Quercetin glycoside', obtained from E. colebrookiana affected neuro-architecture in medulla oblongata of freshwater fish, Barilius bendelisis (Ham.), at 32 days exposure.  Since medulla of fish is primary centre for the reception of several incoming stimuli, the breakdown of neurons and their neuraxes in facial and vagal lobes impaired the transmission of sensory informations to cerebellum.  Consequently fish became unconscious and could be caught easily with hands.  The symptoms like lack of schooling, lack of response to food and external stimuli, sluggishness, incapability of maintaining body posture and uncoordinated functioning are accounted for by the neurolysis in hind brain of fish.

TI  - Ownership and Use of Insecticide-Treated Nets among People Living in Malaria Endemic Areas of Eastern Myanmar
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background
   Myanmar has the highest burden of malaria in the Greater Mekong. However, there is limited information on ownership and use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) in areas of Myanmar most severely affected by malaria. We describe ownership and use of ITNs among people in the malaria-endemic eastern parts of Myanmar and factors associated with ITN use.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional household survey using a multi-stage cluster design was conducted in malaria-endemic townships in eastern Myanmar during the high malaria season of August to September, 2014. An effective ITN was defined as 1) a long-lasting insecticide-treated net obtained within the past three years, or 2) any net treated with insecticide within the past year.
   Results
   In 4,679 households, the average number of ITNs per household was higher in rural compared to urban areas (0.6 vs. 0.4, p < 0.001) as well as the proportion of households owning at least one ITN (27.3% vs. 15.5%, p < 0.001). The proportion of households in which all members slept under an ITN was also higher in rural compared to urban areas (15.3% vs 6.9%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, rural households (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.78, 95% CI: 1.43-2.21, p<0.001), households in which respondents knew malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes (aOR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.10-1.65, p = 0.004), and in which respondents knew malaria can be prevented by ITN use (aOR 1.86, 95% CI: 1.28-2.70, p<0.001) were more likely to have all members sleep under an ITN. Compared to the lowest socio- economic quintile, households in the richest quintile were less likely to have all members sleep under an ITN (aOR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.33-0.66, p<0.001). Households in which the main income earner was a skilled worker or a businessman were less likely to have all members sleep under an ITN (aOR, 0.70, 95% CI: 0.52-0.96, p<0.025) compared to those headed by farmers or fishermen. Households in which all children slept under an ITN were more likely to be in rural areas (aOR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.19-2.09, p = 0.002) and have a household head who knew malaria can be prevented by ITN use (aOR 2.13, 95% CI: 1.30-3.50, p = 0.003). Children were less likely to have slept under an ITN in houses headed by skilled workers or businessmen (aOR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.33-0.75, p = 0.001) or unskilled workers (aOR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.89, p = 0.006) compared to households with farmers or fishermen. Higher socio-economic level was associated with lower ITN use by children (aOR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.36-0.88, p = 0.012, highest vs. lowest quintile).
   Conclusions
   The study found ownership of ITNs was low in Myanmar in comparison to the goal of one for every two household members. Use of ITNs was low even when present. Findings are of concern given the study areas were part of enhanced efforts to reduce artemisinin-resistant malaria. Nonetheless, groups vulnerable to malaria such as individuals in rural settings, lower socio-economic households, and workers in high mosquito exposure jobs, had higher rates of ITN ownership. Malaria knowledge was linked to effective ITN use suggesting that distribution campaigns should be complemented by behavior change communications.

AB  - Abamectin, a pesticide of 16-member macrocyclic lactones, is widely applied in agriculture. As an important environmental factor, pesticides pose a great threat to defense system in aquatic animals. Procambarus clarkii is one of the most important economic aquatic animals in China. It is necessary to explore the defense mechanism of P. clarkii to abamectin. In this study, P. clarkii were exposed to 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 mg/L abamectin, immune-and antioxidant-related enzymes activities, genes expression levels, and histological observations were used to analyze the defense capacity of P. clarkii to abamectin. With increasing abamectin concentration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and malondiadehyde (MDA) content increased significantly. Meanwhiile, acid phosphate (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities, total haemocyte counts (THC), and Crustin expression level decreased significantly, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and GPX expression level also decreased significantly. Hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) observation showed that with increasing abamectin concentration, hepatopancreas were damaged, especially membrane structure. Through TUNEL observation and apoptosis-related genes (PcCTSL, Bcl-2, Bax, BI-1, PcCytc, caspase-3) expression levels, with increasing abamectin concentration, apoptosis rate increased significantly. Results of this study indicated that abamectin caused oxidative damage to P. clarkii, resulting in damage to defense system, sup-pression of nonspecific immunity and antioxidation, and promotion of apoptosis. It provided theoretical basis for healthy P. clarkii culture, and for further study on defense mechanism of aquatic animals to pesticides.

AB  - Broflanilide is widely used to control pests and has attracted attention due to its adverse effects on aquatic organisms. Our previous study showed that broflanilide has a negative impact on the central nervous system (CNS) at lethal dosages; however, its neural effects under practical situations and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To elucidate how broflanilide affects the CNS, we exposed zebrafish larvae to broflanilide at 16.9 and 88.0 mu g/L (the environmentally relevant concentrations) for 120 h. Zebrafish locomotion was significantly disturbed at 88.0 mu g/L, with a decreased moving distance and velocity accompanied by an inhibited neurotransmitter level. In vivo neuroimaging analysis indicated that the nerves of zebrafish larvae, including the axons, myelin sheaths, and neurons, were impaired. The number of neurons was significantly reduced after exposure, with an impaired morphological structure. These changes were accompanied by the abnormal transcription of genes involved in early CNS development. In addition, an increased total number of microglia and an elevated proportion of amoeboid microglia were observed after 88.0 mu g/L broflanilide exposure, pointing out to an upstream role of microglia activation in mediating broflanilide neurotoxicity. Meanwhile, increased inflammatory cytokine levels and brain neutrophil numbers were observed, implicating significant inflammatory response and immune toxicity. Our findings indicate that broflanilide interferes with microglia-neuron regulation and induces neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Withthe poorly soluble and intrinsically unstable feature, prochloraz(Pro) was confronted with lower bioavailability in the crop defenseagainst fungal erosion. Therefore, it was a challenging project toexplore the innovative antifungal compound delivery system for improvingbioavailability. The superior adhesive fungicide formulation was supposedto be an efficient pathway to enhance transmembrane permeability andbiological activity. According to abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups,tannic acid (TA) was an ideal modified adhesive biomaterial to improveinterfacial interactions. The fundamental purpose of this researchwas focused on the synergistic mechanism of TA-interfacial-modifiedpro-ethyl cellulose (EC) nanoparticles for improving bioavailabilityand biosafety. In the stability test, TA-modified Pro-EC nanoparticleshad the capacity to reduce Pro initial release burst, extending apersistent validity and improving anti-photodegradation property.The toxicity index of Pro-EC and Pro-EC-TA was approximately 2.93-foldand 4.96-fold that of raw Pro against Fusarium graminearum(F. graminearum), respectively. Compared with nonmodifiedEC nanoparticles, TA-modified EC nanoparticles obtained eminent transmembranepermeability and superior adherence ability to F. graminearum, for hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of TA to enhance interaction withtarget cell membranes. The contents of cellular reactive oxygen speciesinduced by Pro-EC and Pro-EC-TA nanoparticles were about 2.31 timesand 3.00 times that of the control check (CK), respectively. Comparedto the CK group, the membrane potential and ergosterol values of F. graminearum treated with Pro-EC-TA nanoparticleswere drastically reduced by 74.91 and 56.20%, respectively. In thebiosafety assay, the maximum half-lethal concentration value of theTA-modified Pro-EC nanoparticles indicated that the acute toxicityof the Pro-EC-TA nanoparticles to adult zebrafish was approximately8.34-fold reduced compared to that of the Pro technical. These findingsdemonstrated that the successful interfacial modification of Pro-ECnanoparticles with TA was a highly efficient, environmentally safe,and promising alternative for sustainable agricultural application,thus making the fungicide formulation process more simplified, easierfabrication, and lower cost.

AB  - Arctic communities are disproportionately exposed to pollutants from sources including global atmospheric transport and formerly used defense sites (FUDS). The effects of climate change and increasing development in the Arctic have the potential to exacerbate this problem. Yupik People of Sivuqaq, or St Lawrence Island, Alaska are one such community with documented exposures to pollutants from FUDS, and their traditional lipid-rich foods such as blubber and rendered oils of marine mammals. Troutman Lake, adjacent to the Yupik community of Gambell, Alaska, was used as a disposal site during the decommission of the adjacent FUDS, leading to community concern about exposure to military pollution and intrusion from historic local dump sites. In collaboration with a local community group, this study utilized passive sampling devices deployed in Troutman Lake. Air, water and sediment deployed samplers were analyzed for unsubstituted and alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), brominated and organophosphate flame retardants and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). PAH concentrations were low and comparable to other remote/rural locations. PAHs were generally in deposition from the overlying atmosphere into Troutman Lake. Of the flame retardants, brominated diphenyl ether-47 was detected in all surface water samplers while triphenyl phosphate was detected in all environmental compartments. Both were at concentrations equivalent or lower than other remote locations. Of particular interest, we measured higher atmospheric concentrations of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) (0.75-2.8 ng/m3) than previously reported in the literature for remote Arctic sites (<0.017-0.56 ng/m3). TCEP was found to be in deposition to Troutman Lake at magnitudes from 290 to 1300 ng/m2/day. No PCBs were detected in this study. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of both modern and legacy chemicals from local and global sources. These results help us to understand the fate of anthropogenic contaminants in dynamic Arctic systems providing valuable data for communities, policy makers and scientists.

AB  - This paper considers the role of public consultations in complex agri-environmental policy-making. Through a critical discourse analysis of submissions to the public consultation concerning the European Union's Farm to Fork Strategy, we examine the role of public consultations as a democratic process and the extent to which their non-deliberative nature advances solutions to contentious and complex challenges. We explore different perspectives around the future of agricultural pesticide use and find evidence of polarised submissions. Those in favour of reducing pesticides tend to argue on the grounds of planetary and human health, emphasizing that alternatives already exist and resistance to change results from a lack of political will. Those arguing against setting further restrictions on pesticide use, focus on food security and the lack of viable alternatives. Taking inspiration from Arnstein's (1969) [A ladder of citizen participation. Journal of the American Institute of Planners, 35(4), 216-224] ladder of participation and Fishkin's (2011) [Making deliberative democracy practical. Chapter 4. In When the people speak: Deliberative democracy and public consultation (pp. 95-105] questions around what makes deliberative democracy practical, we argue that consultations are not merely 'tokenistic', but do appear to be inadequate where discourses are strongly polarised, as they are not sufficiently inclusive or thoughtful, using scientific findings only where these support pre-existing views. As such, we explore how other deliberative approaches may be more adequate for seeking legitimate solutions to complex challenges.

AB  - Transposable elements in eukaryotic organisms have historically been considered " selfish," at best conferring indirect benefits to their host organisms. The Starships are a recently discovered feature in fungal genomes that are, in some cases, predicted to confer beneficial traits to their hosts and also have hallmarks of being transposable elements. Here, we provide experimental evidence that Starships are indeed autonomous transposons, using the model Paecilomyces variotii, and identify the HhpA "Captain" tyrosine recombinase as essential for their mobilization into genomic sites with a specific target site consensus sequence. Furthermore, we identify multiple recent horizontal gene transfers of Starships, implying that they jump between species. Fungal genomes have mechanisms to defend against mobile elements, which are frequently detrimental to the host. We discover that Starships are also vulnerable to repeat-induced point mutation defense, thereby having implications on the evolutionary stability of such elements.

AB  - Background: Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are used as flame retardants and plasticizers in various consumer products. Limited prior research suggests sex-specific effects of prenatal OPE exposures on fetal development. We evaluated overall and sex-specific associations between prenatal OPE exposures and gestational age (GA) at birth and birthweight for gestational age (BW for GA) z-scores among the predominately low-income, Hispanic MADRES cohort.Methods: Nine OPE metabolite concentrations were measured in 421 maternal urine samples collected during a third trimester visit (GA = 31.5 +/- 2.0 weeks). We examined associations between single urinary OPE metabolites and GA at birth and BW for GA z-scores using linear regression models and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and effects from OPE mixtures using Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR). We also assessed sex-specific differences in single metabolite analyses by evaluating statistical interactions and stratifying by sex.Results: We did not find significant associations between individual OPE metabolites and birth outcomes in the full infant sample; however, we found that higher bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) was associated with earlier GA at birth among male infants (p = 0.04), and a nonlinear, inverted U-shape association between the sum of dibutyl phosphate and di-isobutyl phosphate (DNBP + DIBP) and GA at birth among female infants (p = 0.03). In mixtures analysis, higher OPE metabolite mixture exposures was associated with lower GA at birth, which was primarily driven by female infants. No associations were observed between OPE mixtures and BW for GA z-scores.Conclusion: Higher BDCIPP and DNBP + DIBP concentrations were associated with earlier GA at birth among male and female infants, respectively. Higher exposure to OPE mixtures was associated with earlier GA at birth, particularly among female infants. However, we saw no associations between prenatal OPEs and BW for GA. Our results suggest sex-specific impacts of prenatal OPE exposures on GA at birth.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is a viral and transferable disease caused by severe respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2. It can spread through breathing droplets in human beings. It caused 5.32 million deaths around the world at the end of 2021. COVID-19 has caused several positive impacts as well, such as a reduction in air, water, and noise pollution. However, its negative impacts are by far critical such as increased death rate, increased release of microcontaminants (pesticides, biocides, pharmaceuticals, surfactants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, and heavy metals), increased biomedical waste generation due to excessive use of safety equipment and its disposal, and municipal solid waste generation. Environmental pollution was significantly reduced due to lockdown during the COVID-19 period. Therefore, the quality of air and water improved. COVID-19 affected all sections of the population, particularly the most vulnerable members of society, and thus pushed more people into poverty. At the world level, it increased risks to food safety by increasing prices and lowering revenues, forcing households to reduce their food consumption in terms of quantity and quality. COVID-19 also upset various exercises e.g., horticulture, fisheries, domesticated animals, and agribusiness hence prohibiting the development of merchandise for poor-country ranchers. Most of the patients can self-recover from COVID-19 if they do not have any other diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart problems. Predictably, the appropriate execution of the proposed approaches (vaccination, wearing face masks, social distancing, sustainable industrialization) is helpful for worldwide environmental sustainability.

AB  - Grapevine seeds have morphophysiological dormancy, which complicates their germination, an important step in obtaining new plants after crossing during breeding. The objective of this work was to establish the ideal conditions for Vitis labrusca L. 'Isabella' seed storage conditions, the method for breaking seed dormancy, ripening of fruits at harvest, need for fungicide application before seed sowing and their germination. The seeds were submitted to three tests with (1 and 2) different treatments to break seed dormancy and storage in two conditions for two different times (Isabella), and (3) seeds from unripe and ripe fruits treated or untreated with fungicide. Germination was monitored two times per week. The percentage of germination (%G), germination mean time (GMT), and germination speed index (GSI) were calculated. Data were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and means were compared using the LSD-Fisher test (p < 0.05). The 12-month storage at a controlled temperature (25 & PLUSMN;2 & DEG;C) provided the best germination results (up to 19.5% of G%). Stratification for 90 or 120 days on wet paper or sand at 5 & PLUSMN;2 & DEG;C of seeds from mature fruits is the most suitable for the germination of Isabella seeds (65% to 72% of G%, and 1.73 and 1.95 of GSI for the treatments of stratification on wet sand for 120 days). It is also not necessary to apply fungicide on seeds before sowing, as long as disinfestation with 70% alcohol and sodium hypochlorite 1%, and triple washing with water is done (no statistical difference for seeds from ripe fruits treated or not with fungicide, 58% and 64.7% of %G, and 1.37 and 1.22 of GSI, respectively).

AB  - Historic and contemporary data can shed light on a species' conservation status and work together to address two main goals in conservation biology: (1) identifying species under extinction risk and (2) the forces shaping this process. Museomics is the study of historical DNA acquired from museum specimens that allows researchers to answer myriad questions across many taxa. Museomics is an effective way to understand how populations have been affected by human and climate factors from a historic perspective. Here, our goal is to investigate changes in wild populations of two small carpenter bee species (Ceratina calcarata and C. dupla) across a 50-year time span. We sampled museum specimens and recent collections to determine their genetic diversity, population structure, effective population size, signatures of selection, and local adaptation. Both species displayed reduced genetic diversity and effective population size through time. We identified signatures of adaptation in both species across human-altered land use and climate change scenarios. We found signatures of selection in genes related to biochemical defense, insecticide, and thermal tolerance, which are consistent with the observed increase in agricultural land use development and rising temperatures over the past 50 years. Our findings suggest that these species are facing population inbreeding, possibly attributable to human land-use change and agrochemicals in their environment. Overall, this study highlights the use of museomics to understand species declines, threats to populations, and targets for remediation.

AB  - As endophytes are widely distributed in the plant's internal compartments and despite having enormous potential as a biocontrol agent against postharvest diseases of fruits, the fruit-endophyte-pathogen interactions have not been studied detail. Therefore, this review aims to briefly discuss the colonization patterns of endophytes and pathogens in the host tissue, the diversity and distribution patterns of endophytes in the carposphere of fruits, and host-endophyte-pathogen interactions and the molecular mechanism of the endophytic microbiome in postharvest disease management in fruits. Postharvest loss management is one of the major concerns of the current century. It is considered a critical challenge to food security for the rising global population. However, to manage the postharvest loss, still, a large population relies on chemical fungicides, which affect food quality and are hazardous to health and the surrounding environment. However, the scientific community has searched for alternatives for the last two decades. In this context, endophytic microorganisms have emerged as an economical, sustainable, and viable option to manage postharvest pathogens with integral colonization properties and eliciting a defense response against pathogens. This review extensively summarizes recent developments in endophytic interactions with harvested fruits and pathogens-the multiple biocontrol traits of endophytes and colonization and diversity patterns of endophytes. In addition, the upscale commercial production of endophytes for postharvest disease treatment is discussed.

AB  - Insecticide-treated net (ITN) is the most applicable and cost-effective malaria intervention measure in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. Although ITNs have been widely distributed to malaria-endemic regions in the past, their success has been threatened by misuses (in fishing, agriculture etc.) and decay in ITN efficacy. Decision-making in using the ITNs depends on multiple coevolving factors: malaria prevalence, mosquito density, ITN availability and its efficacy, and other socio-economic determinants. While ITN misuse increases as the efficacy of ITNs declines, high efficacy also impedes proper use due to free-riding. This irrational usage leads to increased malaria prevalence, thereby worsening malaria control efforts. It also remains unclear if the optimum ITN use for malaria elimination can be achieved under such an adaptive social learning process. Here, we incorporate evolutionary game theory into a disease transmission model to demonstrate these behavioural interactions and their impact on malaria prevalence. We show that social optimum usage is a function of transmission potential, ITN efficacy and mosquito demography. Under specific parameter regimes, our model exhibits patterns of ITN usage similar to observed data from parts of Africa. Our study suggests that the provision of financial incentives as prompt feedback to improper ITN use can reduce misuse and contribute positively towards malaria elimination efforts in Africa and elsewhere.

AB  - The effects of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae on the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) Leptinotarsa decemlineata and the involvement of adipokinetic hormone (AKH) in the responsive reactions were examined in this study. It was observed that nematode application doubled the amount of AKH (Peram-CAH-I and Peram-CAH-II) in the central nervous system of L. decemlineata, indicating mobilization of anti-stress reactions in the body. Furthermore, the external co-application of Peram-CAH-II with the nematode significantly increased beetle mortality (5.6 and 1.8 times, 1 and 2 days after application, respectively). The mechanism underlying this phenomenon was investigated. As the effect on gut characteristics was equivocal, it was assumed that the nematodes profited from the observed mobilization of metabolites from the fat body into the PeramCAH-II-induced hemolymph. This phenomenon supplied nematodes with a more nutrient-dense substrate on which they propagated. Furthermore, Peram-CAH-II lowered vitellogenin expression in the fat body, particularly in males, thus limiting the anti-pathogen defense capacity of the protein. However, there could be other possible mechanisms underpinning this chain of events. The findings could be theoretically intriguing but could also aid in developing real insect pest control methods in the future.

AB  - Today aggressive agricultural efforts to increase crop productivity have sparked new research formulations for innovative fertilizers and natural insecticides, particularly those incorporating nanomaterials. For the first time, bioengineered ZnO NPs (nanoparticles) were done employing peel waste of vegetable extruent as a major mediator to boost the value of cluster beans (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) seeds as well as the higher yield of cluster beans pods. The findings of several phytochemical property investigations show the creation of ZnO NPs. The agar well method was used to explore the antagonistic efficiency of plant pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Candida albicans, and Candida glabrata. For, cluster beans foliar sprays of bioengineering based ZnO nano-fertilizer at varied doses were applied. Among the various concentrations tested, the plant obtained 20 mg/L had the utmost bioactive contents in comparison to the control. Growth characters such as germination of seeds (95%), total plant length (37 cm), shoot length (20 cm), root length(8.2 cm), gross wet weight (25 gm), shoot wet weight (18 gm), root wet weight (1.92 gm), gross dry weight (6.68 gm), shoot dry weight (5.81 gm), root dry weight (0.49 gm), branch numbers (11), leaf expanse (8.9 cm), pod numbers (15), length of the pod (19.6 cm) and weight of the pod (0.126 gm) this sort of seed was recognized as being superior to hydro-primed seeds. From this investigation,we resolved that the bioengineered ZnO NPs has been effectively realized and is a biocompatible,less-toxic, ecologically friendly substance. ZnO NPs thereby synthesized proved to have exceptional antimicrobial potential against pathogens in plants as well as remarkable results in improving the growth and yield of cluster beans. Therefore, a bioengineering-based ZnO nano fertilizer can be recommended for agricultural applications.

AB  - Agricultural modernization is the most important task of modernization construction. This study used the multi-index comprehensive measurement method to estimate the agricultural modernization level of Shandong Province from 2010 to 2019. Regional differences were analyzed using the ESDA method, and the main obstacles were diagnosed using the obstacle degree model. This paper constructs an index system, including an agricultural production system, a management system, an industrial system, output benefits, rural social development, and agricultural sustainable development. The results showed that the level of agricultural modernization in Shandong Province was divided into three stages: decelerating ascent (2010-2013), accelerating ascent (2014-2016), and high-level fluctuation (2017-2019). Results found that the scores of the agricultural production system, rural development level, and agricultural industrial system peaked in 2017.The regional difference in the agricultural modernization level of Shandong Province is high in the north and low in the south of China. The main obstacles in the rising stage of agricultural modernization in Shandong Province are the proportion of the added value of agriculture, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry service; the amount of fertilizer and pesticide used per land area; the total power of units farmland machinery; the high-level fluctuation order are shelterbelt construction rate; the proportion of livestock production value; rural per capita electricity consumption; and rural employment rate. The average arable land per household and the employment rate of the rural population are the key obstacles to high levels of agricultural modernization. Therefore, optimizing industrial structure, improving the input of productive factors, cultivating a high-quality rural labor force, improving the efficiency of agricultural funds use, and awareness of the sustainable development of agriculture are all suggested.

AB  - Invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) populations in the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin have been suppressed for over 60 years primarily by migration barriers and lamprey-specific pesticides. Improving control outcomes by supplementing barriers and pesticides with additional control strategies has been a long-standing objective of managers and stakeholders, but progress towards this objective has been limited. We developed an adaptive management implementation framework and applied it to this objective. The framework consists of a set of adaptive management implementation goals (develop effective monitoring practices, develop effective participatory process, and conduct management experiments), a set of aspirational targets hypothesized to be related to Sea Lamprey Control Program adaptive capacity (multi-level political and social organization, creation of safe-to-fail decision making arenas, and effective use of multi-criteria decision analysis), and a feedback loop linking adaptive capacity and progress towards adaptive management implementation goals. Progress towards improving sea lamprey control outcomes by integrating supplemental control strategy into the Sea Lamprey Control Program may be possible through adaptive management implementation.

TI  - DISEASES/SYMPTOMS DIAGNOSED ON COMMERCIAL CROP SAMPLES SUBMITTED TO THE BRITISH COLUMBIA MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND FISHERIES (BCMAFF), PLANT HEALTH LABORATORY IN 2020 Abstracts
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (BCMAFF), Plant Health Laboratory (PHL) provides diagnoses of diseases and disorders caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, plant parasitic nematodes and insect pests of agricultural crops grown in British Columbia. The PHL also makes assessments on possible abiotic factors affecting plant health. Between January 1 and December 14, 2020, the PHL received 794 samples including Christmas trees, field crops, greenhouse vegetable and floriculture crops, forest nursery seedlings, herbaceous and woody ornamentals, small fruits, tree fruits, nuts, turfgrass and specialty crops for diagnosis. No significantly new or unusually high level of any disease was detected in the samples. METHODS: The BCMAFF Plant Health Laboratory provides diagnoses for diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, plant parasitic nematodes, and insect pests of agricultural crops grown in British Columbia. Samples are submitted to the laboratory by ministry staff, growers, agri-business representatives, crop insurance personnel, municipalities and master gardeners. Crop categories comprising majority of the samples in 2020 included; field vegetables (26.57%) followed by berry crops (18.51%), woody ornamentals (17.12%), tree fruit and grape (7.43%) and forest nursery seedlings (6.29%). All other crops were from 0.5% to up to 5.0% of the total submissions. Diagnoses were accomplished by visual and microscopic examination, culturing onto microbial media, biochemical identification of bacteria using BIOLOG (R) and serological testing of viruses, fungi and bacteria with micro-well and membrane-Molecular techniques (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-conventional and/or real time) were used for some species-specific diagnoses. General primer PCRs (for fungi and bacteria) were followed by sequencing to identify the organism involved. Some specimens were referred to other laboratories for identification or confirmation of the diagnosis.
   RESULTS AND COMMENTS: Overall in 2020, British Columbia had mild winter weather conditions in January followed by a severe cold snap in February. The long, mild spring was wet as is normal for B.C. and was followed by a short dry summer. The wet weather in the spring supported bacterial blights on woody ornamentals, tree fruits and berry crops. Fire blight incidence was higher than usually seen in tree fruit as well as woody ornamental crops. Summaries of diseases and their causal/associated agents diagnosed on crop samples submitted to the laboratory are presented in Tables 1 to 13, organized by crop category. Diagnoses not listed include abiotic disorders caused by suspected nutritional stress, pH imbalance, water stress, drought stress, adverse growing/cultural conditions, genetic abnormalities, environmental and chemical stresses including damage from herbicides, fruit abortion due to lack of pollination, insect-related injury, or damage where no conclusive causal factor was identified. More than one disease-causing agent was identified on many samples and are listed under individual disease/symptom. The frequency of diseases diagnosed in the lab does not reflect their prevalence in the field in B.C.

AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to humankind and the advancement of resistance due to genetic modifications and other defense mechanisms that make the current antibiotics ineffective or less efficacious. Objective: This investigation aims to isolate bioactive compounds from the leaf acetone extract of Terminalia catappa and to evaluate their antimicrobial potential against human pathogenic organisms. Materials and Methods: The bioactive extract was subjected to column chromatography. The fractions were assessed for their minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum fungicidal concentration, and time kill assays. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis was used to identify the bioactive molecules in the fraction. Results: The isolated fraction exhibited antimicrobial activity, with the most sensitive being Staphylococcus aureus (clinical isolate) and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus 1503 (0.097 mg/mL), and the fungi Trichophyton rubrum and Candida albicans were inhibited at 0.097 mg/mL. The time kill assay exhibited bactericidal properties towards S. aureus (clinical isolate) and Salmonella typhi (MTCC 733). Additionally, MRSA 1503 and Proteus vulgaris exhibited bacteriostatic activities. The UHPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed that the fraction was rich in polyphenols. Alkaloids and some ellagitannins were identified for the first time. Conclusion: The results highlight the significant inhibition of multidrug-resistant MRSA strains and fungi by the polyphenol-rich fraction. The investigation reveals the potential use of the identified compounds for antimicrobial use, which could lower the implication of multidrug resistance.

Its presence may cause stress and discomfort to people inhabiting or working the infested areas. In addition, it may cause damage to organic materials, contaminate food and carry microbes. This paper summarizes the available data on its spreading and current distribution of species in Europe and displayed the species is present throughout the continent including Scandinavia. This northward shift of C. longicaudatum might be explained by use of the insulation and central heating to provide optimal climate for the species to establish. The paper also contains updates on the current status of C. longicaudatum in Czechia, United Kingdom, and Ireland, where its first populations were recently detected. Based on the collected data, the spread in the monitored countries continues rapidly, when the domestic settings were the main habitat. Furthermore, the species is often present in accommodation facilities, warehouses, factories, public institutions, shopping malls, archives, museums, and art galleries. Therefore, the study indicates the species may occur everywhere indoors. The paper also highlights an urgent need for establishment of effective pest management strategy and preventive measures. Synanthropic invasive silverfish, Ctenolepisma longicaudatum, has been recently reported to cause nuisance in the indoor environment in many European countries. To get more details on the species distribution, the species occurrence was monitored by the authors in the countries where establishment of C. longicaudatum has been revealed in the last years. In Czechia, 20 findings from 14 municipalities in eight regions were recorded within the last three years. In the United Kingdom, 49 cases, including the first occurrence in Scotland, were recorded. Five cases were recorded for the Republic of Ireland. Domestic settings were the main habitat in the study countries (50.0% for the Czechia and Ireland and 36.8% for the United Kingdom). Regarding C. longicaudatum control, the standard silverfish strategy fails, and the use of insecticidal baits complemented by dust insecticides was suggested as the most promising approach. To reveal presence of C. longicaudatum in Europe, the search of literature, social platforms and databases on invasive species was conducted. According to these sources, the species is known from majority of European countries, when the high increase of records in recent decade was detected.

AB  - Background: The Northern Arizona University (NAU) Center for Health Equity Research (CHER) is conducting community-engaged health research involving "environmental scans" in Yuma County in collaboration with community health stakeholders, including the Yuma Regional Medical Center (YRMC), Regional Center for Border Health, Inc. (RCBH), Campesinos Sin Fronteras (CSF), Yuma County Public Health District, and government agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working on border health issues. The purpose of these efforts is to address community-generated environmental health hazards identified through ongoing coalitions among NAU, and local health care and research institutions.
   Objective: We are undertaking joint community/university efforts to examine human exposures to perchlorate and agricultural pesticides. This project also includes the parallel development of a new animal model for investigating the mechanisms of toxicity following a "one health" approach. The ultimate goal of this community-engaged effort is to develop interventions to reduce exposures and health impacts of contaminants in Yuma populations.
   Methods: All participants completed the informed consent process, which included information on the purpose of the study, a request for access to health histories and medical records, and interviews. The interview included questions related to (1) demographics, (2) social determinants of health, (3) health screening, (4) occupational and environmental exposures to perchlorate and pesticides, and (5) access to health services. Each participant provided a hair sample for quantifying the metals used in pesticides, urine sample for perchlorate quantification, and blood sample for endocrine assays. Modeling will examine the relationships between the concentrations of contaminants and hormones, demographics and social determinants of health, and health status of the study population, including health markers known to be impacted by perchlorate and pesticides.
   Results: We recruited 323 adults residing in Yuma County during a 1-year pilot/feasibility study. Among these, 147 residents were patients from either YRMC or RCBH with a primary diagnosis of thyroid disease, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroid cancer, or goiter. The remaining 176 participants were from the general population but with no history of thyroid disorder. The pilot study confirmed the feasibility of using the identified community-engaged protocol to recruit, consent, and collect data from a difficult-to-access, vulnerable population. The demographics of the pilot study population and positive feedback on the success of the community-engaged approach indicate that the project can be scaled up to a broader study with replicable population health findings.
   Conclusions: Using a community-engaged approach, the research protocol provided substantial evidence regarding the effectiveness of designing and implementing culturally relevant recruitment and dissemination processes that combine laboratory findings and public health information. Future findings will elucidate the mechanisms of toxicity and the population health effects of the contaminants of concern, as well as provide a new animal model to develop precision medicine capabilities for the population.

AB  - The organophosphate flame retardant, tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), is ubiquitous in environmental matrices; however, there is a paucity of information concerning its systemic toxicity. Herein, we investigated the effects of TCPP exposure on zebrafish neurodevelopment and swimming behavior to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity. Under TCPP gradient concentration exposure, the hatching rates were declined by up to 33.3% in 72 hpf, and the malformation rates increased from 15% to 50%. Meanwhile, TCPP led to abnormal behaviors including decreased locomotive activity in the dark and slow/insensitive responses to sound and light stimulation of larvae. TCPP caused excessive apoptosis and ROS accumulation in early embryonic development, with hair cell defects and structural deformity of neuromast. Abnormal expression of neurodevelopment (pax6a, nova1, sox11b, syn2a, foxo3a and robo2) and apoptosis-related genes (baxa, bcl2a and casp8) revealed molecular mechanisms regarding abnormal behavioral and phenotypic symptoms. Chronic TCPP exposure led to anxiety-like behavior and excessive panic, lower capacity for discrimination and risk avoidance, and conditioned place preference in adults. Social interaction tests demonstrated that long-term TCPP stress resulted in unsociable, eccentric, lonely and silent behaviors in adults. Zebrafish memory and cognitive function were severely reduced as concluded fromT-maze tests. Potential mechanisms triggering behavioral abnormality were attributed to histopathological injury of diencephalon, abnormal changes in nerve-related genes at transcription and expression levels, and inhibited activity of AChE by TCPP stress. These findings provide an important reference for risk assessment and early warning to TCPP exposure, and offer insights for prevention/mitigation of pollutant-induced nervous system diseases.

AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the families Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae are effective biocontrol agents against a number of important soil insect pests and are safe to vertebrates, plants and other non-target organisms with no negative effects on the environment. They are associated with mutualistic bacteria in the genus Xenorhabdus for Steinernematidae and Photorhabdus for Heterorhabditidae and are often referred to as the nematode/bacterium complex. The natural habitat of EPNs is the soil where the third-stage infective juveniles (IJs), the only free-living stage, can infect an array of insect hosts. However, the survival of the IJs is affected by various abiotic (i.e., temperature, moisture, soil texture, soil salinity, UV light, oxygen, and pH) and biotic (i.e., natural enemies, omnivores, scavengers, competitors, and plants) factors in the soil. In this review, we summarize the impact of the biotic factors, especially natural enemies, omnivores, scavengers, and competitors against EPNs and conclude that the major predators of the IJs appear to be nematophagous fungi, mites, and collembolans. Omnivores and scavengers, particularly, mites, collembolans, ants and birds, feeding on EPNkilled insects appear to be the major mortality factors on the developing nematodes especially of insects that are 2 days or less post infection. In addition, we discuss the defense mechanisms of EPN IJs against nematophagous fungi, and the protection of the nematode-killed insects by production of the scavenger deterrent factor produced by the mutualistic bacteria against omnivores and scavengers. By understanding the interactions between EPNs and their antagonists we can improve and increase the successful use of EPNs in biological control programs.

AB  - Firemaster 550 (FM550) is a flame retardant (FR) mixture that has become one of the most commonly used FRs in household items such as foam-based furniture and baby products. Because this mixture readily leaches from products, contamination of the environment and human tissues is widespread. Prior work by us and others has reported sex-specific behavioral deficits in rodents and zebrafish following early life exposure. In an effort to understand the mechanisms by which these behavioral effects occur, here we explored the effects of its constituents on behavioral outcomes previously shown to be altered by developmental FM550 exposure. The FM550 commercial mixture is composed of two brominated compounds (BFR) and two organophosphate compounds (OPFRs) at almost equivalent proportions. Both the BFR and the OPFR components are differentially metabolized and structurally distinct, but similar to known neurotoxicants. Here we examined adult Wistar rat offspring socioemotional behaviors following perinatal exposure (oral, to the dam) to vehicle, 2000 mu g/day FM550, 1000 mu g/day BFR or 1000 mu g/day OPFR from gestation day 0 to weaning. Beginning on postnatal day 65 offspring from all groups were subjected to a series of behavioral tasks including open field, elevated plus maze, marble burying, social interaction tests, and running wheel. Effects were exposure-, sex- and task-specific, with BFR exposure resulting in the most consistent behavioral deficits. Overall, exposed females showed more deficits compared to males across all dose groups and tasks. These findings help elucidate how different classes of flame retardants, independently and as a mixture, contribute to sex-specific behavioral effects of exposure.

AB  - Host plant resistance is one of the most promising alternatives to insecticides to manage the shoot fly,Atherigona naqviiSteyskal, which is a major biotic constraint to spring sown maize in northern India. In present studies, Nineteen maize inbreds selected from diverse sources were characterized for resistance traits against shoot fly under its natural infestation using moistened fishmeal. Though the antixenosis to shoot fly for oviposition was not observed in the test genotypes. But, the presence of significant variation in the deadhearts incidence revealed the existence of relative amount of resistance among the test genotypes. The Tolerance (measured in the terms of less proportion of deadhearts out of total shoot fly incidence (leaf injury + deadhearts)) and Antibiosis (in terms of larval and pupal weight, duration and survival) were recognized as key mechanisms of this resistance. Tolerance to shoot fly was significantly more in resistant inbreds, SO1SHYQBBB13B, HK12-6-2-4, DMSC 28, CM 143 and Winpop 8 (29.46-36.56%) in comparison to the susceptible genotypes SE 563 and LM 16 (46.31-47.44%). The correlation and stepwise regression analyses revealed that the more seedling vigor, less leaf area, less number of leaves and thin stem had significant impact on the shoot fly deadhearts incidence and provided resistance against this pest. The total soluble sugars (TSS), proteins and amino acids were significantly higher in the susceptible inbreds; whereas, total phenols and tannins; and activities of defensive enzymes viz. phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were significantly higher in resistant inbreds. Further, the stepwise regression revealed that the larval period, per cent pupation, pupal weight female, pupal weight male and adult emergence of shoot fly were significantly influenced by PAL activity, which explained 71.5, 82.9, 47.0, 29.8 and 39.9% of their total variation, respectively. PPO activity significantly influenced the pupal period (R-2 = 59.7%) whereas, the larval weight was significantly influenced by amino acids (R-2 = 56.9%), proteins (R-2 = 10.2%) and TSS (R-2 = 7.7%). So, the correlation and regression analyses revealed that these physico-chemical characters of the maize inbreds can be utilized as reliable markers traits to identify resistant sources to develop shoot fly resistant maize hybrids.

AB  - Agricultural pests cause huge loss to agricultural production. Their control using biopesticides is gaining importance. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are most promising biopesticides in agriculture. EPN like other biopesticides has a very specific action on one species or related species as against chemical insecticides. In addition, the median lethal time for EPNs is also lower. Hence there is a need for novel virulent EPN which is effective against wide range of insects and has a low median lethal dose. In this study, we isolated different strains of EPN using modified insect bait method from 10 different soil samples. Six nematode strains were isolated and tested for pathogenicity againstSpodoptera lituraegg, larvae, and pupae. Agricultural corn field (AC) strain showed very high virulence against other strains. AC strain 18S rDNA sequencing was done and phylogenetic tree constructed to evaluate its relatedness to other species. The AC strains were identified asPanagrolaimusspp. and the sequence was submitted to Genbank. This species was found to be very effective against all the developmental stages ofS. litura

AB  - Aedes aegypti, is a major vector of several human diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika virus. Multiple strategies are adopted for its control including eradication of mosquito breeding sites by improving water storage and solid waste disposal as well as treating breeding sites with chemical insecticides. However, continuous use of insecticides has resulted in development of insecticide resistance inAe. aegypti. This study explores the potential biocontrol ofAe. aegyptiby the use of commercial entomopathogenic nematodes, namelyHeterorhabditis bacteriophora,H. downesi,H. megidis,Steinernema carpocapsae,S. feltiaeandS. kraussei. The pathogenic effect of nematodes (concentrations 10, 250, 500 and 1,000 infective juveniles (IJs)) was assessed against third instarAe. aegyptiin multi-well culture plates for 3 days. The evaluated nematode species were pathogenic toAe. aegypti, however, their virulence varied significantly.Heterorhabditis bacteriophoraandS. carpocapsaewere most virulent causing 90-100% mortality at 100 IJs per larva, whereasH. megidisandS. krausseishowed least virulence causing 40-60% mortality.Heterorhabditis downesiandS. feltiaehad intermediate virulence.Third instarAe. aegyptiindiscriminately overfeed nematodes triggering melanisation but ingested nematodes overcome the defence system resulting in killing the larvae and reproduced within them. Some of the nematodes were melanised, suggesting a strong humoral defence response byAedes, nevertheless, with variable degree of melanisation. The melanisation did not stop nematode from multiplying and killingAedeslarvae and thus, they have potential to be developed into a novel strategy forAe. aegypticontrol.

AB  - A previous study reported that exposure to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) could promote the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in female HCC model zebrafish. Due to the existence of gender disparity in the development of HCC between females and males, whether the promotion effect of TDCIPP still exists in male HCC model zebrafish remains unclear. In this study, Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2; TRE2:EGFP-kras(G12v)), referred as kras transgenic zebrafish which was shown to be an inducible liver tumor model, was applied as experimental model to assess the promotion potential of TDCIPP for HCC in males. In brief, kras males were exposed to 20 mg/L doxycycline (DOX), 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP and a binary mixture of 20 mg/L DOX with 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP, and after exposure liver size, histopathology and transcriptional profiles of liver from these treatments were examined. With the involvement of TDCIPP, the liver size was significantly increased and the lesion of hepatocyte became more aggressive. Furthermore, expressions of genes involved in DNA replication and inflammatory response were simultaneously up-regulated in the treatment of TDCIPP compared with the solvent control and in the treatment of the binary mixture of the two chemicals compared to the single DOX treatment. Overall, our results suggested that TDCIPP had promotion effect on the progression of liver tumor in kras males.

AB  - Following a series of mass-bleaching events that have seriously degraded coral reefs, notably the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, a common narrative is now dominating the discourse, according to which "the only sure way to save the world's coral reefs is climate change mitigation". However, climate change is not a sole stressor. Most coral reefs around the world are threatened by a myriad of local stressors, including overfishing, destructive fishing, untreated sewage, agriculture effluents (nutrients and pesticides), and siltation due to deforestation. Reefs will not survive the severe effects of this plethora of stressors while waiting until we mitigate climate change. In order to safeguard reefs, we need to adopt a new narrative-"there are diverse ways in which we can improve the chances of saving coral reefs"-by acting now to: (i) improve their local protection and marine protected area networks, (ii) alleviate their critical local stressors, (iii) restore degraded and damaged reefs, and (iv) promote reef resilience and adaptation (e.g. adaptation networks, assisted evolution) to the changing conditions, notably climate change effects. It is time for us to move on from the impractical goals of the climate change narrative ("interventions beyond our field of expertise") to building up resilience and adaptation of social-ecological systems of coral reefs.

AB  - The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens makes an urgent need for discovering novel antimicrobial agents as alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Towards this end, we designed and synthesized a synthetic peptide of 23 amino acids (AAs) ((1)GWLIRGAIHAGKAIHGLIHRRRH23) from a defense protein 3 cDNA sequence of Octopus minor. The sequence of the peptide, which was named Octominin, had characteristic features of known antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as a positive charge (+5), high hydrophobic residue ratio (43%), and 1.86 kcal/mol of Boman index. Octominin was predicted to have an alpha-helix secondary structure. The synthesized Octominin was 2625.2 Da with 92.5% purity. The peptide showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of 50 and 200 mu g/mL, respectively, against Candida albicans. Field emission scanning electron microscopy observation confirmed that Octominin caused ultrastructural cell wall deformities in C. albicans. In addition, propidium iodide penetrated the Octominin-treated C. albicans cells, further demonstrating loss of cell membrane integrity that caused cell death at both MIC and MFC. Octominin treatment increased the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and decreased cell viability in a concentration dependent manner. Cytotoxicity assays revealed no significant influence of Octominin on the viability of human embryonic kidney 293T cell line, with over 95% live cells in the Octominin-treated group observed up to 100 mu g/mL. Moreover, we confirmed the antifungal action of Octominin in vivo using a zebrafish experimental infection model. Overall, our results demonstrate the Octominin is a lead compound for further studies, which exerts its effects by inducing cell wall damage, causing loss of cell membrane integrity, and elevating oxidative stress.

AB  - California's Central Coast rose to national food safety prominence following a deadly 2006 outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 that was traced to spinach grown in this intensive agricultural region. Since then, private food safety protocols and subsequent public regulations targeting farm-level practices have developed extensively, aiming to avert future foodborne illness crises. However, amidst sweeping reforms in prescribed best practices for food safety, growers were pressured to take precautionary approaches to control pathogenic contamination-suppressing wildlife near fields, removing habitat, restricting biological soil amendments (e.g., compost, manure), and most recently, chemically treating irrigation water-that may generate negative unintended consequences for environmental and social sustainability. We synthesize socio-ecological data from three qualitative, interview-based studies to examine grower perceptions and experiences of food safety reforms in California's Central Coast region and explore the effects of food safety regulations on environmental and socio-economic sustainability. We identify three disjunctures between food safety requirements and farming realities in practice: (1) Growers perceive that some food safety practices legitimately mitigate risk, while others fail to reduce or even accentuate risk; (2) Food safety requirements can create contradictions in the co-management of food safety and environmental sustainability; and (3) Food safety requirements may foster impediments to regional food systems socioeconomic sustainability. We argue that these disjunctures warrant changes in food safety policy, implementation, and/or food safety education. We provide concrete suggestions for shifting the focus of food safety reform away from the narrow surveillance of individual grower compliance and toward an integrated perspective on regional risk, vulnerability, and resilience.

AB  - Invasive insect species can act as a plague across the globe, capable of vast expansion and rapid, proliferate reproduction.The spread of pathogens of serious diseases such as malaria and Zika virus and damages to agricultural crops number some of the afflictions invasive insects provide to humans alone. Additionally, an escape from predators can fail to keep invasive insects in check, providing potential threats such as extra resource competition to native species when insects invade. A variety of methods are employed to combat these invasive species, each with their own varying levels of success. Here, we explore the more traditional methods of invasive insect pest control, such as pesticides and biological control. In lieu of several unintended consequences resulting from such practices, we suggest some should be abandoned. We evaluate the potential of new techniques, in particular, those with a genetic component, regarding the costs, benefits and possible consequences of implementing them. And finally, we consider which techniques should be the focus of future research, if we truly wish to manage or even eradicate invasive insects in their introduced lands.

AB  - Sicyos angulatus may become an extremely dangerous invasive plant depending on its ability to naturalize and outcompete other species. To further understand the adaptive strategies of structures that could enhance its competitiveness, field surveys and experimental studies were conducted in plant communities where invasion may occur. The results showed that multistage branches of tendrils ensured that the plants could climb higher to strive for better photosynthetic opportunities. The single fleshy fruit of the infructescence was carpeted with slender white spines on which dense barbs were arranged, which could defend fruits against herbivores and contributed to long-distance dispersal. There would be beaklike lignified thorn forming to continue spreading when most of the barbed spines fell off during the fruit season. Rootstock was found in this herbaceous vine, which could accumulate various storage substances during development and helped the plants spread in harsh conditions. Moreover, the discovery of ants as new pollinators enriched the pollination system of S. angulatus, which greatly enhanced pollination efficiency. Above all, we conclude that this species has diverse adaptive strategies and a strong invasive capacity. It is urgent to find some way to slow or even stop its invasion effectively.

AB  - Extracts of Matricaria chamomilla, Maytenus ilicifolia and Echinodorus grandiflorus have been integrated as viable pest management strategy for controlling bronze bug Thaumastocoris peregrinus (Hemipetra: Thaumastocoridae) due to their insecticidal activities. However, the side effects of these extracts on Cleruchoides noackae (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae), the main biological control agent against the bronze bug of eucalyptus, have never been studied. The objective of this study was to verify the effect of 5% aqueous extracts of M. chamomilla, M. ilicifolia and E. grandiflorus on C. noackae. Tests with eggs treated before being offered to the parasitoid female (pre-parasitism) and tests on which the eggs were treated 1 and 7days after the female had performed oviposition (post-parasitism) were carried out. There was no difference between the treatments and the control group regarding parasitoid emergence in none of the tests. Although, there was increase in egg viability and number of emerged parasitoids when comparing the eggs treated 1 and 7days after parasitism for all treatments. In conclusion, none of the plant extracts caused any harmful effect on C. noackae under lab conditions, indicating they may be an environment-friendly option to control the bronze bug of eucalyptus.

AB  - CD44 gene is a cell surface receptor which undergoes complex alternative splicing and extensive post-translational modifications. Although many studies have showed that CD44 is involved in the process of host defense, the function of piscine CD44 in antibacterial or antiviral defense response remains unclear. In the present study, we report the functional characterization of zebrafish CD44c, which is more similar to CD44b antigen isoforms rather than CD44a based on amino acid composition and phylogenetic analysis. The expression of zebrafish CD44c was inducible in response to bacterial and viral infections. During SVCV infection, the in vivo studies revealed that CD44c overexpression led to the increased virus loads and decreased survival rate. The attenuated response by zebrafish CD44c in response to SVCV infection were characterized by the impaired production of inflammatory cytokines and the impaired expressions of IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes, MHC class I and II genes. During Edwardsiella piscicida infection, the overexpression of zebrafish CD44c facilitated bacterial growth and dissemination, but did not impact on larvae survival. The detrimental role of CD44c in host defense against E. piscicida infection was supported by a decreased production of several antibacterial molecules including defbl2, defbl3, NK-lysin and RNase3. All together, these results firstly demonstrate the negative regulation of piscine CD44c in viral and bacterial infection.

AB  - Objective: To relate the socio-demographic profile with access to health services of the population living in environmentally degraded areas in an estuary region. Study design: A sectional field study of 8819 people, evaluating three contaminated areas of Sao Vicente. Methods: Households were divided by studied area. A structured and pre-tested questionnaire was applied to obtain the data. A probabilistic sample was used. The prevalence of each of the outcomes of interest by area was calculated. To verify the existence of an association between the outcomes of interest and other variables (qualitative), by area, a descriptive analysis and to compare percentages and a comparison test was used between two proportions, a Chi-square test and/or a Fisher's exact test and a Kruska-wallis and Dunn multiple comparison were used as well. The significance level was 5%. Results: Most residents (94%) reported the use of public health services at least once a year (p < 0.001), mainly through the Basic Health Units (BHU) (p < 0.001). Most of the studied population (65%) did not have private health insurance and their schooling was basically restricted to primary education (p < 0.001). The predominant family income (70%) in the three areas was between one and five minimum wages (p < 0.001), with a higher incidence of people receiving one to three minimum wages at the time. The demand for health services was not associated with education or income. Conclusion: The population of the regions analysed heavily rely on the Unified Health System - SUS, but there was no association between income and frequency of health services and there was also no association between education and use of health services.

AB  - Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR), caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, is one of the most important diseases of soybean. Disease management is complicated by the long-term survival of sclerotia in the soil and the absence of resistance in elite, commercial cultivars. Furthermore, the lifecycle of S. sclerotiorum in soybean fields is highly dependent on weather conditions, leading to a highly sporadic occurrence of the disease over seasons and an aggregated distribution within fields. Management relies on a multi-pronged approach of combining partially resistant cultivars with cultural practices, such as altering row spacing and planting population, along with chemical control. These control measures are constrained by economic trade-offs, incomplete efficacy of chemicals, and a lack of understanding of application timing for fungicides. Newer tools have been developed to improve management, such as disease prediction models that can assist farmers in making decisions about fungicide application. This review aims to introduce the Sclerotinia pathosystem in soybean, while covering the complicated biology of S. sclerotiorum that leads to the need for integrated management by soybean farmers.

AB  - Malaria is a serious global health challenge, and it has infected millions of people worldwide. There is an urgent need for new antimalarial drugs and drug targets for both prophylaxis and chemotherapy. In the present study, we biosynthesized TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) using the Momordica charantia leaf aqueous extract as a reducing and stabilizing agent. TiO2 NPs were characterized by UV, XRD, FTIR, HRTEM, EDX, DLS and Zeta-potential. The maximum activity of mosquitocidal was observed in the synthesized TiO2 NPs against Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae and pupae, LC50 were 2.50 mg/l (I instar), 2.86 mg/l (II), 3.29 mg/l (III), 3.43 mg/l (IV), and 5.04 mg/l (pupa). The antimalarial activity of M. charantia leaf aqueous extract and TiO2 NPs were evaluated against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ sensitive (CQ-s) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. IC50 of M. charantia leaf aqueous extract were 83.64 mg/ml (CQ-s) and 88.14 mg/ml (CQ-r). Synthesized TiO2 NPs achieved IC50 of 53.42 mg/ml (CQ-s) and 59.71 mg/ml (CQ-r). The TiO2 NPs did not exhibit any noticeable toxicity on Poecilia reticulata after 24 h of exposure. Overall, our results suggest that the synthesized TiO2 NPs may be employed to develop newer and safer agents for malaria control.

AB  - Background: Vultures have adapted the remarkable ability to feed on carcasses that may contain microorganisms that would be pathogenic to most other animals. The holobiont concept suggests that the genetic basis of such adaptation may not only lie within their genomes, but additionally in their associated microbes. To explore this, we generated shotgun DNA sequencing datasets of the facial skin and large intestine microbiomes of the black vulture (Coragyps atratus) and the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura). We characterized the functional potential and taxonomic diversity of their microbiomes, the potential pathogenic challenges confronted by vultures, and the microbial taxa and genes that could play a protective role on the facial skin and in the gut.
   Results: We found microbial taxa and genes involved in diseases, such as dermatitis and pneumonia (more abundant on the facial skin), and gas gangrene and food poisoning (more abundant in the gut). Interestingly, we found taxa and functions with potential for playing beneficial roles, such as antilisterial bacteria in the gut, and genes for the production of antiparasitics and insecticides on the facial skin. Based on the identified phages, we suggest that phages aid in the control and possibly elimination, as in phage therapy, of microbes reported as pathogenic to a variety of species. Interestingly, we identified Adineta vaga in the gut, an invertebrate that feeds on dead bacteria and protozoans, suggesting a defensive predatory mechanism. Finally, we suggest a colonization resistance role through biofilm formation played by Fusobacteria and Clostridia in the gut.
   Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of complementing genomic analyses with metagenomics in order to obtain a clearer understanding of the host-microbial alliance and show the importance of microbiome-mediated health protection for adaptation to extreme diets, such as scavenging.

AB  - Plants genetically modified to produce insecticidal toxins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) have been extensively used to manage the western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in the United States. Evolution of WCR resistance to Bt toxins has forced the consideration of alternative pest management and improved insect resistance management. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), obligate insect parasites, are attracted toward volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by maize roots afterWCR herbivory.The production of VOCs of two types of Bt maize (MON88017 and MIR604) and their near-isolines was evaluated after induction with Bt-susceptible and resistantWCR.The attraction of EPNs toward the Bt hybrids was tested in the laboratory and the field. Bt hybrids emitted VOCs when induced by Bt-resistant insects whereas induction by Bt-susceptible WCR did not elicit a plant response. Survival of Bt-resistant WCR was lower on the hybrid attracting EPNs and similar to the survival of Bt-susceptible WCR without EPNs. This trade-off of Bt-resistance is defined here as an induced fitness cost, and offers a viable tool to management of Bt-resistant WCR.

AB  - An interlaboratory comparison (ILC) was organized as a measure of the analytical competency in the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry quantification of okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1) in scallop midgut gland samples. The test sample was prepared using boiled midgut glands of naturally contaminated scallops with DTX1 and its esters by spiking with OA, and homogeneity and stability of this test sample was assessed to be appropriate. Twenty laboratories participated in the ILC based on the Japanese official testing method; they submitted two sets of analytical concentrations of target analytes along with the details of their analytical protocols. For assessing these data, assigned values were established from another ILC where ten participants quantified the target analytes by the standard addition method. The mean analytical results of the former ILC showed good agreement with the assigned values, and the corresponding relative reproducibility standard deviations met the criterion of CODEX STAN 292. Meanwhile, the results of more than half of the participants were out of the uncertainty range of the assigned values; these participants were encouraged to investigate their protocols to improve their analytical capability.

AB  - Neutrophils and macrophages provide the first line of cellular defence against pathogens once physical barriers are breached, but can play very different roles for each specific pathogen. This is particularly so for fungal pathogens, which can occupy several niches in the host. We developed an infection model of talaromycosis in zebrafish embryos with the thermally-dimorphic intracellular fungal pathogen Talaromyces marneffei and used it to define different roles of neutrophils and macrophages in infection establishment. This system models opportunistic human infection prevalent in HIV-infected patients, as zebrafish embryos have intact innate immunity but, like HIV-infected talaromycosis patients, lack a functional adaptive immune system. Importantly, this new talaromycosis model permits thermal shifts not possible in mammalian models, which we show does not significantly impact on leukocyte migration, phagocytosis and function in an established Aspergillus fumigatus model. Furthermore, the optical transparency of zebrafish embryos facilitates imaging of leukocyte/pathogen interactions in vivo. Following parenteral inoculation, T. marneffei conidia were phagocytosed by both neutrophils and macrophages. Within these different leukocytes, intracellular fungal form varied, indicating that triggers in the intracellular milieu can override thermal morphological determinants. As in human talaromycosis, conidia were predominantly phagocytosed by macrophages rather than neutrophils. Macrophages provided an intracellular niche that supported yeast morphology. Despite their minor role in T. marneffei conidial phagocytosis, neutrophil numbers increased during infection from a protective CSF3-dependent granulopoietic response. By perturbing the relative abundance of neutrophils and macrophages during conidial inoculation, we demonstrate that the macrophage intracellular niche favours infection establishment by protecting conidia from a myeloperoxidase-dependent neutrophil fungicidal activity. These studies provide a new in vivo model of talaromycosis with several advantages over previous models. Our findings demonstrate that limiting T. marneffei's opportunity for macrophage parasitism and thereby enhancing this pathogen's exposure to effective neutrophil fungicidal mechanisms may represent a novel host-directed therapeutic opportunity.

AB  - The inhibitory potential of silicon (Si) against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the causal agent of postharvest carrot rot was investigated under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and possible modes of action were evaluated. Silicon at the concentration of 10 mM strongly decreased the mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum by 92.2% with inhibition of sclerotia formation by 76.3%. Myceliogenic and carpogenic germination of S. sclerotiorum sclerotia were inhibited by 89.1 and 78.9%, respectively, at the same concentration. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values were 12 and 30 mM, respectively. Cell membrane permeability and lipid peroxidation of S. sclerotiorum mycelia were increased with Si treatment. Silicon at 10 mM significantly decrease the content of oxalic acid in S. sclerotiorum mycelia compared to the control. Application of silicon at 10 mM reduced the incidence of sclerotinia rot in carrot roots by 60.6% with 40 mm lesion length. Silicon treatment enhanced the activities of peroxidase (POD), polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in carrot roots inoculated with S. sclerotiorum. These results confirm that silicon might applied as an alternative tool to chemical fungicides for controlling sclerotinia rot of carrot during storage and to promote the defense response in carrot.

AB  - Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is a globally significant pest of Brassicaceae crops that has attracted enormous research investment. It is typical of many agricultural pests, with insecticides remaining the most common method of control, despite frequent cases of resistance in pest populations and the potential for other management options such as natural enemies to provide suppression. Here we review scope to make better use of neglected natural enemy taxa and integrate recent work on landscape ecology to identify opportunities for more effective pest suppression. Our main findings are as follows: (1) relatively neglected taxa of natural enemies, especially predators and entomopathogens, are now attracting growing levels of research interest, although parasitoids remain most frequently used and researched; (2) knowledge of the spatio-temporal dynamics of populations at the landscape scale have advanced rapidly in the last decade; (3) ecological insights open new possibilities for exploiting spatial heterogeneity at scales larger than individual fields and even farms that influence pests and their natural enemies; (4) there is evidence for landscapes that selectively favor particular guilds and this knowledge could be developed to favor targeted natural enemies over pests in focal crops; and (5) landscape-scale effects can even over-ride field-scale management practices. The significance of these advances is that future management of diamondback moth and similar pests will benefit from a move away from reliance on the use of particular species of biological control agents, especially exotic parasitoids, and strategies that depend on use of broad-spectrum insecticides. Together with this move, we call for greater use of area-wide management that exploits the potential of landscapes to promote diverse assemblages of natural enemy species.

TI  - PRESERVATION AND EVALUATION OF BIODIVERSITY: THE CONCEPT OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF FAUNA
T2  - ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF FAUNA OF SERBIA
LA  - Russian
CP  - Scientific Meeting on Ecological and Economic Significance of Fauna of Serbia
AB  - The concept of "biodiversity preservation" represents one of the key paradigms of modern biological science but at the same time a specific socioeconomic and political element in perceiving and planning the development of society at the end of the 20th and beginning of 21st century. Preservation and evaluation of biological diversity components in various spatial scales (from global to local levels), becomes an important element of strategic documents and legislation in the domain of environmental protection, economic development, well-being of humanity, and etc. (for example: Millennium development goals, Sustainable development strategy). After the Convention on Biological Diversity entered into force, the concept of biodiversity which, in simplified words, represents "universality and the most diverse variability aspects of life on planet Earth", was finally put into use in 1992. By ratifying the Convention on Biological Diversity all signatory states took the obligation to bring legal acts and establish necessary activities regarding the protection and evaluation of biodiversity. During the past two decades the initial concepts from the Convention have been progressively upgraded which facilitates the use of complex tasks of preserving biodiversity and sustainable use of biological resources through a series of important complementary strategic and operational documents.
   Among the most important newly established concepts is defining Ecosystem services as the key theoretical approach and a practical mechanism for comprehensive evaluation of real importance of biodiversity preservation for mankind existence, ie. well-being which every human society has (or could have) in various sectors and aspects of life. This concept prioritizes ecosystem approach and in that way integrates a series of questions which weren't resolved in an adequately clear way in the Convention or other documents which are related to the preservation and protection of biodiversity. The application of ecosystem services concept offers a series of operational solutions for connecting special (to a lesser extent genetic) diversity with the functioning of the ecosystem. Even more important is the contribution to methodology of economic, as well as "immaterial" evaluation of various elements and processes in ecosystems, which, in a direct or an indirect way, contribute to the concrete and measurable parameters of economic growth, social wealth, goods and benefits that people have from preserved and functional ecosystems, populations or biodiversity in general. Consequently, this approach also enables an economic valorization of losses which occur or are expected to occur in case of degradation of biodiversity components.
   Comprehensive classification and fundamental elaboration of the concepts and methods of ecosystem services quantification was realized within the mega-study "Millennium Ecosystem Assessment" (2001-2005).
   Ecosystem services were, in simplified words, defines as "benefits that people have from the ecosystem", and were grouped in: services of supplying/providing, regulation, cultural and supporting services. With later elaboration of classification the methodology of economic valorization was significantly improved, primarily through international iniciatives "The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity - TEEB) and "Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services - CICES). The most significant specific application of this approach in European conditions is realized through the "Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services - MAES initiative, which represents one of the key contributions to the "European Union Biodiversity Strategy 2020", ie., the obligation of all members through the 2010-2020 decade.
   In our national legislative, as in the biggest part of activities realized by line ministries during the past two decades, the concept of ecosystem services was represented in very small amounts, ie. in disproportion with the importance it has had in world and Europe after 2005 (with the exception of the National strategy for sustainable use of natural resources and goods, 2012). The basic approach to economic valorization of biodiversity has been connected to the term "biological resources" (including genetic resources), which came from direct elaboration of these concepts defined in the 1992 Convention. This paper will show the basic elements of mentioned concepts and programs, their connection to the so far practice in Serbia, and the possibilities and needs for implementing the newest international approaches into the valorization of fauna, as a segment of Serbian biodiversity, as well as big problems which have been noticed in the so far practice in biological resources usage (uncontrollable and law prohibited fishery, excessive hunting, destruction of habitats, excessive use of pesticides in agriculture, pollution, unplanned urbanization with area conversion, etc.). An insufficient connection of line ministries in achieving biodiversity protection and misunderstanding and/or ignoring the significance of ecosystem services for society have also been highlighted.

KW  - Insect repellent
AB  - Purpose - The paper focused onto the development of microcapsules by using two essential oils. It proposes the uses of eucalyptus oil and cedarwood oil as a natural insecticide. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the application of developed microcapsules to impart insect repellency on textile substrate.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an experimental study using two essential oils and gum in formations of microcapsules through a simple coaseravtion encapsulation technique. The developed solution was analyzed, including confirmation of size and structure through. Application of developed finish on substrate was also undertaken to prove better ability as repellent fabric.
   Findings - The paper highlights useful invention of microencapsulated fabric developed with the combination of gum acacia and eucalyptus oil as core and shell material. The developed fabric has better ability to repel silverfish as compared to microencapsulated fabric developed with gum acacia (shell) and cedarwood oil (core).
   Research limitations/implications - Due to the lack of time and less availability of essential oils, only two oils were used to test the insect repellent behavior.
   Practical implications - This paper fulfills an identified need, it includes implications for the development of a very useful natural insecticide to repel silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) insect. This insect is a very common problem found in cloth wardrobes and bookshelves; it mainly attacks the fabric with cellulosic content and starch.
   Social implications - Society will get major benefit of using these microencapsulated finished fabrics, which repel silverfish from their home and keep their clothing and books safe for longer period. The natural fragrance and medicinal benefits of these essential oils can never be ignored.
   Originality/value - This study sets a new approach to repel insects like silverfish from the bookshelves and clothing wardrobes. A layer of insect repellent microencapsulated finished fabric can be added in these shelves and wardrobes. It is an eco-friendly approach of using natural essential oils instead of chemical insecticides.

AB  - Plant defense stimulators (PDSs) rely on the activation of plant innate immunity in order to protect crops against various pests. These molecules are thought to be a safer alternative to classical plant protection products. Given that innate immune systems share common features in plants and vertebrates, PDS can potentially cross-react with innate immunity of non-target organisms. To test this hypothesis, we studied effects of the commercial PDS Stifenia (FEN560), which is composed of crushed fenugreek seeds. We tested various concentrations of Stifenia (0.03-1 mg mL-1) on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and checked, 20 h later, cell metabolic activity (MA) using XTT assay, cell death by flow cytometry analysis, and IL-1 beta inflammatory cytokine released in the culture medium using ELISA. Stifenia induced a general decrease of the cell MA, which was concomitant with a dose-dependent release of IL-1 beta. Our results highlight the activation of human immune cells. The inflammatory effect of Stifenia was partially inhibited by pan-caspase inhibitor. Accordingly, Stifenia induced the release of p20 caspase-1 fragment into the culture medium suggesting the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, we observed that Stifenia can induce cell death. We also tested the effect of Stifenia on Zebrafish larvae. After 24 h of exposure, Stifenia induced a dose-dependent IL-1 beta and TNF alpha gene expression. The human-cell-based approach developed in this work revealed a high sensitivity concerning inflammatory properties of a plant protection product. These tests could be routinely used to screen the potential adverse effects of this type of compounds. Finally, our results suggest a potential danger of using extensively certain PDS for crop protection.

AB  - This study describes the mortality effects of the culture broth of Xenorhabdus bovienii and its aqueous and organic extracts on Pieris brassicae larvae. All the treatments had insecticidal activities when injected into the haemocoel. The culture broth of bacteria and its aqueous extracts exhibited more insecticidal activity. The results showed the immune response of P. brassicae exposed to Steinernema feltiae, its symbiont bacteria, X. bovienii, and aqueous and organic extracts of bacteria. Both cellular and humoral responses were investigated. After infection of the larvae of P. brassicae with S. feltiae, the total number of haemocytes quickly increased. A reduction in the number of haemocytes was observed over post-injection time. In addition, plasmatocytes and granulocytes showed increased frequency and significant changes when compared to other haemocytes in responding to entomopathogenic nematode injection. Steinernema feltiae increased phenoloxidase activity but 3 h post-injection the concentration gradually decreased. However, a reduction in phenoloxidase activity was observed when the larvae were infected with bacteria or their aqueous and organic extracts. This study showed that both living and heat-killed bacteria have suppression effects on phenoloxidase activity. The lysozyme concentration increased in P. brassicae larvae when they were exposed to living and heat-killed X. bovienii. No suppression effect of the bacteria was detected on lysozyme.

AB  - To understand the potentially adverse effects of human exposure to tris (1, 3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, combined transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches were employed to investigate the molecular responses of two human cell lines exposed to different concentrations of TDCIPP. Comparative analyses of transcriptional and metabolic profiles of HepG2/C3A and A549 cells were performed after exposure to 1, 10 and 100 M TDCIPP for 24 and 72 h. Stress responses (e.g. xenobiotic metabolism and ABC transporter pathways) were observed at the transcriptional level after 24-h exposure to a sub-cytotoxic concentration (10 M). Transcription of an energy metabolism-related pathway (oxidative phosphorylation) was down-regulated more severely at 100 M TDCIPP exposure, accompanied by the suppression of pathways relevant to cell proliferation (e.g. cell cycle and DNA replication), while no significant cytotoxic effects were observed. Functional metabolic changes were observed after 72 h in HepG2/C3A cells exposed to 100 M TDCIPP that corresponded to changes detected at the transcriptional level after 24 h. Taken together, defensive responses to chemical exposure and energy-related changes both precede the cytotoxic effects of TDCIPP in HepG2/C3A cells. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objective: to describe the main strategies to control Aedes aegypti, with emphasis on promising technological innovations for use in Brazil. Methods: this study is a non-systematic review of the literature. Results: several technologies have been developed as alternatives in the control of Ae. aegypti, using different mechanisms of action, such as selective monitoring of the infestation, social interventions, dispersing insecticides, new biological control agents and molecular techniques for population control of mosquitoes, also considering the combination between them. Evolving technologies require evaluation of the effectiveness, feasibility and costs of implementation strategies as complementary to the actions already recommended by the National Program for Dengue Control. Conclusion: the integration of different compatible and effective vector control strategies, considering the available technologies and regional characteristics, appears to be a viable method to try to reduce the infestation of mosquitoes and the incidence of arbovirus transmitted by them.

AB  - Background: The distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) through universal coverage campaigns is a widely adopted approach for the prevention of malaria at scale. While post-distribution surveys play a valuable role in determining cross-sectional levels of LLIN retention and use, as well as frequently cited reasons for non-use, few studies have explored the consistency of LLIN use over time, within the expected lifespan of the net, and the factors which may drive this.
   Methods: In this qualitative study, 74 in-depth interviews were conducted with (male) household heads and (female) caregivers of children in LLIN recipient households, as well as community health workers, in Buliisa, Hoima and Kiboga districts in Uganda, 25-29 months following a LLIN mass campaign distribution. A triangulation approach to data analysis was taken, incorporating thematic analysis, most significant change and positive deviance.
   Results: The factors found to be most influential in encouraging long-term LLIN use were positive experience of net use prior to the distribution, and appreciation or awareness of a range of benefits arising from their use, including protection from malaria as well as importantly, other health, lifestyle, social and economic benefits. Social support from within the community was also identified as an important factor in determining continued use of LLINs. Net use appeared to be more consistent amongst settled urban and rural communities, compared with fishing, pastoralist, refugee and immigrant communities.
   Conclusions: A multitude of interplaying factors encouraged consistent LLIN use in this setting. Whilst the protection of malaria remains a powerful motivator, social and behaviour change (SBC) strategies should also capitalize on the non-malaria benefits of net use that provide a long-term rationale for consistent use. Where supplies are available, SBC campaigns should promote replacement options, emphasizing ongoing net care and replacement as a household responsibility, thus reducing dependence on free distributions. The triangulation approach to qualitative data analysis enabled increased confidence in the validity of findings and an enhanced contextual understanding of the factors promoting consistent net use in mid-western Uganda. The approach should be considered when designing future studies to explore factors driving net retention and use trends.

AB  - The physiological condition and fecundity of an organism is frequently controlled by diet. As changes in environmental conditions often cause organisms to alter their foraging behavior, a comprehensive understanding of how diet influences the fitness of an individual is central to predicting the effect of environmental change on population dynamics. We experimentally manipulated the diet of the economically and ecologically important blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, to approximate the effects of a dietary shift from primarily animal to plant tissue, a phenomenon commonly documented in crabs. Crabs whose diet consisted exclusively of animal tissue had markedly lower mortality and consumed substantially more food than crabs whose diet consisted exclusively of seaweed. The quantity of food consumed had a significant positive influence on reproductive effort and long-term energy stores. Additionally, seaweed diets produced a three-fold decrease in hepatopancreas lipid content and a simultaneous two-fold increase in crab aggression when compared to an animal diet. Our results reveal that the consumption of animal tissue substantially enhanced C. sapidus fitness, and suggest that a dietary shift to plant tissue may reduce crab population growth by decreasing fecundity as well as increasing mortality. This study has implications for C. sapidus fisheries.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the selectivity of herbicides applied in post-emergence on Zoysia japonica Steud (Poaceae) and determine associations with the leaf anatomy of this grass. The experimental design was randomized blocks with four replications. The treatments were the application of the herbicides bentazon (720 g ha(-1)), nicosulfuron (50 g ha(-1)), halosulfuron (112.5 g ha(-1)), oxadiazon (875 g ha(-1)) and 2.4-D (698 g ha(-1)), plus a control treatment without herbicide application. Phytotoxicity was assessed every seven days after application (DAA) of the herbicides until the symptoms disappeared. Foliar anatomical analyses of the leaves in the collected grass were conducted until the 35th DAA. The quantitative characters of the keel and wing region of the blade of Z. japonica were assessed, as well as the biometric characters, which were submitted to an analysis of variance F test, and the averages were compared by Tukey's test at a probability of 5%. The values of the anatomical characters of the foliar blade were tested by cluster analysis. The application of herbicides did not negatively influence the height of the plants but did reduce their dry mass. Toxic symptoms disappeared after 21 DAA, with the only symptoms of injury observed in plants treated with the herbicides oxadiazon and nicosulfuron. In addition, the cluster analysis indicated the formation of a unique discriminatory group. Thus, the results show that the herbicides applied to Z. japonica were selective for the species.

AB  - This paper introduces the topic of Food Fraud with translations to Russian, Korean, and Chinese. The concepts provide a system-wide focus leading to prevention. The goal is not to detect Food Fraud but to adjust entire food supply chains to reduce fraud opportunities. Food Fraud is a recently defined area of Food Protection between Food Safety (such as Salmonella or pesticide residue), and Food Defense (malicious intent to harm such as terrorism). Food Fraud is intentional with no intent to harm but only for economic gain. As with improving Food Safety and Food Defense, preventing Food Fraud is good for society and the economy. Society benefits through fewer public health threats from unauthorized acts. Society also benefits from increased consumer satisfaction and harmony. Food Security is increased through the production of more, higher-value products for consumers, commerce, and exporting. Food Fraud can reduce economic output because sickened citizens cannot work and it also reduces consumer confidence leading to less commerce. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The cytoskeleton is a protein-based intracellular superstructure that evolved early after the appearance of bacterial prokaryotes. Eventually cytoskeletal proteins and their macromolecular assemblies were established in eukaryotes and assumed critical roles in cell movements, intracellular organization, cell division and cell differentiation. In biomedicine the small-molecules targeting cytoskeletal elements are in the frontline of anticancer research with plant-derived cytoskeletal drugs such as Vinca alkaloids and toxoids, being routinely used in the clinical practice. Moreover, plants are also major material, food and energy resources for human activities ranging from agriculture, textile industry, carpentry, energy production and new material development to name some few.
   Most of these inheritable traits are associated with cell wall synthesis and chemical modification during primary and secondary plant growth and inevitably are associated with the dynamics, organization and interactions of the plant cytoskeleton. Taking into account the vast intracellular spread of microtubules and actin microfilaments the cytoskeleton collectively assumed central roles in plant growth and development, in determining the physical stance of plants against the forces of nature and becoming a battleground between pathogenic invaders and the defense mechanisms of plant cells.
   This review aims to address the role of the plant cytoskeleton in manageable features of plants including cellulose biosynthesis with implications in wood and fiber properties, in biofuel production and the contribution of plant cytoskeletal elements in plant defense responses against pathogens or detrimental environmental conditions. Ultimately the present work surveys the potential of cytoskeletal proteins as platforms of plant genetic engineering, nominating certain cytoskeletal proteins as vectors of favorable traits in crops and other economically important plants.

AB  - Potamon potamios populations have decreased significantly due to the degradation of its habitat caused by human activities, mainly the use of insecticides. Today, P. potamios is protected by Cypriot law, but not much information is known regarding possible effects on the species from interactions with the introduced and invasive freshwater crayfish Procambarus clarkii. We tested the hypothesis that the invasive crayfish P. clarkii can cause negative effects on the populations of the only indigenous freshwater crab of Cyprus P. potamios, through agonistic competition for shelter. A laboratory experiment on the competition between P. potamios and P. clarkii for securing shelter has been performed. During the experiment, pairs of equal-sized individuals from each species were evaluated for aggressiveness, domination in fights and shelter occupation. Results showed that even though both species are similarly aggressive, the crayfish wins more fights and occupies shelter more efficiently than the crab. Even though at present there is no evidence that the two species are syntopic, these results are indicative of possible negative effects of the alien invasive crayfish on the indigenous crab where they may become syntopic in the future.

AB  - On the basis of the historical data and filed investigations, the ecological security situation of the six major key lakes (including Taihu Lake, Chaohu Lake, Dianchi Lake, Hongze Lake, Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake) in the period from 1980 to 2008 was identified. The obtained results indicate that the overlying water of Taihu Lake, Chaohu Lake, Dianchi Lake and Hongze Lake was seriously polluted. The safety of drinking water had been seriously threatened, the biodiversity declined and the aquatic vegetation severely degraded. The shore areas of the lakes had been exploited and the wetlands around were continuously eroded. Water bloom was proved to be a difficult and seriously ongoing issue threatening ecological security. The less polluted Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake were found to have suffered ecological security problems as well. These issues include vegetation degradation, the threat to biological habitat, increased pollution load into lakes, eutrophication, the depressed fisheries resources and rare birds' being threatened. Ecological security in the key lakes is threatened by rapid economic and social development in the basins. A large quantity of industrial pollutant emissions and the overuse of agricultural fertilizers and pesticides can be attributed to the rapid development mentioned above.

AB  - ToxCast is a multiyear effort to develop a cost-effective approach for the US EPA to prioritize chemicals for toxicity testing. Initial evaluation of more than 500 high-throughput (HT) microwell-based assays without metabolic activation showed that most lacked high specificity and sensitivity for detecting genotoxicants. Thus, EPA initiated a pilot project to investigate the use of standard genotoxicity endpoints using medium-throughput genotoxicity (MTG) assays in the context of a large testing program. Twenty-five chemicals were selected from the ToxCast program based in part on their known genotoxicity. The two MTG assays used were the Ames II assay and 96-well In Vitro MicroFlow((R)) Micronucleus (MN) assay. The Ames II assay showed a reasonable correlation with published Ames test data and industry submissions, though specificity was much better than sensitivity due to restraints on top concentrations as prescribed by ToxCast. Overall concordance was 73% both with and without metabolic activation. The flow MN assay had concordances of 71% and 58% with and without metabolic activation, respectively, when compared to published data and submissions. Importantly, a comparison of results without S9 from the MTG assays to an HT ToxCast p53 activation assay showed a fairly good degree of concordance (67%). The results reported here indicate that assays for genotoxicity endpoints can be conducted in a MT format and have the potential to add to the interpretation of results from large-scale testing programs such as EPA's ToxCast program. Inherent limitations such as the top concentrations used in large scale testing programs are discussed. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 56:468-476, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Soil degradation in India is estimated to be occurring on 147 million hectares (Mha) of land, including 94 Mha from water erosion, 16 Mha from acidification, 14 Mha from flooding, 9 Mha from wind erosion, 6 Mha from salinity, and 7 Mha from a combination of factors. This is extremely serious because India supports 18% of the world's human population and 15% of the world's livestock population, but has only 2.4% of the world's land area. Despite its low proportional land area, India ranks second worldwide in farm output. Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries account for 17% of the gross domestic product and employs about 50% of the total workforce of the country. Causes of soil degradation are both natural and human-induced. Natural causes include earthquakes, tsunamis, droughts, avalanches, landslides, volcanic eruptions, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires. Human-induced soil degradation results from land clearing and deforestation, inappropriate agricultural practices, improper management of industrial effluents and wastes, over-grazing, careless management of forests, surface mining, urban sprawl, and commercial/industrial development. Inappropriate agricultural practices include excessive tillage and use of heavy machinery, excessive and unbalanced use of inorganic fertilizers, poor irrigation and water management techniques, pesticide overuse, inadequate crop residue and/or organic carbon inputs, and poor crop cycle planning. Some underlying social causes of soil degradation in India are land shortage, decline in per capita land availability, economic pressure on land, land tenancy, poverty, and population increase. In this review of land degradation in India, we summarize (1) the main causes of soil degradation in different agro-climatic regions; (2) research results documenting both soil degradation and soil health improvement in various agricultural systems; and (3) potential solutions to improve soil health in different regions using a variety of conservation agricultural approaches.

AB  - Bioinsecticides based on nematodes are becoming increasingly popular agents for pest control. Nematodes used in these insecticides owe their properties to the presence of symbiotic bacteria. Representatives of two genera - Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus can be found in the digestive tracts of, respectively, Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae nematodes. Nematodes have a number of properties, allowing them to penetrate the host integument, breaking the immune defenses, multiplicating in his body, killing the host and finally producing invasive forms, viable in the external environment. Bacterial symbionts are responsible for some of these abilities, since they produce toxins lethal to the victim and maintain adequate conditions for the development of their vectors. The bacteria are an example of one organism living in another as a symbiont, and functioning as a pathogen for another one. The relationship nematodes-mutualistic bacteria-insect is formed. The immune system has the ability to fight against insect entomopathogens, however, a variaty of adaptation mechanisms of parasites and symbionts, molecular mimicry and destruction of phagocytic cells among others, enables them to survive in the host. With an effective biocidal properties, nematodes which are in a mutualist relationship with bacteria, become perfect and safe for use in the environment pest control agents. Transgenic plants producing Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus toxins can be as effective as those producing Bacillus thuringiensis toxins.

AB  - The delphinid genus Sousa has recently undergone a major revision, and currently contains four species, the Atlantic humpback (Sousa teuszii), Indian Ocean humpback (Sousa plumbea), Indo-Pacific humpback (Sousa chinensis), and Australian humpback (Sousa sahulensis) dolphins. Recent molecular evidence suggests that humpback dolphins in the Bay of Bengal may comprise a fifth species. These moderate-sized dolphin species are found in shallow (<30 m), coastal waters of the eastern Atlantic, Indian, and western Pacific oceans. Abundance and trends have only been studied in a few areas, mostly in eastern Africa, China, and northern Australia. No global, empirically derived abundance estimates exist for any of the four species, but none appear to number more than about 20,000 individuals. Humpback dolphins feed mostly on small fishes, and sometimes shrimps; occur for the most part in small groups (mostly 12 or less); have limited near-shore movements; and in most parts of their range exhibit a fission/fusion type of social organization. Major threats that affect all the species are entanglement in fishing gear, and habitat degradation/destruction from various forms of coastal development. Impacts from vessel traffic (including behavioural disturbance and displacement, as well as mortality and morbidity from collisions with vessels) appear to be significant in most areas. Several other threats are apparently significant only in particular parts of the range of some species (e.g. high levels of organochlorine contaminants affecting Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in Hong Kong). Direct hunting only occurs in limited areas and primarily on a small scale. Conservation actions so far have been limited, with most populations receiving little study and almost no management attention. Much more work is needed on humpback dolphin population status, threats, and how the major threats can be reduced or eliminated. Extinction risks for the four species and some populations are preliminarily re-assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria in the current volume. The results suggest that all four species in the genus are threatened at some level (suggested Red List status ranges from Vulnerable for S. chinensis and S. sahulensis to Critically Endangered for S. teuszii).

AB  - Background: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) have proven instrumental in the successful reduction of malaria incidence in holoendemic regions during the past decade. As distribution of ITNs throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is being scaled up, maintaining maximal levels of coverage will be necessary to sustain current gains. The effectiveness of mass distribution of ITNs, requires careful analysis of successes and failures if impacts are to be sustained over the long term.
   Methods: Mass distribution of ITNs to a rural Kenyan community along Lake Victoria was performed in early 2011. Surveyors collected data on ITN use both before and one year following this distribution. At both times, household representatives were asked to provide a complete accounting of ITNs within the dwelling, the location of each net, and the ages and genders of each person who slept under that net the previous night. Other data on household material possessions, education levels and occupations were recorded. Information on malaria preventative factors such as ceiling nets and indoor residual spraying was noted. Basic information on malaria knowledge and health-seeking behaviours was also collected. Patterns of ITN use before and one year following net distribution were compared using spatial and multi-variable statistical methods. Associations of ITN use with various individual, household, demographic and malaria related factors were tested using logistic regression.
   Results: After infancy (<1 year), ITN use sharply declined until the late teenage years then began to rise again, plateauing at 30 years of age. Males were less likely to use ITNs than females. Prior to distribution, socio-economic factors such as parental education and occupation were associated with ITN use. Following distribution, ITN use was similar across social groups. Household factors such as availability of nets and sleeping arrangements still reduced consistent net use, however.
   Conclusions: Comprehensive, direct-to-household, mass distribution of ITNs was effective in rapidly scaling up coverage, with use being maintained at a high level at least one year following the intervention. Free distribution of ITNs through direct-to-household distribution method can eliminate important constraints in determining consistent ITN use, thus enhancing the sustainability of effective intervention campaigns.

AB  - The plant pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum can cause serious losses on lettuce crops worldwide and as for most other susceptible crops, control relies on the application of fungicides, which target airborne ascospores. However, the efficacy of this approach depends on accurate timing of these sprays, which could be improved by an understanding of the environmental conditions that are conducive to infection. A mathematical model for S. sclerotiorum infection and disease development on lettuce is presented here for the first time, based on quantifying the effects of temperature, relative humidity (RH) and ascospore density in multiple controlled environment experiments. It was observed that disease can develop on lettuce plants inoculated with dry ascospores in the absence of apparent leaf wetness (required for spore germination). To explain this, the model conceptualises an infection court area containing microsites (in leaf axils and close to the stem base) where conditions are conducive to infection, the size of which is modified by ambient RH. The model indicated that minimum, maximum and optimum temperatures for ascospore germination were 0.0, 29.9 and 21.7 degrees C respectively and that maximum rates of disease development occurred at spore densities >87 spores cm(-2). Disease development was much more rapid at 80-100% RH at 20 degrees C, compared to 50-70% RH and resulted in a greater proportion of lettuce plants infected. Disease development was also more rapid at 15-27 degrees C compared to 5-10 degrees C (85% RH). The model was validated by a further series of independent controlled environment experiments where both RH and temperature were varied and generally simulated the pattern of disease development well. The implications of the results in terms of Sclerotinia disease forecasting are discussed.

AB  - Many governmental and non-governmental organizations have distributed insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) to malaria endemic areas, which contributed to the reduction of malaria deaths. However, some people in malaria endemic areas used ITNs for alternative purposes such as fishery and agriculture. It is unclear why people threatened by malaria misuse ITNs. Here we develop a N-player mosquito net game, and theoretically show that the misuse of ITNs might be underpinned by individual and social rationality. In the mosquito net game, each player uses ITNs for malaria prevention or alternative purposes. The proper ITN use decreases the probability of malaria infection, while the improper ITN use increases the player's labor productivity. Each player's expected payoff is influenced by other players' strategies. We found that the misuse of ITNs can be a Pareto efficient Nash equilibrium. The maximum number of players using ITNs for malaria prevention is limited by insecticidal effectiveness of ITNs and extra income from ITN misuse. Furthermore, we found that players in a low-income community are attracted to the misuse of ITNs even if the probability of malaria infection is high. Introduction of a tax on ITN misuse was shown to be effective to motivate the players to use ITNs for malaria prevention. Our results demonstrate that understanding decision making of people in malaria endemic areas is essential to design more effective malaria control programs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The second and third generations of Lobesia botrana can cause both yield losses and spreading of grape bunch rots. The aim of this study was to know to what degree these generations of L. botrana influence the rots at harvest time. The study was carried out in two grape-growing areas of northeastern Italy where the moth completes two and three generations per year, respectively. In the context of 12 insecticide trials, samplings were conducted in different plots to estimate the number of larval nests of the second and third generations and that of rotten berries at harvest time. The data sets (number of larval nests and rotten berries) from the different trials were submitted to regression analyses. Gray mold was the most important grape rot. The second generation, in the area where L. botrana has only two generations per year, and the third generation, in the area where the moth completes three generations per year, can favor gray mold on and around berries bored by larvae. In contrast, groups of rotten berries non-contiguous to larval nests did not appear to be influenced by moth activity. In the area where the moth completes three generations per year the larval nests of the second generation did not show a significant influence on bunch rots at harvest time.

AB  - Several diseases have recently emerged in lobsters (Homarus americanus) from Long Island Sound (LIS). Various stressors have been implicated as contributory factors, including increased bottom temperatures, extensive eutrophication with commensurate hypoxia, storm-induced thermal destratification, possible exposures to pesticides and metals, and fishery-induced stressors. Such stressors increase host susceptibility by weakening the host immune defenses and act to increase the transmission and severity of pathogens. The lobster mortality in western LIS in 1999 was linked to Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis, but a complex of stressors resulted in outright mortality from hypoxia or consequent immune suppression that increased susceptibility to the ameba. Similar stressors have been implicated in the etiology of epizootic shell disease and calcinosis. The role of environmental stressors has been hard to delineate, but recent declines in landings indicate that epizootic shell disease has had a negative impact on the lobster population in LIS. Calcinosis, blindness, and hepatopancreatitis are indicators of continued exposure to anthropogenic stressors, but their etiologies remain undetermined. More research is needed to understand emerging diseases, their complex etiologies, and their effects on the lobster population.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate antifungal activity of three chemically different chitosans named as A, B and C at different concentrations against three isolates of Sclerotinia scierotiorum, the causal agent of storage carrot rot, by in vitro and in vivo tests. In addition, potential of SAR (systemic acquired resistance) induced by the chitosans and acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) was assessed against the disease. The degree of N-deacetylation (DN) and the molecular weight of chitosans A, B and C were 85%-1129 kDa, 95%-521 kDa and 75%-607 kDa, respectively. The concentrations 2 g/L and 5 g/L of all chitosans were significantly able to decrease mycelial growth, sclerotia formation and carpogenic germination of the pathogen. Four hours and three days before inoculation with the pathogen, application of chitosans and ASA reduced severity of carrot rot in all isolates. However, mycelial growth and sclerotia formation of isolate 2 was more reduced than other isolates. In accordance with in vitro tests, chitosan B showed the highest inhibitory efficacy against the disease. The fungicidal effect of chitosan increased when the DN decreased and there was a negative correlation between the mycelial growth inhibition and the molecular weight of chitosans. The enzyme analysis showed that the activity of phenylalanine ammonia layse, polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase increase in the inoculated carrots after application of different chitosans and ASA.

AB  - Transgenerational effects of stressors can have important implications for offspring fitness and the responses of offspring to future stressful conditions. Parental effects, a common type of transgenerational effect, are non-genetic influences on offspring phenotype that result from parental phenotypes or environments. Little is known, however, about how parental exposure to a stressor effects offspring responses to other stressors despite this type of multi-stressor scenario being common. To better understand the role that parental effects have on offspring contaminant tolerance, we raised freshwater snails, Biomphalaria glabrata, in the presence or absence of predator threat (crayfish + crushed snail) for 12 weeks. Predators are common stressors in aquatic systems and can co-occur with chemical contaminants. We then collected egg masses from parental snails and exposed their offspring to cadmium and malathion survival challenges. Snails raised in the presence of predator threat displayed indicators of stress, including increased time to first reproduction, lower production of egg masses per snail per day and fewer eggs per egg mass, and had smaller shell lengths at 6.5 weeks old compared to snails not exposed to predator threat. Parental exposure to predator threat increased the cadmium tolerance of offspring but did not affect malathion tolerance. These results may have important implications for understanding effects of multiple stressors and indicate that the parental environment can influence responses to contaminants in offspring. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that a biotic stressor in the parental environment can significantly affect the contaminant tolerance of their offspring.

AB  - Background: Malaria mortality is mainly a direct consequence of inadequate and/or delayed diagnosis and case management. Some important control interventions (e.g. long-lasting insecticidal nests) have contributed to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality in different parts of the world. Moreover, the development and effective use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) hold promise to further enhance the control and elimination of malaria, particularly in areas where health services are deficient. The aim of this study was to determine knowledge, attitudes, practices and beliefs in relation to RDTs for malaria in rural Cote d'Ivoire.
   Methods: One hundred individuals from Bozi and Yoho who sought care at the health centre in Bozi and were offered an RDT for malaria were interviewed in April 2010 using a pre-tested questionnaire on practice and perceptions in relation to RDTs for malaria. The relationships between acceptance of RDTs and factors related to opinions were identified, using generalized linear mixed models. Qualitative data from open-ended questions complemented the quantitative analysis.
   Results: Only 34 out of 100 patients who were offered an RDT for malaria were willing to undergo the test. People who perceived blood as a sacred body fluid were less likely to comply with an RDT. The concurrent availability and use of RDTs for HIV and malaria was associated with an unwilling attitude towards RDTs for malaria (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001). The initial willingness of patients to accept malaria testing with RDTs was significantly related to general fear and wanting to know malaria infection status. For further and regular use of RDTs, a strong relationship was observed between acceptance and the idea that an RDT is a pretext used by health worker to know HIV status (odds ratio (OR) = 16.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-268.5). Those thinking that blood samples were useful for medical diagnoses were 8.31-times (95% CI = 2.22-31.1) more likely to undergo an RDT compared to those rejecting blood sampling as a diagnostic strategy.
   Conclusion: Socio-cultural factors might be barriers for accepting RDTs in general health services. There are social representations of malaria and HIV/AIDS, symbolic for blood or experiences in relation to blood taking and blood-related diseases in relation to the introduction and routine use of RDTs. Special attention should be given to these barriers as otherwise the promotion of RDTs for prompt and effective diagnosis and subsequent management of malaria is hampered.

AB  - Sclerotinia homoeocarpa causes dollar spot disease, the predominate disease on highly-maintained turfgrass. Currently, there are major gaps in our understanding of the molecular interactions between S. homoeocarpa and creeping bentgrass. In this study, 454 sequencing technology was used in the de novo assembly of S. homoeocarpa and creeping bentgrass transcriptomes. Transcript sequence data obtained using Illumina's first generation sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) were mapped to the transcriptome assemblies to estimate transcript representation in different SBS libraries. SBS libraries included a S. homoeocarpa culture control, a creeping bentgrass uninoculated control, and a library for creeping bentgrass inoculated with S. homoeocarpa and incubated for 96 h. A Fisher's exact test was performed to determine transcripts that were significantly different during creeping bentgrass infection with S. homoeocarpa. Fungal transcripts of interest included glycosyl hydrolases, proteases, and ABC transporters. Of particular interest were the large number of glycosyl hydrolase transcripts that target a wide range of plant cell wall compounds, corroborating the suggested wide host range and saprophytic abilities of S. homoeocarpa. Several of the multidrug resistance ABC transporters may be important for resistance to both fungicides and plant defense compounds. Creeping bentgrass transcripts of interest included germins, ubiquitin transcripts involved in proteasome degradation, and cinnamoyl reductase, which is involved in lignin production. This analysis provides an extensive overview of the S. homoeocarpa-turfgrass pathosystem and provides a starting point for the characterization of potential virulence factors and host defense responses. In particular, determination of important host defense responses may assist in the development of highly resistant creeping bentgrass varieties.

AB  - Background: Despite the advances in medical therapy and technology, the prognosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains poor and the need for disease prevention based on identifying the risk factors becomes mandatory. Occupational and environmental exposures were studied in several countries and found to play important role in the disease development. However, in Egypt, a little attention has been paid to study the effect of these factors in the disease development.
   Objective: To identify the occupational and environmental risk factors associated with the development of IPF in Egypt.
   Methods: A multicenter hospital-based case-control study was carried out in chest hospitals affiliated to three Egyptian cities-Cairo, Tanta and Mansoura. Subjects were 201 patients with confirmed IPF (cases) and 205 age-, sex- and residence-matched controls. Data on occupational and environmental factors were obtained from a questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent risk factors of IPF in both sexes for single factors with adjustment for age, residence and smoking status.
   Results: Compared with the controls, the risk of IPF in male workers was observed to increase significantly in chemical and petrochemical industries and carpentry and wood working (OR=2.56, 95% CI: 1.02-7.01), and with occupational exposures to wood dust and wood preservatives. Among female workers, a significant increase was observed in farming (OR=3.34, 95% CI: 1.17-10.12), raising birds and occupational exposures to animal feeds, products and dusts and pesticides. Risk of IPF decreased significantly in male workers and insignificantly among female workers in sales and clerical related activities. The environmental exposures to birds and cats were significantly associated with elevated risk of IPF development in both sexes.
   Conclusion: In Egypt, farming, raising birds and wood working are important risk factors for the development of IPF.

AB  - Fynbos is a vegetation type in the Cape Floral Region (CFR), at the southern tip of Africa. Portions of the CFR are recognised as a 'serial' World Heritage site and acclaimed by UNESCO as the world's 'hottest hot spot' for plant species richness and endemism. Habitat degradation and species losses through human intrusion in the CFR include transformations brought about by introduced invasive alien tree species. Since 1970, ten invasive tree species in the fynbos biome have been subjected to biological control, namely: six Acacia species and Paraserianthes lophantha (Mimosaceae), Hakea sericea (Proteaceae) and Leptospermum laevigatum (Myrtaceae), all from Australia, and Sesbania punicea (Fabaceae) from South America. A total of 19 species have been deployed as biological control agents, including nine weevil species (eight Curculionidae and one species in the family Brentidae: Apioninae), a seed-feeding moth species (Lepidoptera: Carposinidae), two species of bud-gallers (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), two species of flower-gallers (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), and a gall-forming rust fungus (Uredinales: Pileolariaceae). Most of these agents primarily reduce seed production, directly or indirectly, but some also cause die-back and mortality of their host plants. The overall result, often in combination with mechanical clearing and herbicide applications, has been a substantial decline in the abundance and/or aggressiveness of most of the targeted host-plants. In this review, four representative but contrasting case studies are used to show that biological control is an indispensible supplement to other management practices for long-term conservation of the remnants of the fynbos biome.

FX  - We are grateful to the Working for Water programme (WfW), now of the Department of Environmental Affairs, which for the past 15 years has been the main champion of weed biological control in South Africa. Without their political and financial support much of the research and implementation work on the biological control of invasive alien plants by the Agricultural Research Council-Plant Protection Research Institute, and the universities, would not have been possible (see Zimmermann et al. 2004). In this context, we are particularly appreciative of the sustained support from Dr. G. Preston, Dr. C. Marais and Mr A. Khan, all of WfW. We are also appreciative of the arrangements by Dr. R. van Driesche and Dr. T. Center who facilitated our attendance at "The 2010 Biological Control for Nature Conference" and allowed us the opportunity, with Prof. M. Hill, to present the story of weed biological control in the fynbos biome.

AB  - Phytophthora ramorum is a regulated pathogen in North America, which causes ramorum blight on nursery stock resulting in the implementation of costly quarantine and eradication measures. Earlier studies showed some biofungicides could inhibit growth and reduce the disease in vitro. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of commercial biofungicides on in vivo disease development and plant growth on four nursery species when inoculated with three isolates representing each of the NA1, NA2 and EU1 lineages of the pathogen. The plant species were Gaultheria shallon, Rubus spectabilis, Rhododendron caucasicum x R. ponticum var. album and Cornus sericea. Prior to pathogen inoculation, plants were pretreated with Aliette (R) (standard fungicide), Actigard 50WG Plant Activator (R), Actinovate (R) SP, Sonata (R), Serenade (R), Plant Helper (R), SoilGard (R) 12G and Pro Mix BX Biofungicide (TM). A suspension containing 7000 sporangia ml(-1) was used to inoculate plants. Disease severity and foliar biomass were recorded 14 days after inoculation. Actinovate was the only product able to reduce disease severity by about 50% and improve plant growth of the susceptible hosts. Its effectiveness differed by isolate. Several other biofungicides and the standard fungicide provided suppression of disease and improved plant growth but their effectiveness was dependent on host species, product and isolate. None of the products prevented disease and generally the level of control obtained was lower than would be acceptable for a commercial nursery. In addition to assessing the disease control products, it was also observed that rhododendron, salal and salmonberry were highly susceptible hosts of P. ramorum with PR05-001 (NA2) being the most aggressive isolate on them.

AB  - The ever rising resistant bacteria and fungi resulted in finding novel antimicrobial sources and agents. Studies confirmed that mung beans have increased phenolic compounds and enhanced defenses during germination. We hypothesized that antimicrobial activities might be found in sprouts of mung beans (MBS), or Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek. The screening method was conducted using disc diffusion assay against 12 gram negative and positive bacteria, including multiple drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and 12 fungi. It was followed by the evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration or the minimum fungicidal concentration. The screening results revealed potential antibacterial and antifungal activities by MBS extract against 11 out of 12 bacteria and 2 out of 10 fungi including remarkable antimicrobial activity against highly infectious MDR bugs such as Methicilline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MDR Escherichia coli O157:H7, MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Salmonella Typhimurium as well as against human fungal pathogens, Trichophyton rubrum and Trichoderma harzianum. The potential antimicrobial activity of MBS reflects effective quality and quantity of polyphenolic compounds present after bean germination. This unprecedented study showed that MBS extract is a potential source for novel antimicrobials that are inexpensive and readily available at a large scale for pharmaceutical companies.

AB  - In order to evaluate the development of the grass species Bermuda (Cynodon dactylon), Emerald (Zoysia japonica) and Broadleaf Carpetgrass (Axonopus compressus) submitted to herbicide sub doses and growth regulators under two light conditions, three experiments were conducted in a greenhouse at Paraguacu Paulista from September to December, 2006. For each grass species, the experimental design used was completely randomized, in a factorial scheme 6 x 2, with four replications, using two growth regulators (trinexapac-ethyl and ethephon), three herbicides applied in sub doses (clethodim, imazethapyr and metsulfuron-methyl), and a check without application. All treatments were evaluated under two light conditions, represented by plastic greenhouse (total light) and plastic greenhouse + shading 50% (partial light). The results obtained at 63 days after application showed that trinexapac-ethyl (250 g ha(-1)), clethodim (12 g ha(-1)) and imazethapyr (12 g ha(-1)) were the best growth regulators for the vegetative development of C. dactylon (65.8, 29.6 and 18.7%), Z. japonica (66.2, 40.7 and 49.7%) and A. compressus (56.5, 10.3 and 17.2%) grasses and for inflorescence emission of C. dactylon (100.0, 95.9 and 89.6%), under high and low luminosity. Ethephon (300 g ha(1)) and metsulfuron-methyl (3.6 g ha(-1)) treatments were found to be the best options for reducing vegetative development (15.5 and 26.7%) and root dry matter (34.7 and 33.9%) of Sao Carlos grass (A. compressus), compared to trinexapac-ethyl. For C. dactylon and Z. japonica turf grass, under conditions where aesthetics preservation is fundamental, clethodim and imazethapyr may substitute trinexapac-ethyl growth regulator on account of the smaller visual damage in the grass. Further studies with growth regulators and herbicide sub doses must be conducted with other cultivated grasses to enable efficient and safe recommendations, based on scientific information generated from Brazilian conditions.

AB  - The agroecological approach to agroecosystem management relies on two pillars: vegetational diversification and soil biological activity enhancement. Although crop pests and their natural enemies may be diversely affected by measures derived from these principles, those generally result in increased agroecosystem resilience vis-a-vis both aerial and soil pests. Earlier studies by ICRISAT and CIRAD and their partners in West Africa showed the potential of the implementation of these principles for the management of some major pests of both staple food and horticultural crops, and their limitations for others, notably in the water-saving and income-generating systems mixing cereals, legumes, and high-value crops currently promoted in the Sudano-Sahelian zones, such as the drip irrigation-based African Market Garden (AMG) and the water harvesting-based Bio-Reclamation of Degraded Lands (BDL) systems. Pigeon-pea showed potential for trap-cropping tomato fruit worm (TFW) on okra, while Andropogon grass was dismissed for such management of stem-borer on pearl millet, and mixed results were obtained with castor bean and other potential trap crops for panicle-feeding bug management on sorghum. The results presented highlight the potential for mobilizing either aerial or soil-bound biological processes for managing fruit flies (FF), the main pest of grafted jujube tree, and leaf worm, the main pest of the Moringa tree, for sustainable production of these two major crops (in BDL and AMG systems, respectively), without having to rely on synthetic pesticide sprays. Studies on the social acceptability of the proposed management options (e. g., pigeon-pea in okra-based BDL) are also underway. The potential of the Jatropha shrub grown as a live-fence around these systems, either for its top-down effects or via the use of its extracts in an assisted push-pull strategy, is discussed. These studies on targeted pathosystems serve the dual purpose of finding solutions to local problems and contribute more globally to the design of pest resilient agrosystems.

KW  - Fisheries
AB  - Traditional Indigenous knowledge has over the years played a significant role in solving several major social-ecological problems including those related to climate change and variability. People living close to nature often observe the circumstances around them and are the often the first to identify and adapt to any changes. The appearance of certain birds, mating of certain animals and flowering of certain plants are all seen as important signals of change with respect to timing and seasonality of natural phenomena that are well understood in traditional knowledge systems. Indigenous and local peoples have relied on biodiversity as a buffer against environmental variation, change and catastrophe. In the face of plague, if one crop fails, another will survive. In coping with risks associated with excessive rainfall, drought or crop failure, some traditional people grow a wide diversity of crop species and varieties with differential susceptibility to drought and floods and supplement their crops by hunting, fishing and collecting wild food plants. The diversity of crops and food resources is often matched by a similar diversity in the locating of fields - a safety measure to increase the likelihood that in the face of extreme weather at least some of the fields will be able to produce harvestable crops. Indigenous Technical Knowledge has three main aspects - materials, operations or practices, and institutional systems responsible for the implementation of the knowledge. The materials which are connected with the Indigenous Knowledge are the traditional seeds, medicines and pesticides collected from the plants and animals, the tools used in livelihood such as gears and crafts in fishing. Thus traditional indigenous communities will undoubtedly need additional support to coup up with the natural disastrous, their expertise will offer a great help for the effective management of natural disasters in future.

AB  - Vinclozolin (VIN) is an antiandrogenic model substance as well as a common fungicide that can affect the endocrine system of vertebrates. The objective of this study was to investigate how VIN affects mate calling behavior of South African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) and whether it is effective at environmentally relevant concentrations. Male X. laevis were injected with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to stimulate their androgen-controlled mate calling behavior and were treated with VIN at concentrations of 10(-6), 10(-8) and 10(-10) M. VIN at 10(-6) M reduced calling activity. Furthermore, the vocalization composition of VIN-treated X. laevis was altered. The call types advertisement calls and chirping are uttered by reproductively active males, whereas the call types growling, ticking, and rasping indicate a sexually unaroused state of a male. VIN at any of the tested concentrations led to a decrease in utterance of calls, which indicate a sexually aroused state of the males, and an increase in relative proportions of calls, indicating a sexually unaroused state of the males. Additionally, the mean duration of clicks and the number of accentuated clicks during the advertisement calls decreased at all concentrations of VIN. No significant differences were observed in any other temporal or spectral calling parameters between the treatments. This study illustrates that exposure to the antiandrogen VIN might result in a reduced reproductive success by altering mate calling behavior of X. laevis. Moreover, it suggests that the behavioral parameters examined in this study can be used as sensitive biomarkers for detecting antiandrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds in amphibians.

AB  - The search for organic foods is expressive worldwide due to the population awareness about the health risks resulting from the presence of chemical residues in food. Several studies suggest that some practices of organic farming, such as the use of animal manure and rules prohibiting the use of conventional pesticides, can increase the microbiological and parasitic risks. Hence, these foods would not be suitable for human consumption. In this context, the present research aimed at determining the sanitary quality of organic vegetables through the evaluation of microbiological contamination by total and fecal and coliforms, Salmonella sp., and parasitological contamination. Moreover, samples of organic lettuce, carrots, and tomatoes from the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba, Parana, were submitted to physicochemical evaluation to assess their nutritional quality. Thermotolerant coliforms, or fecal coliforms, were detected in 40% of the lettuce and in 25% of the carrot samples. It was observed that 25% of the carrot and 20% of lettuce samples presented Salmonella sp., whereas the tomato samples did not present thermotolerant coliforms or Salmonella sp. The major parasites identified in the lettuce samples were acarus, Entamoeba sp., eggs of Ancylostoma sp., and insects. Entamoeba sp., eggs of Ancylostoma sp. and Toxocara sp. were identified in the organic carrot samples, while the tomato samples did not present any parasitological contamination. The data suggest that the organic lettuce and carrot samples might have been contaminated somehow by the soil, water, domestic animals, or non-suitable fertilizers.

AB  - Oltenia region is one of the most favorable for temperate fruit tree crops (apple, plum, peach, apricot, walnut, etc.) This region has numerous micro zones (fruit tree areas) with optimal ecological conditions and tradition in fruit crop growing. There is economical and social interest in achieving qualitative and commercial performances at international level in the case of fruits grown in farms. Establishing of micro zones, of valuable cultivars assortments and applying of superior techniques allow the obtaining of high yields per hectare and high quality fruits. In the case of analyzed fruits from different species and cultivars the emphasize of the quality performances from point of vue morphology, taste, heavy metals (Cd, Pb and CO and residues from certain pesticides (Alpha-HCH, Gamma -ITCH, PCB52, PCB28, PCB180, HCB, Heptaclor, Epsilon-HCH, Heptaclor-epoxyd, Beta-Endosulphan, etc). The quality elements were followed in comparison with those used in theE.U. and in the international trade. The apples, plums, peaches, apricots and walnuts obtained into the fruit growing areas of Oltenia correspond from morphological point of vue because the fruit size, weight, color and uniformity are achieved when growing into fruit tree micro zones and when using quality orchard management. The taste of fruits of Oltenia is superior to similar fruits from other growing areas. The fruits from Oltenia are commercially and health conform because the heavy metal content (Cd and Pb) is way below the maximum level accepted for the E.U. fruits and the pesticide residues level is under the international levels accepted or residues are not present at all (Alpha-Hal, Aldrin, Epsilon-HCH, PCB 180). Other residues can be found in very low quantities in fruits and have no influence on the consumers. In order to assure high quality fruits in Oltenia a constant and responsible monitoring is required.

AB  - This document provides a scientific opinion of the Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 3 applications submitted under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 for renewal of the authorisation of (1) existing food and food ingredients produced from genetically modified (GM) maize MON810 (Unique Identifier MON-00810-6); (2) feed consisting of and/or containing maize MON810, including the use of seed for cultivation; and of (3) food and feed additives, and feed materials produced from maize MON810, developed by Monsanto to provide resistance to lepidopteran target pests.
   The scopes of the 3 renewal applications cover the continued marketing of:
   - existing food and food ingredients produced from maize MON810 (Reference EFSAGMO- RX-MON810[(8-1a)]) that have been placed on the market in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 258/97;
   - feed consisting of and/or containing maize MON810 that were authorised under Directive 90/220/EEC (Commission Decision 98/294/EC), including the use of seed for cultivation (Reference EFSA-GMO-RX-MON810([20-1a]));
   - food additives produced from maize MON810 that were authorised under Directive 89/107/EEC, and feed produced from maize MON810, i.e., feed additives lawfully placed on the market under Directive 70/524/EEC and feed materials (Reference EFSA-GMO-RX-MON810([8-lb/20-lb])).
   After the date of entry into force of the Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, the products mentioned above were notified to the European Commission according to Articles 8 or 20 of this Regulation and subsequently included in the Community Register of GM food and feed.
   Maize MON810 expresses a CrylAb insecticidal protein, derived from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, which confers protection against lepidopteran target pests such as the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) and species belonging to the genus Sesamia.
   In delivering its scientific opinion, the EFSA GMO Panel considered the 3 renewal applications (EFSA-GMO-RX-MON810[8.1. a], EFSA-GMO-RX-MON810[20.1. a] and EFSAGMO- RX-MON81018.1.b/20.1.b]); additional information supplied by the applicant; the scientific comments submitted by Member States; the report of the Spanish Competent Authority and its Biosafety Commission; and relevant information published in the scientific literature.
   The EFSA GMO Panel assessed maize MON810 with reference to the intended uses and appropriate principles described in the guidance document of the EFSA GMO Panel for the risk assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed. The scientific assessment included molecular characterisation of the inserted DNA and expression of target proteins. A comparative analysis of agronomic traits and composition was undertaken, and the safety of the new protein and the whole food/feed were evaluated with respect to potential toxicity, allergenicity and nutritional quality. An assessment of environmental impacts and the post-market environmental monitoring plan were undertaken.
   Maize MON810 was generated by particle acceleration technology. Maize MON810 expresses a crylAb coding sequence that encodes an insecticidally active CrylAb protein. The molecular characterisation data established that a single insert is integrated in the maize genomic DNA. Appropriate analyses of the integration site including sequence determination of the inserted DNA and flanking regions and bioinformatic analysis have been performed. Updated bioinformatic analysis of junction regions demonstrated the absence of any potential new open reading frames coding for proteins known to be toxic for humans and other mammals and/or allergens. The expression of the genes introduced by genetic modification has been sufficiently analysed and the stability of the genetic modification has been demonstrated over several generations. The EFSA GMO Panel is of the opinion that the molecular characterisation of the DNA insert and flanking regions of maize MON810 does not raise any safety concern, and that sufficient evidence for the stability of the genetic modification was provided.
   Analyses carried out on materials from maize MON810, including stacked GM maize events where maize MON810 was one of the parental lines, and their comparators indicate that maize MON810 is compositionally, phenotypically and agronomically equivalent to the non-GM counterparts and conventional maize, except for the newly expressed trait.
   The CrylAb protein shows no homology with proteins known to be toxic for humans and other mammals and/or allergens. In addition, this protein is rapidly degraded under simulated gastric conditions. Furthermore, the CrylAb protein has been extensively assessed in previous opinions of the EFSA GMO Panel. No concerns for humans and animals were identified regarding the safety of the CrylAb protein.
   In a 90-day feeding study in rats, no indications of adverse effects were observed. In addition, a 42-day broiler feeding study provided evidence of nutritional equivalence of maize MON810 kernels to kernels of conventional maize. The toxicological and nutritional data on maize MON810 and appropriate non-GM maize control published during the last 10 years confirm that these maize varieties have comparable influence on the test systems. Therefore, the EFSA GMO Panel is of the opinion that maize MON810 is as safe as its non-GM counterparts and that the overall allergenicity of the whole plant is not changed through the genetic modification.
   The Spanish Competent Authority and its Biosafety Commission provided to EFSA its report on the environmental risk assessment in line with Articles 6.3(e) and 18.3(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. The Spanish Competent Authority and its Biosafety Commission conclude that "according to the current state of scientific knowledge and after examining the existing information and the data provided by the Monsanto Company, the Spanish Commission on Biosafety could give a favourable opinion to the renewal of commercialisation in the EU of maize MON810 if the proposals and conditions defined in this environmental risk assessment report are implemented".
   Since maize MON810 has no altered survival, multiplication or dissemination characteristics, the EFSA GMO Panel agrees with the assessment that the likelihood of unintended environmental effects due to the establishment and spread of maize MON810 will be no different from that of conventional maize varieties.
   On the basis of the data provided by the applicant and obtained from a literature survey and a modelling exercise on the effect of the cultivation of maize MON810 on non-target lepidopteran species in representative maize cultivation regions in the European Union (EU), the EFSA GMO Panel concludes that the likelihood of adverse effects on non-target organisms or on ecological functions is very low, especially if appropriate mitigation measures are adopted. In agreement with the environmental risk assessment by the applicant and the assessment conducted by the Spanish Competent Authority and its Biosafety Commission, the EFSA GMO Panel identifies the possible evolution of resistance in target species, as a potential risk linked to the cultivation of maize MON810.
   In conclusion, the EFSA GMO Panel considers that the information available for maize MON810 addresses the scientific comments raised by Member States and that maize MON810 is as safe as its conventional counterpart with respect to potential effects on human and animal health. The EFSA GMO Panel also concludes that maize MON810 is unlikely to have any adverse effect on the environment in the context of its intended uses, especially if appropriate management measures are put in place in order to mitigate possible exposure of non-target Lepidoptera. Moreover, the EFSA GMO Panel advises that pest resistance management strategies continue to be employed.

AB  - One-tailed statistical tests are often used in ecology, animal behaviour and in most other fields in the biological and social sciences. Here we review the frequency of their use in the 1989 and 2005 volumes of two journals (Animal Behaviour and Oecologia), their advantages and disadvantages, the extensive erroneous advice on them in both older and modern statistics texts and their utility in certain narrow areas of applied research. Of those articles with data sets susceptible to one-tailed tests, at least 24% in Animal Behaviour and at least 13% in Oecologia used one-tailed tests at least once. They were used 35% more frequently with nonparametric methods than with parametric ones and about twice as often in 1989 as in 2005. Debate in the psychological literature of the 1950s established the logical criterion that one-tailed tests should be restricted to situations where there is interest only in results in one direction. 'Interest' should be defined; however, in terms of collective or societal interest and not by the individual investigator. By this 'collective interest' criterion, all uses of one-tailed tests in the journals surveyed seem invalid. In his book Nonparametric Statistics, S. Siegel unrelentingly suggested the use of one-tailed tests whenever the investigator predicts the direction of a result. That work has been a major proximate source of confusion on this issue, but so are most recent statistics textbooks. The utility of one-tailed tests in research aimed at obtaining regulatory approval of new drugs and new pesticides is briefly described, to exemplify the narrow range of research situations where such tests can be appropriate. These situations are characterized by null hypotheses stating that the difference or effect size does not exceed, or is at least as great as, some 'amount of practical interest'. One-tailed tests rarely should be used for basic or applied research in ecology, animal behaviour or any other science.

AB  - Bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus are amongst the best-known cetaceans. In the Mediterranean Sea, however, modern field studies of cetaceans did not start until the late 1980s. Bottlenose dolphins have been studied only in relatively small portions of the basin, and wide areas remain largely unexplored.
   This paper reviews the ecology, behaviour, interactions with fisheries and conservation status of Mediterranean bottlenose dolphins, and identifies threats likely to have affected them in historical and recent times.
   Whilst intentional killing was probably the most important cause of mortality until the 1960s, important ongoing threats include incidental mortality in fishing gear and the reduced availability of key prey caused by overfishing and environmental degradation throughout the region. Additional potential or likely threats include the toxic effects of xenobiotic chemicals, epizootic outbreaks, direct disturbance from boating and shipping, noise, and the consequences of climate change.
   The flexible social organization and opportunistic diet and behaviour of bottlenose dolphins may allow them to withstand at least some of the effects of overfishing and habitat degradation. However, dolphin abundance is thought to have declined considerably in the region and management measures are needed to prevent further decline.
   Management strategies that could benefit bottlenose dolphins, such as sustainable fishing, curbing marine pollution and protecting biodiversity, are already embedded in legislation and treaties. Compliance with those existing commitments and obligations should be given high priority.

AB  - The biological functions of avian cathelicidins are poorly defined. In mammals, cathelicidins have shown to possess potent broad-range antimicrobial activity as well as immunomodulatory activities. Therefore, we investigated the microbicidal activities and localization of Cathelicidin-2 in non-infected and Salmonella-challenged broiler chickens. Using immunohistochemistry, Cathelicidin-2 was shown to be abundantly present in heterophils, localized in the large rod-shaped granules, but absent in other peripheral blood cells and intestinal epithelial cells. Cathelicidin-2 synthesis was observed to be initiated at the early promyelocyte stage. Considerable infiltration of Cathelicidin-2 containing heterophils was observed in the jejunum of Salmonella enteritidis-challenged broilers within 8 h post-infection. Heterophils were shown to release mature Cathelicidin-2 peptide upon stimulation with Solmonello-derived LPS in a time-dependent way. Processing of the Cathelicidin-2 precursor was mediated by serine proteases with a divalent cation dependency. Cathelicidin-2 peptide showed potent bactericidal and fungicidal activity against all tested microorganisms, including chicken-specific Salmonella isolates. These results underscore the importance of avian heterophils as a first line of defence against invading pathogens and implicate that via heterophilmediated release, cathelicidins may greatly contribute to avian innate immunity.

AB  - To examine quality of life outcome for persons who self-report chemical sensitivity, often referred to as multiple chemical sensitivity.
   Multiple chemical sensitivity is poorly understood with few providers specialising in its treatment. This lack of treatment and the ubiquity of chemicals engender severe life impacts such as job loss, financial loss, social isolation and even homelessness for persons who experience these sensitivities.
   Survey.
   We examined chemical incitants, symptoms and sickness-related behavioural dysfunction as measured by the Sickness Impact Profile in 254 persons self-identified with multiple chemical sensitivity.
   Chemicals rated as causing the most symptomatology in respondents were pesticide, formaldehyde, fresh paint, new carpet, diesel exhaust, perfume and air fresheners. The five highest rated symptoms in this sample were tiredness/lethargy, difficulty concentrating, muscle aches, memory difficulties and long-term fatigue. Overall mean Sickness Impact Profile score was 25.25%, showing serious impairment, with the most serious dysfunction in the categories of work (55.36%), alertness behaviour (53.45%) and recreation and pastimes (45.20%).
   Multiple chemical sensitivity is an important health care issue because it often includes serious dysfunction, is poorly understood by providers and poses extensive financial and treatment obstacles for those who experience it.
   Persons with multiple chemical sensitivity seek medical treatment in a variety of contexts and informed providers can both avoid iatrogenic harm due to medical exposures and provide any possible treatment for the chemical sensitivities. Understanding the impact of the health condition is crucial to communicate with and treat persons who experience the sensitivities.

The essential oil was submitted to analysis for the verification of the antibacterial activity, by the method of diffusion in paper discs in Muller Hinton agar medium, where one bacteria were tested Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and four Gram negative (Listeria Monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri and Salmonella choleraesuis), which demonstrated significant results. Assays for the verification of larvicidal activity were made with Aedes aegypti larvae with the oil being active.

AB  - The International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM), together with the South American and Caribbean Steering Committees of the Census of Marine Life program (CoML), supported the initiative of launching a regional lCoMM node (LACar ICoMM). This network aims at promoting discussions among scientists currently involved in marine microbial studies carried out at both the South American and the Caribbean regions, in order to evaluate the research capabilities and to identify complementary strengths and/or possibilities for enhanced collaboration, that would improve the knowledge on marine microbes and their biodiversity in both regions. We present an overview and discussion on some of the directions of current research on marine microbes in these regions. Concerning the marine phytoplankton studies, the best known taxonomic groups are diatoms and dinoflagellates. In Mexican marine waters, the number of taxa recorded to date is of about 1400. Studies dealing with bacterial, phytoplankton and/or cyanobacterial dynamics are carried out in the Caribbean coastal and oceanic marine systems, underscoring the importance of various environmental states, modulated by geographic and seasonal patterns as well as by the expression of large South American rivers. One of the main issues of this type of survey is the determination of wet and dry seasonal patterns of bacterial dynamics, in seascapes off Puerto Rico, with moderate to absent river inputs. Phytoplankton and bacterioplankton dynamics are also studied in F. Guiana coastal and shelf systems under direct Amazon influence, well known for their important fisheries resources, as well as in other South American marine systems influenced by important fresh water inputs or under upwelling conditions. Bacterial and/or picoeukaryotes diversity are assessed in particular marine systems such as coastal lagoons in Uruguay, the Rio de la Plata estuary and adjacent areas, as well as in sediments of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) off South American Pacific coast, and in anoxic waters of the Cariaco Basin. Findings of a diverse range of pico-autotrophs (Patagonian shelf) and particular communities of big filamentous bacteria (OMZ zone off the South American Pacific) represent recent discoveries in those areas. In polluted coastal systems, bacteria with ability to degrade pesticides and hydrocarbons are currently monitored. In coastal areas of the Colombian Caribbean, 64 native marine bacterial strains were isolated from sediment samples. The oil-degrading bacteria are also studied in the Orinoco Delta, submitted to intensive oil exploitation. Furthermore, the Microbial Observatory of Rio de Janeiro (MoRio) established in Guanabara Bay (Brazil), constitutes a model for the study of threatened tropical coastal systems by exploring microbial biodiversity in different coastal systems (including unpolluted sites). The estimation of the activity and diversity of hydrocarbon and oil-degrading bacteria is assessed also in temperate waters and sediments of coastal systems of Argentina. Sharing knowledge and capabilities in common strategies would allow a better understanding of marine microbial diversity patterns in both regions. Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (Suppl. 1): 183-214.

AB  - 1. With biological invasions causing widespread problems in ecosystems, methods to curb the colonization success of invasive species are needed. The effective management of invasive species will require an integrated approach that restores community structure and ecosystem processes while controlling propagule pressure of non-native species.
   2. We tested the hypotheses that restoring native vegetation and minimizing propagule pressure of invasive species slows the establishment of an invader. In field and greenhouse experiments, we evaluated (i) the effects of a native submersed aquatic plant species, Vallisneria americana, on the colonization success of a non-native species, Hydrilla verticillata; and (ii) the effects of H. verticillata propagule density on its colonization success.
   3. Results from the greenhouse experiment showed that V. americana decreased H. verticillata colonization through nutrient draw-down in the water column of closed mesocosms, although data from the field experiment, located in a tidal freshwater region of Chesapeake Bay that is open to nutrient fluxes, suggested that V. americana did not negatively impact H. verticillata colonization. However, H. verticillata colonization was greater in a treatment of plastic V. americana look-alikes, suggesting that the canopy of V. americana can physically capture H. verticillata fragments. Thus pre-emption effects may be less clear in the field experiment because of complex interactions between competitive and facilitative effects in combination with continuous nutrient inputs from tides and rivers that do not allow nutrient draw-down to levels experienced in the greenhouse.
   4. Greenhouse and field tests differed in the timing, duration and density of propagule inputs. However, irrespective of these differences, propagule pressure of the invader affected colonization success except in situations when the native species could draw-down nutrients in closed greenhouse mesocosms. In that case, no propagules were able to colonize.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that reducing propagule pressure through targeted management should be considered to slow the spread of invasive species. This, in combination with restoration of native species, may be the best defence against non-native species invasion. Thus a combined strategy of targeted control and promotion of native plant growth is likely to be the most sustainable and cost-effective form of invasive species management.

AB  - Induction of IL-12 and IL-23 is essential for protective immunity against Cryptococcus neoformans. The contribution of dendritic cells vs. macrophages to IL-12/23 production in response to C. neoformans infection is unclear. Activation of conventional bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC), plasmacytoid BMDC, and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM Phi) was assessed by analyzing cytokine responses and the expression of MHC-II, CD86, and CD80 in each cell type. Cryptococcus neoformans induced the release of IL-12/23p40 by BMDC, but not by BMM Phi, in a TLR2- and TLR4-independent but MyD88-dependent manner. Conventional BMDC rather than plasmacytoid BMDC up-regulated MHC-II and CD86, while BMM Phi down-regulated MHC-II and CD86 in response to C. neoformans. The up-regulation of MHC-II and CD86 on BMDC required MyD88. Our data point to conventional DC as critical IL-12/23-producing antigen-presenting cells during cryptococcosis.

AB  - In order to support healthy aquaculture, we developed assays to assess immune functions and their susceptibility to environmental conditions or toxicants. Flow cytometry allowed the rapid and quantitative analysis of oyster and lobster cell subpopulations and their functions (phagocytosis, peroxide production, natural killer cell-like activity and apoptosis). We demonstrated experimentally that water salinity, water temperature and infection with P. marinus modulated oyster defence mechanisms, and lobsters relative sensitivity to the effects of pesticides. This information will improve the understanding of resistance to pathogens as well as the potential effects of environmental changes to affect disease resistance.

AB  - Brazil has two Western hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) sites, the "Area de Protecao Ambiental das Reentrancias Maranhenses" and the "Parque Nacional da Lagoa do Peixe." Both were designated in 1991 and both are included in the National System of Conservation Units. The APA is managed by the government of the state of Maranhao. It has no personnel, no infrastructure, no management plan, and no budget. It is mostly in private hanks, but the Federal Government owns large areas. Illegal settlers are common. The communities practice small-scale fishing for subsistence or to supply urban centers such as Sao Luiz e Alcantara. They lack basic infrastructure such as water supply and distribution, sewerage, or electricity. Ecotourism is still an incipient activity in the region. The main challenges for conservation are: the difficulty to include an area in the National System of Conservation Units in a region with serious socio-economic problems, conflicts between the social and environmental priorities, and convincing people and administrators about the pertinence of taking advantage of ecotourism as a source of income for the local communities. In contrast, Lagoa do Peixe is managed by the federal government and has an office with staff, a budget and a management plan. After the creation of the park and its inclusion within WHSRN, numerous activities of research, environmental education and ecotourism began to develop, generating alternative sources of income for the local communities. Among the biggest challenges are: the purchase of the many remaining private properties, shrimp fishing, illegal hunting, drainage of waters for rice farms and the associated use of the pesticides, and finally the increased vehicle traffic on the beach during, the summer.

AB  - A 2-year field study was undertaken to examine the effect of the systemic fungicide metalaxyl-m (the R enantiomer of metalaxyl) on endophytic populations of bacteria in tubers of potatoes (Solarium tuberosum) 'Russet Burbank'. The frequency (population density) of bacterial endophytes with antibiosis activity against Phytophthora erythroseptica and Fusarium avenaceum was not independent of fungicide regime, according to Fisher's exact test (two-tailed; P = 0.0032). Significantly more strains with antibiosis activity (in vitro) were recovered from the tubers of plants treated with metalaxyl-m. A weak, but statistically significant (P = 0.01) increase in the strength of antibiosis activity of tuber bacterial endophytes against selected phytopathogens occurred in plants that received foliar fungicide spray programmes incorporating metalaxyl-m (Ridomil Gold (R) MZ 68 WP (wettable powder)) in addition to chlorothalonil (Bravo (R) 500), as compared with plants that received Bravo 500 applications only. Disease development was significantly (P = 0.01) reduced in tubers from plants receiving metalaxyl-m treatments, following tuber inoculation with P. erythroseptica or F. avenaceum. Indices for evenness of distribution and for diversity of bacterial species recovered from potato tubers were significantly higher (P = 0.05) in plants receiving metalaxyl-m treatments. It would appear that, in stimulating a more biodiverse endophyte community, metalaxyl-m may be inducing a form of defensive mutualism amongst bacterial endophytes (a chemically induced endophyte-mediated disease suppression), thereby reducing phytopathogen colonization, including that of the fusaria, against which metalaxyl-m has no direct fungicidal activity.

AB  - Food-borne pathogens are responsible for most cases of food poisoning in developed countries and are often associated with poultry products, including chicken. Little is known about the role of beta-defensins in the chicken digestive tract and their efficacy. In this study, the expression of chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 (Gal-6) and its antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens were investigated. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed high expression of Gal-6 mRNA in the esophagus and crop, moderate expression in the glandular stomach, and low expression throughout the intestinal tract. Putative transcription factor binding sites for nuclear factor kappa beta, activator protein 1, and nuclear factor interleukin-6 were found in the Gal-6 gene upstream region, which suggests a possible inducible nature of the Gal-6 gene. In colony-counting assays, strong bactericidal and fungicidal activity was observed, including bactericidal activity against food-borne pathogens Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli. Treatment with 16 mu g/ml synthetic Gal-6 resulted in a 3 log unit reduction in Clostridium perfringens survival within 60 min, indicating fast killing kinetics. Transmission electron microscopy examination of synthetic-Gal-6-treated Clostridium perfringens cells showed dose-dependent changes in morphology after 30 min, including intracellular granulation, cytoplasm retraction, irregular septum formation in dividing cells, and cell lysis. The high expression in the proximal digestive tract and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 plays an important role in chicken innate host defense.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are important components of the host innate immune responses by exerting broad-spectrum microbicidal activity against pathogenic microbes. The first mollusk big defensin (designated AiBD) cDNA was cloned from bay scallop Argopecten irradians by expressed sequence tag (EST) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques. The scallop AiBD consisted of 531 nucleotides with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA and a poly(A) tail, encoding a polypeptide of 122 amino acids. The high similarity of AiBD deduced amino acid sequence with big defensin from Tachypleus tridentatus and Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtaunese indicated that AiBD should be a member of big defensin family. The expression of AiBD in various tissues was measured by using Northern blotting analysis. mRNA transcripts of AiBD could be detected in haemocytes of unchallenged scallops. The temporal expression of AiBD in haemolymph after Vibrio anguilarum challenge was recorded by quantitative real time PCR. The relative expression level of AiBD in haemolymph was up-regulated evenly in the first 8 h, followed by a drastic increase, and increased 131.1-fold at 32 h post-injection. These results indicated that AiBD could be induced by bacterial challenge, and it should participate in the immune responses of A. irradians. Biological activity assay revealed that recombinant AiBD could inhibit the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and also showed strong fungicidal activity towards the expression host. Recombinant expression of AiBD made it possible to further characterize its functions involved in immune responses, and also provided a potential therapeutic agent for disease control in aquaculture.

AB  - Entomopathogenic nematode in vivo production depends on a high level of successful infection during the inoculation process. Some host-nematode combinations do not provide sufficient or consistent infection levels and are, therefore, not suitable for in vivo production. Our objective was to determine whether infection levels could be improved through host or nematode exposure to physical and chemical stressors. Elevated stress may compromise host insect defenses, thus increasing its vulnerability to nematode infection. Specifically, we investigated the effects of stressors on Heterorhabditis bacteriophora infection of Tenebrio molitor larva. The stressors included temperature extremes, insecticidal oils and metal cations. Most chemical stressor-nematode combinations caused high host mortality and low infectivity rates. However, infective juvenile stimulation by the cation Mn2+ did enhance infectivity compared to the control. Dry heat (40 degrees C for 30 min) and hot water (60-70 degrees C for I s) treatments increased the host's susceptibility to H. bacteriophora infection with respect to unstressed controls, and the yields and virulence of infective juveniles produced in hosts stressed by these treatments were not affected. Thus, host stress methods can be used to successfully enhance infection levels for in vivo production of H. bacteriophora. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The shellfish industry is an important economic activity in France, occurring mostly in estuarine zones subject to pollution due to anthropogenic activities. The harmful effects of pollutants on species inhabiting these estuarine zones are not well known. Among marine species, bivalve mollusks---particularly Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas-may serve a model of interest. The species is sedentary and filter-feeding, which favors bioaccumulation of pollutants in their tissues. Oysters may be suitable for studies on disturbance by pollutants of physiological activities, among which defense mechanisms are poorly documented in bivalves. In this study, effects of pollutants on hemocyte functions were monitored in Pacific oyster, C. gigas. Hemocytes were exposed in vitro to selected pollutants. The strategy for investigating the effects of pollutants on hemocyte functions is based on several biomarkers, which is more relevant than that of published papers based on single-endpoint experiments. Pollutants belonging to the most important groups of xenobiotics (PAHs, PCBs, and pesticides) were selected and their effect on hemocyte activities was analyzed using flow cytometry. Twenty-three pollutants were tested and eight of them showed significant modulation of hemocyte activities. PAHs and PCB 77 induced a decrease of hemocyte activity after an incubation periods of 4 and 24 h at 200 mu mol/L. Three pesticides (2,4D, paraoxon, and chlorothalonil) modulated hemocyte activities. A mixture of eight pesticides also decreased phagocytotic activity. This study is one of the first to investigate the effects of so many pollutants on hemocyte functions at the same time and therefore allows a real comparison of different pollutant effects.

AB  - The chitin is a natural polymer that is extracted commercially from the shells of crustaceans generated as raw material from the fishing industry. Their chemical structure is constituted by residual units of N-acetyl glucosamine linked by beta (1 -> 4) and its derivatives can be obtained from alkaline chitosan.
   The chitin, chitosan and their derivatives present very good perspectives to be used in agriculture. These derivatives are biodegradable and they exhibit fungicides, germicides, nemacides properties and natural defensive mechanisms of the plants.
   The chlorophosphonic-2-acid (Ethephon (R)) is a commercial product employed for the early maturation of fruits.
   The objective of the present work is the synthesis and characterization of chitosan-O-ethyl phosphonate chitosan to obtain a controlled released system with potential plant growth regulation properties. Alkaline chitosan was obtained; and then reacted with the 2-chlorophosphonic acid.
   The synthesis of new chitosan derivatives and its complete characterization by FT-IR, C-13, H-1 and P-31 NMR is described and gas chromatographic, the effects on field blueberries are also tested. A chitosan 99% deacetylated and Mv = 89,000 g/mol is prepared. The O-(ethyl phosphonic) chitosan (QOEP) with a degree of substitution of 58% is obtained.

AB  - This research employs a multi-disciplinary approach by developing a model that draws upon psychometric, cultural, and reflexive modernization perspectives of risk perception. Using data from a 1999 national telephone survey, we tested our model on three food risks-pesticides, Salmonella, and fat. Results showed that perceptions of risks do vary by the nature of the risk investigated. Consistent with the psychometric perspective, the level of knowledge and control varied by risk, but these differences did not correspond with levels of concern. Worldview variables were correlated with perceptions of pesticides, indicating the relevance of cultural approaches. High levels of concern associated with each food risk, and the robustness of the relationship between trust and the perception of food risks, raise the possibility that trust acts as a coping mechanism, which is consistent with the reflexive modernization approach. Knowledge and trust were significantly related to all three risks.

AB  - Perhaps one of the most important questions posed by the neurobiology of aging concerns the pathogenic mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, it was suggested that exposure to pesticides could be the main cause of PD. Another study reported Et the environmental endotoxin, lipopolysaccaride produced by Salmonella minnesota, m be a risk factor for PD. An alternative explanation is the genetic component, which has been suggested to be an important risk factor. Epidemiological studies have identified a positive family history of Parkinson as one of the most important risk factors for the disease. However, these studies neither examined nor reviewed the medical records of the family members. The twin study stated that the major factors in the etiology of PD are non-genetic, Meanwhile, egidemiological studies from China have shown that the prevalence of PD is much lower than in the Caucasian copulation, explained by the low frequency of cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 debrisoquine hydroxylase gene polymorphism. The etiology idiopathic PD is still a question for scientists and calls for further research, especially WINtofeigrowing proportion of elderly and the rising incidence of PD worldwide. Future research for PD risk factors should consider that multiple interactions occur in PD, resulting in a complex trait, which includes genetic, acquired, and environmental components.

AB  - Chytridiomycosis an emerging infectious disease (EID) of the skin caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has been linked with continuing amphibian population declines in the western USA, Central America, Europe, Africa, and Australia. Genetic analysis suggests that B. dendrobatidis is a recently emerged pathogen. This article reviews the biology of this pathogenic chytrid and the evidence for chytridiomycosis as a cause of declines in amphibian populations worldwide. Data are presented to show that antimicrobial peptides, produced in granular glands of the skin and released in high concentrations into skin secretions, are highly effective in inhibiting growth of B. dendrobatidis in vitro and may provide limited protection for some species. Ongoing studies suggest a correlation between resistance to lethal infection by B. dendrobatidis and synthesis of antimicrobial peptides by the host amphibian, but further research is needed to define better the role of antimicrobial peptides in protection of amphibian populations and the effect of environmental factors upon antimicrobial peptide synthesis.

AB  - Rice blast disease is the most serious and damaging of all the plant diseases in rice production in such temperate and humid climate like that of Japan, which resulted in the development of many excellent chemicals for this particular disease, e.g., blasticidin S, kasugamycin, iprobenphos (IBP), edifenphos (EDDP), isoprothiolane, ferimzone, and metominostrobin. These chemicals mostly act on the growth of M oryzae by exhibiting specific fungicidal effects on the pathogen. The wide use of these site specific chemicals sometimes causes development of resistance in the pathogens. In fact, resistance against kasugamycin and organophosphorus thiolate fungicides were recognized in the field where they were too intensively used. Solutions to the problem were contrived for the effective use of the chemicals at hand, such as application of mixtures with different action mechanisms or their use in rotation. While all modem fungicides are developed through extensive safety evaluation, there is a deep public concern about their side effects on non-target organisms and on the environment.
   Thus there is a great deal of interest in non-fungicidal disease controlling agents since they are supposedly specific to target organisms and are less likely to lead to resistance problems. Actually, two groups of non-fungicidal rice blast chemicals are currently on the market; melanin biosynthesis inhibitors (MBIs), e.g., fthalide, tricyclazole, pyroquilon, carpropamid, diclocymet and fenoxanil, and the so called priming effectors or plant defense activators such as probenazole, acibenzolar-S-methyl and tiadmil, which induce host resistance against the pathogen's attack.

AB  - Biological control agents for plant diseases are currently being examined as alternatives to synthetic pesticides due to their perceived increased level of safety and minimal environmental impacts. Fungal biological control agents have several mechanisms of action that allow them to control pathogens, including mycoparasitism, production of antibiotics or enzymes, competition for nutrients and the induction of plant host defences. While effective in the control of plant diseases, these mechanisms may pose risks to non-target species including mycorrhizal and saprophytic fungi, soil bacteria, plants, insects, aquatic and terrestrial animals, and humans. Non-target effects including mycoparasitism of mycorrhizae, reduction in plant root colonisation by mycorrhizal fungi, disorders in commercial mushrooms and nodulation by Rhizobium spp., and changes in plant growth have been associated with fungal biological control agents, such as Trichoderma spp. Also, the genera Tricho-derma and Gliocladium have been linked to respiratory disorders and shellfish toxicity in humans, respectively. Biological control agents, such as Pythium oligandrum, Talaromyces flavus, Coniothyrium minitans and Ampelomyces quisqualis have modes of action which may pose risks to non-target fungi, bacteria, plants and animals. There is need for future research into ecological impacts associated with the release of any biological agent and methods of determining possible non-target effects. Adequate monitoring and the use of molecular techniques to identify and follow the movement of biological control agents are needed to examine and mitigate negative biological impacts.

AB  - In this survey conducted in southern Cameroon, we compared ant-Hemiptera associations on plantations treated with insecticides, on plantations 2 years after insecticide treatments ceased, and on control lots that never received insecticide treatments. By eliminating arboreal-nesting ants, insecticides favored the presence of "ecologically dominant" ground-nesting, arboreal-foraging species that occupied the tree crowns. The reinstallation of arboreal ants was slow as 2 yr after insecticide treatment ceased differences with the control lots were significant; This intermediary period also illustrated that arboreal ants can found and develop colonies on trees occupied by ground-nesting species. Certain arboreal species were more frequent during this intermediary period than on the control lots, showing that the period of installation in the trees was followed by competition between arboreal ants. We confirm that ground-nesting ants tend a wide range of hemipteran families, including well known agricultural pests, whereas arboreal ants, particularly dominant species, were mostly associated with Coccidae and Stictococcidae that do not pose problems to the supporting trees. A tree effect was also noted for both ant and hemipteran distribution. We concluded that because of insecticide use, ground-nesting ants pose problems through their associated Hemiptera. On the contrary, dominant arboreal ants, strong predators, benefit their supporting trees by excluding ground-nesting species and tending mostly nonpest Hemiptera. Nevertheless, certain of them, carpenter species or species likely to tend Pseudococcidae, have to be eliminated through integrated management.

AB  - Allergic disease affects millions of persons in the United States. Environmental control measures are essential for persons who are sensitive to dust mite and cat allergens and may be important in persons who are sensitive to cockroaches and fungus. The bedroom is the most important room in which to implement environmental control measures, such as encasing mattresses and pillows in vinal or semipermaeble covers. Patients with asthma (especially persistent asthma) should be considered for allergy testing and more aggressive environmental control measures. Carpet in the bedroom or over concrete should be removed. For persons who are sensitive to pet allergens, permanent removal of the pet is recommended. Dust mite and fungus growth can be controlled by keeping the household humidity level at less than 50 percent. Removing sources of food and water and using insecticides will help control cockroach populations. Patients who are sensitive to mold and outdoor air pollution should consider limiting outdoor activities when these levels are high. Patients with asthma should avoid exposure to tobacco smoke.

AB  - The question raised in the title was answered. (3R, 3'S)-meso-Zeaxanthin was submitted to iodine catalyzed photochemical stereoisomerisation. The enantiomeric (9Z) and (9'Z) geometrical isomers were isolated by semipreparative HPLC and separated as diastereomeric dicarbamates on a chiral column only. Cleavage of the carbamate could not be effected. CD-Spectra of (1"S, 1"S)- and (1"R, 1"R)-dicarbamates of geometrical isomers of (3R, 3'R)- and (3R, 3'S)-meso-zeaxanthin were systematically studied and the contribution from the carbamate moieties revealed. It was concluded that (92, 3R, 3'S)-"meso"-zeaxanthin, in spite of having no symmetry elements, is optically inactive. The result has been rationalised in line with the current hypothesis on the origin of carotenoid CD spectra. Chirality 13:224-229, 2001. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Plants can be induced locally and systemically to become more resistant to diseases through various biotic or abiotic stresses. The biological inducers include necrotizing pathogens, non-pathogens or root colonizing bacteria. Through at network of signal pathways they induce resistance spectra and marker proteins that are characteristic for the different plant species and activation systems. The best characterized signal pathway for systemically induced resistance is SAR (systemic acquired resistance) that is activated by localized infections with necrotizing pathogens. It is characterized by protection against a broad range of pathogens, by a set of induced proteins and by its dependence on salicylic acid (SA) Various chemicals have been discovered that seem to act at various points in these defense activating networks and mimic all or parts of the biological activation of resistance. Of these, only few have reached commercialization. The best-studied resistance activator is acibenzolar-5-methyl (BION). At low rates it activates resistance in many crops against a broad spectrum of diseases, including fungi, bacteria and viruses. In monocots, activated resistance by BION typically is very long lasting, while the lasting effect is less pronounced in dicots. BION is translocated systemically in plants and can take the place of SA in the natural SAR signal pathway, inducing the same spectrum of resistance and the same set of molecular markers. Probenazole (ORYZEMATE) is used mainly on rice against rice blast and bacterial leaf blight. Its mode of action is not well understood partly because biological systems of systemically induced resistance are not well defined in rice. Treated plants clearly respond faster and in a resistant manner to infections by the two pathogens. Other compounds like beta-aminobutyric acid as wdl as extracts from plants and microorganisms have also been described as resistance inducers. For most of these, neither the mode of action nor reliable pre-challenge markers are known and still other pathways for resistance activation are suspected. Resistance inducing chemicals that are able to induce broad disease resistance offer an additional option for the farmer to complement genetic disease resistance and the use of fungicides. If integrated properly in plant health management programs, they can prolong the useful life of both the resistance genes and the fungicides presently used.

AB  - Carpropamid(1) is a novel root-application systemic fungicide for the control of rice blast disease caused by Pyricularia oryzae (Magnaporthe grisea). Carpropamid is a novel melanin biosynthesis inhibitor that produces a strong inhibition of penetration. In mode-of-action studies, the inhibitory action of carpropamid can be counteracted by supplying the melanin intermediate 1,8-DHN2, which lies beyond the points of inhibition in the melanin biosynthetic pathway. When 1,8-DHN was applied to inoculated, carpropamid-treated plants, 30% of P. oryzae appressoria were melanized compared to 5% without 1,8-DHN. The pigmented appressoria penetrated the host normally and as frequently as on control plants (45%), but fungal invasion was arrested shortly after penetration. This abatement of fungal growth was associated with increased lignification of invaded host cells. Lignification is a typical reaction of resistant rice varieties and of rice plants with acquired resistance. Comparative studies with carpropamid, tricyclazole and resistance-inducing substances such as DDCC3 showed clearly that as well as inhibiting melanin biosynthesis, carpropamid also potentiates the activation of defence responses during fungal invasion.

AB  - 2,5-Dialkylpyrrolidines present in the venom of ants from the genus Monomorium are natural insecticides causing a flaccid paralysis. The mechanism of action of 2(1non-8enyl)-5-(1non-8enyl)pyrrolidine (Pyr9), a synthetic derivative of 2,5-dialkylpyrrolidines, has been investigated in vitro on preparations of the ventral nerve cord of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii. Our results clearly indicate that Pyr9 blocks spike conduction without affecting the resting potential, Voltage-clamp experiments carried out on axons demonstrate that this blockade is due to a dual expression of Na+ current inhibition: a tonic inhibition developing slowly (90% of inhibition within 20 min for a Pyr9 concentration of 50 mu mol l(-1)) and independently of stimulation, and a phasic inhibition developing during repetitive stimulation (5Hz), the accumulation kinetics of which is 0.072 pulse(-1) at 5Hz, according to the Courtney model, These findings suggest that tonic and phasic inhibition are due to different mechanisms. In addition, Pyr9 induces a shift of the Na+ inactivation curve towards more hyperpolarized potentials, which is in agreement with a higher affinity of Pyr9 for inactivated than far resting Na+ channels.

AB  - The killing of Candida albicans by a series of amphiphilic quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) with different hydrocarbon chain lengths was closely related to the binding of the compounds to the cells and damage of the cell membranes, The membrane damage was measured as the level of release of the UV-absorbing material into the medium in which the cells were suspended and as the level of uptake of propidium iodide in individual cells by flow cytometry, It was shown that of the compounds tested, hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide [CTAB]) bound most efficiently. Tetradecyl betainate chloride (B14), tetradecanoylcholine bromide (C14), tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB), and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) followed and had declining degrees of binding efficiency, The proportion of CTAB bound was almost total at concentrations up to the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the compound, whereas that of B14 was somewhat smaller, For the two remaining tetradecyl compounds (C14 and TTAB), still smaller proportions were bound at low concentrations, but the proportions rose disproportionally at increasing concentrations to a distinct maximum at concentrations of 0.2 to 0.5 times the CMC, We propose that interfacial micelle-like aggregates are formed at the cell surface as a step in the binding process, An analogous, but less conspicuous, maximum was seen for DTAB, Thus, great differences in the binding affinity of QACs with different hydrocarbon chains at different concentrations to C, albicans were observed, These differences were related to the CMC of the compound, In contrast, the binding of TTAB to Salmonella typhimurium 395 MS was almost total at low as well as high concentrations until saturation was attained, indicating fundamental differences between binding to the yeast and binding to gram-negative bacteria, The importance of lipid-type complexes or aggregates to the antifungal effect of membrane-active substances are discussed.

AB  - The fungus-feeding beetle, Carpophilus freemani, consumed equal quantities of young mycelia, fewer phialides bearing mature spores and much fewer phialides bearing developing spores of Aspergillus restrictus compared to those of Aspergillus nidulans when tested in diet choice assays. The degree to which specific fungal structures were consumed was inversely related to the localization of high levels of restrictocin, a ribosome-inactivating protein, to those structures. Pure restrictocin added to the insect diet at 1000 p.p.m. killed 38.5 % of C. freemani larvae and 62.5 % of Spodoptera frugiperda larvae in 48 h, but did not affect C. freemani adults or Helicoverpa lea larvae over the same interval. In diet choice assays, 1000 p.p.m. of restrictocin deterred feeding by adult C. freemani and Sitophilus zeamais compared to control diets. Thus, restrictocin production and localization may have a natural defensive role against insect feeding at times critical to spore formation by A. restrictus, and may have potential as an insect control agent.

T2  - VEGETABLE CROPS AGRIBUSINESS, PROCEEDINGS

CP  - Workshop on Vegetable Crops Agribusiness
AB  - Women's involvement in agriculture has started since time immemorial. They play an important role in crop production as well as in livestock and fisheries. Women are effective managers of farming operations to a much greater degree than what is evident from national statistics because it is not socially acceptable for women to be involved in the field of agriculture. Women in very small land holding have the highest involvement in agriculture, followed by women in landless, small and medium sized holdings.
   Most household fruit and vegetable gardens that supplement the family food consumption become the women's responsibility. The male members are more involved in fertilizer and insecticide applications and in selling the produce to the market. Women are more involved in seed collection, seed storage, water management, fertilizer application daily maintenance, harvesting and even in field-laced vegetable production. Women and children's participation is predominant in weeding, watering and specially, harvesting of different vegetables and spices.
   In case of tribal people, vegetable growing fields are mostly cared for by the women. The tribal women of Garo, Chakma and Marma are traditionally managers and workers of their agricultural lands. Urban women are also often found to be eager to grow vegetables in the homestead.
   The contribution of homestead crops to the total food production has remained largely invisible. Its contribution to the family income is even less known, although there are indications that such income could be quite significant. The performance of small, marginal and landless households in terms of average returns per decimal of homestead land is reported to be far superior from large household due to more intensive labor inputs on the part of women in poor households. Traditionally, rural and urban women are also involved in home preservation of vegetables. Women's contribution to family health and nutrition is highly important.
   One-third to half of vegetables, spices, and fruits grown in the homestead are sold to supplement the family income. Among homestead activities, vegetable cultivation contributes two to six percent and tree cultivation is one to 22 % of total income varying according to location. Although, women are primarily responsible for homestead crop production, the marketing of homestead produced is not entirely under their control, In general, women in landless, marginal, and small farm households are directly involved in marketing of fruits and vegetables more often than women in medium and large households.
   Women control their income in nearly all female headed households, irrespective of homestead size. In male headed households the control of income varies considerably according to who sells homestead crops. When the wife sells the crops or the children, the wife retains control to most of the income.
   Because of their wide and long-standing experience with women groups and members, NGOs are promoting the participation of women in vegetable production, consumption and utilization. But the extent of their institutional support to women in vegetable production varies considerably.

AB  - Despite much debate over a presumptively somatic vs psychological etiology of nonatopic food and chemical sensitivities, little systematic research has addressed the issues. The present study investigated self-reported illness from several common foods (wheat, dairy, eggs) and chemicals (pesticide, car exhaust, paint, perfume, new carpet), symptom patterns, and psychological profiles of a sample of young adult college students (n = 490, age 19.4 +/- 2.4, 52% female/48% male). Subjects were divided into 4 groups on the basis of sample medians for frequency of illness from the foods (FI) and chemicals (CI): high FI with high CI (FI/CI), high FI alone, high CI alone, and NOILL (low FI and CI). FI was associated with more defensiveness (denial of negativity) while CI was linked with more shyness (avoidance of novelty). Women outnumbered men in all groups (FI/CI: 61%; FI: 80% ; CI: 55%) except the NOILL (40% women). Nevertheless, the FI/CI, FI, and/or CI groups still had significantly higher total symptom scores as well as more indigestion, headache, and memory trouble than did the NOILL group, even after depression, anxiety, shyness, defensiveness, and gender were covaried. The illness groups reported significantly more limitation of foods that mobilize endogenous opioids or generate exogenous opioids (sweets, fats, bread) as well as more illness from opiate drugs, small amounts of beverage alcohol, and late meals. Nasal symptoms from pollens or animals were more common in the FI/CI (42%) and CI (42%) than in FI (26%) or NOILL (28%) groups. Premenstrual tension syndrome and irritable bowel were also more common in the FI/CI group. The findings indicate that young adults outside the clinical setting who are relatively higher in FI and/or CI have distinctive symptom and psychological patterns. Covariate analyses suggest that important symptoms in FI and CI individuals such as indigestion, headache, and memory problems may occur in addition to rather than as simply part of emotional distress. The data are consistent with a previously hypothesized role of olfactory-limbic and hypothalamic pathways and with a time-dependent sensitization model for illness from foods and chemicals.

AB  - Parties interested in registering a pesticide chemical with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) must submit toxicity information to support the registration. Mutagenicity data are a part of the required information that must be submitted. This information is available to the public via Freedom of Information requests to the OPP. However, it is felt that this information would be more effectively and widely disseminated if presented in a published medium. Beginning with this publication, sets of mutagenicity data on pesticide chemicals will be periodically published in the Genetic Activity Profile (GAP) format. In addition, mutagenicity data extracted from the currently available open literature is also presented to provide a more complete database and to allow comparisons between the OPP-submitted data and other publicly available information.

AB  - OPP - This paper provides the rationale and support for the decisions the OPP will make in requiring and reviewing mutagenicity information. The regulatory requirement for mutagenicity testing to support a pesticide registration is found in the 40 CFR Part 158. The guidance as to the specific mutagenicity testing to be performed is found in the OPP's Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision F, Hazard Evaluation: Human and Domestic Animals (referred to as the Subdivision F guideline).
   A revised Subdivision F guideline has been presented that becomes the current guidance for submitters of mutagenicity data to the OPP. The decision to revise the guideline was the result of close examination of the version published in 1982 and the desire to update the guidance based on developments since then and current state-of-the-science. After undergoing Agency and public scrutiny, the revised guideline is to be published in 1991.
   The revised guideline consists of an initial battery of tests (the Salmonella assay, an in vitro mammalian gene mutation assay and an in vivo cytogenetics assay which may be either a bone marrow assay for chromosomal aberrations or for micronuclei formation) that should provide an adequate initial assessment of the potential mutagenicity of a chemical. Follow-up testing to clarify results from the initial testing may be necessary. After this information as well as all other relevant information is obtained, a weight-of-evidence decision will be made about the possible mutagenicity concern a chemical may present. Testing to pursue qualitative and/or quantitative evidence for assessing heritable risk in relation to human beings will then be considered if a mutagenicity concern exists. This testing may range from tests for evidence of gonadal exposure to dominant lethal testing to quantitative tests such as the specific locus and heritable translocation assays. The mutagenicity assessment will be performed in accordance with the Agency's Mutagenicity Risk Assessment Guidelines. The mutagenicity data would also be used in the weight-of-evidence consideration for the potential carcinogenicity of a chemical in accordance with the Agency's Carcinogen Risk Assessment Guidelines. In instances where there are triggers for carcinogenicity testing, mutagenicity data may be used as one of the triggers after a consideration of available information.
   It is felt that the revised Subdivision F guideline will provide appropriate, and more specific, guidance concerning the OPP approach to mutagenicity testing for the registration of a pesticide. It also provides a clearer understanding of how the OPP will proceed with its evaluation and decision making concerning the potential heritable effects of a test chemical.
   OTS - As a result of recent information in the field of mutagenicity (the Williamsburg meeting, its precedents and sequelae), a modification to the Section 4 test scheme has been proposed. In the proposal, test schemes for gene mutation and chromosomal aberrations are combined. The revision comprises three tests in the initial tier: the Salmonella assay, an in vitro assay for gene mutation and an in vivo assay for chromosomal effects which may be either a bone marrow assay for chromosomal aberrations or the micronucleus assay.
   Since submission of this article for publication, the proposed OTS test scheme has been approved by OTS management. The old two scheme, four test scheme is no longer in effect, and will no longer be used in future TSCA Section 4 Test Rules.
   Under Section 5 of TSCA ("new" chemical, or Premanufacture Notice (PMN)), mutagenicity data are used for three purposes: (1) as part of exposure based testing; (2) to assess the potential of the PMN chemical to induce heritable genetic effects; and (3) as part of the weight-of-evidence that a chemical may be a potential carcinogen.
   As part of the exposure based testing program, the USEPA has required testing of certain high volume chemicals with a two test battery of the Salmonella assay and a mouse micronucleus assay. In supporting a concern for potential carcinogenicity of a PMN chemical, the USEPA generally cites data on an analogue which is known to be carcinogenic (i.e., demonstrated tumor forming ability in one or more animal studies). In such instances, mutagenicity data on the PMN chemical or on the analogues are used to lend support to the case for potential carcinogenicity. Where there is no analogue of the PMN chemical which has been tested for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity data alone are generally not considered sufficient to support a concern for potential carcinogenicity. Regulatory action under Section 5 is seldom, if ever, taken on the basis of mutagenicity data alone, especially on the basis of in vitro mutagenicity data.
