AB  - Performing appropriate mating behaviors is crucial to male reproductive success, especially in species where mating is predominantly via female mate choice. Mating behaviors are hormonally regulated and may be sexually selected traits: courtship displays are selected via mate choice, while forced copulations and aggressive behaviors are selected for via intrasexual competition. Endocrine disrupting compounds interfere with proper hormonal functioning in exposed animals. Exposures during developmentally crucial life stages can have irreversible effects lasting through adulthood. I tested the effects of prenatal exposure to environmentally relevant doses of a commonly used herbicide, atrazine (1 and 13.5 mu g/L) on mating behaviors in male guppies. Guppies were used as a model organism to test the effects of atrazine exposure on wildlife reproductive health. Adult female guppies were mated and exposed to the treatments throughout the gestation period, and offspring born to them were raised without further treatment. At adulthood, the males were tested for the effects of prenatal exposure on their mating behaviors such as courtship displays, gonopodium swings, forced copulatory attempts, and competitive and aggressive behaviors towards rivals who were not exposed to atrazine. I also tested female preference for treated males compared to control males. Atrazine-exposed males were less likely to perform the mating behaviors, and performed them less frequently, than control males. Atrazine exposure also made males less aggressive towards rivals. Females preferred untreated males over atrazine-treated males. In all cases, a non-monotonic pattern was seen, highlighting the significance of low-dose exposures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In aquatic environments, externally developing eggs are in constant contact with the surrounding water, highlighting the significance of water parameters and pathogens for egg survival. In this study we tested the impact of water salinity, egg density and infection potential of the environment on egg viability in the sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus), a small fish that exhibits paternal egg care and has a marine origin, but which in the Baltic Sea lives in brackish water. To manipulate the infection potential of the environment, we added either a Saprolegnia infection vector into UV-filtered water or a fungicide into natural Baltic Sea water. Saprolegnia are widely spread water moulds that are a key cause of egg mortality in aquatic organisms in fresh- and brackish water. We found that increased water salinity indeed decreased the egg infection rate and had a positive effect on egg viability, while high egg density tended to have the opposite effect. However, the different factors influenced egg viability interactively, with a higher egg density having negative effects at low, but not in high, salinity. Thus, the challenges facing marine organisms adapting to lower salinity levels can be amplified by Saprolegnia infections that reduce egg survival in interaction with other environmental factors. Our results support the hypothesis that suppressing egg infections is an important aspect of parental care that can select for filial cannibalism, a common but poorly understood behaviour, especially in fish with parental care.

AB  - Fish are warned about the presence of predators via an alarm cue released from the skin of injured conspecifics. The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 mu g/L. of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation.

AB  - Previous research has suggested that certain environmental pollutants interfere with the perception of chemical stimuli. It is not clear if this interference comes from masking the odor, where the animal cannot detect the signal over the background noise, or if there is a physiological effect on the olfactory receptor cells or neuromusculature that influences the animal's behavior. We acutely exposed crayfish to the agricultural chemical metolachlor. We then tested the ability of crayfish to respond appropriately to 2 chemical stimuli important to their survival: 1) detection of damaged conspecifics, and 2) location of a food source in the absence of metolachlor. A damaged conspecific, commonly known as an alarm signal, produces a chemical signal composed of bodily fluids that could signify a predation event to the individual receiving the signal. Results indicated that crayfish were unable to successfully locate a food source after being exposed to metolachlor. In the presence of an alarm signal, animals exposed to metolachlor walked faster than nonexposed animals and tended to walk in the direction of the alarm signal instead of away, as in the control animals. Crayfish may perceive aspects of the chemical signal but make inappropriate decisions in response to the information received as a result of exposure to metolachlor.

AB  - Understanding the negative impact of a variety of environmental contaminants on aquatic animals is essential to curb biodiversity loss and stop degradation of ecological functions. Excessive and unrestricted use of pesticides is the most serious threat to aquatic animals including amphibians and fishes. Among the known pesticides, glyphosate based formulations have been shown to have lethal effects on many aquatic organisms. However, negative effects of pesticides on crucial ecological interactions such as prey-predator interactions are relatively unknown from tropics. In many aquatic organisms, recognition of predators is based on odor signatures; and therefore any anthropogenic alteration in water chemistry has the potential to impair recognition and learning of predators. Through a series of behavioral experiments we evaluated the effect of glyphosate based herbicide (Roundup (R)) on the antipredator behavior of common spiny loach, Lepidocephalichthys thermalis to understand the effects of pesticide-exposure on recognition of conspecific alarm cues, and associative learning to avoid predation. We exposed common spiny loach (for 3h or 15 days) to sub-lethal concentration (0.5mg a.e./L) of Roundup (R) and subsequently with conspecific alarm cues, signaling the proximity of a predator. Unexposed prey fish showed a significant reduction in activity level in response to conspecific alarm cues. Whereas such alarm response was not observed in prey fish that were exposed to Roundup (R) either for 3h or 15 days. Such lack of response could be associated with alteration of olfactory function in prey individuals. However, this inability to detect the conspecific alarm cues was found to be transient and exposed fish recovered within 2 days. In subsequent experiments, we showed that Roundup (R) deactivates the conspecific alarm cues thus making them unavailable for prey to evoke the response. Furthermore, Roundup (R) mediated degradation of conspecific alarm cues and diminished the associative learning necessary for detection of the invasive/unknown/novel predators. Overall, due to the worldwide occurrence of glyphosate in water bodies, glyphosate mediated behavioral suppression exposes the prey animals to a considerable risk of predation, both by native and non-native predators.

AB  - Neurotoxic pesticides are known to contaminate surface waters that provide habitat for salmonids, including some listed for protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Despite their widespread use, the impacts of these pesticides on the neurological health of wild salmon are not well understood. Of particular concern are the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides that block synaptic transmission by inhibiting neuronal acetylcholinesterase. Here we assess the effects of diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, on alarm pheromone induced antipredator responses and homing behavior in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Nominal exposure concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mu g.L-1) were chosen to emulate diazinon pulses in the natural environment. In the antipredator study, diazinon had no effect on swimming behavior or visually guided food capture. However, the pesticide significantly inhibited olfactory-mediated alarm responses at concentrations as low as 1.0 mu g.L-1. Similarly, homing behavior was impaired at 10.0 mu g.L-1. Our results suggest that olfactory-mediated behaviors are sensitive to anticholinesterase neurotoxicity in salmonids and that short-term, sublethal exposures to these insecticides may cause significant behavioral deficits. Such deficits may have negative consequences for survival and reproductive success in these fish.

AB  - This review attempts to integrate pollution research with behavioural ecology by focusing on reproductive behaviour of fishes. A search of Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts and other sources showed that only 0.1% of 19,199 studies of aquatic pollution and fishes during the past 20 years have made this link. Effects on parental care and courtship have been investigated using a variety of pollutants (e.g. acidification, herbicide, thermal effluent) in several fish families (e.g. Cichlidae, Poeciliidae, Gasterosteidae, Cyprinidae).
   Eleven of the 19 studies found a change in behaviour from the norm. Effects on courtship included decreases or increases in frequency of displays, increased courtship duration, or performance of male-like behaviour by masculinized females. Studies of parental care have found decreased nest-building activity, decreased offspring defence, or changes in division of parental care between the sexes. Few studies have measured reproductive success or extrapolated their results to effects on populations.
   We develop a framework for exploring links between pollution and behavioural ecology which suggests potential impacts on life history trade-offs in reproduction, genetic changes in populations, and population sizes. Many reproductive behaviours of fish species are readily quantifiable and behaviours such as courtship by male guppies and other members of the Poeciliidae show some promise for pollution monitoring and behavioural toxicity tests. Choice of such assays would have to compete with the sensitivity and practicality of more traditional methods but may serve as useful complements. There is considerable scope for further research into conservation. A synthesis between behavioural ecology and toxicology should thus provide useful insights for both fields.

AB  - Male mating signals, including ornaments and courtship displays, and other sexually selected traits, like male-male aggression, are largely controlled by sex hormones. Environmental pollutants, notably endocrine disrupting compounds, can interfere with the proper functioning of hormones, thereby impacting the expression of hormonally regulated traits. Atrazine, one of the most widely used herbicides, can alter sex hormone levels in exposed animals. I tested the effects of environmentally relevant atrazine exposures on mating signals and behaviors in male guppies, a sexually dimorphic freshwater fish. Prolonged atrazine exposure reduced the expression of two honest signals: the area of orange spots (ornaments) and the number of courtship displays performed. Atrazine exposure also reduced aggression towards competing males in the context of mate competition. In the wild, exposure levels vary among individuals because of differential distribution of the pollutants across habitats; hence, differently impacted males often compete for the same mates. Disrupted mating signals can reduce reproductive success as females avoid mating with perceptibly suboptimal males. Less aggressive males are at a competitive disadvantage and lose access to females. This study highlights the effects of atrazine on ecologically relevant mating signals and behaviors in exposed wildlife. Altered reproductive traits have important implications for population dynamics, evolutionary patterns, and conservation of wildlife species.

AB  - In order to assess the quality of streams susceptible to contamination by pesticides we apply biochemical and genotoxic biomarkers in the Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus submitted to in situ tests. Fish were caged, for 96 h, in two streams located in areas with intensive use of pesticides, the Apertados (AP) and the Jacutinga (JC), and in a small stream(Godoy stream-GD) found inside a forest fragment adjacent to a State Park. Biochemical parameters, such as biotransformation enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), non-protein thiols (NPSH), lipoperoxidation (LPO), protein carbonylation (PCO) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were evaluated in various fish organs, as well as genotoxic biomarkers (damage to DNA and occurrence of micronuclei and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities). Samples of water and sediment were collected for analysis of metals (Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, Mn, Cd and Zn), organochloride pesticides, and triazine and glyphosate herbicides. We observed an increase in liver GST activity in fish at AP and gill GST activity in fish at JC. An increase in liver LPO was also observed in fish exposed to AP and JC. The same animals also exhibited increased DNA damage and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) compared to the fish kept in GD. A number of compounds showed concentrations higher than the permitted levels, in particular, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), itsmetabolites dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH), heptachloride, diclofluanid and aldrins. These pesticides were detected at higher concentrations in water and sediment samples from AP, followed by JC and GD. The Integrated Biomarker Response Index (IBR) indicated that AP and JC (AP: 21.7 > JC: 18.5 > GD: 12.6) have the worst environmental quality. Integrated biomarker analysis revealed that the alterations observed related well with the levels of environmental contaminants, demonstrating the effectiveness of this biomonitoring approach.

AB  - Guppy (Poecilia reticulata) was selected to investigate the effects of chlorpyrifos on reproductive performances. Male and female guppy with proven fertility were selected from our own colony and the groups of fish (n = 72/group) were exposed to pre-determined chlorpyrifos concentrations (0.002 mug/l, 2 mug/l) based on the 96-h LC50 for guppy. Mating behavior of males was recorded on the 2nd day of exposure. Offspring were counted and survival recorded on the 14th day. Gonopodial thrusts (8/15 min) in 0.002 mug/l and (4/15 min) in 2 mug/l were significantly different from the control group (11/15 min). Similarly, live birth reduced significantly to 8/female in 2 mug/l compared to 27/female in the control group. Survival of offspring after 14 days was reduced to 47% in the 2 mug/l group compared to 94% of survival in the control. Our findings demonstrate that low soluble concentrations of chlorpyrifos affect mating behavior, number of offspring and offspring survival of guppy. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of cellular defense against oxidative stress and correlated with classical toxicological endpoints. In vitro methods using fish cell lines for the assessment of aquatic toxicity are needed for mechanistic studies and as an alternative to in vivo. We describe an in vitro assay to study oxidative stress using zebrafish cell lines. Transfection efficiency of twelve commercially available transfection reagents were tested in the zebrafish cell lines ZFL, ZF4, and Pac2. The most efficient reagent for each cell line was selected for further experiments. Cells were transiently transfected with an Nrf2-responsive luciferase plasmid. The assay was tested using the oxidative stress inducing chemicals tertbutylhydroquinone, hydrogen peroxide, and sulforaphane. Of the transfected cell lines, ZF4 and ZFL showed higher sensitivity. The latter were used to study potential oxidative stress induced by pesticides (diazinon, deltamethrin, atrazine, metazachlor, terbutylazine, diuron). Besides known inducers, Nrf2 activity was also significantly induced by diazinon, deltametrin, diuron, and metazachlor. Activation of Nrf2 by metazachlor is a novel finding. The described assay could be a valuable tool for research in toxicology to study the stress response of both pure chemicals and environmental water samples.

AB  - Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed to concentrations of 0.01, 0.10, and 1.0 mug/L of the pesticide endosulfan for 24 h beginning either 4-6 h postfertilization or 4-6 h posthatch to determine effects on hatching time, growth, mobility, foraging ability, and reproduction. Eggs exposed to endosulfan took longer to hatch, and the resulting fry were smaller at 1 week of age and had decreased mobility at 2 weeks of age. Upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals also produced fewer eggs, and these eggs took significantly longer to hatch. Medaka exposed to endosulfan shortly after hatching did not differ in early mobility or foraging ability. Interestingly, upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals produced more eggs than did unexposed females. The observed effects were not dose-dependent, with medaka exposed to intermediate concentrations of endosulfan (0.10 mug/L) exhibiting the greatest response. These results suggest that short-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of a common pesticide may have long-term effects on growth, behavior, and reproduction in fish.

AB  - In recent decades, pyrethroid pesticides have been deemed a safer alternative to previously used pesticides. While some evidence supports this assumption in mammals and birds, exposure to certain pyrethroids can affect concentrations of hormones vital to reproduction in fish. Thus, we hypothesized that pyrethroid exposure impacts fish reproductive behavior and the expression of genes associated with reproduction. We tested our hypothesis by examining effects of the widely used pyrethroid pesticide, bifenthrin, on the reproductive behaviors of the broadly distributed livebearing western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis. We exposed sexually mature female fish to one of five environmentally relevant concentrations of bifenthrin and conducted behavioral assays to assess reproductive, social, and space use behaviors before and after exposure. We did not detect changes in behaviors measured in response to bifenthrin. However, exposure was associated with increased expression of an estrogen receptor gene (ER-alpha) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in brain tissue at bifenthrin concentrations at concentrations of 5.90 and 24.82 ng/L, and 5.90 and 12.21 ng/L, respectively. Our study supports the perspective that the use of multiple endpoints through integrative approaches is essential for understanding the cumulative impact of pollutants. Integrating physiological, morphological, and behavioral investigations of nonlethal concentrations of pollutants like bifenthrin may heighten our potential to predict their impact on individuals, populations, and communities.

AB  - The knowledge in oxidative stress in fish has a great importance for environmental and aquatic toxicology. Because oxidative stress is evoked by many chemicals including some pesticides, pro-oxidant factors' action in fish organism can be used to assess specific area pollution or world sea pollution.
   Hepatotoxic effect of DDT may be related with lipid peroxidation. Releasing of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after HCB exposure can be realized via two ways: via the uncoupling of the electron transport chain from monooxygenase activity and via metabolism of HCB major metabolite pentachlorophenol. Chlorothalonil disrupts mitochondrial metabolism due to the impairment of NADPH oxidase function. Activation of spleen macrophages and a decrease of catalase (CAT) activity have been observed after endosulfan exposure. Excessive release of superoxide radicals after etoxazole exposure can cause a decrease of CAT activity and increase phagocytic activity of splenocytes. Anticholinergic activity of organo-phosphates leads to the accumulation of ROS and resulting lipid peroxidation. Carbaryl induces changes in the content of glutathione and antioxidant enzymes activities. The antioxidant enzymes changes have been observed after actuation of pesticides deltamethrin and cypermethrin. Bipyridyl herbicides are able to form redox cycles and thereby cause oxidative stress. Low concentrations of simazine do not cause oxidative stress in carps during sub-chronic tests while sublethal concentrations of atrazin can induce oxidative stress in bluegill sunfish. Butachlor causes increased activity of superoxide dismutase -catalase system in the kidney. Rotenon can inhibit the electron transport in mitochondria and thereby increase ROS production. Dichloroaniline, the metabolite of diuron, has oxidative effects. Oxidative damage from fenpyroximate actuation is related to the disruption of mitochondrial redox respiratory chain. Low concentration of glyphosate can cause mild oxidative stress.

AB  - Oxidative stress parameters and some antioxidant defense systems in the liver of Carassius auratus exposed to glyphosate and its formulation (Roundup (R)) have been studied. Fish were exposed to glyphosate and its formulation at concentrations of 0.032, 0.16, 0.8, and 4.0mg L-1, all calculated on glyphosate basis, for 11days. Hydroxyl radical generation as determined by electron spin resonance spectroscopy of its spin-adduct with -phenyl-t-butyl nitrone increased with the concentration of Roundup (R). Superoxide dismutase activities were decreased relative to control by 21%-46% when exposed to glyphosate and 45%-52% when exposed to Roundup (R), suggesting that the formulation is more toxic than glyphosate alone. Catalase showed no difference between both groups.

AB  - Environmental contaminants have been identified as endocrine disruptors through their antiandrogenic activity. Thus, as androgen receptor antagonists, the fungicide vinclozolin and the principal DDT metabolite p,p ' -DDE have been demonstrated to induce demasculinization in rats. Whether this is also the case in fish remains to be demonstrated. For a period of 30 days, groups of adult male guppies were exposed to vinclozolin, p,p ' -DDE, or the therapeutic antiandrogen flutamide (used as positive control) applied to the fodder at concentrations between 0.1 and 100 mug/g fodder. Subsequently, sexual characteristics of relevance to the male reproductive capacity were measured and compared with untreated control fish. All three chemicals caused profound alterations at increasing levels of biological organization, even in these fully matured males. At the cellular level, the three compounds induced a significant reduction in the number of ejaculated sperm cells. At the organ level, the sexually attractive orange-yellow coloration was reduced in area and discolored, and treated fish also had smaller testes. Further, at the organismal level, computer-aided behavior analyses demonstrated a severe disruption in male courtship behavior. We conclude that this demasculinization is consistent with an antiandrogenic action of vinclozolin and p,p ' -DDE and is likely to compromise reproductive capability in this fish.

AB  - Fish behaviors have great potential as models for the study of pharmacology, genetics, and neuroscience. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rams) are popular freshwater animal models. However, their behavioral use in aquatic toxicology research is generally ham pered by oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are not well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented a comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e.,anxiety-like behavior, novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory). We found that only medaka (d-rR) presented a weak or no response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus. In addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the three species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01% v/v carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and DMSO). In contrast to zebrafish and Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes in spatial memory after subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5 mu g/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead, a hyperactivity response in the open field test and reduced social time were induced by cpf and imidacloprid, respectively. Our results suggest that: (1) behavioral effects are negligible when using <0.01% v/v carrier solvents for behavioral assessment: (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be insufficient for estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other environmental contaminants. In conclusion, these results could have major implications for aquatic toxicology research and water quality monitoring and ecoioxicological risk assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Behavioral sequences of the medaka (Oryzias latipes) were continuously investigated through an automatic image recognition system in response to medaka treated with the insecticide and medaka not treated with the insecticide, diazinon (0.1 mg/l) during a 1 hour period. The observation of behavior through the movement tracking program showed many patterns of the medaka, After much observation, behavioral patterns were divided into four basic patterns: active-smooth, active-shaking, inactive-smooth, and inactive-shaking. The "smooth" and "shaking" patterns were shown as normal movement behavior. However, the "shaking" pattern was more frequently observed than the "smooth" pattern in medaka specimens that were treated with insecticide. Each pattern was classified using a devised decision tree after the feature choice. It provides a natural way to incorporate prior knowledge from human experts in fish behavior and contains the information in a logical expression tree. The main focus of this study was to determine whether the decision tree could be useful for interpreting and classifying behavior patterns of the medaka.

AB  - It has been thoroughly established that the fungicide vinclozolin and the persistent DDT metabolite p,p'-DDE, can function as antiandrogens in mammals in a manner similar to the therapeutic antiandrogen flutamide. In mammals, these chemicals bind the androgen receptor and prevent the transcription of the associated genes causing abnormal sexual development and demasculinization. There are few similar studies in fish and so far it has not been demonstrated that these chemicals have any antiandrogenic effects in this group. In the present study, juvenile guppies (Poccilia reticulata) were fed sublethal doses of vinclozolin, p,p'-DDE or flutamide from birth to adulthood. At sexual maturity, we measured a suite of male sexual characteristics that are known to be under androgen control. All three chemicals caused a reduction in the orange display coloration, inhibited gonopodium development. reduced the sperm count and suppressed courtship behaviour, in a manner consistent with antiandrogen action. Only the gonodosomatic index was unaffected by the treatments. In addition, the three chemicals skewed the sex ratio at adulthood and caused delayed maturation. The altered characters are all considered to be important for male mating success and their impairment indicates that antiandrogens may seriously compromise male reproductive fitness.

AB  - Specimens of medaka (Oryzias latipes) were observed continuously through an automatic image recognition system before and after treatments of an anti-cholinesterase insecticide, diazinon (0.1 mg/l), for 4 days in semi-natural conditions (2 days before treatment and 2 days after treatment). The "smooth" pattern was typically shown as a normal movement behavior, while the "shaking" pattern was frequently observed after treatments of diazinon. These smooth and shaking patterns were selected for training with an artificial neural network. Parameters characterizing the movement tracks, such as speed, degree of backward movements, stop duration, turning rate, meander, and maximum distance movements in the y-axis of 1-min duration, were given as input (six nodes) to a multi-layer perceptron with the backpropagation algorithm. Binary information for the smooth and shaking patterns was separately given as the matching output (one node), while eight nodes were assigned to a single hidden layer. As new input data were given to the trained network, it was possible to recognize the smooth and shaking patterns of the new input data. Average recognition rates of the smooth pattern decreased significantly while those for the shaking pattern increased to a higher degree after treatments of diazinon. The trained network was able to reveal the difference in the shaking pattern in different light phases before treatments of diazinon. This study demonstrated that artificial neural networks could be useful for detecting the presence of toxic chemicals in the environment by serving as in-situ behavioral monitoring tools.

AB  - Because chemicals introduced into the environment by humans can affect both long-term survivorship and reproduction of amphibians, discovering the specific mechanisms through which these chemicals act may facilitate the development of plans for amphibian conservation. We investigated the amphibian pheromonal system as a potential target of common environmental chemicals. By treating female red-spotted newts, Notophthalmus viridescens, to a commonly used insecticide, endosulfan, we found that the pheromonal system is highly susceptible to low-concentration exposure. The impairment of the pheromonal system directly led to disrupted mate choice and lowered mating success. There were no other notable physiologic or behavioral changes demonstrated by the animals at the insecticide concentrations administered. Our findings suggest that the amphibian pheromonal system is one of the systems subject to subtle negative effects of environmental chemicals.

AB  - Aquatic systems are subjected to various sources of stress due to global changes, such as increasing temperature and pollution. A major challenge for the next decade will be to evaluate the combined effects of these multiple stressors on organisms and ecosystems. For organisms submitted to chemical, biological or physical stressors, the capacity to set up an efficient adaptive response is a fundamental prerequisite for their long-term survival and performance. In this study, goldfish (Carassius auratus) were subjected to individual and combined pesticide mixtures and increased temperatures to evaluate their adaptive response in multistress conditions from the molecular to the individual level. Fish were exposed for 16 days to a mixture of pesticides at environmental relevant concentrations (S-metolachlor, isoproturon, linuron, atrazine-desethyl, aclonifen, pendimethalin and tebuconazole) and at two temperatures (22 degrees C and 32 degrees C). Three major physiological traits of the stress response were measured: the hormonal response (i.e. plasma cortisol), the metabolic balance from molecular to individuals' levels (metabolomics, cellular energy allocation, energy reserves and global condition indexes), and the cellular defense system induction (SOD, CAT and GST). Results show that (1) environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides lead to significant responses in fish at all biological levels; (2) the metabolic response depends on the nature of stress (thermal vs. chemical); and (3) fish may be unable to set up an efficient adaptive response when chemical and thermal stresses were combined, with adverse outcomes at the individuals' level.

AB  - Diuron, a commonly used herbicide and antifouling biocide, has been frequently detected in seawater. The effects of diuron on fish behaviour are currently poorly understood. Herein, the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was continuously exposed to environmentally realistic levels of diuron from the fertilised egg stage to the adult stage. Behavioural evaluation of adult marine medaka indicated that exposure to diuron increased anxiety in the light-dark test and increased predator avoidance. In addition, diumn exposure significantly reduced aggression, social interaction, shoaling, and learning and memory ability. However, only negligible variations in foraging behaviour and in behaviour in the novel tank test were observed. Marine medaka chronically exposed to diuron also showed decreased levels of dopamine in the brain, and changes were observed in the transcription of genes related to dopamine synthesis, degradation and receptors. Exposure to 5000 ng/L diumn caused significant downregulation of the expression of the genes of tyrosine hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase and significantly upregulated the expression of the genes of the D-5 dopaminergic receptor. The relative expression of the D-4 dopaminergic receptor was significantly upregulated in the 50, 500 and 5000 ng/L diuron-treated groups. These findings highlight the significant neumtoxic effects of diumn and the extent to which this may involve the dopaminergic system of the brain. More broadly, this study reveals the ecological risk associated with environmentally realistic levels of diuron in marine animals.

AB  - Experiments were performed in goldfish to determine the effects of a short-term exposure (24 h) to atrazine or diuron (0.5, 5, 50 mu g/L) on some behavior endpoints related to swimming and social activities. Observations were also made to assess the influence of such exposure on the behavioral responses of fish to the flow of a crude skin extract solution from conspecifics, active in social chemocommunication and producing alarm behaviors. Additive tests were run to check the behavioral responses of previously unexposed goldfish to the flow of a solution of atrazine- or diuron-contaminated water, at three concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L). Significant burst swimming reactions appeared in response to a 24-h exposure to atrazine, at the lowest concentration tested (0.5 mu g/L). A 24-h exposure to 5 mu g/L atrazine or diuron was found to induce various significant behavioral alterations in fish. At this concentration, both herbicides decreased grouping behavior and atrazine also increased surfacing activity. Herbicide-exposed fish showed a decreased grouping behavior during the flow of the skin extract solution. Sheltering was also decreased during the Row of the biological solution in fish exposed to atrazine. Moreover, fish exposed to diuron clearly displayed attraction responses to the how of the skin solution. Previously unexposed fish showed a significant increase in burst swimming reactions in response to the flow of a solution of atrazine- or diuron-contaminated water, at all concentrations tested (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L). Furthermore, the diuron-contaminated flow was found to be significantly attractive at the highest concentration. These results indicate that a short-term exposure to a relatively low concentration (5 mu g/L) of atrazine or diuron can affect various behaviors of fish not only directly but also indirectly by altering the chemical perception of natural substances of eco-ethological importance. In consideration of the basic role of olfaction in fish behavior, these results also emphasize the need for further developments on the possible effects of aquatic toxicants on olfactory-mediated behaviors.

AB  - Cannibalism in O-group Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was investigated in a semi-natural marine pond using stomach content analysis. About 6000 individuals were eradicated by rotenone treatment of the pond in November 1991. Total lengths of cod ranged from 7.4-28.8 cm with a median of 10.4 cm. The proportion of cannibalistic cod in the population was estimated at 1.3%. Cannibalism accounted for a daily loss of 1.1% of the population. The frequency of cod with greater than or equal to 2 cod prey per stomach was higher in the population compared with a Poisson model. Predator-prey length ratios ranged between 1.6 and 3.2 when estimated from otolith-length relationships. Chesson's 1983 alpha-index indicated that cannibalistic cod had a positive selectivity for conspecifics < 9.0 cm in total length.

AB  - Glyphosate has become the most widely used herbicide in the world, due to the wide scale adoption of transgenic glyphosate resistant crops after its introduction in 1996. Glyphosate may be used alone, but it is commonly applied as an active ingredient of the herbicide Roundup (R). This pesticide contains several adjuvants, which may promote an unknown toxicity. The indiscriminate application poses numerous problems, both for the health of the applicators and consumers, and for the environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death of plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio redo) is quickly gaining popularity in behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals, sensitivity to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost, short spawning intervals, external fertilization, transparency of embryos through larval stages, and rapid development. The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of glyphosate and Roundup on behavioral and morphological parameters in zebrafish larvae and adults. Zebrafish larvae at 3 days post-fertilization and adults were exposed to glyphosate (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5 mg/L) or Roundup (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5 mg/L) for 96 h. Immediately after the exposure, we performed the analysis of locomotor activity, aversive behavior, and morphology for the larvae and exploratory behavior, aggression and inhibitory avoidance memory for adult zebrafish. In zebrafish larvae, there were significant differences in the locomotor activity and aversive behavior after glyphosate or Roundup' exposure when compared to the control group. Our findings demonstrated that exposure to glyphosate at the concentration of 0.5 mg/L, Roundup at 0.065 or 0.5 mg/L reduced the distance traveled, the mean speed and the line crossings in adult zebrafish. A decreased ocular distance was observed for larvae exposed at 0.5 mg/L of glyphosate. We verified that at 0.5 mg/L of Roundup"-treated adult zebrafish demonstrated a significant impairment in memory. Both glyphosate and Roundup (R) reduced aggressive behavior. Our data suggest that there are small differences between the effects induced by glyphosate and Roundup', altering morphological and behavioral parameters in zebrafish, suggesting common mechanisms of toxicity and cellular response.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the biological effects triggered by the application of a current-use mixture of pesticides (the herbicide glyphosate, the insecticide bifenthrin, BF, and the fungicides azoxystrobin, AZ, and cyproconazole, CYP) on two native fish (Markiana nigripinnis and Astyanax lacustris) inhabiting a rice field. We analyzed pesticide residues in water, sediment and fish samples 21 days before and after a fumigation event. Additionally, organismic indices, oxidative stress and neurotoxicity biomarkers in fish at both sampling periods were compared. After fumigation, glyphosate, BF, AZ and CYP were detected in water and sediment samples, being also bioaccumulated in both fish species. A decreasing condition factor in A. lacustris and a higher liver somatic index in M. nigripinnis were observed as well. Overall, results showed that, after the application of the pesticide mixture, antioxidant mechanisms failed to prevent oxidative damage in the liver and gills of M. nigripinnis. Meanwhile, A. lacustris showed a different response: an inhibition of the antioxidant defenses without tissue lipid oxidative damage. Furthermore, acetylcholinesterase activity after spraying was significantly reduced in brain and muscle tissues of A. lacustris and in the brain of M. nigripinnis. Our results show that currentuse pesticides, like glyphosate, BF, AZ and CYP, pose health risks on native fish populations inhabiting rice fields.

AB  - Atrazine and Diuron are widely used herbicides. The use of pesticides contaminates the aquatic environment, threatening biodiversity and non-target organisms such as fish. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute exposure for 96 h hours to atrazine and diuron commercial formulations in zebrafish (Danio rerio, wild-type AB) embryos and larvae and adult stages. We observed a significant concentration-dependent survival decrease and hatching delays in animals exposed to both herbicides and in the frequency of malformations compared to the control groups. Morphological defects included cardiac edema, tail reduction, and head malformation. At 7 days post-fertilization (dpf), atrazine exposure resulted in a reduction in the head length at 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L and increased the ocular distance at 1, 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L atrazine when compared to controls. At the same age, diuron increased the ocular distance in animals exposed to diuron (1.0 and 1.5 mg/L) and no effects were observed on the head length. We also evaluated a behavioral repertoire in larvae at 7 dpf, and there were no significant differences in distance traveled, mean speed, time in movement, and thigmotaxis for atrazine and diuron when animals were individually placed in a new environment. The cognitive ability of the larvae was tested at 7 dpf for avoidance and optomotor responses, and neither atrazine nor diuron had significant impacts when treated groups were compared to their corresponding controls. Adults' behavior was evaluated 7 and 8 days after the end of the acute herbicide exposure. Exploration of a new environment and associated anxiety-like parameters, social interaction, and aggressiveness were not altered. Our results highlight the need for further studies on the sublethal effects of both herbicides and the consideration of the effects of commercial formulas vs. isolated active ingredients. It also emphasizes the need to take sublethal effects into consideration when establishing the environmental limits of residues.

AB  - The behavioral effects of short periods (2, 4, 6, 8 h) of static exposure to prochloraz (imidazole fungicide) and nicosulfuron (sulfonylurea herbicide) were recorded in goldfish (Carassius auratus). Observations were also made in an olfactometer to assess the effects of 8-h exposures to these two pesticides and to carbofuran (carbamate insecticide) on the behavioral responses to the flow of a solution of four L-amino acids (glycine, alanine, valine, taurine), mixed in the same relative proportions as in the urine of conspecifics. Each pesticide was tested at three sublethal concentrations (25, 50, 100 mug/L), and the behaviors recorded were related to swimming pattern, social interactions, and comfort movements. Static exposures to prochloraz affected horizontal displacements, burst swimming, grouping, and buccal movements. Static exposures to nicosulfuron affected burst swimming and grouping. In pesticide-unexposed fish (control), the flow of the amino acid solution induced attraction, decreased sheltering, and increased horizontal displacements, burst swimming, buccal movements, and antagonistic interactions. Compared to the controls, some of the behavioral responses to the solution of amino acids were significantly different after 8 It of subacute exposure to prochloraz and carbofuran. Both pesticides decreased attraction and increased sheltering. In addition, carbofuran decreased buccal movements and antagonistic interactions. Contrastingly, exposure to nicosulfuron showed no significant effect. This study further confirms the great vulnerability of fish behavior and chemocommunication processes to exposure to waterborne pesticides.

AB  - A heavy metal, copper, was exposed to indicator species, Daphnia magna in fresh water. Response behaviors were accordingly monitored by using models for pattern recognition. With computer interfacing techniques movement of indicator species was continuously observed in response to Cu2+ at low concentrations before (24 hours) and after (24 hours) the treatments. The movement tracks in 2-dimension were segmented into a short unit (30s). The parameters (e. g., speed, stop number and meander) in the movement data were trained with Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to classify behavioral patterns under the stressful condition of chemical treatments. The patterns in the designated time unit accordingly revealed the structural properties of movement data under the chemical stress. This study further suggested that models of pattern recognition such as SOM could be a useful tool in analyzing complex behavioral patterns of indicator species and in monitoring heavy metal exposure in environment in situ.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most widely used insecticides and has been found in both urban and rural water bodies. In this study, we studied variations in the social behavioral patterns, swimming behavior, and brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of Japanese medaka exposed to lethal (0.12 mg/L) and sublethal (0.012 mg/L) concentrations of CPF after different exposure times. Group behavior performance (schooling, shoaling, and solitary) was determined on day 4 of lethal exposure and on days 4, 8, and 12 of sublethal exposure. Swimming speed and brain AChE activity were measured on days 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 of sublethal CPF exposure. We observed significant decreases in social behavior and swimming speed (i.e., hypoactivity) in fish exposed to lethal CPF concentrations for 4 days. At the sublethal concentration, there was increased schooling duration and hyperactivity of fish on day 8 but not on day 4. In contrast, 12 days of sublethal CPF exposure resulted in social behavior responses similar to those after 4 days' lethal exposure, i.e., significant decreases in schooling frequency and duration with a notable increase in duration of solitary behavior. Brain AChE activity was inhibited in a time-dependent manner. Altered fish behavior in response to organophosphorus pesticides such as CPF may be mediated by more than AChE inhibition alone.

AB  - This report includes a detailed description of the reproductive behaviour of the freshwater crab Zilchiopsis collastinensis in the family Trichodactylidae and some observations on two other genera. It presents observations on the courtship, copulation, spawning, incubation and maternal care in Z. collastinensis. No discernible courtship behaviour occurred. We found instead that forced copulation is practised by males. Z. collastinensis copulations were observed in between April and October, for Dilocarcinus pagei between January and August, and throughout the year for Trichodactylus borellianus. The spawning behaviour of all of the species observed took place out of the water. Incubation lasted between 46 and 62days in D. pagei, 37 and 41days in Z. collastinensis and 8 and 12days in T. borellianus. The number of juveniles carried by each ovigerous female ranged from 651 +/- 172 in Z. collastinensis, through 582 +/- 8 in D. pagei to 63 +/- 33 in T. borellianus. The results support the proposition that members of the family Trichodactylidae, comprising exclusively endemic freshwater crabs, have evolved unusual adaptive reproductive behaviours to optimize their reproductive fitness in unstable environments.

AB  - The behavioral and biochemical responses of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to acute and subacute (sublethal) levels of chlorpyrifos were studied. In the acute exposure test, medaka were exposed to 0.018, 0.055, 0.166, or 0.500 mg L-1 chlorpyrifos for 4 d. As a result, fish showed hypoactivity compared to the control (at 0.018, 0.055, and 0.166 mg L-1, swimming speeds were 55.6%, 39.0%, and 27.3% those of the control), Brain acetylcholinesterase activity and swimming speed were significantly correlated. In the subacute toxicity test, medaka were exposed to 0.012 mg L-1 chlorpyrifos (10% of LC50) for 8 d. On day 4, there were no significant differences in behavioral and biochemical endpoints in exposed fish as compared to the control. On day 8, exposed fish became hyperactive, and the swimming speed of the social group increased to 2 times that of the control, whereas acetylcholinesterase activity was decreased to 68% that of the control. In addition, fish exhibited significant alterations in social behavior (schooling duration increased to 2.6 times and solitary duration decreased to 28% that of the control). Our findings clearly demonstrate a subacute effect of chlorpyrifos on the social behavior of medaka, which may pose a risk at population level because of the disturbance of social behavior. In addition, the recorded behavioral alterations may provide a useful tool for assessing the toxicity of organophosphorous pesticides to aquatic organisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study is the first to report sound production in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). Sound production was affected by exposure to the carbamate insecticide (aldicarb) and heavy-metal compound (copper sulfate). Medaka were exposed at four concentrations (aldicarb: 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg L-1; copper sulfate: 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg. L-1), and sound characteristics were monitored for 5 h after exposure. We observed constant average interpulse intervals (approx 0.2 s) in all test groups before exposure, and in the control groups throughout the experiment. The average interpulse interval became significantly longer during the recording periods after 50 min of exposure to aldicarb, and reached a length of more than 0.3 s during the recording periods after 120 min exposure. Most medaka fish stopped to produce sound after 50 min of exposure to copper sulfate at 1 and 2 mg L-1, resulting in significantly declined number of sound pulses and pulse groups. Relative shortened interpulse intervals of sound were occasionally observed in medaka fish exposed to 0.5 mg L-1 copper sulfate. These alternations in sound characteristics due to toxicants exposure suggested that they might impair acoustic communication of medaka fish, which may be important for their reproduction and survival. Our results suggested that using acoustic changes of medaka has potential to monitor precipitate water pollutions, such as intentional poisoning or accidental leakage of industrial waste.

AB  - Behavioral changes have been considered as appropriate to evaluate sublethal effects of pollutants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a mixture of pesticides, with glyphosate and 2,4-D (Gly + 2,4-D) as active ingredients, on the zooplankton evasion behavior from the fish Cnesterodon decemmaculatus. An increase in the evasion behavior was observed for copepods at two different concentrations of the Gly + 2,4-D mixture, for cladocerans at the lowest pesticide concentration, and for rotifers at the highest pesticide concentration. The response time to the fish signals also differed, being copepods faster than cladocerans and rotifers. All the exposed organisms showed higher variability in their distribution over time than those of controls (without pesticides). Our results suggest that the Gly + 2,4-D mixture formulations may have a mimetic effect with the fish alarm signals. The potential consequences of maladaptive responses triggered by pesticides, as well as the increased swimming activity, are discussed.

AB  - Reports in populations working or living in agricultural areas have associated pesticide exposure with adverse neurodevelopmental effects. More recent longitudinal studies in rural and urban areas have assessed exposure by measuring urine and blood biomarkers in children and mothers during pregnancy, thus allowing effects to be associated with a particular chemical family or pesticide. Prenatal exposure to persistent organochlorine insecticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and dichlorodiphenyldi-chloroethylene (DDE) is associated with developmental delays and possibly an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in agricultural areas. In Guadeloupe, impairments of fine motor skills in young children, particularly boys, have been associated with maternal concentrations during pregnancy of chlordecone (a persistent organochlorine insecticide formerly used on banana plantations). Studies of cohorts of children from several countries describe various neurodevelopmental impairments associated with the highest maternal concentrations of organophosphates and chiorpyrifos insecticide metabolites measured during pregnancy. These include disturbances in psychomotor development, impaired visual function, cognitive and attention deficits, and behaviors related to ASD. Prenatal and postnatal exposure to newer pyrethroid insecticides is associated with alterations in social and emotional development, cognitive, language and motor deficits, and a possible increased risk of ASD. A possible effect of herbicides such as glyphosate on child neurodevelopment remains to be established. Experimental studies in rodents and fish exposed to insecticide pesticides describe effects on behavior, locomotion and cognitive functions, consistent with the associations reported in epidemiological studies and changes observed in different brain areas. Modes of action such as oxidative stress, alterations in neurotransmission systems, neuroinflammation, changes in gene expression and the diversity of molecular targets may account for the variety of effects reported.

AB  - All over the world, insecticides and fungicides are used to protect wood against pathogens. To document the environmental toxicity of wood preservative mixtures, freshwater amphipods Gammarus pulex (L.) were submitted to organic pesticides given independently or in mixtures. When given independently at environmentally realistic concentrations, propiconazole and tebuconazole (triazoles fungicides) were not toxic for G. pulex, 3-iodo-2-propinyl butyl carbamate (IPBC, fungicide) was moderately toxic, and cypermethrin (pyrethroid insecticide) was extremely toxic. 96-h LC50 were, respectively, 4703, 1643, 604, and 0.09 mu g L-1. When amphipods were submitted to a mixture mimicking the composition of a commercial solution (18.2% of cypermethrin, 45.8% propiconazole, 17.2% tebuconazole, 18.8% IPBC), the overall toxicity was equal to that of the most toxic component, namely cypermethrin. But, when organisms were submitted to the real commercial mixture containing pesticides, solvents and additives, the toxic effects were markedly higher. Moreover, a third mixture with only 0.002% cypermethrin showed lethality 2.5-18-fold higher than those predicted by the commonly used models. The present results show that toxicity of wood preservative mixtures cannot be assessed starting only from the toxicities of each single component. Furthermore, the present data strongly suggest that the environmental impacts of wood preservative mixtures might be frequently underestimated. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundZebrafish have been increasingly used for monitoring and assessing the effects of different contaminants in the aquatic environments. In the present study, zebrafish embryos and larvae were used to study the effects of the insecticide diazinon and the herbicide diuron in regard to occurrence of oxidative stress-related cellular responses, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR)-related efflux transporter activitywhich represents the first line of defense against xenobiotics in many aquatic organismsand responses of different molecular and biochemical biomarkers.ResultsThe recently established non-invasive quantitative plate assay, which uses the fluorescent probes CM-H(2)DCFDA and CellTracker Green CMFDA and measures the fluorescence in whole zebrafish larvae, was applied to assess changes in reactive oxidative species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) after exposure to the investigated pesticides. The results showed a significant increase of GSH after 1h exposure of zebrafish larvae to both diazinon and diuron. Regarding the ROS induction, no significant increases in fluorescence could be detected after 2h exposure to the investigated pesticides. Applying a newly adapted assay for MXR activity, it was determined that diuron caused no change after a 24-h exposure, but caused a significant induction of MXR activity after a 48-h exposure (indicated by a decreased amount of accumulated rhodamine B). On the other hand, diazinon caused an inhibition of MXR activity after both 24h and 48h exposure (indicated by an increased amount of accumulated rhodamine B). Regarding the biomarkers, different set-ups and exposure periods were applied and both molecular (gene expression) and biochemical (enzymatic activities) responses were assessed. Diazinon caused an inhibition of carboxylesterase (CES) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in zebrafish larvae, diuron inhibited AChE activity in in vitro testing, and both pesticides significantly affected gene expression and activities of some of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family enzymes.ConclusionsThe obtained results show various effects of the investigated pesticides and will help to elucidate how aquatic animals cope with pesticides present in their environment. Additionally, the recently developed fluorescence-based assay and the newly adapted MXR activity assay proved to be useful tools for ecotoxicological risk assessment to further investigate pesticide effects.

AB  - A sequence of different classes of synthetic insecticides have been used over the past 70 years. Over this period, the widely-used organochlorines were eventually replaced by organophosphates, with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) as the principal prototypes. Considerable research has characterized the risks of DDT and CPF individually, but little is known about the toxicology of transitioning from one class of insecticides to another, as has been commonplace for agricultural and pest control workers. This study used adult zebrafish to investigate neurobehavioral toxicity following 5-week chronic exposure to either DDT or CPF, to or their sequential exposure (DDT for 5 weeks followed by CPF for 5 weeks). At the end of the exposure period, a subset of fish were analyzed for brain cholinesterase activity. Behavioral effects were initially assessed one week following the end of the CPF exposure and again at 14 months of age using a behavioral test battery covering sensorimotor responses, anxiety-like functions, predator avoidance and social attraction. Adult insecticide exposures, individually or sequentially, were found to modulate multiple behavioral features, including startle responsivity, social approach, predator avoidance, locomotor activity and novel location recognition and avoidance. Locomotor activity and startle responsivity were each impacted to a greater degree by the sequential exposures than by individual compounds, with the latter being pronounced at the early (1-week post exposure) time point, but not 3-4 months later in aging. Social approach responses were similarly impaired by the sequential exposure as by CPF-alone at the aging time point. Fleeing responses in the predator test showed fleeenhancing effects of both compounds individually versus controls, and no additive impact of the two following sequential exposure. Each compound was also associated with changes in recognition or avoidance patterns in a novel place recognition task in late adulthood, but sequential exposures did not enhance these phenotypes. The potential for chemical x chemical interactions did not appear related to changes in CPF metabolism to the active oxon, as prior DDT exposure did not affect the cholinesterase inhibition resulting from CPF. This study shows that the effects of chronic adult insecticide exposures may be relevant to behavioral health initially and much later in life, and that the effects of sequential exposures may be unpredictable based on their constituent exposures.

AB  - The toxicity of Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide widely used in agriculture, was determined for the Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. The 96 h-LC50 of Roundup was 13.69 mg L-1, indicating that this fish is more sensitive to Roundup than rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). These differences should be considered when establishing criteria for water quality and animal well-being in the Neotropical region. Short-term (6, 24 and 96 h) toxicity tests were then performed to evaluate the effects of sub-lethal concentrations of the herbicide (7.5 and 10 mg L-1) to P lineatus. Roundup did not interfere with the maintenance of the ionic balance and there was no significant alteration in plasma cortisol levels in Roundup-exposed fish. However an increase in plasma glucose was noted in fish exposed to 10 mg L-1 of the herbicide, indicating a typical stress response. Catalase liver activity also showed an increase in fish exposed to 10 mg L-1 of the herbicide, suggesting the activation of antioxidant defenses after Roundup exposure. In addition, Roundup induced several liver histological alterations that might impair normal organ functioning. Therefore, short-term exposure to Roundup at subletal concentrations induced biochemical, physiological and histological alterations in P lineatus. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Roundup is the most popular commercial glyphosate formulation applied in the cultivation of genetically modified glyphosate-resistant crops. The aim of this study was to evaluate the histological lesions of the neotropical native fish, Jenynsia multidentata, in response to acute and subchronic exposure to Roundup and to determine if subchronic exposure to the herbicide causes changes in male sexual activity of individuals exposed to a sublethal concentration (0.5 mg/l) for 7 and 28 days. The estimated 96-h LC50 was 19.02 mg/l for both male and female fish. Gill and liver histological lesions were evaluated through histopathological indices allowing quantification of the histological damages in fish exposed to different concentrations of the herbicide. Roundup induced different histological alterations in a concentration-dependent manner. In subchronic-exposure tests, Roundup also altered normal histology of the studied organs and caused a significant decrease in the number of copulations and mating success in male fish exposed to the herbicide. It is expected that in natural environments contaminated with Roundup, both general health condition and reproductive success of J. multidenatata could be seriously affected.

AB  - By considering chlorpyrifos (CPF), an organophosphorus pesticide with known mechanisms of action that affect neurobehavioral development, we assessed the validity and sensitivity of a miniaturized swim flume by investigating the effects of the insecticide on swimming behavior in medaka (Oryzias latipes) fish growing stages. Medaka in three developmental periods, namely 0, 20 and 40 day-old post-hatch (i.e. time points 0, 20 and 40, respectively), were exposed to CPF (12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mu g/L) for 48 h under semi-static conditions. The CPF half-lives during exposures were evaluated and the swimming patterns in a flume section (arena) were presented on two-dimensional gradient maps of forced movement of fish against water current. A comparative numerical analysis of fish residence times between each time point control and the corresponding CPF groups was performed by dividing arenas into 15 proportional areas. The time point 0 control group gradient map showed a noticeably different swim pattern from those of the >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups, which was statistically supported by the differences for residence times seen in >= 12 corresponding areas. The control group gradient maps for time points 20 and 40 differed from those of the respective >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups. The comparative analysis of the residence times in the corresponding 15 areas revealed differences in >= 5 areas for time point 20 and in >= 3 areas for time point 40. The integrative analysis of the gradient maps and the numerical statistics revealed stage-specific effects and a concentration-response relationship between CPF and alterations on forced medaka swimming despite the dissipation of CPF from the water column. These results indicate the validity of the miniaturized swim flume toward a more environmentally realistic scenario for the evaluation of neurodevelopmental and behavioral toxicity in small fish models.

AB  - Response behaviors of medaka were computationally analyzed before and after the treatments of copper at low concentration (1.0 mg/L). Parameters (e.g., speed, stop time, turning rate, etc) of the movement patterns were used as input for training the Multi-Layer Perceptron. Detection rates of the movement patterns such as 'Slow movement' and 'No movement' increased after the treatments. However, a higher degree of variation was observed in detection rates. Fractal dimension calculated from the movement data of individual specimens decreased consistently after the treatments. Higher consistency in fractal dimension was further achieved by using the data for collective rearing. Feasibility of behavioral monitoring was discussed in assessing toxic chemicals in environment.

TI  - GEOGRAPHICAL-DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANOCHLORINE CONTAMINANTS AND REPRODUCTIVE PARAMETERS IN HERRING-GULLS ON LAKE-SUPERIOR IN 1983
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
LA  - English
AB  - As part of the Great Lakes International Surveillance Plan, 1978-83, egg contaminant levels and reproductive output were determined for Herring Gull colonies on Lake Superior in 1983. Since 1974, the Herring Gull has been widely used in the Great Lakes as a spatial and temporal monitor of organochlorine (OC) contaminant levels and associated biological effects. Most eggs contained a wide range of OCs, the main compounds being DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane, hexachlorobenzene and mirex. Levels of an additional ten OCs and five polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) congeners were also determined for some sites. Overall, levels varied significantly among colonies, but there was no obvious relationship to spatial distribution of contaminants in sediments or fish species. OC levels in eggs had declined by up to 84% since 1974. Eggshells were only 8% thinner than before the introduction of DDT, and shell thinning was not a cause of breeding failure. Average reproductive output varied from 0.15 to 1.57 young per apparently occupied nest in 1983: at 56% of colonies the value was below that thought necessary to maintain stable populations. The main causes of failure were egg disappearence and cannibalism of chicks. Despite this, the population appeared to have been increasing at about 4% per annum. Reduced availability of forage fish during the early 1980s was the most likely reason for the poor reproductive output in 1983.

AB  - The use of pesticides has been growing along with the demand for agricultural products. These compounds, however, are not restricted to the field, spreading easily through the soil, contaminating groundwater and reaching urban centers. Propiconazole is a triazole fungicide that has been increasingly used in agriculture. However, there are few data about its effects on non-target organisms. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of propiconazole in zebrafish. The animals were exposed for 96 h to different concentrations of propiconazole (425, 850, 1700, 8500 ng/L), then submitted to the novel tank test for behavioral analyses. The brains were collected for evaluation of oxidative stress parameters. Exposure to propiconazole (1700 and 8500 ng/L) decreased the number of crossings, entries, and time spent in the top, and increased the time spent in the bottom area of the tank. We also observed an increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in zebrafish brain exposed to propiconazole at 425, 850, and 1700 ng/L. We conclude that propiconazole alters normal fish behavior and disrupts oxidative status. More studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism underlying the effects of propiconazole on non-target-organisms.

AB  - The formulation of Roundup consists of the herbicide glyphosate as the active ingredient with polyethoxylene amine added as a surfactant. The acute toxicity of Roundup (particularly of glyphosate) to animals is considered to be low according to the World Health Organization, but the extensive use of Roundup may still cause environmental problems with negative impact on wildlife, particularly in an aquatic environment where chemicals may persist for a long time. Therefore, we studied the effects of Roundup on markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense in goldfish, Carassius auratus. The fish were given 96 h exposure to Roundup at concentrations of 2.5-20 mg L-1. Exposure to Roundup did not affect levels of lipid peroxides (LOOH) in goldfish brain or liver, and in kidney only the 10 mg L-1 treatment elevated LOOH by 3.2-fold. Herbicide exposure also had no effect on the concentrations of protein thiols or low molecular mass thiols in kidney, but selective suppression of low molecular mass thiols by 26-29% occurred at some treatment levels in brain and liver. Roundup exposure generally suppressed the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in fish tissues. For example, SOD activities were reduced by 51-68% in brain, 58-67% in liver and 33-53% in kidney of Roundup treated fish. GST activity decreased by 29-34% in liver. However, catalase activity increased in both liver and kidney of herbicide-exposed fish. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate a systematic response by the antioxidant systems of fish to Roundup exposure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the period from 2004-2006, investigations of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) in littoral sediments and the muscle tissue of the bottom-dwelling fish (Barbus macedonicus Karaman) have been conducted in Lake Dojran, Republic of Macedonia. Special emphasis was given to the presence the DDT degradation products 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2- bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (p,p'-DDT), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDD). Sediment samples showed a dominance of p,p'-DDT, ranging from 3.55 mu g kg(-1) to 5.01 mu g kg(-1) of sediment dry mass, whereas p,p'-DDE was dominant in the muscle tissue of the bottom-dwelling fish Barbus macedonicus Karaman, with contents between 8.98 mu g kg(-1) and 10.85 mu g kg(-1) fresh tissue. Although DDT concentrations were below international health standards they may increase anthropogenic pressure on the unique and vulnerable ecosystem of Lake Dojran. The general findings underline the long period of intensive usage of DDT in the Southern Balkans, as well as its great persistence in agriculturally impacted surface waters. Furthermore, DDT-ratios in the sediment indicated use after the official ban of the pesticide, a situation, which may be representative for a range of surface waters in southeastern Europe.

AB  - Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide active substance worldwide, has raised many scientific, political and public debates in the context of its recent re-registration in the European Union, highlighting in particular a lack of data concerning its potential generational effects. In this study, we investigated the intergenerational toxicity of this active substance used alone or coformulated in glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) on the ability of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to face a viral challenge. Juvenile trout from parents exposed for eight months to four different chemical exposure conditions (non-exposed control, pure glyphosate, Roundup Innovert (R), and Viaglif Jardin (R) were experimentally infected with the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNv). Various enzymatic and hemato-immunological markers were assessed before and after the viral challenge. Chemical contamination with GBHs strongly modulated viral trout susceptibility. Pure glyphosate induced a cumulative mortality of 35.8%, comparable to the control (37.0%), which was significantly reduced with Roundup Innovert (R) (-9.9%) and increased (+14.8%) with Viaglif Jardin (R). No modification was observed for the biomarkers analysed for any conditions. These results demonstrate that the nature of the co-formulants associated to glyphosate in GHBs can modulate the susceptibility of fish to pathogens.

AB  - Background: Evidence on the effectiveness of low-cost, sustainable, biological vector-control tools for the Aedes mosquitoes is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this trial is to estimate the impact of guppy fish (guppies), in combination with the use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen (Sumilarv (R) 2MR), and Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities to reduce entomological indices in Cambodia.
   Methods/design: In this cluster randomized controlled, superiority trial, 30 clusters comprising one or more villages each (with approximately 170 households) will be allocated, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive either (1) three interventions (guppies, Sumilarv (R) 2MR, and COMBI activities), (2) two interventions (guppies and COMBI activities), or (3) control (standard vector control). Households will be invited to participate, and entomology surveys among 40 randomly selected households per cluster will be carried out quarterly. The primary outcome will be the population density of adult female Aedes mosquitoes (i.e., number per house) trapped using adult resting collections. Secondary outcome measures will include the House Index, Container Index, Breteau Index, Pupae Per House, Pupae Per Person, mosquito infection rate, guppy fish coverage, Sumilarv (R) 2MR coverage, and percentage of respondents with knowledge about Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue. In the primary analysis, adult female Aedes density and mosquito infection rates will be aggregated over follow-up time points to give a single rate per cluster. This will be analyzed by negative binomial regression, yielding density ratios.
   Discussion: This trial is expected to provide robust estimates of the intervention effect. A rigorous evaluation of these vector-control interventions is vital to developing an evidence-based dengue control strategy and to help direct government resources.

AB  - Response behaviors of indicator species have been used for monitoring environmental disturbances. Markov processes were applied to elucidate behavioral changes of animals under chemical stress. Movement of Daphnia magna in two dimensions was continuously observed before and after treatments with an insecticide, diazinon, at low concentrations. The Self-organizing map (SOM) was initially used to train complex movement data to classify different movement states. Subsequently, a bidden Markov model (HMM) was applied to sequence the movement states identified by the SOM. The transition probability matrix (TPM) and the emission probability matrix (EPM) were efficiently estimated by using the HMM. Markov processes were separately observed before and after the treatments, and the changes in the response behaviors of the indicator organisms were demonstrated tinder stressful conditions.

AB  - An eradication program using rotenone was implemented primarily targeting a localised population of the feral Pearl Cichlid (Geophagus brasiliensis), and as a secondary objective to also remove the widespread Eastern Gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) in two artificial lakes used for irrigation purposes in Byford, Western Australia (WA). Rotenone, applied at the approved rate (i.e. 0.25 ppm), failed to eradicate all Eastern Gambusia, and possibly all of the Pearl Cichlids in the first attempt, but at a higher dose rate (i.e. 1 ppm) it eradicated both species on the second attempt. We attributed the initial failure partially to the low dose rate of rotenone approved by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA). Pearl Cichlids are present in multiple public ponds and lakes, and waterways in the greater Perth metropolitan area (), and needs to be more aggressively managed by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD).

AB  - The presence of the transmembrane proteins of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, which perform the efflux of several substances, contributes to the survival of aquatic organisms in a contaminated environmental. Those proteins provide a phenotype named the multixenobiotic resistance mechanism (MXR) by performing the efflux of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds (ABCB) and biotransformation products and anionic compounds (ABCC). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cellular defense pathway of an established culture from zebrafish hepatocytes (ZF-L) after 24 and 48 h of exposure to glyphosate and Original Roundup (R), an herbicide used globally. Through abcb4, abccl, abcc2 and abcc4 gene expression, ABCB and ABCC2 protein expression and ABC pump activity in ZF-L cells exposed to glyphosate and Roundup (R). The results showed an increase in ABCB gene and protein expression; however, although ABCC2 showed an increase in gene expression, its protein expression was lower than in the control group. Regarding ABC activity, only exposure to Roundup (R) at the lowest concentration showed an increase at 48 h, but in the presence of inhibitors, both glyphosate and Roundup (R) appeared to modulate ABC activity, reducing its inhibition and returning activity to levels without inhibitor.

AB  - The glyphosate-based herbicide, Roundup (R), is among the most used pesticides worldwide. Due to its extensive use, it has been widely detected in aquatic ecosystems representing a potential threat to non-target organisms, including fish. Despite the negative impact of this commercial formulation in fish, as described in literature, the scarcity of studies assessing its genotoxicity and underlying mechanisms is evident. Therefore, as a novel approach, this study evaluated the genotoxic potential of Roundup (R) to blood cells of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) following short-term (1 and 3 days) exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations (58 and 116 mu g/l), addressing also the possible association with oxidative stress. Thus, comet and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) assays were adopted, as genotoxic end points, reflecting different types of genetic damage. The pro-oxidant state was assessed through enzymatic (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase) and non-enzymatic (total glutathione content) antioxidants, as well as by lipid peroxidation (LPO) measurements. The Roundup (R) potential to induce DNA strand breaks for both concentrations was demonstrated by the comet assay. The induction of chromosome breakage and/or segregational abnormalities was also demonstrated through the ENA assay, though only after 3-day exposure to both tested concentrations. In addition, the two genotoxic indicators were positively correlated. Antioxidant defences were unresponsive to Roundup (R). LPO levels increased only for the high concentration after the first day of exposure, indicating that oxidative stress caused by this agrochemical in blood was not severe. Overall results suggested that both DNA damaging effects induced by Roundup (R) are not directly related with an increased pro-oxidant state. Moreover, it was demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations of Roundup (R) can pose a health risk for fish populations.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are currently subjected to dual stresses of chemical pollution and climate change. Through a series of laboratory experiments, this study investigated the impact of exposure to chemical contaminant such as DDT or copper (Cu), in combination with cold or warm temperature extremes on the marine medaka fish Oryzias melastigma. The results showed that extreme seawater temperatures (i.e., 15 and 32 degrees C in sub-tropical Hong Kong) exacerbated adverse chemical impacts on the growth performance of O. melastigma, in particular at the high thermal extreme. This was likely associated with an interruption of oxygen consumption and aerobic scope. Most importantly, the results of acclimation experiments, as reflected by thermal tolerance polygons, showed that chemical exposure substantially narrowed the thermal tolerance of the medaka, making them more vulnerable to temperature changes and extreme thermal events. Under dual stresses of thermal extremes and chemical exposure, the medaka switched their metabolic pathway to anaerobic respiration that might deplete their energy reserve for chemical detoxification. Although stress proteins such as heat shock proteins (HSP90) were up-regulated for cellular protection in the fish, such a defensive mechanism was repressed with intensifying dual stresses at high temperature and high chemical concentration. Bioconcentration of DDT or Cu generally increased with increasing temperature and its exposure concentration. Overall, these complex chemical-temperature interactions concomitantly exerted a concerted adverse impact to O. melastigma. The temperature-dependent toxicity of DDT or Cu shown in this study clearly demonstrated the potential challenge brought by the risk of chemical pollution under the impact of global climate change.

AB  - The transfer of maternal contaminants to offspring during oogenesis and gestation is documented in many animals, and in mammals, contaminants may pass from mother to offspring during lactation. Although other non-mammalian vertebrates provide parental care in the form of nutritive secretions for offspring to feed from, the potential for toxicant transfer during non-mammalian parental care is rarely considered. The discus fish, Symphysodon spp., employs an unusual parental care strategy where fry feed on parental epidermal mucus for several weeks after hatching. This strategy has the potential to act as a method of contaminant transfer. In discus adults, both waterborne and dietary toxicants are sequestered and secreted into their epidermal mucus, the food on which fry depend. To determine whether parents could channel these contaminants directly to offspring, we exposed parents to aqueous cadmium (Cd) and recorded the subsequent feeding behaviour and Cd content of fry. Fry continued to feed normally from contaminated mucus and accumulated significant tissue concentrations of Cd. In conclusion, this parental care mechanism of the discus fish can expose offspring to harmful contaminants during the sensitive early stages of life and highlights that parent to offspring contaminant transfer after birth may be more widespread than previously thought.

AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides are widely used in global agriculture, and their effects on different non-target animal organisms have been the focus of many toxicological studies. Regarding the potential role of glyphosate-based herbicides as an endocrine disruptor, the present study aims to investigate the effects of the herbicide Roundup WG (R) (RWG) on female reproduction, specifically on the ovarian maturation of Danio rerio. Adult females were exposed to low concentrations of RWG (0.065, 0.65, and 6.5 mg L-1) for 15 days, and then the ovaries were submitted to structural and morphometric procedures, accompanied by analysis of the vitellin protein content. Our results showed an increase of initial ovarian follicle numbers, decrease of late ovarian follicles, and smaller diameter of ovarian follicles in fish exposed to 0.065 and 6.5 mg L-1. The thickness of vitelline envelope was reduced, and the vitellin protein content was increased in the ovarian follicle in the two highest concentrations. Ultrastructural changes in the ovarian follicular component were evident and expressed by the cell index; vacuolization in follicular cells, increase of perivitelline space, and impaired mitochondria in oocytes were observed. Therefore, RWG adversely affects the ovarian maturation in D. rerio, and these changes can lead to reproductive toxicity, compromising population dynamics.

AB  - Organism immune defences might be weakened by pollutants, largely detected in aquatic ecosystems, leading to the facilitation for opportunistic pathogens to infect organisms. In this context, destabilization of fish nonspecific immune parameters and erythrocyte DNA integrity was tested, on a model fish species, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), after exposure to chlorpyrifos (CPF). Alone, pesticide exposure induced a genotoxic potential (chlorpyrifos at 1.75 and 0.88 mu g/L) in addition to a decrease in phagocytosis capacity and a stimulation of respiratory burst. Then, to mimic pathogenic infection, fish exposure to chlorpyrifos was combined with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stress. In this second experiment, an increase of DNA damage was observed in fish exposed to a lower concentration of chlorpyrifos and LPS. Moreover, at the higher concentration of chlorpyrifos, an early destabilization of innate immunity was observed as suggested by the absence of an increase of lysosomal presence in fish injected with LPS. This study highlighted the usefulness of stress on stress responses to better understand the impact of contaminants on the organism's health.

AB  - Previous research suggests that agricultural herbicides interfere with olfactory-mediated behavior, such as responses to alarm signals and the ability to locate food, in aquatic organisms. In crayfish, aggressive interactions are also mediated by chemical signals. These social signals are important in establishing dominance, which in turn has an impact on an individual's ability to find and use mates, food, and habitat space. In this study, we investigated the impact of exposure to sublethal levels of the herbicide metolachlor on the ability of crayfish to respond to olfactory signals used in agonistic behaviors. Crayfish were exposed to three different environmentally relevant concentrations (60 ppb, 70 ppb, and 80 ppb) of metolachlor for 96 hours. Each exposed crayfish was then placed in a fight arena and was allowed to interact with a naive, untreated crayfish for 15 minutes. We analyzed several characteristics of fighting behavior, including initial aggressiveness, time to fight, intensity levels, duration, number of encounters, and the winner and loser of each fight. Crayfish exposed to 80 ppb metolachlor were less likely to initiate and win encounters against naive conspecifics than any other treatment group. Analysis of fight dynamics shows that metolachlor does not alter the temporal fighting dynamics within crayfish aggression. We conclude that high sublethal concentrations of metolachlor may be interfering with the ability of crayfish to receive or respond to social signals and thus affect certain agonistic behaviors.

AB  - Mating pairs of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) received 17beta-estradiol (E2; dose, 3 and 30 mug/g body weight daily) in their diet and E2-free diet (control) for two weeks. The effect on reproductive success was assessed in the mating pairs, and sexual and nonsexual behaviors in the male were quantified. The fecundities of the E2-treated groups were reduced significantly (p < 0.05) compared with those of control, and the sexual behaviors (following, dancing, floating, and crossing) of male fish in response to prostaglandin F2alpha (PG)-injected E2-unexposed females were suppressed dramatically. While the fertility of spawned eggs and the frequencies of the nonsexual behaviors of resting and swimming in a straight line performed by male were unchanged in E2-exposed groups. Therefore, sexual behavior in male may be linked with reproductive success in mating pair of madaka exposed to E2. This assay for sexual behavior using PG may provide a useful tool for assessing the effect of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The creation of a trophy largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides fishery was the primary management objective when Briery Creek Lake was developed in the mid-1980s. Several management strategies were utilized to create this fishery and a combination of data collection techniques was required to monitor the fishery. Prior to impoundment, undesirable species were removed with rotenone. Standing timber was left throughout this 342-ha reservoir to provide fish habitat. The reservoir was stocked with Florida largemouth bass and northern largemouth bass fingerlings at a ratio of 3:1 in both 1986 and 1987. Largemouth bass were regulated with several different restrictive regulations. Monitoring techniques included electrofishing, the Virginia Angler Recognition program, and creel surveys. The Virginia Angler Recognition program awarded 291 state citations (minimum of 3.6 kg or 560 mm) to Briery Creek anglers from 1990 to 1999, with 33 of these fish weighing over 5.4 kg. This reservoir produced more largemouth bass citations per ha in 1998 and 1999 than any other reservoir in Virginia. Approximately 81 percent of largemouth bass anglers interviewed in a 1999 creel survey revealed that the chance to catch a trophy bass was the primary reason for fishing Briery Creek Lake. Creel surveys and the Angler Recognition Program were considered invaluable techniques for the monitoring the trophy fishery at Briery Creek Lake.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the value of the children's version of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test as a screening test in a population exposed to different mixtures of neurotoxicants. Copy and Immediate Recall scores were evaluated through the test. Children were recruited from three sites; an area with natural contamination by fluoride and arsenic (F-As), a mining-metallurgical area with lead and arsenic contamination (Pb-As) and a malaria zone with the evidence of fish contaminated with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Children aged 6-11 years old, living in one of the three polluted sites since birth were recruited (n = 166). The exposure was evaluated as follows: fluoride and arsenic in urine, lead in blood and DDT, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and PCBs in serum. To evaluate the test performance, z-scores for Copy and Immediate Recall were calculated. The proportion of children by residence area with performance lower than expected by age (below -1 SD) for Copy and Immediate Recall was in the F-As area (88.7% and 59%) and in the DDT-PCBs area (73% and 43.8%), respectively. In the Pb-As area, the proportion was 62% for both tests. After adjustment, Copy correlated inversely with fluoride in urine (r = -0.29; p < 0.001) and Immediate Recall correlated inversely with fluoride in urine (r=-0.27; p<0.05), lead in blood (r = -0.72; p < 0.01), arsenic in urine (r = -0.63; p < 0.05) and DDE (r = -0.25; p < 0.05). This study provided evidence that children included in this research are living in high risk areas and were exposed to neurotoxicants. Poor performance in the test could be explained in some way by F, Pb, As or DDE exposure, however social factors or the low quality of school education prevalent in the areas could be playing an important role.

AB  - The effects of chemicals on biotic interactions, such as competition and predation, have rarely been investigated in aquatic ecotoxicology. This study presents a new approach for the investigation of predator prey interactions between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) impaired by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic insecticide. With a simple experimental design including four different treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed, (3) prey exposed and (4) both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect by visual observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 mu g/l CHP. Previously, a decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid larvae was observed. However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both predators and prey, no significant differences in the feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. This suggests an impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP concentration (1 mu g/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. We therefore propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in higher tier studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk assessment.

AB  - Evidence on the effectiveness of low-cost, sustainable biological vector control tools for Aedes mosquitoes is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this trial was to estimate the impact of guppy fish in combination with the larvicide pyriproxyfen (PPF) (Sumilarv (R) 2MR) and communication for behavioral impact (COMBI) activities to reduce entomological indices in Cambodia. In this cluster randomized, controlled superiority trial, 30 clusters comprised of one or more villages each was allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either 1) all three interventions (guppies, PPF, and COMBI), 2) two interventions (guppies and COMBI), or 3) control (standard vector control). Entomological surveys among 40 randomly selected households per cluster were carried out quarterly. The primary outcome was the population abundance of adult female Aedes mosquitoes trapped using adult resting collections. In the primary analysis, adult female Aedes abundance and mosquito infection rates was aggregated over follow-up time points to give a single rate per cluster. These data were analyzed by negative binomial regression, yielding abundance ratios (ARs). The number of Aedes females was reduced roughly by half compared with the control in both the guppy, PPF, and COMBI arm (AR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34-0.85; P = 0.0073); and the guppy and COMBI arm (AR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31-0.77; P = 0.0021). The effectiveness demonstrated and extremely low cost of including fish rearing in community-based health structures suggest they should be considered as a vector control tool as long as the benefits outweigh any potential environmental concerns. Sumilarv (R) was also highly accepted and preferred over current vector control tools used in Cambodia.

AB  - Bifenthrin is a common pesticide that is widespread in aquatic environments. Although it has been shown to be toxic to aquatic organisms, its immunotoxicity and mechanism are unclear. Herein, we reported the immuno-toxicity of bifenthrin on adult Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) after 28 days of exposure to different concentrations of bifenthrin (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mu g/L) and 36-h Pseudomonas fluorescens challenge. Bifenthrin inhibited the fish humoral immune response to bacteria by altering the lymphocyte and neutrophil ratios and decreasing the production of lysozyme, complement component 3, immunoglobulin M, and C-reactive protein, particularly were 1.0 mu g/L. Bifenthrin caused intestinal damage and significantly reduced the volume of intes-tinal mucus at 12 and 36 hours postinjection (hpi) (p < 0.05). Moreover, 1.0 mu g/L bifenthrin significantly increased the fish mortality and bacterial loads at 12 and 36 hpi (p < 0.05). RNA-seq analysis revealed several enriched genes involved in pathogen attachment and recognition, inflammatory responses, and complement system at the early-to-mid stage of infection (4-12 hpi). Overall, our results corroborated that bifenthrin induced immunotoxicity in Gobiocypris rarus, resulting in immune dysfunction of fish and increasing their sensitivity to bacterial infection and accelerating mortality. Moreover, 4-12 hpi was better than 36 hpi for analyzing immune responses against pathogen infection in fish exposed to bifenthrin.

AB  - Goldfish (Carassius auratus) were exposed to a mixture of herbicides, namely atrazine, simazine, diuron, and isoproturon (ASDI) at a cumulative concentration of 50 mu g/l for 12 weeks. Control fish and exposed fish were sampled at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of exposure to observe the combined impact of herbicides on non-specific and specific mechanisms of immunity and antioxidant defenses. The antioxidant defenses were evaluated in haemopoietic organs and liver. ASDI-induced stress was reflected as a significant induction of superoxide (O-2(center dot-)) production in phagocytic cells of head kidney and spleen. In addition, plasma lysozyme activity was consistently high in the treatment group. Specific immunity was assessed by antibody titre responses following immunization of the fish with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs). Antibody titre was reduced throughout the period of observation in ASDI-treated fish. This reduction was found to be significant at week 4 (p < 0.05). Herbicide-exposed fish showed reduced resistance against pathogen invasion but remarkable enhancement in lysozyme activity. The ASDI-induced oxidative stress in spleen, kidney and liver was reflected as a change in the antioxidant enzyme activities in these vital organs of fish. Our data indicate that herbicides at concentrations present in water bodies in Europe cause immune suppression in goldfish. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ornament magnitude often reflects a local balance between sexual selection and other sources of natural selection opposing their elaboration. Human activity may disrupt this balance if it modifies the costs of producing, maintaining or displaying the ornaments. When costs are increased, a shortage of acceptable partners may ensue, with consequences commensurate with how stringent (and effective) the process of mate choice is. Here, we show that the expression of ornaments in the viviparous amarillo fish (Girardinichthys multiradiatus) is influenced by embryonic exposure to low concentrations of an organophosphorus insecticide. Male ornamental fin size, dimorphic yellow coloration and display rates were all compromised in exposed fish, but unaffected in their paternal half-sibling controls and in their sisters (morphology and colour). Exposure resulted in smaller fish of both sexes, thus the differential effect by sex was restricted to attributes such as fin size only above the naturally selected magnitude shown by females. Father phenotype predicted offspring morphology of controls, but not of exposed males, which were discriminated against by both control and exposed females. Since stringent female mate choice can result in females refusing to mate with suboptimal mates, this sub-lethal developmental effect can reduce the effective population size of amarillo fish populations.

AB  - Shrimp larvae (Penaeus vannamei) collected from an uncontaminated area were challenged with sublethal concentrations of organochlorine pesticides, The effects of treatment with lindane, lorsban, chlordane and DDT, were a 5, -12, 13 and 21% increase in the larval respiratory rate, respectively, Glycogen synthesis decreased from the 0.471 mu g g(-1) h(-1) of the control, to 0.455, 0.415, 0.400 and 0.365 mu g g(-1) h(-1), for larvae submitted to DDT, chlordane, lindane and lorsban, In addition, we measured decreases in nucleic acid content, from 20.4 and 34.9% in larvae challenged by chlordane and lorsban, respectively, and values close to 25% for two other pesticides tested. These results indicate drastic metabolic changes, which may impinge on the commercial fishery and culture of this organisms. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - Sediments are reservoirs and sources of DDTs to the aquatic ecosystem. However, the role of sediment particulate matter and benthic organisms in transferring DDTs remains unclear. In this study, microcosms were built up with different groups to simulate a freshwater system with DDT-contaminated sediment and organisms. The impacts of different exposure routes (water and sediment) on the changes of DDT and its metabolites (DDD and DDE) in carp (Cyprinus carpio) were investigated. The bioturbation of Tubifex tubifex (Oligochaeta, Tubificidae) was investigated to understand the fate and transfer of DDTs in aquatic environment. For the sediment treatment, the concentrations of o,p'-DDT in carp were significantly higher than those of p,p'-DDT, and the metallothionein (MT) content decreased. The bioaccumulation of DDTs in carp via sediment particulate matter was significantly higher/faster than that via overlying water. T. tubifex and sediment particulate matter accelerate DDT bioaccumulation in carp. Selective enrichment of the (+)-o,p'-DDT and (+)-o,p'-DDD was found in carp. These results help to reduce uncertainty in ecological and health risk assessments and to better understand the risk of DDTs in the environment.

AB  - Pyrethroid pesticides are a class of insecticides found to have endocrine disrupting properties in vertebrates such as fishes and in human cell lines. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are environmental contaminants that mimic or alter the process of hormone signaling. In particular, EDCs that alter estrogen and androgen signaling pathways are of major concern for fishes because these EDCs may alter reproductive physiology, behavior, and ultimately sex ratio. Bifenthrin, a pyrethroid with escalating usage, is confirmed to disrupt estrogen signaling in several species of fish, including Menidia beryllina (inland silverside), an Atherinid recently established as a euryhaline model. Our main objective was to broadly assess the molecular and physiological responses of M. beryllina to the ng/L concentrations of bifenthrin typically found in the environment, with a focus on endocrine-related effects, and to discern links between different tiers of the biological hierarchy. As such, we evaluated the response of juvenile Menidia to bifenthrin using a Menidia-specific microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on specific endocrine-related genes of interest, and a Menidia-specific ELISA to the egg-coat protein choriogenin, to evaluate a multitude of molecular-level responses that would inform mechanisms of toxicity and any underlying causes of change at higher biological levels of organization. The sublethal nominal concentrations tested (0.5, 5 and 50 ng/L) were chosen to represent the range of concentrations observed in the environment and to provide coverage of a variety of potential responses. We then employed a 21-day reproductive assay to evaluate reproductive responses to bifenthrin (at 0.5 ng/L) in a separate group of adult M. beryllina. The microarray analysis indicated that bifenthrin influences a diverse suite of molecular pathways, from baseline metabolic processes to carcinogenesis. A more targeted examination of gene expression via qPCR demonstrated that bifenthrin downregulates a number of estrogen-related transcripts, particularly at the lowest exposure level. Choriogenin protein also decreased with exposure to increasing concentrations of bifenthrin, and adult M. beryllina exposed to 0.5 ng/L had significantly reduced reproductive output (fertilized eggs per female). This reduction in fecundity is consistent with observed changes in endocrine-related gene expression and choriogenin production. Taken together, our results demonstrate that environmental concentrations of bifenthrin have potential to interfere with metabolic processes, endocrine signaling, and to decrease reproductive output.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine the behavioral and molecular responses in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) central nervous system (CNS) following a dietary exposure to the pesticide dieldrin. Zebrafish were fed pellets spiked with 0.03, 0.15, or 1.8 mu g/g dieldrin for 21 days. Behavioral analysis revealed no difference in exploratory behaviors or those related to anxiety. Transcriptional networks for T-cell aggregation and selection were decreased in expression suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of dieldrin, consistent with other studies investigating organochlorine pesticides. Processes related to oxidative phosphorylation were also differentially affected by dieldrin. Quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) using a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap identified 226 proteins that were different following one or more doses. These proteins included ATP synthase subunits (mitochondrial) and hypoxia up-regulated protein 1 which were decreased and NADH dehydrogenases (mitochondrial) and signal recognition particle 9 which were up-regulated. Thus, proteins affected were functionally associated with the mitochondria and a protein network analysis implicated Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease as diseases associated with altered proteins. Molecular networks related to mitochondrial dysfunction and T-cell regulation are hypothesized to underlie the association between dieldrin and PD. These data contribute to a comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic biomarker framework for pesticide exposures and neurodegenerative diseases.
   Biological significance: Dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine pesticide that has been associated with human neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease. Dieldrin is ranked 18th on the 2015 U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and continues to be a pesticide of concern for human health. Transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics (ITRAQ) were employed to characterize the molecular networks in the central nervous system that are altered with dietary exposure to dieldrin. We found that transcriptional and protein networks related to the immune system, mitochondria, and Parkinson's disease were preferentially affected by dieldrin. The study provides new insight into the mechanisms of dieldrin neurotoxicity that may explain, in part, the association between this pesticide and increased risks to neurodegeneration. These data contribute in a significant way to developing a molecular framework for pesticide induced neurotoxicity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Photobacterium damsela ssp. piscicida (Phdp ) isolates were grown in various bacteriological media, in eukaryotic cell culture media and in the presence of fish cells (resembling some aspects of in vivo growth environments). Bacterial cells, extracellular products (ECPs) and crude capsular polysaccharide were isolated and analysed by electrophoresis and Western blot using sea bass sera. Growth in bacteriological media conserved the synthesis of cell and extracellular components when these were compared with those prepared under near-in vivo growth conditions. In fact, synthesis of a larger range of cell components was induced after growth in bacteriological media. Certain media based on yeast extract and peptones from various sources and a specific salt formulation induced the synthesis of novel cell components at approximately 21.3 and 14 kDa. These antigens were recognized by sea bass sera collected after natural pasteurellosis outbreaks and other sea bass sera raised against live or inactivated Phdp cells. The ECPs of the pathogen were not good immunogens in their soluble form despite various treatments prior to immunization. The results are discussed with respect to vaccine development.

AB  - Roundup (R) is one of the most widely marketed glyphosate-based herbicides in the world. There are many different formulations of this brand that differ from each other in glyphosate concentration, salts and adjuvants, including surfactants, which are labelled as "inert" compounds. Several studies have shown that these formulations are highly toxic to fish, even compared with pure glyphosate. However, mechanisms underlying this toxicity are not fully understood. In this context, this study evaluated the effects of exposure to Roundup Original (R) (RO), Roundup Transorb (R) (RT), and Roundup WG (R) (RWG) on the behavioural patterns of the livebearer Jenynsia multidentata. This fish naturally inhabits agricultural areas in southern Brazil and Argentina where glyphosate is used extensively. In the experiment, animals were exposed to the herbicides for 96 h, at the environmentally relevant concentration of 0.5 mg/L of glyphosate. Swimming performance, anxiety, aggressiveness, long-term memory and male sexual activity were recorded. The formulation RWG negatively affected swimming performance, thigmotaxia and long-term memory consolidation. Conversely, RT reduced the sexual performance of males. These results confirm that Roundup (R) formulations are extremely harmful and also that they have different targets of toxicity, affecting behaviours that are essential for fish survival.

AB  - Tests of acute toxicity were performed on the most common species of aquarium fish, Poecilia reticulata. Guppies (P. reticulata) were exposed to progressive concentrations of methyl parathion (MP) and chlorpyrifos (CPF); a semi-static method according to guidelines of OECD was used. Tests of acute toxicity were conducted using 10 fish for each separate concentration and for the control group. The results were subjected to probit analysis to determine the 96 h LC50 values. The 96 h LC50 values of MP and CPF to P. reticulata were 8.48 ppm/L (5.98-10.89) and 0.176 ppm/L (0.313-0.224) respectively. In addition, behavioral changes at each concentration were observed for the individual fish. Fish were exposed for 96 h to different sublethal concentrations of MP and CPF (1/4 LC50, 1/8 LC50 and 1/10 LC50) and their oxidative stress-induction potential was estimated in brain, liver and gills of fish. MDA content is induced in all tissues but maximum rise was observed in gills (161% and 153% for MP and CPF respectively). With regard to antioxidant defense system (ADS). GSH level decreased in the brain, liver and gills of tissues of MP treated fishes (22%, 6% and 13% respectively) and showed increase in brain and gills CPF treated (23% and 21% respectively). CAT, GST, GR and SOD levels fluctuated in all treatment groups relative to the control. Brain AChE showed dose-dependent inhibition in fish exposed to the higher concentrations reached 45% and 66% for MP and CPF respectively. Collective findings demonstrated that pesticide exposure of fish induced an increase in MDA and fluctuated ADS along with inhibited AChE. These findings may be used as valuable biomarkers for evaluation of water pollution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The sense of smell in fish is thought to be important for behaviors associated with alarm scent recognition and predator avoidance. Olfactory function of juvenile chinook salmon was evaluated in two separate experiments following 2-h immersion exposures to 0, 1, 10, or 100 mu g diazinon/L. In the first test system. groups of 10 salmon were transferred to the prechoice zone of a Y-maze fluviarium with parallel streams of water. A dilute alarm scent composed of either chinook skin extract or L-serine was pumped into the water supply of one arm. Fish were allowed to choose either upstream arm by raising a containment screen for 10 min, then their positions were photographed and the screen lowered. In the second test system the relationship of diazinon exposure to predation susceptibility was directly examined by transferring groups of 20 salmon (10 diazinon-exposed, 10 control) to troughs containing a protective cover. These salmon were given two olfactory warnings by delivering conspecific skin extract to both their transfer container and the predation tank they entered. After a 2-min prey acclimation period, larger predator rainbow trout were allowed access to the downstream section of the tank containing the test salmon. The combined fish were observed until approximately 50% of the prey fish had been consumed. Statistical comparisons indicated that although the salmon did avoid the water streams containing alarm scents. none of the diazinon exposure levels resulted in significantly different outcomes from the controls (alpha = 0.05) in either the two-choice maze study or the predation study. Possible environmental and population implications are discussed in light of related olfaction and diazinon studies. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010:29:1113-1122. (C) 2010 SETAC

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are known as neurotoxic chemicals and possibly alter animal behavior. We previously reported that PCB-exposure induced abnormal schooling behavior in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). This abnormal behavior might be caused by the functional alteration of central or terminal nervous system. To understand the mechanism(s) of behavioral change by PCB-exposure, we analyzed the gene expression profiles in the brain of medaka exposed to 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) or a PCB mixture (Kanechlor-400: KC-400) using a cDNA microarray that we constructed. Twelve FLF-II strain medaka (six individuals per treatment) were dietary exposed to PCB126 (0,01 mu g/g b.w./day) or KC-400 (1 mu g/g b.w./day) for three weeks. For the control, six fish were fed a control diet. After the exposure period, fish were dissected, and the brain samples were collected. The samples from control fish were pooled and used as a common reference in the microarray experiment. Microarray data were normalized by the LOWESS method, and we screened the genes whose expression levels were altered more than 1.5-fold. Gene expression profiling showed 97 down-regulated and 379 up-regulated genes in the brain of medaka exposed to PCB126. KC-400 exposure suppressed 15 genes and induced 266 genes in medaka brain. Among these genes, the expression levels of 7 and 188 genes were commonly down- or up-regulated, respectively in both treatment groups. On the other hand, 31 gene expressions were significantly different between PCB126 and KC-400 treatment groups, and three out of 31 genes were received opposite effects. In addition, the microarray data showed that thyroid hormone-responsive genes were up-regulated by PCB-exposure, which may imply that PCBs or their metabolites mimic thyroid hormone effects in the brain of PCB-exposed medaka.

AB  - Acute toxicity of the glyphosate -N (phosphonomethyl) glycine-herbicide, Roundup (R), in juveniles of cachama blanca, (Piaractus brachypomus), was evaluated and the histopathological lesions were assessed. The 96 h lethal concentration 50 was 97.47mg.L-1 (P < 0.05). In the gill, necrotic and proliferative lesions were detected. In the liver, congestion, degenerative foci, hyaline droplets and lipidic vacuolization of the hepatocytes were observed. In the stomach mild hyperplasia of mucous cells was detected, which was also observed in the skin. In this latter tissue, a large increase in the thickness of the epidermis with necrotic lesions, infiltration of leukocytes and melanin pigment were observed. In the brain, degenerative foci of neuronal bodies in the telencephalon associated with gliosis and infiltration of eosinophilic granule cells/mast cells were shown. In conclusion, gills, liver, skin and brain are susceptible to Roundup (R). Moreover, effects on the central nervous system could affect olfaction as well as individual and group behavior, the reproductive performance of the fish and hence have repercussions at the population level.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of three concentrations of a pesticide mixture on the first development stages of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The mixture was made up of three commonly used pesticides in viticulture: glyphosate (GLY), chlorpyrifos (CPF) and copper sulfate (Cu). Eyed stage embryos were exposed for 3 weeks to three concentrations of the pesticide mixture. Lethal and sub-lethal effects were assessed through a number of phenotypic and molecular endpoints including survival, hatching delay, hatching success, biometry, swimming activity, DNA damage (Comet assay), lipid peroxidation (TBARS), protein carbonyl content and gene expression. Ten target genes involved in antioxidant defenses, DNA repair, mitochondrial metabolism and apoptosis were analyzed using real-time RT-qPCR. No significant increase of mortality, half-hatch, growth defects, TBARS and protein carbonyl contents were observed whatever the pesticide mixture concentration. In contrast, DNA damage and swimming activity were significantly more elevated at the highest pesticide mixture concentration. Gene transcription was up-regulated for genes involved in detoxification (gst and mt1), DNA repair (ogg1), mitochondrial metabolism (cox1 and 12S), and cholinergic system (ache). This study highlighted the induction of adaptive molecular and behavioral responses of rainbow trout larvae when exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of a mixture of pesticides.

AB  - During infection, macrophage lineage cells eliminate infiltrating pathogens through a battery of antimicrobial responses, where the efficacy of these innate immune responses is pivotal to immunological outcomes. Not surprisingly, many intracellular pathogens have evolved mechanisms to overcome macrophage defenses, using these immune cells as residences and dissemination strategies. With pathogenic infections causing increasing detriments to both aquacultural and wild fish populations, it is imperative to garner greater understanding of fish phagocyte antimicrobial responses and the mechanisms by which aquatic pathogens are able to overcome these teleost macrophage barriers. Insights into the regulation of macrophage immunity of bony fish species will lend to the development of more effective aquacultural prophylaxis as well as broadening our understanding of the evolution of these immune processes. Accordingly, this review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of teleost macrophage antimicrobial responses and the strategies by which intracellular fish pathogens are able to avoid being killed by phagocytes, with a focus on Mycobacterium marinum.

AB  - Author summary Dengue is one of the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral diseases in the world and is caused by bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue infection is a systemic and dynamic disease with a wide clinical spectrum that includes both severe and non-severe manifestations. In some cases dengue can lead to death. Cambodia has one of the highest per-capita incidence rates. Without a cure or routinely available vaccine, dengue control relies largely on reduction and avoidance mosquitoes. In Cambodia dengue mosquito control activities are focused on larviciding with temephos and pyrethroid based adulticide sprays to which Aedes have been shown to be increasingly resistant. The current qualitative study was designed to better understand the community acceptance and perceptions of biological controls that would overcome insecticide resistance for consideration in dengue control strategies for the future. Two control methods were deployed in different size water containers: (1) guppy fish to predate mosquito larvae in large containers, and (2) a slow-release larvicide (pyriproxyfen) product in small containers. A total of 103 people participated in 12 FGDs and nine IDIs. Both methods were generally seen positively. The advantages of guppy fish were their ease of use and rearing, and evident propensity to eat larvae. The advantages of pyriproxyfen was its long-lasting effectiveness, lack of smell, and easy maintenance. Interpersonal communication through health volunteers was the most preferred method of transmitting prevention messages. Both mosquito control interventions should be considered in future projects in Cambodia.
   Background In Cambodia dengue vector control activities are focused on larviciding with temephos and pyrethroid based adulticide sprays to which Aedes have been shown to be increasingly resistant. A cluster randomized trial assessed the impact of using biological control tools (guppy fish, pyriproxyfen (PPF), and Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities in combination), which would be used in a value comparison to traditional chemical control tools. Given these new intervention methods, a qualitative assessment was designed in order to represent the quality of understanding, acceptance, and implementation by participants. Methodology/Principal findings A total of 103 participants in 12 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and nine In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) were included in the study. The majority of participants in intervention villages (50 out of 80) preferred guppy fish over other vector control methods due to ease of use and rearing, quick reproduction and propensity to eat larvae. A substantial number of participants (11 out of 40) in intervention villages with PPF favored it due to long-lasting effectiveness, lack of smell and easy maintenance. Participants showed high demand for both interventions and were willing to pay between 100-500 riel (0.03-0.13 USD). Nearly all participants perceived that the interventions resulted in a reduction in Aedes mosquitos (both adults and immatures) and dengue cases. The presence of larvae in the water despite the use of PPF was a source of concern for some participants, although this was overcome in some cases with proper health education through health volunteers. Interpersonal communication through health volunteers was the most favorite method of transmitting prevention messages.

AB  - Exposure to dieldrin induces neurotoxic effects in the vertebrate CNS and disrupts reproductive processes in teleost fish. Reproductive impairment observed in fish by dieldrin is likely the result of multiple effects along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, but the molecular signaling cascades are not well characterized. To better elucidate the mode of action of dieldrin in the hypothalamus, this study measured neurotransmitter levels and examined the transcriptomic response in female largemouth bass (LMB) to an acute treatment of dieldrin. Male and female LMB were injected with either vehicle or 10 mg dieldrin/kg and sacrificed after 7 days. There were no significant changes in dopamine or DOPAC concentrations in the neuroendocrine brain of males and females after treatment but GABA levels in females were moderately increased 20-30% in the hypothalamus and cerebellum. In the female hypothalamus, there were 227 transcripts (p < 0.001) identified as being differentially regulated by dieldrin. Functional enrichment analysis revealed transcription, DNA repair, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and cell communication, as biological processes over-represented in the microarray analysis. Pathway analysis identified DNA damage, inflammation, regeneration, and Alzheimer's disease as major cell processes and diseases affected by dieldrin. Using multiple bioinformatics approaches, this study demonstrates that the teleostean hypothalamus is a target for dieldrin-induced neurotoxicity and provides mechanistic evidence that dieldrin activates similar cell pathways and biological processes that are also associated with the etiology of human neurological disorders.

AB  - The freshwater fish Anabas testudineus was exposed for 21 days to two commercial formulations of synthetic pyrethroids deltamethrin and permethrin at sublethal concentrations of 0.007 and 0.0007 mg L-1, and 0.093 and 0.0093 mg L-1, that represented 10% and 1%, respectively, of the 96 h LC50 of these two pesticides for this fish. The glycogen, protein and lactic acid contents, along with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme activities in liver and muscle tissues of control and pesticide-exposed fish were estimated. When compared with those of control fish, significant depletion of glycogen content was observed in liver, and that of protein in muscle tissue of fish treated with both the pesticides at their higher as well as lower concentrations. Lactic acid reduction was significant only in fish muscle treated with deltamethrin. SDH level was reduced significantly in both liver and muscle tissues except in fish exposed to 0.0093 mg L-1 permethrin. AST level was reduced significantly in liver and muscle tissues and ALT in muscle tissue of deltamethrin treated fish only. It is concluded that deltamethrin, a type-II pyrethroid, is more toxic to fish than the type-I pyrethroid permethrin and is capable of rendering toxicity at a dose as low as 1% of its LC50 value.

AB  - Jundia (Rhamdia quelen, Quoy and Gaimard), a South American teleostean fish, was exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of cypermethrin (30% and 45% of the 48-h LC50 value of 0.265 ppm) for 2, 4 or 8 days. Serum biochemical and hematological values and behavioral changes were studied. The 30% LC50, 0.08 ppm, produced significant increases in Mg2+, P, K+, creatinine, urea, glucose, cholesterol, aspartate amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, and reduction in total proteins and triglycerides in serum. The 45% LC50, 0.12 ppm, produced significant increase in Na+ Mg2+, P, K+, creatinine, urea, glucose, cholesterol, and alkaline phosphatase, and reduction in triglycerides and alanine aminotransferase levels in serum. At this concentration, the fish showed behavior changes such as hyperexcitability, asphyxia, and widening of mouth and operculum. The hematological values remained normal, except for hemoglobin concentrations and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, which increased with exposure to 0.08 ppm and 0.12 ppm cypermethrin. Results of the present work show that biochemical analysis of serum can be useful to detect incipient cypermethrin intoxication of the shoal.

AB  - The use of herbicides with glyphosate as an active ingredient (a.i.) has increased dramatically in recent years, with its residues often being found in either soil or water. Nevertheless, concerns have arisen about its harmful side effects for both ecosystems and wildlife health. Therefore, the objective of this work was to assess the effects of a commercial formulation of glyphosate (RoundUp (R) UltraMax), at environmentally relevant concentrations on zebrafish embryos through a set of behavioural patterns. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 2 and 5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) concentrations of the glyphosate formulation for 72 h (from 2.5 to 75 h post-fertilization (hpf)). After exposure, larvae were washed and allowed to develop until 144 hpf. At this point, the larvae behaviour was evaluated using a battery of tests to assess the general exploratory motility, escape-like responses, anxiety-related behaviours and social interactions. In addition, cortisol levels were assessed. No significant changes were observed relative to the exploratory behaviour in the standard open field. The anxiety-related behaviours were similar among groups, and no social interference was observed following exposure to these glyphosate concentrations. Likewise, cortisol levels remained similar among treatments. Still, the larvae exposed to 5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) did not react to the presence of an aversive stimulus, supporting glyphosate-induced changes in the sensory- motor coordination during development. In general, these results indicate a possible neurotoxic effect of this glyphosate-based formulation that should be further evaluated. In addition, the results obtained could impose a risk for wildlife sensitive species that should not be neglected. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Roundup, also known by the name Glyphosate, is used as a non-selective herbicide in agriculture as well as in fish ponds, lakes, canals etc. Literature on the toxicity of glyphosate for the aquatic environment and aquatic organisms is extremely scarce. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different sublethal concentrations of glyphosate (4, 6, 8 mg/l) in water on the non-specific immunity and the following internal organs: livers and kidneys of carps. The study was carried out on 120 clinically healthy carps K-1, weighing 60-80 g. The white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count and micro test of NBT reduction to evaluate phagocytic activity of neutrophils were performed. Likewise the phagocytic activity of kidney neutrophils and macrophages as well as the level of lysozyme in serum were observed. During all the experiments (28 days) one observed decreased non-specific immunity. The reduction of the phagocytic activity of blood and kidney neutrophils and macrophages as well as of the lysozyme level was observed.
   In the histopathological investigations degenerative changes in the livers and kidneys of the carps exposed to glyphosate during 14 days were observed. Histopathological changes in livers were characterized with oedema cells, vacuolar degeneration and focal fibrosis. In kidneys, degenerative changes relating mostly to tubular cells were noted, as well as necrosis of heamopoietic tissue and focal fibrosis. The studies showed that Roundup in toxic to fish, handicapping the functioning of the defensive immunological system and liver and kidney function.

AB  - Farmers are often chronically exposed to insecticides, which may present health risks including increased risk of neurobehavioral impairment during adulthood and across aging. Experimental animal studies complement epidemiological studies to help determine the cause-and-effect relationship between chronic adult insecticide exposure and behavioral dysfunction. With the zebrafish model, we examined short and long-term neurobehavioral effects of exposure to either an organochlorine insecticide, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or an organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). Adult fish were exposed continuously for either two or 5 weeks (10-30 nM DDT, 0.3-3 mu M CPF), with short- and long-term effects assessed at 1-week post-exposure and at 14 months of age respectively. The behavioral test battery included tests of locomotor activity, tap startle, social behavior, anxiety, predator avoidance and learning. Long-term effects on neurochemical indices of cholinergic function were also assessed. Two weeks of DDT exposure had only slight effects on locomotor activity, while a longer five-week exposure led to hypoactivity and increased anxiety-like diving responses and predator avoidance at 1-week post-exposure. When tested at 14 months of age, these fish showed hypoactivity and increased startle responses. Cholinergic function was not found to be significantly altered by DDT. The two-week CPF exposure led to reductions in anxiety-like diving and increases in shoaling responses at the 1-week time point, but these effects did not persist through 14 months of age. Nevertheless, there were persistent decrements in cholinergic presynaptic activity. A five-week CPF exposure led to long-term effects including locomotor hyperactivity and impaired predator avoidance at 14 months of age, although no effects were apparent at the 1-week time point. These studies documented neurobehavioral effects of adult exposure to chronic doses of either organochlorine or organophosphate pesticides that can be characterized in zebrafish. Zebrafish provide a lowcost model that has a variety of advantages for mechanistic studies and may be used to expand our understanding of neurobehavioral toxicity in adulthood, including the potential for such toxicity to influence behavior and development during aging.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the propensity of permethrin (PTN) to induce oxidative stress and changes in enzyme activities in liver of rainbow trout and its possible attenuation by vitamin C. Forty-eight fish were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment groups and their livers were used for liver perfusion method: control (0 mu gL(-1) permethrin and 0 mgL(-1) vitamin C), PTN-0.16 (0.16 mu gL(-1) permethrin), PTN-0.32 (0.32 mu gL(-1) permethrin), PTN-0.64 (0.64 mu gL(-1) permethrin), Vit. C (17.2 mgL(-1) vitamin C), and PTN-0.64 + Vit. C (0.64 mu gL(-1) permethrin and 17.2 mgL(-1) vitamin C). Results obtained showed that permethrin significantly (P<0.05) increased ALT, AST and LDH activities in the liver perfusion medium and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in liver tissue. The values of reduced glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant capacity (FRAP) in the liver tissue were significantly decreased due to permethrin administration. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between MDA concentration and ALT, AST and LDH activities in the permethrin groups, suggesting that the enhanced lipid peroxidation may be linked to hepatic damage caused by permethrin. On the other hand, treatment with vitamin C in the PTN-0.64 + Vit. C group increased the values of GSH and FRAP, and decreased the level of MDA and the activities of hepatic enzymes, when compared to the PTN-0.64 group. The present study revealed that vitamin C could ameliorate permethrin-induced oxidative damage by decreasing lipid peroxidation and altering antioxidant defense system in liver of rainbow trout.

AB  - Many microbiotests that have been proposed for use in the risk assessment of environmental pollutants have the drawback of lacking relevant published data on various aspects of their test application possibilities and therefore do not receive the regulatory recognition which they may deserve. The MARA bioassay lacks published data for many relevant environmental pollutants, particularly pesticides and this may limit its use in regulatory framework. The present study has assessed the sensitivity of the MARA bioassay relative to other established bioassays (Daphnia magna and Oreochromis niloticus) to two widely used herbicide formulations: Roundup (having glyphosate as active ingredient) and Herbextra (with the active ingredient being 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-2,4-D). Roundup was found to be more toxic than Herbextra in all three bioassays. The D. magna EC50 s obtained for Roundup and Herbextra were respectively 5.55 and 356.61 mg/l while the LC50 s for O. niloticus were 11.30 and 222,28 mg/l respectively. In the case of the MARA bioassay microbial toxic concentrations (MTCs) for individual species ranged from 6.85 to 468 mg/l with an overall mean MTC of 101.82 mg/l for glyphosate and from 74.67 to 13,333 mg/l for 2,4-D giving an overall mean MTC of 2855.88 mg/l. Although the overall MTCs from the MARA bioassay were much higher than the LC50 s and EC50 s from the fish and daphnia bioassays respectively, the most sensitive MARA organism for each of the herbicides had MTCs that were comparable to or lower than the corresponding endpoints from the other bioassays implying that the MARA assay is a potentially useful bioassay for risk assessment of pesticides.

AB  - Glyphosate is a broad spectrum herbicide used aggressively in agricultural practices as well as home garden care. Although labeled "safe" by the chemical industry, doses tested by industry do not mimic chronic exposures to sublethal doses that organisms in the environment are exposed to over long periods of time. Given the widespread uses of and exposure to glyphosate, studies on developmental toxicity are needed. Here we utilize the zebrafish vertebrate model system to study early effects of glyphosate on the developing heart. Treatment by embryo soaking with 50 mu g/ml glyphosate starting at gastrulation results in structural abnormalities in the atrium and ventricle, irregular heart looping, situs inversus as well as decreased heartbeats by 48 h as determined by live imaging and immunohistochemistry. Vasculature in the body was also affected as determined using fli-1 transgenic embryos. To determine if the effects noted at 48 h post fertilization are due to early stage alterations in myocardial precursors, we also investigate cardiomyocyte development with a Mef2 antibody and by mef2ca in situ hybridization and find alterations in the Mef2/mef2ca staining patterns during early cardiac patterning stages. We conclude that glyphosate is developmentally toxic to the zebrafish heart. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In mammals, interleukin (IL)-17 receptor C (IL-17RC) and IL-17RA mediate IL-17A and IL-17F signaling to produce mucin, antimicrobial peptides, and maintain healthy intestinal flora. However, IL-17RC signaling in fish remains unclear. In this study, three il17rc transcripts (il17rca1, il17rca2, and il17rcb) from the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were cloned; il17rca1 and il17rca2 mRNAs were alternatively spliced from il17rca pre-mRNA as transcript variants. The il17rca and il17rcb genes were located on chromosomes 7 and 5, respectively. Teleost clades containing medaka il17rca and il17rcb clustered separately from the tetrapod clade. In adult tissues, il17rca1 expression was significantly higher than il17rca2 and il17rcb. Conversely, il17rcb expression was significantly higher in embryos and larvae. These expression patterns changed following infection with Edwardsiella piscicida and Aeromonas hydrophila. Furthermore, an immunoprecipitation assay using recombinant IL-17RCs and rIL-17A/Fs suggested that, in teleosts, three ligands could function in signaling through two IL17RCs.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of Roundup on oxidative status in adult Danio rerio liver and gills. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant capacity (ACAP) were measured in fish after exposure to Roundup (5 and 10 mg/L) for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Furthermore, gene expression related to antioxidant response was evaluated after 24 and 96 h. In gills, an increase in ACAP was observed after 96 h in the highest concentration. In the liver, a reduction in ROS and ACAP was observed after 24 h, whereas an increase in ACAP was observed after 48 h in the highest concentration. Exposure to the lowest concentration caused a reduction in ROS after 72 and 96 h. Regarding gene expression, a reduction in superoxide dismutase 2 (sod2) and glutathione S-transferase (gst pi) was observed. An increase in uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1) expression was observed in gills of animals exposed to the highest concentration after 24 h. Glutathione peroxidase (gpx) gene expression was reduced in the gills of animals exposed to the lowest concentration; however, it was induced in liver tissue after 96 h of exposure to the highest concentration. These results indicate that zebrafish exposure to Roundup alters oxidative status and causes a response in terms of antioxidant defense system gene expression.

AB  - Variance and invariance residing in multi-individual movement of zebrafish under chemical stress were addressed concurrently before and after treatment with formaldehyde. Variance was observed in movement parameters. Without treatment, linear speed was highest in groups with two-individuals, followed by those with one- and four-individuals. Following treatment, linear speed decreased significantly in groups with one- and two-individuals, but not in those with four-individuals. Inter-distances between two-individuals in groups with two-individuals decreased markedly after treatment, whereas inter-distances between two randomly selected individuals in the groups with four-individuals were not affected. The zero- and peak-values in the time-lag of autocorrelation of inter-distances decreased further after treatment in groups of two individuals relative to those in groups of four individuals. However, the empirical transition probability matrix between predefined behavioral patterns remained invariant among groups with different numbers of individuals as well as before and after treatment. Variance and invariance in multi-individual behaviors are suitable in expressing complex behaviors under chemical stress and could be a reference for detecting contaminants in the environment using indicator species.

AB  - Excessively used pesticides in agricultural areas are spilled into aquatic environments, wherein they are suspended or sedimented. Owing to climate change, herbicides are the fastest growing sector of the pesticide industry and are detected in surface water, groundwater, and sediments near agricultural areas. In freshwater, organisms, including mussels, snails, frogs, and fish, are exposed to various types and concentrations of herbicides. Invertebrates are sensitive to herbicide exposure because their defense systems are incomplete. At the top of the food chain in freshwater ecosystems, fish show high bioaccumulation of herbicides. Herbicide exposure causes reproductive toxicity and population declines in freshwater organisms and further contamination of fish used for consumption poses a risk to human health. In addition, it is important to understand how environmental factors are physiologically processed and assess their impacts on reproductive parameters, such as gonadosomatic index and steroid hormone levels. Zebrafish is a good model for examining the effects of herbicides such as atrazine and glyphosate on embryonic development in freshwater fish. This review describes the occurrence and role of herbicides in freshwater environments and their potential implications for the reproduction and embryonic development of freshwater organisms.

AB  - During pre-pandemic time, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were investigated in the surface water of Periyar River (PR) and Bharathappuzha River (BR) in Ernakulam and Malappuram districts of Kerala, respectively and Adyar River (AR) and Cooum River (CR) in Chennai district of Tamil Nadu. After the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, variation in OCPs and PCBs were evaluated for AR and CR. Dominance of beta-HCH and gamma-HCH in south Indian rivers indicate historical use of technical HCH and ongoing use of Lindane, respectively. In > 90 % sites, p,p'-DDT/ p,p & PRIME;-DDE ratio was < 1, indicating past DDT usage. However during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, elevated p,p & PRIME;-DDT in AR and CR reflects localized use of DDT possibly for vector control. Similarly, during the first wave of pandemic, over a 100-fold increase in PCB-52 in these rivers of Chennai mostly via surface run-off and atmospheric deposition can be reasoned with open burning of dumped waste including added waste plastic in the solid waste stream. On contrary, a significant (p < 0.05) decline of dioxin-like PCBs level, suggests lesser combustion related activities by the formal and informal industrial sectors after the lockdown phase in Tamil Nadu. Eco-toxicological risk assessment indicated a higher risk for edible fish in PR due to endosulfan.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate Roundup (R) effects on biochemical biomarkers of the neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. Fish were acutely exposed (6, 24 and 96 h) to 10 mg L-1 of Roundup (R) (RD) or only water (control) and samples of liver, for antioxidants analysis, and brain and muscle, for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) determination, were collected. Fish exposed to RD for 24 h showed reduction on superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, and increased glutathione (GSH) content. After 24 and 96 h, fish of RD group showed increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity and lipid peroxidation. AChE activity was inhibited in brain after 96 h and in muscle after 24 and 96 h of exposure. Thus, acute exposure to RD stimulated the biotransformation pathway, with increased GST, but interfered on the antioxidant defenses, with reduction of SOD and GPx activity, leading to the occurrence of lipid peroxidation oxidation. Inhibition of AChE showed that RD acts as a contaminant with anti-AChE action. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cultivation of herbicide-tolerant strain of GM corn involves applications of a non-selective herbicide. Mortality of arthropod natural enemies resulting from the application of herbicides is negligible. But nothing is known how herbicides affect the behaviour of natural enemies and thus alter their pest control efficacy. Aim of the study was to assess the effect of the Roundup residues on the predatory, defensive, locomotory and reproductive behaviour of epigeic spiders and carabid beetles. Specimens of Pardosa agricola (Araneae: Lycosidae) and Poecilus cupreus (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were exposed for 2 h to the fresh and 1-day old residues of Roundup Biaktiv (Monsanto, IPA 480 g/l). Predation rate was similar for all treatments in both spiders and beetles. Spiders did not avoid surface treated with herbicide residues more than the control surface, but beetles slightly avoided surface with fresh residues. The speed of locomotion of spiders was not altered by herbicide residues, but beetles exposed to residues crawled at significantly lower speed than the control group. Herbicide residues did not affect the escape efficacy of spiders from a predator. Residues had no detrimental effect on the courtship, mating frequency and duration in spiders. Roundup Bioaktiv thus appears to be harmless to lycosid spiders and only slightly harmful to carabid beetles. The biological control potential of both predators should not be reduced by the application of Roundup Bioaktiv. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - ASC is a component of the inflammasome playing crucial roles in the inflammatory response. In mammals, ASC induces pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine production. In this study, three asc genes (asc1, asc2, and asc3) from the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were identified and characterized. These asc genes were tandem replicates on chromosome 16, and their exon-intron structures differed between them. All three ASCs conserved the pyrin and caspase-recruitment domains, which are important for inflammasome formation. In phylogenetic analysis, all ASCs clustered with those of other teleosts. The asc1 expression levels were significantly higher in several organs than those of asc2 and asc3, suggesting that asc1 may act as a dominant asc in the Japanese medaka. Expression of the three asc genes showed different patterns during Aeromonas hydrophila and Edwardsiella piscicida infections. Furthermore, their expression was adequately down-regulated in the medaka fin derived cells stimulated with ATP for 12 h, while asc2 expression was statistically up-regulated after nigericin stimulation for 24 h. Moreover, the expression of asc2 and asc3 was significantly higher in the skin of ASC-1-knockout medaka than in that of the wild type medaka during A. hydrophila infection.

AB  - Sea bass were experimentally infected with Listonella anguillarum or Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp). At 24 and 72 h post-infection, the expression analysis of immune-relevant genes (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, Hepcidin), the transcriptional level and detection of HSP70, and the quantification of serum iron were investigated in association with the histological analysis and the bacterial recognition in tissues by immunohistochemistry. At 15 days post-infection, the specific antibody response was detected in surviving fish, as well as the transcriptional levels of TcR and BcR sequences. Both experimental infections were characterized by a similar acute response, whereas different histological and immunohistochemistry evidences were observed. In particular, the early reaction appeared suitable for the clearance of L anguillarum, thus limiting the histological lesions, the bacterial dissemination and the further development of acquired immunity in surviving fish. On the contrary, the innate response appeared not enough to resolve the Phdp infection, which was characterized by tissue damage, bacterial widespread and substantial detection of specific humoral immunity in surviving fish, also associated to lymphocytes clonal expansion. Besides the opportunistic conditions involved in fish vibriosis and pasteurellosis, the comparison between these experimental infection models seems to suggest that the rate of development of the acquired immunity is strictly linked to the activation of the host innate response combined to the degree of bacterial virulence.

AB  - Glyphosate is a non-selective and post-emergent herbicide that affects plant growth. Animal exposure to this herbicide can lead to adverse effects, such as endocrine disruption, oxidative stress and behavioural disorders. Drosophilids have been utilized previously as an effective tool in toxicological tests. In the present study, the effects of a glyphosate-based herbicide (Roundup [Original]) were investigated regarding oxidative stress, the antioxidant defence system and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies (of both genders) that were 1 to 3 days old were exposed to different glyphosate concentrations (0.0 mg/L = control, 1.0 mg/L, 2.0 mg/L, 5.0 mg/L and 10.0 mg/L) in the diet for 24 h and 96 h. After the exposure periods, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were quantified. In addition, the mRNA expression of antioxidant genes (i.e., keap1, sod, sod2, cat, irc, gclc, gclm, gss, trxt, trxr-1 and trxr-2) was evaluated via RT-PCR. Additionally, AChE activity was evaluated only after the 96 h exposure period. The results indicated that Roundup exposure leads to a reduction in ROS levels in flies exposed for 96 h. ACAP levels and gene expression of the antioxidant defence system exhibited an increase from 24 h, while LPO did not show any significant alterations in both exposure periods. AChE activity was not affected following Roundup exposure. Our data suggest that Roundup exposure causes an early activation of the antioxidant defence system in D. melanogaster, and this can prevent subsequent damage caused by ROS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Glyphosate is an efficient herbicide widely used worldwide. However, its toxicity to non-targeted organisms has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicide was evaluated on goldfish (Carassius auratus) after long-term exposure. Tissues of brains, kidneys and livers were collected and submitted to NMR-based metabolomics analysis and histopathological inspection. Plasma was collected and the blood biochemical indexes of AST, ALT, BUN, CRE, LDH, SOD, GSH-Px, GR and MDA were measured. Long-term glyphosate exposure caused disorders of blood biochemical indexes and renal tissue injury in goldfish. Metabolomics analysis combined with correlation network analysis uncovered significant perturbations in oxidative stress, energy metabolism, amino acids metabolism and nucleosides metabolism in glyphosate dosed fish, which provide new clues to the toxicity of glyphosate. This integrated metabolomics approach showed its applicability in discovering the toxic mechanisms of pesticides, which provided new strategy for the assessment of the environmental risk of herbicides to non-target organisms.

AB  - Deltamethrin is a pyrethroid insecticide that is considered extremely toxic to aquatic organisms. We evaluated the effect of subacute doses (0.033, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/kg) of deltamethrin on micronucleus frequency and oxidative stress markers in Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 d after intracoelomic injection. No genotoxic damage was recorded, as no specimen showed a micronucleus number above the physiological range. Deltamethrin exposure elicited a transient reduction in the levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase and a persistent decrease in glutathione reductase activity. Overall, the lower antioxidant enzyme activity in the deltamethrin-treated fish was mainly dose-dependent.

AB  - The influence of deltamethrin on the innate immunity in rainbow trout was examined. Fish were immersed in deltamethrin at doses of 1, 2, and 4 mu g/L for 30 min. The results showed that deltamethrin at doses of 2 and 4 mu g/L decreased phagocytic activity of spleen macrophages and proliferative response of pronephros lymphocytes at days 1, 2, and 5 after immersion. Deltamethrin at these doses decreased the lysozyme activity, total protein, and immunoglobulin levels in serum. The greatest immunosuppressive influence of deltamethrin at dose 4 mu g/L was observed at the end of the study. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010; 29: 489-491. (C) 2009 SETAC

AB  - Two topically applied spot-on products -65% permethrin (Defend(R) EXspot(R) Treatment for Dogs, SP Animal Health, Union, NJ) and 9,7% fipronil (Frontline(R) Spot On Dog, Merial Limited, Iselin, NJ)-used for canine flea and tick control were evaluated for repellency against Ixodes ricinus, the tick species that is the primary vector Of Lyme disease in Europe. Eighteen dogs were randomly assigned to the following treatment groups (n=6): (1) 65% permethrin, (2) 9,7% fipronil, or (3) untreated control. Dogs were exposed to ticks in individually assigned cages with a carpet that covered similar to70% of the cage bottom. Dogs in treatment groups I and 2 were treated in accordance with label directions for each respective product on study day 0. Fifty unfed, male and female adult ticks were placed in the cages 15 to 30 minutes before the dogs. The dogs were placed in the cages for a 2-hour exposure period at 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 41 days after treatment. After a 2-hour exposure period, dogs were removed from the cages and live (attached and unattached) and dead ticks were counted on the dogs, on the carpets, and in the cages. Cages were thoroughly cleaned and new carpet was used for each tick exposure period. Treatment of dogs with 65% permethrin reduced tick numbers on dogs by 99,1% at 2 days, 99,0% at 1 week, 95,9% at 2 weeks, 88,5% at 3 weeks, 87,1% at 4 weeks, and 48,0% at 6 weeks after application. In contrast, treatment of dogs with 9,7% fipronil reduced tick numbers on body by 61,4% at 2 days, 51,6% at 1 week, 37,0% at 2 weeks, 33,7% at 3 weeks, 10,8% at 4 weeks, and 0% at 6 weeks after application. The efficacy of, 65% permethrin was significant (Pless than or equal to0.05) when compared to the control at all challenges, whereas the efficacy of 9,7% fipronil was not significant as compared to controls at 21, 28, 35, and 41 days after treatment. The 65% permethrin killed significantly more Ixodes ricinus ticks (Pless than or equal to0.05) than 9,7% fipronil from 2 to 41 days after treatment. The 65% permethrin repelled 1,9-, 2,0-, 3,0-, 43,3-, 3,9-, 8,9-, and 17,3-fold more Ixodes ricinus than did 9,7% fipronil at 2, 7,14,21, 28,35, and 41 days after treatment, respectively, and all differences in repellency were significant (Pless than or equal to0.05).

AB  - Biologically active compounds used in agriculture that develop near aquatic environments easily spill into rivers or lakes. As a result, insecticides, herbicides and fungicides are observed worldwide in aquatic environments and accumulated in aquatic organism. Many insecticides, including organochlorine and organophosphate, have long been banned long ago because of their high persistence and non-target toxicity. However, previous studies have shown that persistent pesticides remain in aquatic organisms. The immune system is the first defense mechanism against exposure to persistent organic pollutants or pesticides that have been released into the aquatic environment. Many insecticides have been reported to cause immunotoxicity, which is represented by alteration of phagocytic and lysozyme activity. Recent studies show that immunotoxicity by insecticides exerts a more complex mechanism in fish. Insecticides induce immunotoxic effects, such as the release of inflammatory cytokines from head kidney macrophages and inhibition of immune cell proliferation in fish, which can lead to death in severe cases. Even currently used pesticides, such as pyrethroid, with low bioaccumulation have been shown to induce immunotoxicological effects in fish when exposed continuously. Therefore, this review describes the types and bioaccumulation of insecticides that cause immunotoxicity and detailed immunotoxicological mechanisms in fish tissues.

AB  - Organophosphate herbicides are among the most dangerous agrochemicals for the aquatic environment. In this context. Roundup (R), a glyphosate-based herbicide, has been widely detected in natural water bodies, representing a potential threat to non-target organisms, namely fish. Thus, the main goal of the present study was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of Roundup (R) in the teleost fish Anguilla anguilla, addressing the possible causative involvement of oxidative stress. Fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of this herbicide (58 and 116 mu g L-1) during one or three clays. The standard procedure of the comet assay was applied to gill and liver cells in order to determine organ-specific genetic damage. Since liver is a central organ in xenobiotic metabolism, nucleoids of hepatic cells were also incubated with a lesion-specific repair enzyme (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase - FPG), in order to recognise oxidised purines. Antioxidants were determined in both organs as indicators of pro-oxidant state. In general, both organs displayed an increase in DNA damage for the two Roundup (R) concentrations and exposure times, although liver showed to be less susceptible to the lower concentration. The enzyme-modified comet assay showed the occurrence of FPG-sensitive sites in liver only after a 3-day exposure to the higher Roundup (R) concentration. The antioxidant defences were in general unresponsive, despite a single increment of catalase activity in gills (116 mu L-1, 3-day) and a decrease of superoxide dismutase activity in liver (58 mu g L-1 3-day). Overall, the mechanisms involved in Roundup (R)-induced DNA strand-breaks showed to be similar in both organs. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the type of DNA damage varies with the concentration and exposure duration. Hence, after 1-day exposure, an increase on pro-oxidant state is not a necessary condition for the induction of DNA-damaging effects of Roundup (R). By increasing the duration of exposure to three days, ROS-depenclent processes gained preponderance as a mechanism of DNA-damage induction in the higher concentration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper studies the effect of environmental regulations on border pollution reduction in developing countries' rural areas by taking livestock environmental regulations (LERs) in China as a quasi-natural experiment. Applying the generalized difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) method, we find that LERs are effective in reducing border pollution: the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) of the border counties are 21.78% and 39.51%, less than that of the interior counties. We document that the effectiveness of LERs in reducing border pollution can be attributed to the fact that LERs require local governments to make collective decisions in fighting livestock pollution. Further heterogeneity analysis finds that the reduction effect of LERs on border pollution is greater in the downstream border and underdeveloped areas. Our paper implies that the externality of border pollution can be internalized through collective decision-making between local governments.

AB  - Fish populations are increasingly being subjected to anthropogenic changes to their sensory environments. The impact of these changes on inter- and intra-specific communication, and its evolutionary consequences, has only recently started to receive research attention. A disruption of the sensory environment is likely to impact communication, especially with respect to reproductive interactions that help to maintain species boundaries. Aquatic ecosystems around the world are being threatened by a variety of environmental stressors, causing dramatic losses of biodiversity and bringing urgency to the need to understand how fish respond to rapid environmental changes. Here, we discuss current research on different communication systems (visual, chemical, acoustic, electric) and explore the state of our knowledge of how complex systems respond to environmental stressors using fish as a model. By far the bulk of our understanding comes from research on visual communication in the context of mate selection and competition for mates, while work on other communication systems is accumulating. In particular, it is increasingly acknowledged that environmental effects on one mode of communication may trigger compensation through other modalities. The strength and direction of selection on communication traits may vary if such compensation occurs. However, we find a dearth of studies that have taken a multimodal approach to investigating the evolutionary impact of environmental change on communication in fish. Future research should focus on the interaction between different modes of communication, especially under changing environmental conditions. Further, we see an urgent need for a better understanding of the evolutionary consequences of changes in communication systems on fish diversity.

AB  - The use of commercial pesticides combinations increases the risk of intoxication in non-target aquatic organisms. Here, we investigate the potential of a commercial pesticide formulation containing (CYP) plus chlorpyrifos (CPF) to induce oxidative damage on two fish species (common carp and zebrafish). Carp and zebrafish were exposed for 96 h under laboratory conditions. Fish were divided in three different groups: CTL, 0.3 mu g L-1 or 0.6 mu g L-1 of CYP and 0.5 or 1 mu g L-1 of CPF in commercial formulation. Both carp and zebrafish showed an increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity when compared to control group. Other oxidative parameters responded differently to exposure in carp and zebrafish. There were an increase in ascorbic acid (ASA) levels and decrease in catalase (CAT) activity and non-protein thiols (NPSH) levels in treated groups of carps. In the other hand, zebrafish showed significant decrease in ASA and increase in CAT activity and NPSH levels. Overall, we demonstrate noxious effects on redox parameters in two fish experimental models and different effects were observe in each fish species exposed to commercial pesticide formulation. This difference responses observed can be related with specific mechanisms of detoxification and antioxidant defense system of each species.

AB  - Rotenone, commonly used as a pesticide in agriculture and as a piscicide in aquaculture, is a toxic compound that causes dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brain. At the neuroendocrine level, dopamine (DA) drives behavioral (locomotion, emotion, feeding, and social interactions, etc.) and reproductive functions of fish. In the current investigation, we examined effects of rotenone toxicity on neurobehavioral and reproductive functions in whole brain and in selected brain regions in an Indian freshwater catfish, locally known as gulsha (Mystus cavasius). After fish were exposed to water containing rotenone at 0, 2.5, 25, and 250 mu g/L for 2 days, significant reductions of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; a DA metabolite), and their ratio (DOPAC/DA) were observed in whole brain at 250 mg/L ambient concentrations of rotenone. When fish were treated with rotenone at 250 mg/L concentration for 2 days, there was a significant reduction of DA, DOPAC and DOPAC/DA in diencephalon, DA and DOPAC in pituitary, and only DA in the telencephalon, compared with control fish. In parallel, numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (THthorn) neurons declined significantly in the diencephalon and pituitary after rotenone treatment. Slowed, spontaneous movement and reduced feeding behavior were observed in rotenone-treated fish. Rotenone treatment resulted in a significantly higher gonadosomatic index with many mature vitellogenic oocytes in ovaries and lowered dopaminergic activity in these fish. These results indicate that rotenone influences neurobehavioral and reproductive functions through dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in gulsha brain. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During an avian mass mortality event investigation at the National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory in Ashland, OR, imidacloprid became an insecticide of concern. A qualitative analytical toxicology screen of seeds, plucks (tongue, esophagus, and trachea), and ventricular contents was requested. A method for the extraction and qualitative analysis of the insecticide in animal tissues was therefore developed. The procedure relies on a combined Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) and QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) approach to sample extraction followed by qualitative analysis by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Since imidacloprid is not amenable to the conditions of gas chromatography, a trimethylsilyl derivative was created and characterized. Proposed mechanisms for the creation of this derivative and its mass spectrum are described. The imidacloprid-trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivative was detected in all samples submitted.

AB  - In fish, the first line of defense is represented by the innate immune system and the lysozyme is one of the molecules involved in this mechanism of protection. Three types of lysozymes have been identified in metazoan, the c-type (chicken or conventional), the g-type (goose-type) and the i-type (invertebrate type). They are all involved in the hydrolysation of the bacterial cell wall. Our work has been focused on the molecular characterization, expression analysis by real-time PCR, both at basal condition and after in vivo challenges, and 3D structural studies on the g-type lysozyme from sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.). Moreover, a recombinant sea bass lysozyme has been produced in Escherichia coli and used to investigate the activity of the enzyme at different pH and temperatures and to perform antibacterial assays against typical fish pathogens. The cloned sea bass cDNA for g-type lysozyme (accession number FN667957) consists of 742 bp and translates for a putative protein of 188 amino acids. The molecular weight is 20.251, 41 Da with a theoretical pI of 8.53, two cysteine residues along the sequence and no putative signal peptide. These features of the enzyme are in agreement with the expected characteristics of a proper g-type lysozyme, except for the cysteine residues that in fish are quite variable in number. An alignment between known g-type lysozyme sequences evidences that the amino acid residues thought to be involved in the enzyme catalysis (G1u(71), Asp(84) and Asp(95) in sea bass) are quite well conserved between mammalian, avian and fish sequences. The sea bass g-type lysozyme gene is composed of four exons and three introns and this gene structure is more compact compared to other known fish lysozyme homologues. Modeling of 3D structure has been performed on the template structure of g-type lysozyme from Atlantic cod. The catalytic site appears well conserved when compared with known structures of fish g-type lysozymes (cod and salmon). The basal expression of lysozyme transcripts is highest in gills, followed by head kidney and peripheral blood leukocytes. The lysozyme expression is up regulated in head kidney leukocytes both after challenge with the fish bacterial pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. The lytic activity, determined using as substrate Micrococcus lysodeikticus, was optimal at pH 5.5 and at a temperature of 30 degrees C. In conclusion, these results suggest that the identified g-type lysozyme should be involved in the innate immune responses of sea bass. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT) metabolites, other than those routinely measured [i.e., 2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (DDE) and 2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane (DDD)], have recently been detected in elevated concentrations not only in the surface water of Teltow Canal, Berlin, but also in sediment samples from Elbe tributaries (e.g., Mulde and Havel/Spree). This was paralleled by recent reports that multiple other metabolites could emerge from the degradation of parent DDT by naturally occurring organisms or by interaction with some heavy metals. Nevertheless, only very few data on the biological activities of these metabolites are available to date. The objective of this communication is to evaluate, for the first time, the cytotoxicity, dioxin-like activity, and estrogenicity of the least-studied DDT metabolites.
   Four DDT metabolites, p,p'-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1-chloroethylene (DDMU), p,p'-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1-chloroethane (DDMS), p,p'-2,2-bis(4-ch1oropheny1)acetonitrile (DDCN), and p,p'-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)acetic acid (DDA), were selected based on their presence in environmental samples in Germany such as in sediments from the Mulde River and Teltow Canal. O,p'-DDT was used as reference in all assays. Cytotoxicity was measured by neutral red retention with the permanent cell line RTG-2 of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Dioxin-like activity was determined using the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deetylase assay. The estrogenic potential was tested in a dot blot/RNAse protection-assay with primary hepatocytes from male rainbow trout (O. mykiss) and in a yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay.
   All DDT metabolites tested revealed a clear dose-response relationship for cytotoxicity in RTG-2 cells, but no dioxin-like activities with RTL-W1 cells. The dot blot/RNAse protection-assay demonstrated that the highest non-toxic concentrations of these DDT metabolites (50 mu M) had vitellogenin-induction potentials comparable to the positive control (1 nM 17 beta-estradiol). The estrogenic activities could be ranked as o,p'-DDT > p,p'-DDMS > p,p'-DDMU > p,p'-DDCN. In contrast, p,p'-DDA showed a moderate anti-estrogenic effect. In the YES assay, besides the reference o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDMS and p,p'-DDMU displayed dose-dependent estrogenic potentials, whereas p,p'-DDCN and p,p'-DDA did not show any estrogenic potential.
   The reference toxicant o,p'-DDT displayed a similar spectrum of estrogenic activities similar to 17 beta-estradiol, however, with a lower potency. Both p,p'-DDMS and p,p'-DDMU were also shown to have dose-dependent estrogenic potentials, which were much lower than the reference o,p'-DDT, in both the vitellogenin and YES bioassays. Interestingly, p,p'-DDA did not show estrogenic activity but rather displayed a tendency towards anti-estrogenic activity by inhibiting the estrogenic effect of 17 beta-estradiol. The results also showed that the p,p'-metabolites DDMU, DDMS, DDCN, and DDA do not show any dioxin-like activities in RTL-W1 cells, thus resembling the major DDT metabolites DDD and DDE.
   All the DDT metabolites tested did not exhibit dioxin-like activities in RTL-W1 cells, but show cytotoxic and estrogenic activities. Based on the results of the in vitro assays used in our study and on the reported concentrations of DDT metabolites in contaminated sediments, such substances could, in the future, pose interference with the normal reproductive and endocrine functions in various organisms exposed to these chemicals. Consequently, there is an urgent need to examine more comprehensively the risk of environmental concentrations of the investigated DDT metabolites using in vivo studies. However, this should be paralleled also by periodic evaluation and monitoring of the current levels of the DDT metabolites in environmental matrices.
   Our results clearly point out the need to integrate the potential ecotoxicological risks associated with the "neglected" p,p'-DDT metabolites. For instance, these DDT metabolites should be integrated into sediment risk assessment initiatives in contaminated areas. One major challenge would be the identification of baseline data for such risk assessment. Further studies are also warranted to determine possible additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects that may interfere with the fundamental cytotoxicity and endocrine activities of these metabolites. For a more conclusive assessment of the spectrum of DDT metabolites, additional bioassays are needed to identify potential anti-estrogenic, androgenic, and/or anti-androgenic effects.

AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), including Roundup, are the most used herbicides in agricultural and non-agricultural areas, which can reach aquatic environments through drift during application or surface runoff. Some studies, mostly in fish, demonstrated that GBH caused oxidative stress in non-target animals. However, only few information is available on the GBH effects in the antioxidant and stress proteins of many other organisms, such as freshwater crustaceans. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of environmentally relevant GBH concentrations on the relative transcript expression (RTE) of the superoxide dismutase (soda catalase (cat), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (gpx), glutathione-S-transferase (gst), thioredoxin (txn), heat shock protein (hsp70 and hsp90) in the hepatopancreas of the ecologically important freshwater prawn Macrobrachium potiuna. Moreover, this study aimed to assess the gender-differences responses to GBH exposure. Male and female prawns were exposed to three Roundup WG (R) concentrations (0.0065, 0.065 and 0.28 mg of glyphosate/L) and a control group (0.0 mg/L) for 7 and 14 days. In general, males had an under-expression of the studied genes, indicating an oxidative stress and possible accumulation of ROS in the hepatopancreas. In the opposite, females had an overexpression of the same genes, indicating a more robust antioxidant system, in order to cope with the possible ROS increase after Roundup WG (R) exposure. Therefore, results confirmed that gender could be a confounding factor in ecotoxicological assessment of GBH effects. Additionally, this work highlights that sod1, cat, gpx, gst, txn, hsp70 and hsp90 gene expressions seem to be useful biomarkers to investigate the oxidative stress caused by Roundup WG (R) in Macrobrachium sp.

AB  - In order to identify the phagocytic cells of sea bass, the peritoneal leucocyte population of fish injected intraperitoneally with Photobacterium damselae subspecies piscicida was studied by light microscopy using cytocentrifuge preparations stained by the Antonow technique for peroxidase detection. Among the leucocytes present in the peritoneal exudate of the infected fish (macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophilic granular cells, lymphocytes and thrombocytes), macrophages and neutrophils were the only phagocytic cells. Neutrophils were easily distinguished from macrophages in Antonow stained preparations by the pattern of peroxidase positivity. Using ultrastructural cytochemistry, neutrophils were found to have abundant cytoplasmic granules positive for peroxidase and arylsulphatase and were negative for alpha-naphthyl butyrate (ANB) esterase. In contrast, ANB esterase activity was detected in macrophages. These leucocytes were typically negative for peroxidase, but occasionally, some macrophages with peroxidase or arylsulphatase-positive vacuoles were observed. Both phagocytes had cytoplasmic granules positive for acid phosphatase. Glycogen particles were found in the cytoplasm of the two phagocytic cells, but they were much more abundant in neutrophils. Macrophages were much more abundant than neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity of non-injected sea bass but early after the intraperitoneal injection of bacteria, the number of neutrophils increased quickly and extensively. Higher numbers of intraperitoneally injected bacteria were found inside macrophages as compared to neutrophils because macrophages strongly predominated in the peritoneal population at the time of injection. However, when the bacteria were injected into peritoneal cavities with high numbers of neutrophils (attracted by a previous injection of 12% casein), the percentage of neutrophils with phagocytosed bacteria increased, approaching that of infected macrophages. Taken together, these results show that in sea bass, as in many other organisms, in addition to macrophages, neutrophils are important phagocytic cells, the relative participation of each, of the two phagocytes in defense mechanisms against infection depending on the opportunity to encounter the invading infectious agents.

AB  - The immediate behavioral responses of goldfish (Carassius auratus) to pesticide-contaminated flows were recorded in a countercurrent olfactometer. In addition, electro-olfactograms were recorded from the epithelial surface of the olfactory rosette as a preliminary check for the. olfactory sensitivity of the fish to the pesticides tested. All tests were run on prochloraz (imidazole fungicide), bentazone (diazine herbicide), and nicosulfuron (sulfonylurea herbicide). Behavioral effects were assessed, at four concentrations (10 mug/L, 100 mug/L, 1 mg/L, 10 mg/L), on endpoints related to swimming pattern (preference-avoidance responses, burst swimming reactions), comfort activities (buccal movements, feeding attempts), and social relations (antagonistic acts, grouping). The behavior of the fish appeared particularly sensitive to prochloraz exposure. As a whole, prochloraz-contaminated flows showed significant effects on the six behaviors studied; bentazone and nicosulfuron affected three and five, respectively. At the lowest concentration, prochloraz also showed more effects than the two other pesticides. Some of the behavioral endpoints. were found particularly sensitive to a given chemical. Pesticide-contaminated flows also induced significant changes in swimming orientation of the fish. Attraction was observed in response to flowing solutions of prochloraz (1 mg/L,10 mg/L), bentazone (10 mug/L, 10 mg/L), and nicosulfuron (I mg/L, 10 mg/L). At a concentration of 1 mg/L, none of the pesticides induced a noticeable depolarization of the olfactory epithelium, suggesting that these chemicals are not detected by the olfactory sense of the fish. These results are discussed in the light of the data concerning effects of pesticides on behavior and chemical communication in fish.

AB  - Organophosphate pesticides as diazinon disrupt the neuroimmune communication, affecting the innate and adaptive immune response of the exposed organisms. Since the target molecule of diazinon is typically the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE), the existence of a non-neuronal cholinergic system in leukocytes makes them susceptible to alterations by diazinon. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of AChE, acetylcholine (ACh) concentration, and the expression of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChR) and muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChR) in spleen mononuclear cells (SMNC) of Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) exposed in vitro to diazoxon, a diazinon metabolite. SMNC were exposed in-vitro to 1 nM, 1 mu M, and 10 mu M diazoxon for 24 h. The enzyme activity of AChE was then evaluated by spectrophotometry, followed by ACh quantification by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Finally, mAChR and nAChR expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR. The results indicate that AChE levels are significantly inhibited at 1 and 10 mu M diazoxon, while the relative expression of (M3, M4, and M5) mAChR and (beta 2) nAChR is reduced significantly as compared against SMNC not exposed to diazoxon. However, ACh levels show no significant difference with respect to the control group. The data indicate that diazoxon directly alters elements in the cholinergic system of SMNC by AChE inhibition or indirectly through the interaction with AChR, which is likely related to the immunotoxic properties of diazinon and its metabolites.

AB  - Effects of pesticide exposure on the European flounder, Platichthys flesus, were investigated using a suppression subtractive hybridization method (SSH) to identify up- and down-regulated genes after a 30-day exposure to herbicides (a cocktail of atrazine, diuron, and isoproturon, and a single herbicide, glyphosate). A total of 256 expressed gene sequences were identified as having the potential for being differentially expressed, of which 116 could be identified by homology with databased sequences. The metabolic functions with which they are associated include energy production, general metabolism, signaling, transport, immune system, and structure. Expression of 14 of these genes was analyzed in liver, muscle, and gills by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) under experimental conditions (0, 15, and 30 days of exposure) and under field conditions (sampling in two estuaries displaying different levels of pesticide contamination). This study provides a first basis for studying the response of fish to pesticide exposure and allows the characterization of new potential genetic markers of pesticide contamination in the field.

AB  - Imidacloprid (IMI) is part of the neonicotinoids family, insecticides widely used by humans and also found in wastewater. This class of compounds, if present in the environment, can cause toxicity to different species such as bees and gammarids, although little is known about vertebrates such as fish. In addition, several substances have been reported in the environment that can cause damage to aquatic species, such as potassium perchlorate (KClO4), if exposed to high concentrations or for long periods. Often, the co-presence of different contaminants can cause a synergistic action in terms of toxicity to fish. In the present study, we first analyzed different concentrations of IMI (75, 100 and 150 mg/L) and KClO4 (1, 1.5 and 5 mM) to highlight the morphological effects at 96 hpf and, subsequently, chose two nontoxic concentrations to evaluate their co-exposure and the pathway involved in their co-toxicity. Morphological alteration, mucus production, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression related to intestinal function and oxidative stress were measured. These results suggest that co-exposure to IMI and KClO4 could affect zebrafish embryo development by increasing gut toxicity and the alteration of antioxidative defense mechanisms.

AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the most frequently used herbicides worldwide. The use of GBHs is intended to tackle weeds, but GBHs have been shown to affect the life-history traits and antioxidant defense system of invertebrates found in agroecosystems. Thus far, the effects of GBHs on detoxification pathways among invertebrates have not been sufficiently investigated. We performed two different experiments-1) the direct pure glyphosate and GBH treatment, and 2) the indirect GBH experiment via food-to examine the possible effects of environmentally relevant GBH levels on the survival of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) and the expression profiles of their detoxification genes. As candidate genes, we selected four cytochrome P450 (CYP), three glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and two acetylcholinesterase (AChE) genes that are known to be related to metabolic or target-site resistances in insects. We showed that environmentally relevant levels of pure glyphosate and GBH increased the probability for higher mortality in the Colorado potato beetle larvae in the direct experiment, but not in the indirect experiment. The GBHs or glyphosate did not affect the expression profiles of the studied CYP, GST, or AChE genes; however, we found a large family-level variation in expression profiles in both the direct and indirect treatment experiments. These results suggest that the genes selected for this study may not be the ones expressed in response to glyphosate or GBHs. It is also possible that the relatively short exposure time did not affect gene expression profiles, or the response may have already occurred at a shorter exposure time. Our results show that glyphosate products may affect the survival of the herbivorous insect already at lower levels, depending on their sensitivity to pesticides.

AB  - Aim: The current study was directed to investigate the immunotoxic and oxidative stress effects of Roundup and Stomp herbicides and their combination on Nile catfish (Clarias gariepinus).
   Materials and Methods: The experiment was carried out on 120 fish that randomly divided into four equal groups with three replicates: The first group kept as control, the second group exposed to 1/2 96 h lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of Roundup, the third group exposed to 1/2 96 h LC50 of Stomp, and the fourth one exposed to a combination of Roundup and Stomp at previously-mentioned doses. The experiment was terminated after 15 days; blood samples were obtained at 1st, 8th, and 15th days of treatment where the sera were separated for estimation of antioxidant enzymes. Meanwhile, at 15th day of exposure part of blood was collected from all groups with an anticoagulant for evaluation of phagocytic activity, then the fish were sacrificed, and specimens from the liver of all groups were obtained for histopathological examination.
   Results: Our results indicated that both herbicides either individually or in combination elucidated significant decrease in phagocytic activity that was highly marked in group exposed to both herbicides. Furthermore, our data elicited an obvious elevation in the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Meanwhile, the data depicted reduction in levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Histopathological investigation of liver proved the aforementioned results.
   Conclusion: It could be concluded that either Roundup or Stomp alone cause significant deleterious effects on aquatic vertebrates. However, the use of their combination enhanced their toxic effects. Toxicity can end up in humans through the food chain.

AB  - Pesticide pollution has become a severe challenge for harming food quality and human safety. Therefore, it's urgent to develop sensitive methods to detect and analyse pesticides. Herein, we successfully developed a new turn-on fluorescent chemosensor (TPE-4P), a tetraphenyl ethylene derivative modified with four pillar[5]arenes, which could sensitively, selectively, and rapidly detect the pesticide paraquat. In our study, we took full advantage of both the host-guest strategy and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) to achieve fluorescent enhancement of the chemosensor for paraquat, in which four pillar[5]arenes as the recognition units can selectively capture paraquat. The formation of the supramolecular complexes based on the interlaced host-guest interactions effectively restricted the intramolecular single-bond rotation and skeletal vibration, resulting in the intensive fluorescent emission. The detection limit for paraquat was low enough to reach 154.1 nM, and the detection time was short enough to meet the rapid detection conditions. Moreover, the test strips loaded-TPE-4P facilitated the detection process and achieved the semi-quantitative analysis for paraquat in real spiked samples. In addition, TPE-4P could respond to paraquat in living zebrafish obviously. These results suggest that the cooperation of host-guest and AIE chemistry could become useful for the design to detect some appropriate organic molecules.

AB  - The immunosuppressive effects of bath exposure to a sub lethal concentration of the synthetic pyrethroid alpha-permethrin (3.05 x 10(-4) mg l(-1)) in the Indian Major carp, Labeo rohita was studied after 45 days' exposure. In some groups, the effects of a-permethrin on non-specific defences and serum enzymes of carp were investigated after challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila. Several nonspecific immune responses and serum enzymes were reduced after exposure of a-permethrin. Bactericidal activity of rohu serum was reduced significantly in pesticide and bacteria treated fish. The Glutamic Oxaloacetate Transaminase (GOT) and Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (GPT) activity were increased in immuno suppressed fish. Blood glucose level was elevated significantly and Hb% was reduced significantly in pesticide and bacteria treated fishes as compared to the negative control. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The levels, distribution patterns, ecological risk and human health risk of fourteen organochlorine pesticides in surface water, sediment, and fish (Tilapia zilli and Clarias gariepinus) collected from a massive rice field in Illushi, were monitored. Samples obtained were extracted and analyzed using gas chromatography equipped with electron capture detector while risk assessment was carried out using standard models (risk quotient and Chronic daily intake). Pesticide concentration in water samples ranged from ND to 1.65 mu g/l, while the concentration of pesticide residues in sediment, C. gariepinus, and T. zilli ranged from ND to 8.45 mu g/kg dw, 0.03 to 1.57 mu g/kg/ww, and 0.03 to 0.85 mu g/kg/ww, respectively. There was a clear dominance of the organochlorine; Hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH, beta-HCH) in all matrices. Risk quotient estimates for heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, aldrin, dieldrin, DDT, endosulfan I, endosulfan II, and endosulfan aldehyde showed risk to aquatic organisms under extreme conditions. Health risk estimations showed that there is a potential risk to humans exposed to contaminated water, sediment, and fishes through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal routes of exposures. Cumulative hazard quotient estimated for pesticide mixtures in each matrix further confirmed that there was potential risk to human health especially children. Furthermore, the risk of non-carcinogenic effects followed the following sequence; biota > sediment > water. This study presents evidence of the multiple contamination of water, sediment, and biota from the Illushi River Basin which would possibly lead to non-cancer effects in humans especially children when exposed. Therefore, water bodies draining agricultural farmlands should be monitored regularly to prevent the contamination of the aquatic environment by toxic and banned pesticides, while efforts should be intensified to regulate the sales, application, and disposal of pesticide products in Nigeria.

AB  - The production of reactive oxygen species by organochlorine pesticides has been implicated in the toxicity and carcinogenicity of these compounds; however, the mechanism by which these agents stimulate the production of oxygen radicals is unknown. Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2))-mediated release of arachidonic acid has been shown to play an essential role in superoxide anion (O-2(-)) production in neutrophils exposed to various physiologic and pharmacologic agents. Therefore, studies were performed to determine if the organochlorine pesticides, lindane and dieldrin, activate neutrophils to produce O-2(-) by a mechanism that requires PLA(2). Production of O-2(-) and H-3-AA release increased with similar kinetics and concentration-response relations in neutrophils activated with either dieldrin or lindane. Significant release of H-3-AA was seen in neutrophils stimulated with dieldrin or lindane in calcium-free medium and in the presence of the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, suggesting that these agents stimulate a PLA(2) that does not require calcium for activation. In addition, both O-2(-) production and H-3-AA release were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by EEL, a mechanism-based inhibitor of calcium-independent PLA(2), These data suggest that dieldrin and lindane stimulate O-2(-) production by a mechanism that involves PLA(2). However, release of H-3-AA was not abrogated completely by EEL nor, in the case of dieldrin, preserved entirely in the absence of calcium. This suggests that more than one isoform of PLA(2) is activated by dieldrin and by lindane, and that one isoform is calcium-dependent.

AB  - Suspended sediments can decrease the apparent bio-concentration factor of organic pollutants through adsorption. However, whether this process also weakens the toxicity of organic pollutants to non-target aquatic organisms is not clear. Therefore, natural sediments were chosen as suspended sediment examples in this research applying atrazine as the target pollutant and Brachydanio rerio (more recently, Danio rerio (Zebrafish)) as the target organism to conduct acute toxicity experiments. The concentration of atrazine in aqueous solution was measured as a time series. Results show that without suspended sediments, the 96-h LC50 of atrazine to Brachydanio rerio is 29.06 mg/l at 95 % confidence interval (24.41 to 40.70 mg/l). For suspended sediments of 7500 and 15,000 mg/l, the LC50 (i.e., concentration resulting in 50 % mortality) equates to 30.74 and 39.51 mg/l, respectively, and the corresponding confidence intervals are between 27.17 and 40.91 mg/l and between 30.43 and 126.93 mg/l in that order. Probit analysis, which is a type of regression used to analyze binomial response variables, was applied using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. For the series of no suspended solids (SS), 7500 and 15,000 mg/l SS, the so-called no-observed-effective concentrations were 3, 9, and 15 mg/l, correspondingly. The uptake quantity and uptake rate of atrazine by B. rerio according to atrazine concentrations in the aqueous solution were computed. The research indicates that suspended sediments can decrease the absorbed rate of atrazine by B. rerio. Thus, suspended sediments weaken the acute toxicity of atrazine to B. rerio.

AB  - The current research aims to determine alterations in gene expression and enzymatic activity of fish antioxidant metabolism in response to pesticide administration. To this end, three different deltamethrin concentrations (0.25, 1, 2.5 mu g/L) were administrated to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at different time intervals (6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h) in order to observe the influences of the pesticide on the activity of glutathione reductase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-ghosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and the expression of Hsp70 gene. We observed that the activities of the enzymes decreased with increasing deltamethrin concentrations and exposure time. The pesticide had more inhibitory effects on gill enzymes than those of muscle, liver and kidney.. In addition, we detected that deltamethrin increased the expression of the stress-related protein Hsp70 with significant fold-chance values. The efficiency rate was 96.4% which is equal to 1.96 calculated via conversion formula used to calculate fold-chance value. We conclude that deltamethrin causes oxidative stress in fish both at protein and mRNA levels. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this in situ study was to determine the pattern of protandrous hermaphrodite Ceratothoa oestroides infestation in sea bass with respect to parasite sexual behaviour. Sea bass (N = 618) were divided into six net cages which presented three experimental groups. Group 1 represented infected fish, where female parasites were manually removed and male parasites were left in the buccal cavity of fish. Group 2 represented infected fish where both female and male parasites were removed, and group 3 represented uninfected fish (i.e., the control group). The duration of the experiment was 865.47 degree days (?D), and average sea bass mortality rate was 11.97 %. No mature C. oestroides females were found at the end of the experiment. Fish in cages with removed female parasites (group 1) had a statistically higher number of parasites in pairs at the end of the experiment, compared to the group where all parasites - both males and females - were removed (group 2) and control group (group 3) (P < 0.005). Female parasites from group 1, being larger and older, had more success in mate finding. These results suggest that the female parasite uses some method of communication to attract the pulli II, i.e., the future male parasite, necessary for reproduction. Because there is a lack of parasite biology studies, especially in situ , our data on reproduction and mating behaviour of C. oestroides could help in the development of overall parasitic removal procedures and health management in aquaculture.

AB  - Dory, the animated surgeonfish created by the Pixar Animation studios, famously suffered from short-term memory loss leading to many adventures. In reality, many fishes have excellent cognitive abilities and are able to learn and retain important information such as the identity of predators. However, if and how cognition can be affected by anthropogenically altered oceanic conditions is poorly understood. Here, we examine the effect of a widely used pesticide, chlorpyrifos, on the retention of acquired predator recognition in post-larval stage of the surgeonfish Acanthurus triostegus. Through associative learning, post-larvae of A. triostegus were first observed to forage significantly less in the presence of conspecific alarm cues and alarm cues associated to a predator's odor. The retention of this anti-predator behavior was estimated to last between 2 and 5 days in the absence of pesticide. However, environmentally-relevant concentrations of chlorpyrifos (1 mu g.L-1) induced the loss of this acquired predator recognition. This reduced ability to recognize learned predators is discussed as it may lead to more vulnerable fish communities in coastal areas subjected to organophosphate pesticide pollution.

AB  - Pesticides containing diazinon are frequently used in agriculture in the Vietnamese Mekong delta region leading to their potential residual occurrence in the environment. Under laboratory conditions, exposure to diazinon has been shown to result in adverse inhibition of cholinesterase enzyme (ChE) activity and subsequent death in several fish species. This study investigated a 96-h median lethal concentration (LC50) of diazinon concentrations from 0.08 to 1.25 mg/L on juvenile giant freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii de Man, 1879) in tanks in the laboratory. Inhibition of ChE in the flesh and in the eyes of the tested shrimps after exposed to diazinon concentrations of 2.7, 27, 67.5 mu g/L equivalent to 1%, 10%, 25% LC50-96 h was calculated. The results indicated that diazinon was highly toxic to giant freshwater prawn with a low LC50-96 h of 270 mu g/L. The activity of ChE in the flesh was more sensitive to diazinon than that in the eyes. Furthermore, in the future, the activity of ChE in the flesh or in the eyes of shrimps has potential to be used as biomarker for rapid recognition of diazinon contamination in water.

AB  - For salmon, amino acid and bile salt detection form the basis for important behaviors including predator evasion and conspecific recognition, respectively. For this reason, decreases in olfactory sensory neuron responses to the amino acid i-serine and the bile salt taurocholic acid (TChA) have been used in studies as indicators of acute olfactory pesticide toxicity to environmental contaminants such as metals and pesticides. In this study, we first compare baseline responses to these two odorant classes across three salmonids, and then explore how two currently used pesticides alter these responses. We found baseline differences in electro-olfactogram (EOG) responses and their sensitivity to pesticide exposure between rainbow trout, coho and sockeye salmon. For example, rainbow trout had lower baseline EOGs than either coho or sockeye (e.g. 10(-5) NI TChA EOGs of 1.34 +/- 0.17 versus 2.57 +/- 0.46 and 2.72 +/- 0.43 mV, respectively). At 15 min after exposure to 10 mu g/L of the herbicide linuron, rainbow L-serine-evoked EOGs were 49.6% of control versus 78.5 and 69.8% for sockeye and coho, indicating rainbow were more sensitive to linuron. In contrast, at 30 min of exposure to 100 mu g/L carbaryl, L-serine-evoked EOGs of sockeye were 49.7% of control versus 60.3 and 62.3% for rainbow and coho, suggesting sockeye were more sensitive to carbaryl. In all species the L-serine-evoked EOGs did not return to baseline by 15 min after 100 mu g/L carbaryl exposure, suggesting persisting impairment of arnino acid detection. The TChA-evoked EOGs were less affected by carbaryl exposure (i.e. EOGs were 83.3, 84.9 and 66.0% of control 15 min after exposure) and not affected at all by 100 mu g/L linuron exposure. Species-specific differences in pesticide sensitivity may limit extrapolation of toxicity across salmonids while the generally greater sensitivity of amino acid olfaction may lead to selective impairment of behaviors such;IS predator evasion.

AB  - Triazole fungicides are extensively applied in general agriculture for fungal control and have negative impacts on aquatic organisms. Prothioconazole, a widely used triazole fungicide, is toxic to zebrafish, but systematic research on the negative effects caused by prothioconazole in zebrafish embryos is limited. In this study, we studied the developmental toxicology, oxidative stress and apoptosis caused by prothioconazole in zebrafish embryos. Exposure to 0.850 ma prothioconazole impacts embryo survival and hatching. Prothioconazole exposure caused embryo malformation, especially yolk-sac and pericardial edemas, and prothioconazole-induced apoptosis was observed. Additionally, exposure to a high prothioconazole concentration up-regulated the expression levels of oxidative stress defense-related genes and p53. The bax to bcl2 ratio increased along with exposure time and prothioconazole concentration. Prothioconazole induced apoptosis during the early life stages of zebrafish and may trigger oxidative-stress and p53-dependent pathway responses. Our findings increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress and cell death caused by prothioconazole. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Present study aimed mainly to assess oxidative stress pesticides such as methyl parathion (MP) and diazinon, which are widely used insecticides and contaminate aquatic ecosystems, on certain biomarkers in various tissues of rainbowtrout (Oncorhynchcus mykiss). Biomarkers selected for stress monitoring were malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant defense system (ADS) mainly reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), peroxidase (GSH-PX), transferase (GST) and superoxidedismutase (SOD) activities in the liver, gills and muscle of fishes exposed to 0.5 and 1 ppm dosages of MP and diazinon for 24,48 and 72 h. According to these results, after the administrations of MP and diazinon promote MDA content in some of the tissues of fishes treated with both dosages of MP and diazinon. With regard to the ADS, GSH-Px, GST, SOD, GR activities and GSH levels fluctuated after 24, 48 and 72 h in all the treatment groups compared with controls. Collective results demonstrated that exposure of fish to pesticides induced an increase in MDA joined with fluctuated ADS. This may reflect the potential role of these parameters as useful biomarkers for assessment of water pollution. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of concentration (5, 50, and 500 mug/L) and duration (24, 48 h) of exposure to carbofuran, a carbamate insecticide, were assessed on brain catecholamine (norepinephrine [NE] and dopamine), plasma glucose, and hepatic glycogen contents and behavioral activities of goldfish (Carassius auratus). After 24 h of exposure to 50 and 500 mug/L, the level of NE was increased in the olfactory bulbs. The same effect was observed after a 48-h exposure to 500 and 50 mug/L in the telencephalic hemispheres and in the hypothalamus, respectively. An increase in the level of dopamine was also found in hypothalamus after 48 h of exposure to 500 mug/L carbofuran. Plasma glucose increased in concentration after both periods of exposure to carbofuran at 50 and 500 mug/L. Hepatic glycogen concentration decreased after a 48-h exposure to the highest concentration, Behavioral endpoints related to swimming pattern and social interactions were affected after a 24-h exposure to the lowest concentration tested (5 mug/L). The relative sensitivities of these different types of responses to exposure to carbofuran are discussed in light of data on the neurotoxic effects of carbamate and organophosphate insecticides in fish.

AB  - Diazinon, an organophosphate pesticide, had a sublethal effect on the olfactory system of mature male Atlantic salmon parr. The olfactory responses of the parr to prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) were studied after exposure of the epithelium to different concentrations of Diazinon in water. Electrophysiological recordings from the epithelium indicated that the responses to this prostaglandin were significantly reduced at nominal concentrations as low: as 1.0 mu g l(-1) and the threshold of detection was reduced 10-fold at 2.0 mu g l(-1). Mature male salmon parr exposed for a period of 120 h to Diazinon (nominal concentrations 0.3, 0.8, 1.7, 2.7, 5.6, 13, 28 and 45 mu g l(-1)) also had significantly reduced levels of the reproductive steroids, 17,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, testosterone and gonadotrophin II in the blood plasma after priming with ovulated female salmon urine. Both prostaglandin F-2 alpha and ovulated female urine are known to have important roles in synchronizing reproductive physiology and behaviour in salmonids as well as other fish species. The results are therefore discussed in relation to the possible sublethal effects of Diazinon on reproduction in the Atlantic salmon and possible effects on populations of salmonids.

AB  - The presence and toxicity of waterborne diuron in aquatic environments pose a severe threat to non-target organisms. However, the chronic impact of diuron in marine fish has been poorly investigated. In this study, we report the chronic effects (30 and 60 days) of environmentally relevant concentrations of diuron (0.1, 1, and 10 mu g L-1) on economically important marine fish, red seabream (Pagrus major), and black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii) by evaluating several parameters, including hormone levels, immunity, hepatic function, and antioxidant defense. Significant decreases in 17 beta-estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone levels and gonadosomatic index were observed on day 60 in fish exposed to 10 mu g L-1 diuron. Parameters of immunity, such as alternative complement activity, lysozyme activity, and total immunoglobulin levels, were significantly lowered by 60-day exposure to 10 mu g L-1 diuron in both fish. Significant decreases in the hepatic enzyme activities of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase were observed with an induction of cortisol on day 60 in fish exposed to 10 mu g L-1 diuron. Intracellular malondialdehyde and glutathione levels were significantly increased by 10 mu g L-1 diuron at day 60 with an increase in the enzymatic activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase. Overall, black rockfish were more sensitive to diuron than red seabream. These results suggest that consistent exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of diuron is detrimental to the reproduction, immunity, and health of marine fish.

AB  - Fipronil, which targets GABAA receptors (GABAARs), is the first phenylpyrazole insecticide widely used in crop protection and public hygiene. However, its high toxicity on fishes greatly limited its applications. In the present study, a series of computational methods including homology modeling, docking, and molecular dynamics simulation studies were integrated to explore the binding difference of fipronil with GABAARs from fruitfly and zebrafish systems. It was found that, in the zebrafish system, the H-bond between 6'Thr and fipronil exerted key effects on the recognition of fipronil, which was absent in the fruitfly system. On the other hand, in the fruitfly system, strong electrostatic interaction between 2'Ala and fipronil was favorable to the binding of fipronil but detrimental to the binding in the zebrafish system. These findings marked the binding difference of fipronil with different GABA(A)Rs, which might be helpful in designing selective insecticides against pests instead of fishes.

AB  - Fish are capable of sensing water-borne chemicals at sub-lethal concentrations. Inadequate behavioral responses to physiological and environmental stimuli owing to adverse effects of aquatic toxicants can have serious implications for survival.
   In this study we exposed juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during 5 days to a low-concentration mixture of three co-occurring herbicides: atrazine, linuron and metolachlor, at maximum concentrations of 4.5, 4.9 and 13.4 mu g L-1, respectively. Our hypothesis was that fish behavior - swimming activity and interactions between individuals - would be modified due to exposure to the mixture. We studied these behaviors by observing fish twice-daily throughout the exposure period at 30-s intervals for 5 min, registering the vertical distribution of fish in the water column and the number of agoniztic acts between all individuals.
   Fish exposed to the mixture of herbicides were hypoactive and spent more time in the lower parts of the aquaria in comparison to non-exposed controls, reflecting inhibited swimming activity. Average swimming height of exposed fish decreased significantly with the number of agoniztic acts, whilst in control groups there was no significant relationship between the two behaviors.

AB  - The lambda-cyhalothrin (CL) is a globally used pyrethroid insecticide that has been detected in different water bodies worldwide. However, studies on the effects of CL on freshwater fishes are still incipient. In this context, we evaluated the acute effects of a commercial formulation containing CL (Karate Zeon (R) CS 50) in juveniles of the teleost Prochilodus lineatus exposed for 96 h to four concentrations of the active ingredient (5, 50, 250 and 500 ng.L-1). Biochemical, physiological, and genotoxic biomarkers were evaluated in different organs of the fish. Exposure to CL induced significant changes in the enzymatic profiles of P. lineatus, with specific alterations in biotransformation enzymes and antioxidant defence in different tissues. Lipid peroxidation was observed in fish gills and kidney. Increases in esterases were observed in the liver of fish exposed to all CL concentrations evaluated, whereas acetylcholinesterase activity decreased in the muscles of fish at all concentrations. CL also promoted osmoregulatory disorders, with decreases in calcium and magnesium gill ATPases, with consequent hypocalcaemia, in addition an increase in sodium-potassium ATPase activity was observed in the gills of fish exposed to the highest CL concentration, probably in order to compensate a reduction in plasma sodium. Besides, increases in DNA damage were observed in the erythrocytes of fish exposed to all CL concentrations. Thus, despite the low CL concentrations and the short exposure time, this pyrethroid caused hematological adjustments, oxidative stress, osmoregulatory disorders, and DNA damage in P. lineatus, showing that the species is highly sensitive to the deleterious effects of CL.

AB  - Moderating effects of oregano extract (Origanum vulgare L.) on oxidative stress and toxicity induced by organophosphate pesticide, diazinon (0.287 mg/l) were investigated for the first time in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss by measuring antioxidant and metabolic enzymes. In non-diazinon-exposed fish, the hepatic levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) elevated in fish supplemented with 6 and 10 g ORG/kg diet compared to control group (non-ORG-supplemented fish). The supplementation of fish with 14 g ORG/kg diet significantly decreased the hepatic antioxidant enzymes compared to control. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels remained unchanged in all groups throughout the experiment. The serum levels of hepatic metabolic enzymes [(aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LHD)] remained unchanged in all experimental groups throughout the experiment. In diazinon-exposed groups, the activity of SOD, GPx, and TAC in liver elevated after exposure to diazinon in fish fed 2, 6, and 10 g ORG/kg diet. The CAT activity increased only in fish supplemented with 6 and 10 g ORG/kg diet. The levels of all antioxidant enzymes and TAC significantly decreased in control and fish supplemented with 14 g ORG/kg diet. The AChE activity significantly declined in control and fish supplemented with 2 and 14 g ORG/kg diet. After exposure to diazinon, the levels of MDA in liver increased in control and those fed 2 and 14 g ORG/kg diet. In fish supplemented with 6 and 10 g ORG/kg diet, the MDA levels showed no significant alternations during the experiment period. The serum levels of AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevated during exposure to diazinon in control and fish supplemented with 2 and 14 g ORG/kg diet, while these enzymes showed no significant changes in fish fed with 6 and 10 g ORG/kg diet. In conclusion, our results showed that ORG at optimum dietary levels (6 and 10 g ORG/kg diet) could moderate the toxicity induced by diazinon in rainbow trout by enhancing the liver antioxidant system and protecting the hepatocytes. Furthermore, the high dietary levels of ORG caused toxic effects on antioxidant enzymes and hepatocytes, which this makes it necessary to optimize its levels in the diet.

AB  - To fight the banana weevil, organochlorine insecticide was used in Guadeloupe, leading to a contamination of the rivers by chlordecone, for which the molecules are long lasting and persist in the environment although its use was banned in the 90s. In the rivers, Sicydiinae gobies of the genus. Sicydium represent key species of the ecosystem. They are herbivorous and feed on the epilithic biofilm by scraping it off the rocks. We undertook in vitro experiments in order to obtain preliminary results on the effect of the pollutant on the behaviour of Sicydium punctatum Perugia, 1896, and on its food source. It seems that the pollutant has no effect on the social behaviour of this species. However, we noted that in polluted conditions, the biofilm composition is altered, depriving S. punctatum of its favoured diatom species, which S. punctatum usually "grows" by having a gardening behaviour.

AB  - Pyrethroids, such as deltamethrin, are toxic substances that lead to generation of reactive oxygen species, which harm living organisms. We assessed the level and patterns of imbalance evolved by a single dose of 2 mu g/L deltamethrin on the lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the antioxidant defense system of Carassius auratus gibelio liver and intestine, and monitored the recovery dynamics of these parameters during a 14-day post-exposure period. LPO and antioxidative defense mechanisms displayed different responses in the investigated tissues. Sudden increase of LPO in the liver, persisting at this elevated level throughout the test period, was observed on the third day post-exposure, while in the intestine significant enhancement of this parameter was recorded from the seventh day. Reduced glutathione (GSH) showed a transient increase in the liver, and was depleted in the intestine by the second day of exposure, with signs of recovery by the end of the experimental tenure. In the liver of fish a temporary inhibition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, and activation of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GR) enzymes was observed, with maximum thresholds recorded on the third and second days, respectively. In the intestine a relevant increase in CAT and GST activity up to the second day and almost complete recovery by the end of the experiment was recorded, while for GR a continuous enhancement was apparent.

AB  - With the known facts of deltamethrin toxicity in aquaculture, efforts have been made to ameliorate its toxicity with supplementation of Silybum marianum plant extract in Cyprinus carpio. For validating its efficacy, standard techniques of histopathology, anti-oxidant profile and RAPD-PCR were used. By performing acute toxicity bioassay, 96 h LC50 of the pesticide to C. carpio was determined and was found to be 2 mu g/L. Histopathological alterations were comprised of nuclear alterations, vacuolisation and oedema in the hepatocytes. Chronic exposure to the toxicant induced significant changes in antioxidant defense system (CAT, SOD, GSH and GST levels), lipid peroxidation being prominent. Diet supplementation with silymarin appeared to modulate the oxidative stress, histopathological alterations and genotoxic damage caused by the pesticide in the fish. RAPD-PCR studies revealed deltamethrin induced toxicity and its effective amelioration in form of restoration of bands which were lost in toxicant exposed DNA profile.

AB  - Eggs from Herring Gulls, Audouin Gulls and Gull Billed Terns were collected at three different locations in Spain during the breeding season of 1988.  Organochlorine pesticides, total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and seven selected individual chlorobiphenyl congeners were determined in each of the thirty infertile eggs.
   The levels of DDE and total PCBs in eggs from the Delta Ebro River are greater than those gathered at Chafarinas Island and Cuenca.  Among the species investigated, the Gull Billed Tern eggs showed the lowest level followed by the Herring Gull and the Audouin Gull eggs.
   The levels of the seven congeners of PCBs showed that 138 was the most prominent, followed by, in decreasing order, 153, 180, 170, 101, 151, and 194.  Congener 138 constituted 10.5% +/- 2.7 (S.D) of the total PCBs concentration, the 153 8.7% +/- 4.2, the 180 7.5% +/- 1.9, the 170 3.2% +/- 1.0, the 101 1.9% +/- 3.06, the 151 1.1% +/- 1.5 and the 194 0.9% +/- 0.5.
   Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) residues (48 congeners) from gull eggs gathered at Ebro Delta and Chafarinas Islands were analyzed with SIMCA (Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy), a principal components analysis technique.  A series of technical Aroclors(R) were also analyzed to provide a reference data set for pattern recognition.  Environmental PCB residue profiles differed according to the sample's origin.  This analysis discriminated between the two regions sampled.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the toxic effects of Roundup Transorb (R) on the endangered Neotropical annual killifish Austrolebias charrua through the assessment of molecular and biochemical biomarkers. The fish were collected in temporary ponds and exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of the herbicide (5 mg.L-1 for 96 h). The production of ROS, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and membrane fluidity were evaluated in the blood cells by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of the antioxidant-related genes sod2, cat, gst alpha, atp1a1, gclc, and ucp1 across the brain, liver, and gills was quantified. The acute exposure of annual killifish to Roundup significantly increased ROS production, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage in their erythrocytes. Likewise, Roundup Transorb (R) decreased membrane fluidity in the blood cells of the exposed fish. Gene expression analysis revealed that Roundup exposure alters the relative expression of genes associated with oxidative stress and antioxidant defense. Our results give rise to new insights into adaptive mechanisms of A. charrua in response to Roundup. Since Brazilian annual killifishes strongly risk extinction, this study paves the way for developing novel biotechnologies applied to environmental monitoring and aquatic toxicology assessment.

AB  - Sera raised in rabbits, mice and sea bass against Photobacterium damsela subsp. piscicida (Ph.d.p.) cultured both in normal laboratory medium and under iron-limited conditions were analysed by Western blot. Sera collected from sea bass after injection with both live and heat-killed Ph.d.p. cells were also analysed. All analysed sera reacted with two groups of Ph.d.p. cell antigens, one (an array of products) assigned as a high molecular weight group and another (lipopolysaccharide and/or lipoprotein) assigned as a low molecular weight group. Each serum tested differed in its reaction by Western blot. Cells cultured under iron-limited conditions demonstrated, both qualitatively and quantitatively, elevated immunogenicity. Great variation among the sera was evident with reference to the recognition of antigens in the high molecular weight group of Ph.d.p. products, with the sea bass serum raised against live cells demonstrating reaction against a wider range of cell material. Lipopolysaccharide and/or lipoprotein situated in the low molecular weight group products appeared to be the most immunogenic material in the bacterial cell. A 15.5 kDa antigen was recognised only from seabass serum raised against live cells. The findings of this study are discussed in relation to future vaccine development.

AB  - The most widespread and numerous inland fish in the world is likely the mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis and G. holbrooki, Poeciliidae). Much has been written about the basic biology, the current distribution and the negative impacts of non-native populations of mosquitofish. Here, we instead review the relationship of humanity with mosquitofish. First, we review the early literature on the species and aim to resolve its path towards becoming the globally dominant fish for biological control of mosquitoes. We identify the initial advocates of mosquitofish use, we examine the reasons behind their advocacy, and we document the spread of their viewpoints into and from the globally foundational mosquito control texts. Second, we identify the people and institutions that facilitated early international translocations of mosquitofish, including, among others, David Starr Jordan, the Rockefeller Foundation and the International Red Cross. Third, we discuss the reduction in mosquitofish translocation and use during and after WWII, initially stemming from the discovery and use of other methods, like DDT and later from a recognition of the negative ecological consequences of non-native mosquitofish populations. Fourth, we propose that the future utility of mosquitofish is largely in its value as a model study organism. We provide an overview of the contributions mosquitofish have made to some major fields in biology. Finally, we suggest that the value of mosquitofish as a model system should increase into the future, behind a momentum of research advances, and as human-mediated range expansion will permit access to mosquitofish by yet greater numbers of biologists worldwide.

AB  - Fipronil has been widely used in agriculture to prevent aggressive insects from damaging agricultural products. Fipronil residues circulate in the environment and they have been detected in non-targeted organisms in aquatic environments. To study the effect of fipronil toxicity on environmental health, 6 h post fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were treated with fipronil for 72 h. LC50 value was obtained by applying varying concentrations of fipronil to zebrafish embryos for 72 h. As zebrafish embryos are useful vertebrate models for studying developmental and genetic findings in toxicology research, they were exposed to fipronil to study detailed elucidating mechanisms with hazardous end points of toxicity. Cell cycle arrest-related apoptosis supported pathological alterations, such as increased mortality, shortened body length, and reduced hatchability. Furthermore, observed heart defects, including edema and irregular heartbeat were caused due to abnormal blood circulation. In transgenic zebrafish models (fli1:eGFP and olig2:dsRED), disrupted blood vessel formations were indicated by eGFP(+) endothelial cells. Moreover, neurogenic defects were observed by studying dsRED(+) motor neurons and oligodendrocytes. This study demonstrates fipronil accumulation in aquatic environment and its ability to impair essential processes, such as angiogenesis and neurogenesis during early developmental stage of zebrafish, along with general developmental toxicity.

AB  - Difenoconazole (DCZ) is a triazole fungicide that negatively affects aquatic organisms and humans. However, data regarding the reproductive toxicity of DCZ are insufficient. In this study, we used zebrafish (from 2 h post-fertilization [hpf] to adulthood) as a model to evaluate whether DCZ at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mu g/L) induces reproductive toxicity. After exposure to DCZ, egg production and fertilization rates were reduced by 1.0 and 10.0 mu g/L. A significant decrease in gamete frequency (late vitellogenic oocytes and spermatozoa) was observed at 10.0 mu g/L. The concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and vitellogenin (VTG) were disrupted in females and males by 1.0 and 10.0 mu g/L. Exposure to 10.0 mu g/L DCZ significantly inhibited the contact time between female and male fish, which was mainly achieved by affecting male fish. The transcription of genes involved in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis was significantly changed after treatment with DCZ. Overall, these data show that the endocrine-disrupting effect of DCZ on the zebrafish HPG axis inhibited gamete maturation and disrupted reproductive behavior, reducing fertility.

AB  - The role of antioxidants in maintaining the functional integrity of adrenocortical cells during in vitro exposure to endosulfan, an organochlorine pesticide, was investigated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Aminotriazole (ATA), an inhibitor of catalase (CAT), L-buthionine sulfoximine (L-BSO), an inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor, were used to investigate the role of CAT and GSH redox cycle in protection against the adrenal toxicity of endosulfan, a pesticide that impairs cell viability (LC50 366 muM) and cortisol secretion (EC50 19 muM) in a concentration-related manner. Pretreatment with ATA and L-BSO enhanced the toxicity of endosulfan (LC50 and EC50, respectively, 302 and 2.6 muM with ATA, 346 and 3.1 muM with L-BSO), while pretreatment with NAC had no significant effect on cell viability and increased the EC50 of endosulfan to 51 muM. CAT activity was significantly reduced following exposure to endosulfan when cells were pretreated with ATA. Pretreatment with L-BSO significantly decreased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in a concentration-related manner following exposure to endosulfan, while GSH levels were significantly higher in NAC pretreated cells compared to untreated cells. Finally, pretreatment with ATA and L-BSO increased, while pretreatment with NAC decreased, lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) levels. CAT, GPx, and GSH were identified as important antioxidants in maintaining the function and integrity of rainbow trout adrenocortical cells and ATA, L-BSO, and NAC were identified as effective modulators of CAT and GSH redox cycle. Moreover, this study suggests that the glutathione redox cycle may be more efficient than catalase in protecting adrenocortical cells against endosulfan-induced oxidative stress.

AB  - Organochlorine (OC) plasma levels and their dietary and reproductive determinants were investigated in 64 pregnant women from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Prenatal exposure of newborns was evaluated in a subset of these women in which umbilical cord blood was analyzed. To assess the influence of dietary factors on OC levels, a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was completed by participants. Nondietary determinants were investigated through a general questionnaire that addressed reproductive history, lifestyle, and social-demographic characteristics. Both women and their newborns had detectable but low levels of OCs. The most frequently detected compound was p,p'-DDE, the main metabolite of p,p'-DDT. This compound was found in 97% of the women who participated in the study and in 67% of the umbilical cord blood samples, with levels ranging from 0.161 to 8.03 ppb and from 0.320 to 1.06 ppb, respectively. Among the OCs detected, only p,p'-DDE showed any correlation with dietary and nondietary factors. There was a positive correlation between maternal p,p'-DDE and the consumption of fish (Pearson r = 0.38, P = 0.002) and chicken (Pearson r = 0.26, P = 0.042). The correlation between pork consumption and p,p-DDE exhibited an inverse relationship (Pearson r = -0.25, P = 0.052). Parity was the only nondietary factor that showed a significant correlation (Pearson r = -0.36, P = 0.004). The main determinants of p,p'-DDE levels in this group of women were fish consumption and parity, together explaining 28% of the variance (P<001), in a multivariate model.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acute glyphosate (active ingredient) exposure on the oxidative stress biomarkers and antioxidant defenses of a hybrid surubim (Pseudoplatystoma sp). The fish were exposed to different herbicide concentrations for 96 h. The thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyls and antioxidant responses were verified. The 15 mg a.p L-1 of herbicide resulted in the death of 50% of the fish after 96 h. An increase in liver and muscle TBARS levels was observed when fish were exposed to the herbicide. The protein carbonyl content was also increased in the liver (4.5 mg a.p L-1 concentration) and brain (2.25 mg a.p L-1 concentration). The antioxidant activities decreased in the liver and brain after exposure to herbicide. Levels of ascorbic acid in the liver (2.25 mg a.p L-1 and 4.5 mg a.p L-1 concentrations) and brain (2.25 mg a.p L-1 concentration) were increased post-treatment. Levels of total thiols were increased in the liver and brain (2.25 mg L-1 and 7.5 mg a.p L-1, respectively). Glyphosate exposure, at the tested concentrations affects surubim health by promoting changes that can affect their survival in natural environment. Some parameters as TBARS and protein carbonyl could be early biomarkers for Roundup exposure in this fish species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deltamethrin, a widely used type II pyrethroid insecticide, was reported with neurotoxicity to aquatic organisms, such as fish. However, the effects and potential mechanisms on the central nervous system remain largely unknown, especially under environmental concentrations. Therefore, we exposed adult female zebrafish to environmentally relevant levels of deltamethrin (30,100, and 333 ng/L) for 21 days to assess neurobehavioral changes related to the central nervous system and explore the modes of action. Behavioral assays revealed significant increases in the swimming speeds, residence time near other fish and the shoaling cohesion in exposed fish. Transcriptomic results enriched the disrupted neural functions involving the glutamatergic and dopaminergic synapses in the brain. The qRT-PCR confirmed the up regulation of the factors for promoting the glutamate release. The measurement of neurotransmitters showed significantly increased content of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain. Taken together, deltamethrin exposure increased the glutamate level and promoted the release of such an excitatory neurotransmitter between the glutamatergic synapses in the brain, which eventually led to hyperactivity of social behaviors in adult zebrafish.

AB  - Pregnant mice (10 in 4 groups each) were exposed to diazinon (DZN) at 10 and 20 mg/kg on gestation day 6 (GD 6), 9 and 12. A group of 10 pregnant animals was maintained as untreated control. The ovaries were exteriorized on GD 18 by euthanizing the animals. The tissues were processed for histopathological and micrometric analysis. Oocytic nuclear derangements in terms of size increase followed by leakage of nuclear contents with increased duration of exposure were seen. Follicular and luteal cells also showed necrosis. The morphometric data showed significant increase in oocyte and para-follicular size (P_0.0001) along with similar increase in nuclear sizes (P_0.001). These findings indicate that DZN is toxic to bring about histopathological and micrometric derangements in the ovaries of the treated pregnant females.

AB  - The acute effects of the organophosphate insecticide fenitrothion on Dicentrarchus labrax juveniles were investigated through a bioassay using biomarkers and swimming behaviour as effect criteria. After 96 h of exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of fenitrothion, the swimming velocity and several biomarkers were individually determined, namely: brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity; muscle cholinesterases (ChE), lactate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities; liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferases, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and lipid peroxidation levels (LPO). A significant decrease of the swimming velocity (LOEC = 2 mg l(-1)), an inhibition of both AChE (LOEC = 0.06 mg l(-1)) and ChE activities (LOEC = 0.03 mg l(-1)), and a positive and significant correlation between the swimming velocity and AChE were found in exposed fish, suggesting an influence of the inhibition of these enzymes in the swimming velocity decrease. An increase of EROD activity (LOEC = 1 mg l(-1)), indicating the involvement of this enzyme in fenitrothion biotransformation, and a negative and significant correlation between EROD activity and swimming velocity were also found, suggesting that the two findings may somehow be related. Furthermore, results show a significant induction of SOD (LOEC = 0.13 mg l(-1)) without LPO increase, suggesting that the enzyme is preventing oxidative stress damage. No significant alterations were found in any of the other parameters tested. Thus, exposure of seabass to fenitrothion in the wild at concentrations similar to those tested here may have adverse consequences at population level as neurotransmission and swimming ability are essential for fish performance and survival.

AB  - Atrazine (ATZ) is a herbicide worldwide used. That can cause oxidative damage in non-target organisms, such as fish. Furthermore, the threat of exposure to pesticides together with poor nutrition is hazardous to the normal development of fish, and supplementation of the fish diet with antioxidants compounds is an alternative approach to prevent the hazardous effects of pesticide exposure. Here we aimed to investigate the capacity of diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)(2) diet supplementation to improve the antioxidant defense of Cyprinus carpio (carp) exposed to environmental concentrations of ATZ. To prove the efficiency of (PhSe)(2), we used the Integrated Biomarkers Response (IBR) methodology. Therefore, carp were fed for 8 weeks diets either with or without (PhSe)(2) and exposed to 2 or 10 mu g/L of ATZ for 96 h, euthanized, and their liver, gills, and muscle tissues were removed for biochemical assays. ATZ was able to cause oxidative damage from reactive species production in all tissues of carp, as observed by the increase of lipid peroxidation and protein damage. The activity of some antioxidant enzymes was inhibited in carp exposed to ATZ. However, (PhSe)(2) supplementation was able to prevent this ATZ-induced damage by improving the activities of antioxidant enzymes and through antioxidant competence of (PhSe)(2)per se. Furthermore, IBR was shown to be a useful tool to compare treatments, even at different concentrations, and identify the efficiently antioxidant behavior of the organoselenium compound

AB  - Agricultural runoff containing herbicide is known to have adverse effects on freshwater organisms. Aquatic insects are particularly susceptible, and herbicide runoff has the potential to affect behavior in this group. Here we examine the effects of short-term exposure to the herbicide atrazine on cannibalistic behavior in larvae of the widow skimmer dragonfly (Libellula luctuosa Burmeister, 1839). Large larvae (>12 mm length) were exposed to concentrations of 0, 1, 10, or 100 mu g/L atrazine for 96 h. A smaller (<8 mm) conspecific was then placed with the large larva and the behavior of the large larvae was observed for 30 min. Time until initiation of stalking and time until strike were determined. After the initial 30 min, each pair was checked at 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 h. Time of consumption and amount consumed were determined. The number of larvae that engaged in cannibalistic activity within the initial 30 min observation period was significantly higher for controls compared with all experimental treatments. When stalking, striking, and consumption times were examined together (a measure of overall response time), concentration had a significant effect with the 10 mu g/L group taking significantly longer to cannibalize than the control group. Cannibalism is a particularly important behavior in dragonfly larvae populations, and this study confirms that this interaction is altered by exposure to atrazine, with the potential to affect ecological relationships.

AB  - Monitoring of pesticides based on acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) inhibition in vitro avoids interference of detoxification defenses and bioactivation of some of those compounds in non-target tissues. Moreover, environmental temperature, age and stress are able to affect specific enzyme activities when performing in vivo studies. Few comparative studies have investigated the inter-specific differences in AChE activity in fish. Screening studies allow choosing the suitable species as source of AChE to detect pesticides in a given situation. Brain AChE from the tropical fish: pirarucu (Arapaima gigas). cobia (Rachycentron canadum) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were characterized and their activities were assayed in the presence of pesticides (the organophosphates: dichlorvos, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, temephos, tetraethyl pyrophosphate- TEPP and the carbamates: carbaryl and carbofuran). Inhibition parameters (IC50 and Ki) for each species were found and compared with commercial AChE from electric eel (Electrophorus electricus). Optimal pH and temperature were found to be 8.0 and 35-45 degrees C, respectively. A. gigas AChE retained 81% of the activity after incubation at 50 degrees C for 30 min. The electric eel enzyme was more sensitive to the compounds (mainly carbofuran, IC50 of 5 nM), excepting the one from A. gigas (IC50 of 9 nM) under TEPP inhibition. These results show comparable sensitivity between purified and non-purified enzymes suggesting them as biomarkers for organophosphorus and carbamate detection in routine environmental and food monitoring programs for pesticides.

AB  - Skin is the first barrier of defense on fish, which is crucial to protection against different stressors, including pathogens. Skin samples obtained from dorsal and ventral part of Sparus aurata specimens were incubated with Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (a pathogen for this fish species), with Shewanella putrefaciens Pdp11 (a probiotic bacteria isolated from healthy gilthead seabream skin) or with both bacteria. The gene expression profile of nine cytokines (il1b, tnfa, il6, il7, il8, il15, il18, il10 and tgfb) was studied by qPCR in all the skin samples. The present findings revealed different patterns of cytokine profile in dorsal and ventral skin of gilthead seabream, which could be related to the influence and susceptibility to a possible infection.

AB  - Diuron and its biodegradation metabolites were recently reported to cause alterations in plasma steroid hormone concentrations with subsequent impacts on reproductive development in fish. Since steroid hormone biosynthesis is regulated through neurotransmission of the central nervous system (CNS), studies were conducted to determine whether neurotransmitters that control hormone biosynthesis could be affected after diuron and diuron metabolites treatment. As the same neurotransmitters and steroid hormones regulate behavioral outcomes, aggression was also evaluated in male Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Male tilapias were exposed for 10 days to waterborne diuron and the metabolites 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA), 3,4-dichlorophenyl-N-methylurea (DCPMU), at nominal concentrations of 100 ng L-1. In contrast to Diuron, DCA and DCPMU significantly diminished plasma testosterone concentrations (39.4% and 36.8%, respectively) and reduced dopamine levels in the brain (47.1% and 44.2%, respectively). In addition, concentrations of the stress steroid, cortisol were increased after DCA (71.0%) and DCPMU (57.8-%) exposure. A significant decrease in aggressive behavior was also observed in animals treated with the metabolites DCA (50.9%) and DCPMU (68.8%). These results indicate that biotransformation of diuron to active metabolites alter signaling pathways of the CNS which may impact androgen and the stress response as well as behavior necessary for social dominance, growth, and reproduction.

AB  - Response behavior of specimens of the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) exposed to the Ca2+ signal inducing chemicals was characterized through implementation of two computational methods: the Fourier transform analysis and artificial neural networks. lonomycin, thapsigargin, and their solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide) were topically applied to male German cockroaches, and the movement tracks were continuously observed through the image processing system under semi-natural conditions for 4-5 days. The specimens treated with the chemicals revealed different movement patterns: 1) shaky advancement and entanglement of the movement tracks with the ionomycin treatments; 2) continuous, circular movements with the thapsigargin treatments; and 3) shaky turning movements with the dimethyl sulfoxide treatments. The movement tracks in time domain were further analyzed with the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2-D FFT). The coefficients of the 2-D FFT efficiently revealed characteristics that resided in the two-dimensional data of the movement tracks in the frequency domain. Subsequently the magnitudes of the coefficients were trained by self-organizing map (SOM) through unsupervised learning. Classification of the different movement patterns was possible with the trained network. The combined use of the 2-D FFT and the SOM could be an alternative tool to automatically monitor behavioral changes in specimens exposed to stimulating chemicals.

AB  - Principal component analysis of PCB congeners and organochlorines in herring gull eggs from four of the Great Lakes reveals that, with the exception of Lake Erie, the two colonies within each lake contain distinctive patterns which did not change significantly between 1983 and 1990. Lake Ontario colonies were modelled by high percentages of mirex and photomirex, while high proportions of dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide and oxychlordane grouped the colonies in lakes Huron and Superior. The Middle Is. colony in the western end of Lake Erie showed high relative amounts of the higher chlorinated PCB congeners, due to continuing contamination from the Detroit R., or resuspension of contaminated sediments. PCDD/F patterns in the same colonies were dominated by 1,2,3,6,7,8 HxCDD and 1,2,3,7,8 PeCDD in lakes Erie, Huron and Superior while Lake Ontario patterns were dominated by 2,3,7,8 TCDD. Lake trout and walleye in the same lakes showed high levels of 2,3,7,8 TCDF which does not accumulate in herring gulls. It is concluded that the application of PCA techniques to Great Lakes data sets provides a useful screening procedure which can generate hypotheses on lake loading patterns and species residue differences by grouping samples with similar residue patterns.

AB  - Crossed effects between climate change and chemical pollutions were identified on community structure and ecosystem functioning. Temperature rising affects the toxic properties of pollutants and the sensitiveness of organisms to chemicals stress. Inversely, chemical exposure may decrease the capacity of organisms to respond to environmental changes. The aim of our study was to assess the individual and crossed effects of temperature rising and pesticide contamination on fish. Goldfish, Carassius auratus, were exposed during 96 h at two temperatures (22 and 32 A degrees C) to a mixture of common pesticides (S-metolachlor, isoproturon, linuron, atrazine-desethyl, aclonifen, pendimethalin, and tebuconazol) at two environmentally relevant concentrations (total concentrations MIX1 = 8.4 mu g L-1 and MIX2 = 42 mu g L-1). We investigated the sediment reworking behavior, which has a major ecological functional role. We also focused on three physiological traits from the cellular up to the whole individual level showing metabolic status of fish (protein concentration in liver and muscle, hepatosomatic index, and Fulton's condition factor). Individual thermal stress and low concentrations of pesticides decreased the sediment reworking activity of fish and entrained metabolic compensation with global depletion in energy stores. We found that combined chemical and thermal stresses impaired the capacity of fish to set up an efficient adaptive response. Our results strongly suggest that temperature will make fish more sensitive to water contamination by pesticides, raising concerns about wild fish conservation submitted to global changes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Atrazine and its chloro-s-triazine metabolites are found in surface water and groundwater of the Czech Republic, although their use has been banned since 2005. The objective of the study was to determine the toxic effects of atrazine at an environmentally relevant concentration of atrazine, 0.3 mu g.L-1 and at concentrations of 30, 100, and 300 mu g.L-1 on morphometric and condition characteristics, development of early life stages, and antioxidant defense enzymes of common carp.
   METHODS: The embryo-larval toxicity test was performed according to the OECD Guidelines 210 (Fish, Early-life Stage Toxicity Test).
   RESULTS: Atrazine exposure showed no effect on morphometric and condition characteristics or histology. Exposure at 0.3 mu g.L-1 was associated with significantly increased activity of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase compared to control. Activity of glutathione reductase was slightly higher at a concentration of 0.3 mu g.L-1, with significantly lower (p<0.05) activity observed in groups exposed to 30, 100, and 300 mu g.L-1 compared to the group exposed to 0.3 mu g.L-1. The level of oxidized lipids was slightly higher in groups exposed to atrazine at 100 and 300 mu g.L-1 compared to controls.
   CONCLUSIONS: Atrazine has a significant influence on the biotransformation enzyme and oxidative defense enzymes of early life stages of common carp. The lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) was 0.3 mu g.L-1.

AB  - Historical data are provided to support the hypothesis that organochlorine chemicals introduced into the Great Lakes ecosystem following World War II are the cause of reproductive loss among bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in the basin. This is supported with data on concurrent population fluxes of extrabasin North American bald eagle populations and the European white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicillus) where the same chemicals were produced and released. Organochlorine chemicals appear as a unique stress on Great Lakes bald eagle populations when compared with stresses on successful populations of bald eagles continentwide. Shoreline birds bear significantly higher concentrations of these persistent toxics than inland birds. Association between contaminated prey and elevated concentrations of PCBs, DDT, and DDE in Great Lakes bald eagles are presented. A fledging ratio is used to support the hypothesis that maternal prezygotic exposure affects the viability of embryos and chicks. The ratio of the mean number of fledglings per successful territory to the mean number of fledglings per active territory, when the numerator is greater than 1.4, provides an index of exposure to contaminants by parental animals and affected offspring. When the ratio is greater than 2, parental exposure to organochlorine chemicals should be considered. The adverse effects of prezygotic exposure to the same contaminants in other animal species dependent upon Great Lakes fish, and extrabsin bald eagle populations dependent upon contaminated fish, provide consistency to the argument. The mechanism of action of the organochlorine chemicals further strengthens the causal argument indicting DDT, DDE, and PCBs. A strong association between DDT/DDE and bald eagle reproductive success is provided. However, the role of PCBs is not ruled out. Only data for total PCB concentrations in bald eagle tissue are available, and until specific PCB congeners are quantified there will be uncertainty concerning PCB's role in the Great Lakes bald eagle's lack of success.

AB  - Our earlier studies showed the inhibitory effects of cadmium (Cd) and paraquat (PQ) on the gene expression of DNA mismatch recognition proteins in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. This study explored the effects of Cd and PQ on nucleotide excision repair (NER) capacity in zebrafish embryos. Exposure of embryos at 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to 3-5 mu M Cd or 30-100 mu M PQ for 9 h induced a 2-3-fold increase of oxidative stress, while a 6.5-fold increase of oxidative stress was induced by 200 mu M PQ Real-time RT-PCR detected a down-regulated xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) and an up-regulated UV-DDB2 gene expression in mildly-stressed embryos, whereas 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) gene expression increased with PQ exposure levels. NER of UV-damaged DNA was enhanced in weakly oxidant-stressed embryos as shown by a transcription-based DNA repair assay, yet repair activities of both UV and cisplatin-damaged DNA were inhibited in embryos exposed to 200 mu M PQ. Band shift assay showed a suppression of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) binding activity in all stressed embryos. In contrast, (6-4) photoproduct (6-4PP) recognition activity was weakly stimulated except in embryos exposed to 200 AM PQ revealing a link of NER capacity to 6-4PP binding. Our results showed that Cd and PQ imposed similar inducing effects on UV-DDB2 gene expression, NER of UV-damaged DNA and 6-4PP binding activity in zebrafish embryo under low levels of oxidative stress and NER capacity could be inhibited if the intensity of oxidative stress increased to a critical level.

AB  - Over the course of an approximately 11-month period, an outdoor, freshwater, mixed species, recirculating, display system at a public aquarium experienced intermittent mortalities of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and blue catfish (I. furcatus). Catfish acutely presented for abnormal buoyancy, coelomic distention, and protein-rich coelomic effusion. Gross lesions typically involved massive coelomic distension with protein-rich effusion, generalized edema, and gastric hemorrhage and edema. Microscopically, primary lesions included renal tubular necrosis, gastric edema with mucosal hemorrhages, and generalized edema. Aerobic culture and virus isolation could not recover a consistent infectious agent. Intracoelomic injection of coelomic effusion and aspirated retrobulbar fluid from a catfish into naive zebrafish (bioassay) produced peracute mortality in 3 of 4 fish and nervous signs in the fourth compared with 2 saline-injected control zebrafish that had - no mortality or clinical signs. Kidney tissue and coelomic effusion were submitted for gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry by multiple reaction monitoring against laboratory standards, which detected the presence of multiple pyrethroid toxins, including bioallethrin, bifenthrin, trans-permethrin, phenothrin, and deltamethrin. Detection of multiple pyrethroids presumably reflects multiple exposures with several products. As such, the contributions of each pyrethroid toward clinical presentation, lesion development, and disease pathogenesis cannot be determined, but they are suspected to have collectively resulted in disrupted osmoregulation and fluid overload due to renal injury. Pesticide-induced toxicoses involving aquarium fish are rarely reported with this being the first description of pyrethroid-induced lesions and mortality in public aquarium-held fish.

AB  - Glyphosate (GLY) frequently detected in various water bodies has imposed a serious risk on fish. Head kidney of fish is an important defense organ, playing a vital part in antagonizing exogenous hazardous matter. The objective of this study was to characterize toxic mechanisms of GLY in head kidney of common carp based on transcriptome profiling. After 45-days exposure of GLY at environmentally relevant concentrations, juvenile common carp were used as experimental subjects to analyze how the head kidney responded to GLY. The transcriptome profiling identified 1381 different expressed genes (DEGs) between the control and exposure groups (5 and 50 mg/L). Functional analysis of DEGs substantiated over-representative pathways mainly involving cellular stress responses, cell proliferation and turnover, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and innate immune processes in both treated groups compared with the control group. Predicted network of gene regulation indicated that GLY-induced tp53 played a vital role in linking a battery of signals. Furthermore, the expression of 10 candidate genes by qRT-PCR aligned with transcriptional profiling. In addition, western blotting analysis confirmed that GLY-induced apoptosis and cellular proliferation were closely involved in activating MAKP signaling pathway and lipid metabolism pathway in both treated groups. Collectively, these data demonstrate that head kidney of juvenile common carp mainly leverages upregulation of genes related to cell proliferation and turnover, apoptosis, and lipid metabolism to combat sub-chronic exposure of GLY. This study casts new understanding into the risk of GLY in aquatic animals.

AB  - Revealing biological responses of organisms in responding to environmental stressors is the critical issue in contemporary ecological sciences. Markov processes in behavioral data were unraveled by utilizing the hidden Markov model (HMM). Individual organisms of daphnia (Daphnia magna) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to diazinon at low concentrations. The transition probability matrix (TPM) and the emission probability matrix (EPM) were accordingly estimated by training with the HMM and were verified before and after the treatments with 10(-6) tolerance in 10(3) iterations. Structured property in behavioral changes was accordingly revealed to characterize dynamic processes in movement patterns. Parameters and sequences produced through the HMM training could be a suitable means of monitoring toxic chemicals in environment.

AB  - Roundup (TM) is a commonly used pesticide applied to agriculture and forest habitats. These areas are generally ideal for amphibians due to the presence of small, ephemeral water bodies. While Roundup (TM) has been shown to have lethal effects on many species of amphibians, effects on behaviour and sensory perception have yet to be considered. Here, we exposed wood frog tadpoles to a sub-lethal concentration of Roundup (TM) and showed that the ability of tadpoles to respond to injured conspecific cues, an important source of information regarding local predation risk, was impaired. Subsequent experiments revealed that impaired responses likely result from a chemical reaction between the Roundup (TM) and the cues and that tadpoles chronically exposed to Roundup (TM) had reduced basal movement rates compared with unexposed tadpoles. Our data demonstrate that environmentally-relevant concentrations of RoundupTm can drastically alter movement and anti-predator responses of tadpoles, with potential negative consequences for the population.

AB  - Pesticides applied to paddy fields may pose considerable danger to non-target aquatic organisms and further threaten human health. Flufiprole is a pesticide used in rice fields; considering the widespread existence of rice-fish-farming ecosystems, the acute toxicities of flufiprole enantiomers and its six metabolites (fipronil, flufiprole sulfide, flufiprole sulfone, detrifluoromethylsulfinyl flufiprole, desulfinyl flufiprole, and flufiprole amide) to four common aquatic organisms in rice fields including Misgurnus anguillicaudatus (pond loach), Carassius gibelio (Prussian carp), Pelophylax nigromaculatus (black-spotted frog), and Daphnia magna (water flea) were investigated. Genotoxicity, pathological changes and the effects on the antioxidant system of M. anguillicaudatus were also evaluated after exposure. The LC50 (EC50) values showed that fipronil and desulfinyl flufiprole were the most toxic compounds and were approximately about six times as toxic as flufiprole. No enantioselective toxicity was observed between the two enantiomers. The activity of antioxidant defense enzymes and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver and gills of M. anguillicaudatus were significantly increased by the chemicals in most cases. In addition, fipronil and desulfinyl flufiprole were found to induce an increase in the micronucleus rate in M. anguillicaudatus. Histopathological analysis showed that the liver of M. anguillicaudatus was not significantly affected by flufiprole. Our study demonstrated a potential negative effect on flufiprole-treated aquatic organisms. As an alternative to fipronil, the environmental risk of flufiprole and its metabolites to non-target organisms in rice fields cannot be ignored. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Imidacloprid, a widely used neonicotinoid insecticide, poses a significant threat to aquatic ecosystems. Behavior is a functional indicator of the net sensory, motor, and integrative processes of the nervous system and is presumed to be more sensitive in detecting toxicity. In the present study, we investigated the behavioral effects of imidacloprid at the level of environmental concentrations (1, 10 and 100 mu g/L) for a constant exposure to zebrafish adults, and performed the integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis to analyze the molecular mechanism underlying behavioral effects of imidacloprid. Our results show that imidacloprid exposure significantly induce behavioral disruptions characterized by anxiety, depression, and reduced physiological function including exploratory, decision, social interaction and locomotor activity. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis indicate that the disruption of circadian rhythm, metabolic imbalance of arginine and proline, and neurotransmitter disorder are the underlying molecular mechanisms of behavioral impairment induced by imidacloprid. The "gene-metabolite-disease " network consisted by 11 metabolites and 15 genes is associated human disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. Our results confirm the behavioral impairment induced by imidacloprid at environmental concentrations for constant exposure. The identified genes and metabolites can be used not only to illustrate the underlying mechanisms, but also can be developed as biomarkers in determining the ecological risk of imidacloprid to aquatic organisms even Homo sapiens.

AB  - In this study, to assess the immunotoxicity of deltamethrin on fish, adult Chinese rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) were exposed to 0.1,0.3, and 1 mu g/L deltamethrin for 28 d. Many immunological parameters and histopathological alterations were determined. The results showed that lymphocyte number was markedly decreased at 0.3 and 1 mu g/L treatments, whereas the neutrophil number was strongly increased at 1 mu g/L treatments (p < 0.05). Furthermore, lysozyme (LYS), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and complement component 3 (C3) levels at 0.3 and 1 mu g/L treatments were markedly reduced, whereas alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were marked increased at 1 mu g/L treatments (p < 0.05). The transcripts of almost all TLR (Toll-like receptor) signaling pathwayrelated genes were up-regulated. Histological lesions in the livers, intestines, and gills were observed at all treatments. Then, all remaining fish from controls and deltamethrin-exposed groups were injected with Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens) for 48 h. At 24 and 48 h post-injection with P. fluorescens (hpi), the lymphocyte numbers were strongly reduced at 0.3 and 1 mu g/L deltamethrin-exposed groups, whereas LYS and C3 levels were strongly reduced at 0.3 and 1 mu g/L deltamethrin-exposed groups (p < 0.05). Obvious reduces in 1gM levels were also detected at 0.3 and 1 mu g/Ldeltamethrin-exposed groups at 48 hpi (p <- 0.05). The transcripts of almost all TLR signaling pathway-related genes were significantly down-regulated, whereas the levels of related microRNAs (miRNAs) were markedly increased at all deltamethrin-exposed groups at 24 and 48 hpi. Moreover, the bacterial load in the liver and the mortality of fish were significantly increased at 1 mu g/Ldeltamethrin-exposed groups at 24 and 48 hpi (p < 0.05). Furthermore, obvious histological damage in the livers, intestines, and gills were observed at all deltamethrin-exposed fish at 48 hpi. Overall, our results demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentration deltamethrin suppressed immunity and rendered the fish vulnerable to P. fluorescens infection, subsequently inducing mortality.

AB  - The immunosuppressive effects of pollutants from industry (effluents, heavy metals) and agriculture (pesticides) on freshwater fish, as a sentinel model for the aquatic environment, are presented in this paper. An impairment of humoral, cellular and/or non-specific immunity compromises the defence mechanisms against pathogens. For ten years, we studied the effects on rainbow trout and carp of pesticides such as organochlorine (lindane) and organophosphorous (trichlorfon, dichlorvos) insecticides, and a triazine herbicide (atrazine); heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Mg, Mn, Hg) were also analysed for their in vitro effects. More recently, pulp mill effluents were studied on rainbow trout immunity. Most of those aquatic pollutants were shown to be partial or total immunosuppressors of the major functions of some freshwater fish immune system.

AB  - To document the levels and the determinants of dichloro-dyphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) metabolites in maternal milk, we conducted a cohort study of 50 adult females who lived in Mexico City. We measured social and dietary characteristics via interview. Levels of DDT metabolites were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The mean values (lipid milk basis) were 0.162 ppm p,p'-DDT; 0.138 ppm o,p'-DDT; and 0.594 ppm 2,2(6is)p-chlorophyenyl-1-1-dichloroethylene (DDE). The main determinants of DDT metabolites were maternal age, lifetime lactation, history of living in an agricultural area, and consumption of salted meat and fish. We estimated that 6.0% of the breast-fed babies had daily intakes of DDT above the level of 0.005 mg/kg . d recommended by the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (WHO/FAO). Health-outcomes research among children is needed, and investigators should design or adjust current surveillance programs.

AB  - Background: Neonicotinoid insecticides are becoming more widely applied as organophosphate (OP) insecticides are decreasing in use. Because of their relative specificity to insect nicotinic receptors, they are thought to have reduced risk of neurotoxicity in vertebrates. However, there is scant published literature concerning the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure of vertebrates to neonicotinoids.
   Methods: Using zebrafish, we investigated the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure to imidacloprid, a prototypic neonicotinoid pesticide. Nicotine was also administered for comparison. Zebrafish were exposed via immersion in aqueous solutions containing 45 mu M or 60 mu M of imidacloprid or nicotine (or vehicle control) from 4 h to 5 d post fertilization. The functional effects of developmental exposure to both imidadoprid and nicotine were assessed in larvae using an activity assay and-during adolescence and adulthood using a battery of neurobehavioral assays, including assessment of sensorimotor response and habituation in a tactile startle test, novel tank swimming, and shoaling behavior.
   Results: In larvae, developmental imidadoprid exposure at both doses significantly decreased swimming activity. The 5D strains of zebrafish were more sensitive to both nicotine and imidadoprid than the AB* strain. In adolescent and adult fish, developmental exposure to imidacloprid significantly decreased novel tank exploration and increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli. While nicotine did not affect novel tank swimming, it increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli at the low dose. No effects of either compound were found on shoaling behavior or habituation to a startling stimulus.
   Discussion: Early developmental exposure to imidacloprid has both early-life and persisting effects on neurobehavioral function in zebrafish. Its developmental neurotoxicity should be further investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - Pesticide use and ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation have both been suggested to adversely affect amphibians; however, little is known about their interactive effects. One potential adverse interaction could involve pesticide-induced dysregulation of DNA repair pathways, resulting in greater numbers of DNA photoadducts from UVB exposure. In the present study, we investigated the interactive effects of UVB radiation and two common pesticides (endosulfan and alpha-cypermethrin) on induction of DNA photo-adducts and expression of DNA damage and repair related genes in African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) embryos. We examined 13 genes that are, collectively, involved in stress defense, cell cycle arrest, nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair, mismatch repair, DNA repair regulation, and apoptosis. We exposed X. laevis embryos to 0, 25, and 50 mu g/L endosulfan or 0, 2.5, and 5.0 mu g/L alpha-cypermethrin for 96 h, with environmentally relevant exposures of UVB radiation during the last 7 h of the 96 h exposure. We measured the amount of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and mRNA abundance of the 13 genes among treatments including control, pesticide only, UVB only, and UVB and pesticide co-exposures. Each of the co-exposure scenarios resulted in elevated CPD levels compared to UVB exposure alone, suggesting an inhibitory effect of endosulfan and alpha-cypermethrin on CPD repair. This is attributed to results indicating that alpha-cypermethrin and endosulfan reduced mRNA abundance of XPA and HR23B, respectively, to levels that may affect the initial recognition of DNA lesions. In contrast, both pesticides increased transcript abundance of CSA and MUTL. In addition, mRNA abundance of HSP70 and GADD45 alpha were increased by endosulfan and mRNA abundance of XPG was increased by alpha-cypermethrin. XPC, HR23B, XPG, and GADD45 alpha exhibited elevated mRNA concentrations whereas there was a reduction in MUTL transcript concentrations in UVB-alone treatments. It appeared that even though expression of XPC and CSA were induced by exposure to UVB or pesticides, XPA was the limiting factor in the NER pathway. Our results suggest that pesticides may increase the accumulation of UVB-induced DNA photo-adducts and one likely mechanism is the alteration of critical NER gene expression. The present study provides important implications for evaluating the combined risks of pesticide usage and potentially increasing UVB radiation in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study examined the effects of environmentally realistic exposure to atrazine (ATZ) on the behavior of sailfin mollies, Poecilia latipinna. ATZ is one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and a known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). The behavior of sailfin mollies is well documented in the scientific literature. Moreover, they are ecologically important indicators of environmental health, widely distributed among the mangroves along the Gulf Coast of the Southeastern US where significant amounts of ATZ are introduced via runoff and storm water drainage from coastal households, businesses, and farms. Four sets of experiments designed to assess ATZ's impact on various aspects of male and female reproductive behavior, aggression, anxiety, and boldness were conducted following 12 weeks of exposure to 1 or 15 ppb water-borne ATZ, along with a no-exposure control group. Results indicated that the behavior of ATZ-exposed individuals differed from those of controls: ATZ exposure affected which stimulus fish (a male vs. a female) subject females preferred to associate with while also affecting female strength of preference for males of larger body size and their sexual receptivity to conspecific males in general. ATZ-exposed males also showed reduced overall responsiveness to conspecific stimuli and directed significantly less aggression toward their mirror image compared with controls. Finally, ATZ exposure affected multiple aspects of male and female behavior that are often used as proxies for boldness and anxiety. Overall, ATZ exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behaviors attributed to sexual receptivity, mate choice and motivation to mate, aggression, as well as boldness and anxiety. These ATZ-induced behavioral changes may adversely affect the long-term health of natural populations exposed to similar, environmentally realistic concentrations and add to a growing body of empirical data demonstrating substantial fitness consequences of exposure to sublethal concentrations of this known EDC.

TI  - The pesticide dieldrin disrupts proteins related to oxidative respiration and mitochondrial stress in the central nervous system
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
LA  - English
AB  - Quantitative proteins analysis was carried out in the hypothalamus of zebrafish following dietary exposure to the legacy pesticide dieldrin. Data were collected using iTRAQ labeling methodology and data were acquired using a hybrid quadrupole Orbitrap (Q Exactive) MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). There were 3941 proteins identified in the hypothalamus of zebrafish, and these proteins comprised 23 unique expression patterns for proteins based on the three doses of dieldrin. There were 226 proteins that were regulated in one or more doses of dieldrin and 3715 proteins that were not affected. Thus, 5.7% of the proteins detected responded to the treatment. Many proteins that were differentially expressed were those found in, or associated with, the mitochondria. The proteomics data described in this article is associated with a research article, "Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis implicates the immune system and mitochondria as molecular targets of dieldrin in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) central nervous system" (A.M. Cowie, K.I. Sarty, A. Mercer, J. Koh, K.A. Kidd, C.J. Martyniuk, submitted) [1], and serves as a resource for researchers working in the Reid of pesticide exposures and protein biomarkers.

AB  - Amphibians are very sensitive to environmental change and pollution because they have both aquatic and terrestrial life cycle stages and high skin permeability. Particularly during the larval stages, when these animals are restricted to small, transient ponds, exposure to high concentrations of pesticides is inevitable in agricultural areas. Given that pesticide application increases during the summer, which coincides with the reproductive season and the occurrence of most neotropical tadpoles in their natural environment, strong indications exist that tadpoles are developing in contaminated ponds. Fipronil is one of the primary insecticides used in sugarcane cultivation in Brazil, and little is known about its toxic effects on non-target organisms such as tadpoles. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fipronil and its metabolites on oxidative stress in Eupemphix nattereri tadpoles after exposure in water and sediment at concentrations of 35, 120 and 180 mu g kg(-1). We assessed the activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione S-transferase (GST), glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and catalase (CAT) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA). The results showed that fipronil has an inherent capacity to cause oxidative stress in tadpoles, as evidenced by a decrease in CAT activity and an increase in lipid peroxidation levels at all concentrations tested. Fipronil sulfone also produced elevated MDA levels at two of the tested concentrations and increased G6PDH activity in tadpoles exposed to the highest concentration of this metabolite but did not affect MDA levels. Our data showed that fipronil and its degradation products promoted oxidative stress in Eupemphix nattereri tadpoles exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations and could lead to a decrease in the long-term physiological performance of these animals, leading to detrimental effects at the population level.

AB  - The herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and the insecticide fipronil have been used widely in agriculture and detected in aquatic ecosystems, where they threaten wildlife. This study evaluated the whole body bioconcentration and the biochemical and morphological changes in the gills of the neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus exposed for 96 h to 2,4-D or fipronil as single compounds or as a mixture (2,4-D + fipronil). Fish exposed to either compound alone bioconcentrated 2,4-D (77 +/- 23 ng g(-1) fish dry mass) and fipronil (789 +/- 178 ng g(-1) fish dry mass). Fish exposed to 2,4-D + fipronil bioconcentrated fipronil (683 +/- 73 ng g(-1) fish dry mass) but not 2,4-D. In the gills, catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities and the lipid peroxidation (LPO) level increased after exposure to 2,4-D. GST activity increased after exposure to fipronil. Conversely, no changes occurred in CAT and GST activities and LPO upon exposure to 2,4-D + fipronil. Histopathological changes such as hyperplasia, cellular hypertrophy, epithelial lifting, and vascular congestion were frequent in the gills of fish exposed to 2,4-D or fipronil individually or 2,4-D + fipronil. The mitochondria-rich cell (MRC) density increased on gill surface in fish exposed to fipronil or 2,4-D + fipronil. Only exposure to 2,4-D alone induced oxidative stress in the gills. Most morphological changes showed defense responses against the pesticides; however, hypertrophy and the change in MRC indicated compensatory responses to maintain the gill osmoregulatory function. The 2,4-D + fipronil mixture showed antagonistic interaction, except for the MRC fractional area at gill surface, which showed synergistic interaction. This is the first report showing antagonistic interaction of 2,4-D and fipronil in the gills after exposing fish to the mixture of both pesticides. The biochemical and morphological changes in gills endanger the gill functions, a phenomenon that implies an energy cost for fish.

AB  - The variations of haematological parameters hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, leukocyte and erythrocyte count have been used as pollution and physiological indicators of organic dysfunction in both environmental and aquaculture studies. These parameters are commonly applied as prognostic and diagnostic tools in fish health status. However, there are both extrinsic and intrinsic factors to consider when performing a blood test, because a major limitation for field researchers is that the "rules" for animal or human haematology do not always apply to wildlife. The main objective of this review is to show how some environmental and xenobiotic factors are capable to modulating the haematic cells. Visualizing the strengths and limitations of a haematological analysis in the health assessment of wild and culture fish. Finally, we point out the importance of the use of mitochondrial activities as part of haematological evaluations associated to environment or aquaculture stress. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainable aquaculture arises as key to increase food production in the coming years. However, the sector still faces many challenges such as the exposure of the cultured animals to pesticide-contaminated water. Pesticides used in agriculture can reach aquaculture systems either directly (integrated-agriculture aquaculture practices) or indirectly (soil leakage) and cause a broad range of ecotoxicological effects on cultured fish and shellfish. Here, we studied how glyphosate affects several haematological, biochemical, and immune parameters in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) fingerlings, the fourth most important cultured fish species worldwide. We also evaluated the potential of dietary supplementation with black seed (Nigella sativa, 0.25, 0.5 and 1%) to lower glyphosate-associated toxicity. Our results showed that 14-day sub-lethal exposure of common carp fingerlings to glyphosate increases oxidative stress, decreases antioxidant defences, affects several metabolic pathways, and induced immune depression. Furthermore, we showed that fish fed with N. sativa-enriched diets at 0.25, 0.5 and 1% for 60 days coped better with glyphosate exposure than control fish and displayed more stable levels of biochemical serum parameters (total protein, albumin, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein LDL), cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein HDL), higher levels of immune defences (lysozyme and immunoglobulin) and higher antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase SOD, glutathione peroxidase GPx) than control fish. Fish fed with all enriched diets also displayed lower lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde MDA), lower metabolic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase ALT, aspartate aminotransferase AST and alkaline phosphatase ALP) levels in blood serum and lower cortisol levels than control fish. Altogether, our results show that dietary inclusion of black seed can be used as a sustainable bio-remediation strategy, mitigating many of the negative effects of glyphosate exposure in fish.

AB  - In this study zebrafish specimens were exposed for 15 days to 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mu g L-1 non-lethal concentrations of deltamethrin (DM) knowing that is the active compound in insecticides used on agricultural crops. They were investigated important issues resulted during the chronic exposure with DM: effects on aggressive behavior and swimming performances knowing that is a high neurotoxic compound; toxicity on nervous system investigated on telencephalon, optic tectum and cerebellum; activity of PCNA, p53 and TUNEL as toxicity markers in immunocytochemistry of the histological samples; changes of elements concentrations in the fish body and their role in detoxification of DM. This scenario investigated the harmful effects of this compound for freshwater fish communities. The aggressive behavior significantly increased and remained constant for the concentration 0.5 mu g L-1. They were not evidences in changing of anxiety level and swimming performances. The nervous system suffered significant damage for all studied concentrations and confirmed the changes in the behavior. Selenium concentration in the body decreased and may be involved in the detoxification processes.

AB  - As a cycloaliphatic brominated flame retardant, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) has been widely used in building thermal insulation and fireproof materials. However, there is little information on the bioconcentration as well as effects with respect to HBCD exposure in the aquatic environment. To investigate the bioconcentration of HBCD in tissues (muscle and liver) and its biochemical and behavioural effects, juvenile crucian carp (Carassius auratus) were exposed to different concentrations of technical HBCD (nominal concentrations, 2, 20, 200 mu g/L) for 7 days, using a flow-through exposure system. HBCD was found to concentrate in the liver and muscle with a terminal concentration of 0.60 +/- 0.22 mu g/g lw (lipid weight) and 0.18 +/- 0.02 mu g/g lw, respectively, at an environmentally-relevant concentration (2 mu g/L). The total thyroxine and total triiodothyronine in the fish plasma were lowered as a result of exposure to the HBCD. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain was increased, while swimming activity was inhibited and shoaling inclination was enhanced after exposure to 200 mu g/L HBCD. Feeding rate was suppressed in the 20 and 200 mu g/L treatment groups. In summary, HBCD concentrations 10-100x higher than the current environmentally-relevant exposures induced adverse effects in the fish species tested in this study. These results suggest that increasing environmental concentrations and/or species with higher sensitivity than carp might be adversely affected by HBCD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate effects of the insecticide Decis Mega (DM; active substance deltamethrin 50 g.L-1) on common carp on the basis of haematological profile, oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes and histopathology.
   DESIGN: Fish were exposed two concentrations of DM 6.56 mu g.L-1 (1DM) and 65.6 mu g.L-1 (2DM) for 96 h. Then the remaining fish were transferred into DM-free water for depuration for another period of 96 h.
   RESULTS: Exposure to 1DM and 2DM proved effect on enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and on oxidative damage of cells in gills, liver and kidney (p<0.05, p<0.01). Exposure to 1DM showed differences (p<0.05, p<0.01) in hematocrit and hemoglobin in blood. Histopathological changes were observed after acute exposure to DM as well as to DM-free water in gills, liver and kidney.
   CONCLUSION: This study concludes that deltamethrin has influence on the haematological parameters, activity of antioxidant enzymes and caused oxidative damage, and histopathological changes in the fish. However, antioxidant balance in the body was restored after placing the fish in clean water for 4 days, however, this time was not sufficient complete regeneration.

AB  - The insecticide fipronil, one of the main pesticides used in Brazil, is often detected in natural aquatic environments, and causes neuronal hyperexcitation by inhibiting GABAergic neurotransmission, leading to putative alterations in behaviour and development. This work sought to analyse the toxicity of formulated Regent(R) 800WG (80% fipronil) on development (fish embryo toxicity test, FET), morphology, and swimming behaviour of larvae and adults of zebrafish (Danio rerio). FET was performed following OECD236 guidelines at concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 1600 mu g.L-1 of formulated Regent(R) 800WG. Adults were exposed to 0.2, 2 and 20 mu g.L-1 of the product for 24 and 96 h, and were submitted to the light-dark, novel tank and swimming endurance tests No lethal parameters were observed in larvae, but in concentrations above 400 mu g.L-1, there was shortening of the body axis and decreased swimming behavior. In adults, exposure to the pesticide did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a marked decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion, since baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at all conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish adults did not show their natural preference for the dark environment. The pesticide likely has anxiolytic effects on zebrafish, as well as a compromising effect on locomotor control, illustrating that behavioural changes, which could affect activities on the natural environment, such as escape and predation, may occur even in environmentally relevant concentrations of this pollutant.

AB  - There is growing interest in the ecological consequences of fear, as evidenced by the numerous studies on the nonconsumptive, trait-mediated effects of predators. Parasitism, however, has yet to be fully integrated into research on the ecology of fear, despite it having direct negative and often lethal effects on hosts and being the most common life history strategy on the planet. This might at least be partly due to the traditional, but untested, assumption that anti-parasite responses are weak relative to anti-predator responses. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the activity and location responses of Bufo americanus tadpoles to one of six chemical cues: water; cercariae of Echinostoma trivolvis, a trematode which infects and can kill amphibians; a snail releasing E. trivolvis cercariae; an uninfected snail; food; or conspecific alarm chemicals signaling predation. There is also literature encouraging research on the context dependency and pollution-induced disruption of fear responses. Consequently, before quantifying responses to the chemical cues, half of the B. americanus were exposed to the herbicide atrazine (201 mu g/l for 4 days), a reported inhibitor of fear responses in fish. Tadpoles were attracted to food, were indifferent to an uninfected snail, avoided alarm chemicals, and exhibited avoidance and elevated activity in response to a snail shedding cercariae and cercariae alone. Atrazine had no detectable effects on B. americanus' responses to the tested cues despite the use of a higher concentration and longer exposure duration than has been repeatedly shown to inhibit chemical cue detection in fish. The magnitude of anti-parasite and anti-predator responses were qualitatively similar, suggesting that the fear of disease and its ecological consequences could be comparable to that of predation. Consequently, we call for a greater integration of parasites into research on the ecology of fear and trait-mediated indirect effects.

AB  - The imidacloprid-based insecticides (IBIs) are among the most used insecticides worldwide, and chronic and acute toxic effects (days exposure protocols) have been reported in several species in studies of IBIs at lethal concentrations. However, there is little information on shorter time exposures and environmentally relevant concentrations. In this study, we investigated the effect of a 30-min exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of IBI on the behavior, redox status, and cortisol levels of zebrafish. We showed that the IBI decreased fish locomotion and social and aggressive behaviors and induced an anxiolytic-like behavior. Furthermore, IBI increased cortisol levels and protein carbonylation and decreased nitric oxide levels. These changes were mostly observed at 0.013 and 0.0013 mu g center dot L-1 of IBI. In an environmental context, these behavioral and physiological disbalances, which were immediately triggered by IBI, can impair the ability of fish to evade predators and, consequently, affect their survival.

AB  - Aquatic herbicides are commonly used to control excessive and nuisance levels of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV). At times, these applications tend to be more effective at the onset of fish spawning in spring: however, they can cause conflicts between anglers and lake management personnel assigned to control excessive SAV. We evaluated the direct application of an aquatic herbicide (Aquathol K [dipotassium salt of endothall]) on the nest behavior and fidelity of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and measured the subsequent reproductive success of these fish. Endothall was applied to achieve a shoreline concentration of 5 mg/L of water volume in 0.1-ha ponds (3 mg/L whole-pond concentration). It was applied directly on nests in three ponds in March 2005, 2006, and 2007 when largemouth bass initiated spawning; spawning activity was monitored over 14-15 d. Using similar techniques, we applied water to another three ponds where largemouth bass were nesting. For all 3 years, endothall did not affect nest guarding by largemouth bass, and nest fidelity was similar to that for ponds treated with water. Endothall concentrations declined about sevenfold over 21 d but persisted in the water during spawning. Electrofishing of young largemouth bass 2-3 months after spawning showed that their relative abundance and size were similar among the ponds treated with endothall and the control ponds. Similarly, the density and biomass of age-0 largemouth bass did not vary between treatments for fish killed with rotenone in late August each year. Managers can use these results to address angler concerns about endothall application during largemouth bass spawning and thereby lessen conflicts over efforts to control excessive SAV.

AB  - The surfactant polyoxyethylene amine (POEA) is added to several formulations of glyphosate herbicides that are widely used in agriculture and can contaminate aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, an integrated approach examining genotoxic, biochemical and physiological parameters was employed to evaluate acute effects of POEA on the Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. Juvenile fish were exposed to 0.15 mg.L-1 (POEA 1), 0.75 mg.L-1 (POEA 2) and 1.5 mg.L-1 (POEA 3) of POEA or only water (CTR), and after 24 h exposure samples of blood and liver were taken. Compared with CTR, liver of fish exposed to POEA 2 and POEA 3 showed increased activity of 7 ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and increased content of glutathione, whereas the activity of glutathione-S-transferase was diminished. On the other hand, fish of the group POEA 1 showed an increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase and in the occurrence of lipid peroxidation. Fish exposed to POEA 3 presented increased hepatic activity of glutathione peroxidase and reduced plasma cortisol. The exposure to POEA at all concentrations tested caused an increase in plasma lactate and a decrease in the hepatic activity of catalase, in the number of red blood cells and in hemoglobin content The comet assay used for analyzing DNA damage in blood cells indicated the genotoxicity of the surfactant at all concentrations tested. Taken together these results show that POEA can cause effects at various levels, such as hemolysis, DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, which are directly related to an imbalance in the redox state of the fish.

AB  - Selfish genetic elements (SGEs) such as replicating mobile elements, segregation distorters and maternally inherited endosymbionts, bias their transmission success relative to the rest of the genome to increase in representation in subsequent generations. As such, they generate conflict with the rest of the genome. Such intragenomic conflict is also a hallmark of sexually antagonistic (SA) alleles, which are shared genes between the sexes but that have opposing fitness effects when expressed in males and females. However, whilst both SGEs and SA alleles are recognized as common and potent sources of genomic conflict, the realization that SGEs can also generate sexually antagonistic selection and contribute to sexual conflict in addition to generate sexual selection is largely overlooked. Here, I show that SGEs frequently generate sex-specific selection and outline how SGEs that are associated with compromised male fertility can shape female mating patterns, play a key role in the dynamics of sex-determination systems and likely be an important source of sexually antagonistic genetic variation. Given the prevalence of SGEs, their contribution to sexual conflict is likely to be greatly overlooked.

AB  - Roundup Transorb (R) (RDT) is a glyphosate-based herbicide containing a mixture of surfactants. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of this herbicide on the Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. Juvenile fish were acutely exposed (6, 24 and 96 h) to 1 mg L-1 of RDT (RDT 1), 5 mg L-1 of RDT (RDT 5) or only water (control) and blood samples for hematological analysis, liver for antioxidants analysis, and brain and muscle for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) determination, were collected. RDT effects were more evident in fish exposed to the higher concentration of the herbicide. Hematologic alterations appeared only after 96 h exposure, when fish showed an increase in the hematocrit and in the number of both red and white blood cells. After 6 h exposure fish showed a transient reduction in superoxide dismutase and catalase activity. ROT also inhibited glutathione-S-transferase, after 6 and 24 h of exposure. The reduction in these enzymes is probably related to the occurrence of lipid peroxidation (LPO) in fish exposed to the herbicide for 6 h. LPO returned to control levels after 24 and 96 h exposure to RDT, when fish showed an increased activity of glutathione peroxidase. The content of reduced glutathione also increased after 96 h exposure. Thus, after 24 and 96 h the antioxidant defenses were apparently enough to combat ROS, preventing the occurrence of oxidative damage. The exposure to RDT for 96 h led to an inhibition of AChE in brain and muscle at rates which may not be considered a life-threatening situation. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and AimsPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly used in health services. Paper forms are still often used to register such data. Manual double data entry (DDE) has been defined as the gold standard for transferring data to an electronic format but is laborious and costly. Automated form processing (AFP) is an alternative, but validation in a clinical context is warranted. The study objective was to examine and validate a local hospital AFP setup.
   MethodsPatients over 18years of age who were scheduled for knee or hip replacement at Stavanger University Hospital from 2014 to 2017 who answered PROMs were included in the study and contributed PROM data. All paper PROMs were scanned using the AFP techniques of optical mark recognition (OMR) and intelligent character recognition (ICR) and were processed by DDE by health secretaries using a data entry program. OMR and ICR were used to capture different types of data. The main outcome was the proportion of correctly entered numbers, defined as the same response recorded in AFP and DDE or by consulting the original paper questionnaire at the data field, item, and PROM level.
   ResultsA total of 448 questionnaires from 255 patients were analyzed. There was no statistically significant difference in error proportions per 10000 data fields between OMR and DDE for data from check boxes (3.52 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.17 to 5.72 and 4.18 (95% CI 2.68-6.53), respectively P =.61). The error proportion for ICR (nine errors) was statistically significantly higher than that for DDE (two errors), that is, 3.53 (95% CI 1.87-6.57) vs 0.78 (95% CI 0.22-2.81) per 100 data fields/items/questionnaires; P =.033. OMR (0.04% errors) outperformed ICR (3.51% errors; P <.001), Fisher's exact test.
   ConclusionsOMR can produce an error rate that is comparable to that of DDE. In our setup, ICR is still problematic and is highly dependent on manual validation. When AFP is used, data quality should be tested and documented.

AB  - The effects of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and tributyltin (TBT) association were investigated through a multi-biomarker approach. Ten Rhamdia quelen fish per group were exposed through intraperitoneal injections either to BaP (0.3; 3 or 30 mg kg(-1)), DDT or TBT (0.03; 0.3 or 3 mg kg(-1)) or BaP/DDT, BaP/TBT, DDT/TBT or BaP/DDT/TBT on their lowest doses. The experiments were divided in acute (one dose, 5-day) and sub-chronic (3 doses, 15-day). Control groups received an equal volume of PBS or canola oil (1 ml kg-1). The three tested contaminants altered AChE activity in brain and muscle in similar ways; the mixtures antagonized the increase evoked by the contaminants alone. BaP and TBT increased GSH content and mixtures reduced it. GPx activity was increased by DDT and TBT in the 15-day experiment and reduced by the mixtures. BaP increased GST activity in sub-chronic experiment while TBT reduced it in the acute experiment. BaP/TBT increased GST activity compared to all groups; the other mixtures reduced it compared to BaP or DDT in the 5-day experiment. BaP, DDT and TBT increased delta-ALAd activity mainly in acute exposure; the mixtures also increased delta-ALAd compared to DDT or TBT in 5 and 15-day. BaP, TBT and BaP/DDT decreased LPO in the acute experiment. In the subchronic experiment DDT/TBT increased LPO when compared to TBT. None of the contaminants alone altered PCO, but all mixtures increased it compared to one or another contaminant. Contaminants isolated had a more acute effect in ALT plasma level; their lowest dose, which had no effect alone, in combination has led to an increase of this enzyme, especially after 15 days. DDT increased AST in the acute and sub-chronic experiments, while TBT did the same in the latter. DDT/TBT decreased AST opposing the effect of the contaminants alone in the 5-day experiment. Hepatic lesions index could be explained by a more acute effect of the contaminants alone or combined and by activation of cell defenses after the sub-chronic exposure. TBT increased melanomacrophages counting in the 5-day experiment and the mixtures increased it in the 5 and 15-day experiments. Overall, the majority of the biomarkers pointed to a more toxic effect when these contaminants were combined, leading to unexpected toxicities compared to individual exposure scenarios. These findings are relevant considering environmental exposure conditions, since organisms are often exposed to different combinations of contaminants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The presence of agricultural contaminants has been shown to disrupt olfactory-mediated behaviors in aquatic animals. We assessed the effects of atrazine on the ability of reproductively active (form I), male crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) to identify and respond to conspecific chemical signals involved in mating. Male crayfish were exposed to atrazine (80 ppb) and water (control) for 96 h. We analyzed odor localization and locomotor behaviors of herbicide-treated and control male crayfish to two different odor sources: female odor or water (control) delivered from the proximal end of a test arena. Control crayfish spent more time in the proximal region of the test arena and at the odor source. Atrazine-exposed crayfish showed no preference for the proximal region of the test arena and odor source when female odor was delivered. Atrazine exposure did not affect locomotor behaviors. Overall, atrazine-mediated chemosensory deficits have the potential to disrupt mating and affect population size.

AB  - Atrazine is a herbicide that is banned in Europe but remains widely used on different types of crops in several countries in the American continent. Atrazine is known to be an endocrine disruptor and its effects on gonads have been extensively reported, but the toxic action on other organs is poorly documented. In this paper, we investigated the toxicity of atrazine on the gills and spleens of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The median lethal concentration (LC50), capable of killing one-half of the test animals was calculated, and sublethal concentrations of atrazine were used in a semistatic and subchronic assay. The following four experimental groups were formed: control not exposed to atrazine, a group exposed to 1 ppm atrazine for 15 days, a group exposed to 2 ppm for 7 days, and a group exposed to 2 ppm for 15 days. The concentrations were verified during the study by high performance liquid chromatography. The gills and spleens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and histopathological findings were made. The Perls technique was used on the spleens to identify hemosiderin, lipofuscin, and melanin pigments in the cells from melanomacrophage centres (MMCs). The spleens were submitted to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunohistochemistry, and morphometry was used to assess splenocyte proliferation and melanomacrophage iNOS expression. Finally, a colorimetric assay for caspase-3 was performed on the spleens to identify apoptosis. Vascular and structural alterations, such as venous sinus congestion, aneurysm, hemorrhage, pillar cell hypertrophy, disarrangement of secondary lamellae, and epithelial lifting were observed in the gills. The frequency of individuals with aneurysms was higher in the groups treated with 2 ppm than in other groups. Atrazine had an immunomodulatory effect on the spleen, observed by the alteration in the percentage of red and white pulp, alteration of the MMC area, changes in the melanomacrophage pigment content, slight iNOS suppression, decrease in splenocyte proliferation under 1 ppm atrazine, and increased caspase 3 activity under 2 ppm atrazine after 7 and 15 d. Such effects could compromise oxygenation and the immune response and, ultimately, the survival and fitness of the fish.

AB  - The present communication deals with the effects of fenitrothion (0.02 mg/liter) on the energy metabolism of the European eel, Anguilla anguilla, and its recovery from intoxication. Various parameters such as glycogen, lactate, proteins, and glucose levels were measured in different eel tissues after 2, 8, 12, 24, 32, 48, 56, 72, and 96 hr of fenitrothion exposure. Subsequently, the fish were allowed recovery periods of 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 144, and 192 hr in clean water, and the same parameters were evaluated, Liver glycogen content showed no significant changes during the exposure time, while blood glucose levels increased markedly, Gill, liver, and blood lactate values increased during pesticide exposure, while proteins decreased in comparison to unexposed controls, Most of the metabolic disorders did not persist after eels were allowed to recover in clean water for less than a week, The observed effects of fenitrothion on fish metabolism are discussed in relation to a stress syndrome, as are probable reasons for alterations.

AB  - The hazardous effects of pesticides on various metabolic pathways are a great problem for environmental health and should be well determined. In the present study, the authors treated rainbow trout with 0.6 mu g/L deltamethrin for 28 days and 1.6 mg/L 2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate for 21 days. After this time period, the authors observed alterations in mRNA expression levels of MT-A, MT-B and CYP-1A. Chronic exposure to low levels of pesticides may have a more significant effect on fish populations than acute poisoning. While both pesticides caused a significant increase on mRNA levels of MT-A and CYP-1A, MT-B mRNA levels were increased significantly only upon deltamethin administration. The significant increase in mRNA levels of the corresponding genes may be considered as a defence mechanism in addition to the antioxidants against oxidative stress, as well as a detoxification mechanism against adverse effects of pesticides.

AB  - The behaviour of Aphidius rhopalosiphi DeStefani-Perez (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was recorded in laboratory bioassays in the presence and absence of both residues of honeydew from the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (F.) and the pyrethroid insecticide, deltamethrin. Insecticide concentrations ranged from the held recommended dose rate (6.25 g ai/ha in 200 1 water) to 1/16th of field rate. Parasitoids responded strongly to patches of honeydew on filter papers, however the addition of increasing concentrations of deltamethrin caused increasingly early departure from the honeydew-treated areas. Parasitoids pre-exposed to field concentration residues for between and 20 min showed shorter retention times and abnormal types of behaviour on honeydew-treated patches compared to control wasps. Recovery of 'normal' behaviour patterns occurred over a 12, h period away from the insecticide source. Further laboratory studies examined the foraging of A. rhopalosiphi and one of its associated hyperparasitoids, Dendrocerus carpenteri (Curtis), on mature wheat plants treated with an artificial honeydew solution and deltamethrin. Wasps exposed to deltamethrin residues were observed to spend shorter visit times, to groom more frequently and to rest less frequently than those on insecticide-free plants. Differences were found between the distribution of parasitoids on insecticide-treated and untreated plants, with D. carpenteri showing greater movement down insecticide-treated plants accompanied with an increase in time spent on abaxial leaf surfaces compared to A. rhopalosiphi. The results are discussed in terms of the repellency of deltamethrin and the implications for integrated pest management of differing sub-lethal insecticide effects on primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid behaviour.

AB  - The herbicide atrazine (ATZ) is used worldwide in the control of annual grasses and broad-leaved weeds. The present study evaluated sperm quality parameters in zebrafish Danio rerio after 11-day exposure to nominal ATZ concentrations of 2, 10, and 100 mu g L-1. All ATZ concentrations caused a decrease in motility, mitochondrial functionality, and membrane integrity, as measured using conventional microscopy or fluorescence microscopy with specific probes. The DNA integrity of sperm was not affected. The levels of expression of genes related to spermatogenesis, antioxidant defenses, and DNA repair were also investigated using RT-qPCR. The ATZ caused transcriptional repression of the spermatogenesis-related genes SRD5A2 and CFTR, the antioxidant defense genes SOD2 and GPX4B, and the DNA repair gene XPC. This is the first study to show that environmentally relevant concentrations of ATZ significantly affect the sperm quality in fish, possibly resulting in reduced fertility rates. In addition, we showed that the repression of genes related to spermatogenesis and cellular defense could be part of the mechanisms involved in the ATZ toxicity in the testes of male fish.

AB  - The aim of the current work was to investigate the effects of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and monomethyl mercury (MeHg) on hepatocytes from tropical fish Hypostomus commersoni (cascudo). In order to verify DDT and MeHg impacts on the redox milieu, cells were exposed for 4 days to 50 nM of DDT, 0.25 and 2.5 mu M of MeHg and to a combination of 50 nM of DDT and 0.25 mu M of MeHg. These concentrations were compared with those previously published (Filipak Neto et al., 2008) for the predator fish Hoplias malabaricus (traira). The effects were mostly noticeable on reduced glutathione concentration and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and glutathione S-transferase activity. Catalase activity increased in the group exposed to 2.5 mu M of MeHg and hydrogen peroxide levels decreased in all exposed groups. Also, superoxide anion levels decreased in the groups exposed to 2.5 mu M of MeHg and DDT MeHg group. Cell viability decreased only in the DDT exposed group, demonstrating that the antioxidant defense mechanism of H. commersoni hepatocytes is more efficient than H. malabaricus. These results corroborate the resistance of H. commersoni to polluted areas and support the hypothesis that this species is more resistant to DDT and MeHg than H. malabaricus species.

AB  - The current study estimates the impact of different common herbicides on antioxidant defenses and histological structure of liver and spinal cord of juvenile tilapia. Eighty-four fish were divided into seven groups: group 1 fish acted as controls and the remaining fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of acetochlor, bispyribacsodium, bentazon, bensulfuron-methyl, halosulfuron-methyl, or quinclorac at sublethal concentrations 2.625, 0.800, 36.00, 2.50, 1.275, and 11.250 mg/l, respectively, for 96 h. Antioxidant parameters changed in response to some test herbicides and the greatest effects were caused by exposure to acetochlor and quinelorac for all antioxidant measurements. Prominent histological changes in liver tissue included loss of liver architecture and the appearance of fatty liver cells, necrotic areas, foci of leukocytic infiltration and many apoptotic cells. The most obvious changes in the spinal cord in all treated fish were degradation of myelinated white matter fibers with the emergence of empty spaces, large aggregation of pyknotic neuroglial nuclei, and damaged areas in the dorsal horn of gray matter. Collectively, the harmful effect of tested herbicides on antioxidant capacity and significant alterations in histological structures of liver and spinal cord of Oreochromis niloticus.

AB  - Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide that entered the market to replace organochlorides and organophosphates. Fipronil impairs the regular inhibition of nerve impulses that ultimately result in paralysis and death of insects. Because of its use as a pest control, and due to runoff events, fipronil has been detected in freshwater systems near agricultural areas, and therefore might represent a threat to non-target aquatic organisms. In this study, the toxicity of fipronil to the freshwater midge Chironomus riparius was investigated at biochemical, molecular, and whole organism (e.g. growth, emergence, and behavior) levels.
   At the individual level, chronic (28 days) exposure to fipronil resulted in reduced larval growth and emergence with a lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 0.081 mu g L-1. Adult weight, which is directly linked to the flying performance and fecundity of midges, was also affected (LOEC = 0.040 mu g L-1). Additionally, behavioral changes such as irregular burrowing behavior of C. riparius larvae (EC50 = 0.084 mu g L-1) and impairment of adult flying performance were observed. At a biochemical level, acute (48 h) exposure to fipronil increased cellular oxygen consumption (as indicated by the increase of electron transport system (ETS) activity) and decreased antioxidant and detoxification defenses (as suggested by the decrease in catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities). Exposure to fipronil also caused alterations in the fatty acid profile of C. riparius, since high levels of stearidonic acid (SDA) were observed. A comparison between exposed and non-exposed larvae also revealed alterations in the expression of globins, cytoskeleton and motor proteins, and proteins involved in protein biosynthesis. These alterations may aid in the interpretation of potential mechanisms of action that lead to the effects observed at the organism level.
   Present results show that environmentally relevant concentrations of fipronil are toxic to chironomid populations which call for monitoring of phenylpyrazole insecticides and of their ecological effects in freshwaters. Present results also emphasize the importance of complementing ecotoxicological data with molecular approaches such as proteomics, for a better interpretation of the mode of action of insecticides in aquatic invertebrates.

AB  - Background: The pyrethroid class of insecticides, including deltamethrin, is being used as substitutes for organochlorines and organophosphates in pest-control programs because of their low environmental persistence and toxicity. This study was aimed to investigate the impact of commonly used pesticides (deltamethrin) on the blood and tissue oxidative stress level in catfish (Clarias gariepinus); in addition to the protective effect of alpha-tocopherol on deltamethrin induced oxidative stress.
   Catfish were divided into three groups, 1st control group include 20 fish divided into two tanks each one contain 10 fish, 2nd deltamethrin group, where Fish exposed to deltamethrin in a concentration (0.75 mu g/l) and 3rd Vitamin E group, Fish exposed to deltamethrin and vitamin E at a dose of 12 mu g/l for successive 4 days.
   Serum, liver, kidney and Gills were collected for biochemical assays. Tissue oxidative stress biomarkers malondialdhyde (MDA) and catalase activity in liver, kidney and gills tissues, serum liver enzymes (ALT and AST), serum albumin, total protein, urea and creatinine were analysed.
   Results: Our results showed that 48 h. exposure to 0.75 mu g/l deltamethrin significantly (p < 0.05) increased lipid peroxidation (MDA) in the liver, kidney and gills while catalase activity was significantly decreased in the same tissues. This accompanied by significant increase in serum ALT, AST activity, urea and creatinine and a marked decrease in serum albumin and total proteins.
   Conclusions: It could be concluded that deltamethrin is highly toxic to catfish even in very low concentration (0.75 mu g/l). Moreover the effect of deltamethrin was pronounced in the liver of catfish in comparison with kidneys and gills. Moreover fish antioxidants and oxidative stress could be used as biomarkers for aquatic pollution, thus helping in the diagnosis of pollution. Adminstration of 12 mu g/l alpha-tocopherol restored the quantified tissue and serum parameters, so supplementation of alpha-tocopherol consider an effective way to counter the toxicity of deltamethrin in the catfish.

AB  - In order to evaluate the effects of copper and atrazine on the stress response of the freshwater fish Prochilodus lineatus, juvenile fish were pre-exposed to copper (20 mu g L-1) or atrazine (10 mu g L-1) for 24 h and then submitted to air exposure for 3 min. Simultaneously fish kept in dechlorinated water for 24 h were subjected to air exposure and a non-stress group was not subjected to air stress or any contaminants. Animals were sampled immediately (t0) and after 1, 3 and 6 h of air exposure (t1, t3 and t6 respectively) for the analysis of plasma cortisol, glucose and Na+, hepatic glycogen, branchial Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), number of red blood cells per cubic millimeter of blood (RBC), hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin content (Hb). In fish pre-exposed to copper the stress response was inhibited, and at t1 and t3 both cortisol and glucose remained significantly lower compared to fish subjected to air stress only. in fish pre-exposed to atrazine there was no rise in cortisol, but there was an increase in plasma glucose, RBC, Hct and Hb at t0 and a return of these parameters to basal levels at t1, as they did not differ significantly in relation to non-stressed fish. Animals pre-exposed to either Cu or atrazine showed a significant reduction in NKA activity at t1 and t3, in relation to air stressed fish. These results clearly indicate that copper and atrazine impair cortisol stress response of P. lineatus and that fish subjected to a contaminant-induced stress, either by copper or atrazine, may not be able to respond to any additional stressors.

AB  - Fipronil is a current use pesticide, widely used in many crops, commonly adsorbed to sediments of aquatic environments. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomarker responses and fipronil distribution pattern in different matrixes (fish, sediment and water) after juveniles P. lineatus exposure at two environmental concentrations (5.5 and 82 mu g kg-- 1) of fipronil-spiked sediments. The levels of oxidized proteins (PO), lipid peroxidation (LPO), and enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione content (GSH), antioxidant capacity against peroxyls (ACAP) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were evaluated in liver, gills and brain. Concentrations of fipronil and its metabolites (f. desulfinyl, f sulphpHide and f. sulfone) were quantified by GC-ECD. F. desulfinyl was the major metabolite found in all matrixes, followed by f. sulphide in sediments, while f. sulfone was mainly accumulated in fish. Fipronil promoted oxidative stress in P. lineatus, as evidenced by the increases in LPO and PO levels and the decrease brain AChE activity. Fish exposed at both concentrations showed significant decrease in antioxidant capacity. Alterations in the antioxidant defenses system was evidenced in all organs. These results suggest that the occurrence of fipronil in aquatic environments can generate oxidative stress at different levels in P. lineatus, showing that this species is highly sensitive to the deleterious effects of fipronil and metabolites.

AB  - Atrazine accumulation, oxidative stress, and defense response in maize seedlings exposed to extraneous atrazine were studied. Accumulation of atrazine in maize increased with increasing exposure concentration. The abscisic acid (ABA) content was positively correlated with the atrazine concentrations in maize roots and shoots (p < 0.05). Hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) in maize was determined in vivo with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Its intensity was positively correlated with atrazine concentration in roots and shoots (p < 0.05), and higher level of (OH)-O-center dot generated in roots than in shoots corresponded to the major accumulation of atrazine in roots. Superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase in roots were up-regulated by atrazine exposure at 1 mg/L compared to the control and malondialdehyde content in roots was enhanced when atrazine exposure concentration reached 10 mg/L. These results suggested the exposure and accumulation of atrazine caused oxidative toxicity and antioxidant response in maize.

AB  - Aquatic environments face frequent exposure to organophosphate pesticides, such as diazinon, which are frequently utilized in agriculture. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of diazinon exposure on fish and to investigate the potential of the HSP inducer (HSPi) in developing a defense mechanism. To achieve this, several factors were analyzed, including the HSP70 gene expression, levels of immunity markers (lysozyme, IgM, and C3), antioxidant status, and the activity of acetylcholine esterase (AChE). Stellate sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus) fry, was exposed to diazinon (25, 50, and 75% of 96h-LC50) for 6 days after pre-treatment with an HSP inducer (HSPi), TEX-OE (R) (a prickly pear cactus extract), for 4 hours. Two HSPi concentrations, 100 and 200 mg.L-1, were used. Pre-treatment with HSPi significantly enhanced HSP70 gene expression in the gill and liver, as well as immune markers in the blood of Acipenser stellatus. Diazinon-treated groups exhibited higher antioxidant activities of SOD, CAT, and T-AOC. Increased activity also observed in control fish pre-treated with HSPi. However, stellate sturgeon receiving both diazinon and HSPi+diazinon experienced a significant decrease in AChE activity in comparison with control group. Cortisol levels were elevated in the fish that were subjected to diazinon. Those subjected to diazinon after receiving HSPi showed a significant decrease in cortisol levels. In conclusion, the study suggests that HSPi-mediated HSP70 induction may have a protective effect. The presence of an HSP inducer offers a potential strategy to mitigate the consequences of diazinon exposure in stellate sturgeon.

AB  - Olfaction conveys critical environmental information to fishes, enabling activities such as mating, locating food, discriminating kin, avoiding predators and homing. All of these behaviors can be impaired or lost as a result of exposure to toxic contaminants in surface waters. Historically, teleost olfaction studies have focused on behavioral responses to anthropogenic contaminants (e.g., avoidance). More recently, there has been a shift towards understanding the underlying mechanisms and functional significance of contaminant-mediated changes in fish olfaction. This includes a consideration of how contaminants affect the olfactory nervous system and, by extension, the downstream physiological and behavioral processes that together comprise a normal response to naturally occurring stimuli (e.g., reproductive priming or releasing pheromones). Numerous studies spanning several species have shown that ecologically relevant exposures to common pollutants such as metals and pesticides can interfere with fish olfaction and disrupt life history processes that determine individual survival and reproductive success. This represents one of the pathways by which toxic chemicals in aquatic habitats may increasingly contribute to the decline and at-risk status of many commercially and ecologically important fish stocks. Despite our emerging understanding of the threats that pollution poses for chemical communication in aquatic communities, many research challenges remain. These include: (1) the determination of specific mechanisms of toxicity in the fish olfactory sensory epithelium; (2) an understanding of the impacts of complex chemical mixtures: (3) the capacity to assess olfactory toxicity in fish in situ; (4) the impacts of toxins on olfactory-mediated behaviors that are still poorly understood for many fish species; and (5) the connections between sublethal effects on individual fish and the long-term viability of wild populations. This review summarizes and integrates studies on fish olfaction-contaminant interactions, including metrics ranging from the molecular to the behavioral, and highlights directions for future research.

AB  - Selfish genetic elements (SGEs) are ubiquitous in eukaryotes and bacteria, and make up a large part of the genome. They frequently target sperm to increase their transmission success, but these manipulations are often associated with reduced male fertility. Low fertility of SGE-carrying males is suggested to promote polyandry as a female strategy to bias paternity against male carriers. Support for this hypothesis is found in several taxa, where SGE-carrying males have reduced sperm competitive ability. In contrast, when SGEs give rise to reproductive incompatibilities between SGE-carrying males and females, polyandry is not necessarily favoured, irrespective of the detrimental impact on male fertility. This is due to the frequency-dependent nature of these incompatibilities, because they will decrease in the population as the frequency of SGEs increases. However, reduced fertility of SGE-carrying males can prevent the successful population invasion of SGEs. In addition, SGEs can directly influence male and female mating behaviour, mating rates and reproductive traits (e. g. female reproductive tract length and male sperm). This reveals a potent and dynamic interaction between SGEs and polyandry highlighting the potential to generate sexual selection and conflict, but also indicates that polyandry can promote harmony within the genome by undermining the spread of SGEs.

AB  - There is a growing concern regarding the adverse risks exposure to cylindrospermopsin (CYN) might exert on animals and humans. However, data regarding the toxicity of this cyanotoxin to neotropical fish species are scarce. Using the fish species Poecilia reticulata, the influence of CYN concentrations equal to and above the tolerable for drinking water may produce on liver was determined by assessing biomarkers of antioxidant defense mechanisms and correlated to qualitative and semiquantitative histopathological observations. Adult females were exposed to 0.0 (Control); 0.5, 1 and 1.5 mu g/L pure CYN for 24 or 96 hr, in triplicate. Subsequently the livers were extracted for biochemical assays and histopathological evaluation. Catalase (CAT) activity was significantly increased only by 1.5 mu g/L CYN-treatment, at both exposure times. Glutathione -S-transferase (GST) activity presented a biphasic response for both exposure times. It was markedly decreased after exposure by 0.5 mu g/L CYN treatment but significantly elevated by 1.5 mu g/L CYN treatment. All CYN treatments produced histopathological alterations, as evidenced by hepatocyte cords degeneration, steatosis, inflammatory infiltration, melanomacrophage centers, vessel congestion, and areas with necrosis. Further, an IORG >35 was achieved for all treatments, indicative of the presence of severe histological alterations in P. reticulata hepatic parenchyma and stroma. Taken together, data demonstrated evidence that CYN-induced hepatotoxicity in P. reticulata appears to be associated with an imbalance of antioxidant defense mechanisms accompanied by histopathological liver alterations. It is worthy to note that exposure to low environmentally-relevant CYN concentrations might constitute a significant risk to health of aquatic organisms.

AB  - Environmental pollutants such as metals, pesticides, and other organics pose serious risks to many aquatic organisms. Accordingly, a great deal of previous research has characterized physiological mechanisms of toxicity in animals exposed to contaminants. In contrast, effects of contaminants on fish behaviour are less frequently studied. Because behaviour links physiological function with ecological processes, behavioural indicators of toxicity appear ideal for assessing the effects of aquatic pollutants on fish populations. Here we consider the many toxicants that disrupt complex fish behaviours, such as predator avoidance, reproductive, and social behaviours. Toxicant exposure often completely eliminates the performance of behaviours that are essential to fitness and survival in natural ecosystems, frequently after exposures of lesser magnitude than those causing significant mortality. Unfortunately, the behavioural toxicity of many xenobiotics is still unknown, warranting their future study. Physiological effects of toxicants in the literature include disruption of sensory, hormonal, neurological, and metabolic systems, which are likely to have profound implications for many fish behaviours. However, little toxicological research has sought to integrate the behavioural effects of toxicants with physiological processes. Those studies that take this multidisciplinary approach add important insight into possible mechanisms of behavioural alteration. The most commonly observed links with behavioural disruption include cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition, altered brain neurotransmitter levels, sensory deprivation, and impaired gonadal or thyroid hormone levels. Even less frequently studied are the implications of interrelated changes in behaviour and physiology caused by aquatic pollutants for fish populations. We conclude that future integrative, multidisciplinary research is clearly needed to increase the significance and usefulness of behavioural Judicators for aquatic toxicology, and aim to highlight specific areas for consideration.

AB  - Deltamethrin (DMN) exposure causes severe damage to the gill and liver tissues of aquatic organisms, as well as neurotoxic effects and metabolic disorders. The goal of the present study was to assess the impacts of DMN toxicity on blood biochemistry, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, catalase (CAT) levels, behavior disorder, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, histopathology and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8 OHdG) of brown trout (Salmo trutta fario). Acute concentrations (1.0 and 2.0 mu g/L) of DMN caused behavioral disorder such as rapid swimming, loss of balance, aggressiveness and increasing in the surface activity and inactivity in brown trout. A significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and a significant decrease in CAT, AChE, blood albumin, and blood total protein content were observed. Histopathologically, both doses of DMN have caused steatosis, necrosis, and degeneration in hepatocytes and hyperemia in the liver. Also, they led to inflammation, adhesion and fusion depending on severe hyperplasia in secondary lamellae, hyperemia and lamellar edema in gill tissues when compared to control group. Additionally, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8 OHdG) levels at 2.0 mu g/L dose of DMN in liver tissues were more severe according to 1.0 mu g/L dose of DMN. Finally, different concentrations of DMN led to changes of the histopathology, 8 OHdG, the CAT levels, plasma AChE activity, and the serum metabolites, as well as behavioral disorder in brown trout.

AB  - The synergy between multiple compounds and other stressors, including heat, creates volatility and greater unpredictability than standard single-chemical toxicity testing, especially in the case of pesticides and metabolites which might contain several noxious ingredients resulting in adverse ecological effects. To address this, the aim of this study was to examine the dose- and time-dependent effects of low- and high-dose pesticide mixture (metalachlor, linuron, isoproturon, tebucanazole, aclonifen, atrazine, pendimethalin, azinphos-methyl) and heat stress co-exposure (22 degrees C control/32 degrees C treatment for 4-week) on free-swimming behaviors and cumulative actionless time (CAT) of goldfish. Behavioral analysis showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in distance swam, as well as a subsequent increase in CAT. Vertical and horizontal spatial behavioral use were affected under heat and pesticides co-exposure conditions. In 3- and 4-week(s) exposure groups, horizontal spatial behavioral use demonstrated elevated time spent in the lower third of the aquarium. Similarly, during 3- and 4-week(s) exposure (32 degrees C control and 32 degrees C high doses) vertical spatial behavioral use was found to increase time spent in the outermost edges of the aquarium. In all treatment groups, the final condition factor (KM) showed significant attenuation when compared to the initial KM. However, there was an unclear relationship between heat/pesticide co-exposure and growth most notably in 32 degrees C high-dose groups. In addition, the expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A mRNA was significantly higher in pesticide-exposed groups. Taken together, data demonstrated that co-exposure with low- or high-dose pesticide mixture and heat stress significantly impacted natural swimming patterns, which over time might result in the broader population and ecological effects.

AB  - Background. As every organ within the body, the brain is also extremely susceptible to a plethora of noxious agents that change its chemistry. One component frequently found in current products against harmful species to crops is rotenone whose effect under prolonged exposure has been demonstrated to cause neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The latest reports have indeed revealed that rotenone promotes Parkinson's in humans, but studies aiming to show congruent effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) are lacking. Material and Methods. In this context, the aim of the present study was to demonstrate how chronic administration of rotenone for 3 weeks impairs the locomotor activity and sociability and induces oxidative stress in zebrafish. Results. There were no statistically significant differences following the analysis of their social interaction and locomotor tests (p>0.05). However, several exceptions have been noted in the control, rotenone, and probiotics groups when we compared their locomotor activity during the pretreatment and treatment interval (p<0.05). We further assessed the role of rotenone in disturbing the detoxifying system as represented by three enzymes known as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Despite the fact that there were no statistically significant changes within SOD and GPx levels between the control group and rotenone, probiotics, and rotenone+probiotics (p>0.05), relevant changes have been observed between the analyzed groups (p<0.05 and p<0.005, respectively). On the other hand, significant differences (p<0.05) have been observed for MDA when we analyzed the data between the control group and the other three groups. Conclusions. Our results suggest that rotenone can be successfully used to trigger Parkinson's disease-related symptomatology in zebrafish.</p>

AB  - Chronic exposure to synthetic insecticides in the early life of a child can lead to a series of disorders. Several causes as parental age, maternal smoking, birth complications, and exposure to toxins such as insecticides on childhood can lead to Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) occurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential protective role of vitamin C (Vit. C) from children's supplements after 14 days chronic exposure to insecticide mixture fipronil (Fip) + pyriproxyfen (Pyr) on juvenile zebrafish for swimming performances, social behavior and oxidative stress associated with ASD model. Juvenile (14-17 mm) wild-type AB zebrafish (Danio rerio) (45 days) were exposed to relevant concentrations: vit. C (25 mu g L-1), Fip (600 mu g L-1/1.372 mu M) + Pyr (600 mu g L-1/1.89 mu M), and [Fip (600 mu g L-1/1.372 mu M) + Pyr (600 mu g L-1 /1.89 mu M)] + vit. C (25 mu g L-1). Our results showed that insecticides can disturb the social behavior of zebrafish during 14 days of the administration, decreased the swimming performances, and elevated the oxidative stress biomarkers of SOD (superoxide dismutase), GPx (glutathione peroxidase), and MDA (malondialdehyde). The vitamin C supplement significantly attenuated the neurotoxicity of insecticide mixture and oxidative stress. This study provides possible in vivo evidence to show that vitamin C supplements could attenuate oxidative stress and brain damage of fipronil and pyriproxyfen insecticide chronic exposure on zebrafish juvenile.

AB  - Objectives Exposure to chlorpyrifos (CPF), a neurotoxic insecticide, is implicated with adverse neurodevelopmental effects in children through noncholinergic mechanisms.
   Methods This review presents qualitative and quantitative evidence in three animal models (rodent, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans), for neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects occurring at CPF doses lower than those inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE).
   Results CPF treatment in rodents at low noncholinergic doses during neurodevelopment showed behavioral effects, including locomotor activity, neuromotor function (NMF), cognition, anxiety, social behavior, and maternal care. Zebrafish and C. elegans, which are transparent during development, allow for detailed analysis of specific systems; further, they exhibit neurotoxic effects closely emulating those observed in mammalian pathways. Qualitative results showed concordance among rodents, zebrafish and C. elegans for adverse effects on locomotor activity, NMF, and AChE inhibition. Male rodents had greater sensitivity for effects on locomotor activity than females and exposure during the gestation day 10-14 window showed consistent increases in locomotor activity at low CPF doses (<= 1.0 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). Zebrafish had cognitive and anxiety deficits after CPF treatment at low doses and young adult C. elegans had reproductive dysfunction associated NMF and disruption of the serotonergic pathway. Quantitative data for all three species showed neurobehavioral effects after exposure to CPF doses approximately 2-10-fold below the threshold for AChE inhibition.
   Conclusions Taken together, these findings provided a weight-of-evidence for low-dose CPF neurotoxicity and noncholinergic mechanisms. Variability in laboratories, exposure methods, tests, sex, and animal species/strain might have contributed to the inconsistent results. The detrimental CPF effects during early development are relevant to human populations.

AB  - Rotenone, a widely used botanical insecticide submitted to strong restrictions regarding its environmental hazards, was studied as a target compound for electro-Fenton (EF) treatment in aqueous-acetonitrile mixture (70:30) of pH 3.0. In this system, the degradation of organic pollutants occurs by attack of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) which are produced from the reaction of added ferrous catalyst (Fe2+) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrogene rated by oxygen reduction at carbon felt cathode. The degradative efficiency of EF system was comparatively studied versus anodic oxidation method (AO) in absence and presence of H2O2, It was found that only EF is sufficiently powerful to induce fast and efficient mineralization of rotenone and its degradation intermediates.
   The mineralization of rotenone was found to depend largely on organic solvent type, metal ion catalyst, applied current and initial rotenone concentration. The best operative conditions are achieved using aqueous-acetonitrile mixture of pH 3.0 in the presence of 0.2 mM Fe2+ catalyst with a current intensity of 100 mA. Under these optimized conditions, 30 min were sufficient to completely degrade rotenone in 100 mL of a 20 mg L-1 solution. A nearly complete mineralization (similar to 96% of COD removal) was achieved after 8 h treatment.
   Rotenone removal kinetic was found to obey the pseudo-first order model and the absolute second order rate constant (k(Rot) = 2.49 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)) for the reaction between the substrate and (OH)-O-center dot was derived.
   HPLC-MS and HPLC-DAD analysis were applied to identify and follow the evolution of rotenone oxidation products. Three stable aromatic intermediates were observed and two of these were identified as 12a beta-hydroxyrotenone and hydroquinone. Subsequent attack of these intermediates by (OH)-O-center dot radicals leads to the formation of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as succinic, acetic, oxalic and formic, quantified by ion-exclusion chromatography.

AB  - Dioxins have been an inconvenience to the Baltic Sea ecosystem for decades. Although the concentrations in the environment and biota have continuously decreased, dioxins still pose a risk to human health. The risk and its formation vary in different parts of the Baltic Sea, due to variability in the environmental and societal factors affecting it. This paper presents a systematic literature review and knowledge synthesis about the regional dioxin risk formation in four sub-areas of the Baltic Sea and evaluates, whether systemic approach changes our thinking about the risk and its effective management. We studied the dioxin flux from atmospheric deposition to the Baltic Sea food webs, accumulation to two commercially and culturally important fish species, Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras) and Baltic salmon (Salmo salar), and further to risk group members of four Baltic countries. Based on 46 studies, we identified 20 quantifiable variables and indexed them for commensurable regional comparison. Spatial differences in dioxin pollution, environmental conditions, food web dynamics, and the following dioxin concentrations in herring and salmon, together with fishing and fish consumption, affect how the final health risk builds up. In the southern Baltic Sea, atmospheric pollution levels are relatively high and environmental processes to decrease bioavailability of dioxins unfavorable, but the growth is fast, which curb the bioaccumulation of dioxins in the biota. In the North, long-range atmospheric pollution is minor compared to South, but the local pollution and slower growth leads to higher bioaccumulation rates. However, based on our results, the most remarkable differences in the dioxin risk formation between the areas arise from the social sphere: the emissions, origin of national catches, and cultural differences in fish consumption. The article suggests that acknowledging spatial characteristics of socio-ecological systems that generate environmental risks may aid to direct local focus in risk management. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - This study aims to determine the effect of glyphosate on the transcriptional and enzymatic activity of antioxidant metabolism enzymes of juvenile rainbow trout with short term (6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h) and long term (21 days) exposures followed by a recovery treatment. This study also aims to determine the effects of glyphosate exposure on liver tissue damage and swimming performance due to short term (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/L) and long term (2.5 and 5 mg/L) exposures. Following pesticide administration, ten fish, each as a sample, were caught at 6th, 12th, 24th, 48th and 96th -h for the short term, and at 21st day for the long term exposure study. GPx activity was found to be significantly induced 12 h after the exposure to 2.5 mg/L of glyphosate as compared with the control group. A similar degree of induction was also observed for CAT activity but not for SOD. For long term exposure, except for the GPx activity after exposure to 5 mg/L of glyphosate, the activities of all other enzymes remained on a par with the control group. It was also observed that the levels of gene expression of these enzymes were not comparable with each other. It is assumed that these differences might result from the effect of glyphosate before translation and the possible reasons for this scenario are also discussed. The results of swimming performance are found to be consistent with responses of the antioxidant system, and they are attributed to the energy metabolism. The data are also supported with liver histopathology analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Monopterus cuchia is a freshwater mud eel predominantly found in Bangladesh and the North East Region of India but available in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Indonesia, Philippines, etc. as well. M. cuchia is a tasteful, medicinally valuable, nutritionally rich, and economically important fish with high demands in national as well as international markets. The eel is recommended for consumption due to its high protein content and calorific values besides its high erythrocyte indices. The fish is usually available in freshwater ecosystems and shows survivability in extreme environmental conditions like high temperatures, low oxygen levels, high salt conditions, shallow waters, etc. by showing various morpho-histochemical, respiratory, and epidermal adaptations. It plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of a nation by providing employment and means of livelihood to millions of people involved in its production, catching, and marketing. The population of the eel is declining at a faster rate due to aggressive catching and less rearing, habitat destruction, and lack of conservative measures, therefore, requires serious attention in terms of production and conservation. In this regard, the current review gives a deep insight into nutritional, therapeutic and economic importance, habitat, morphology, reproduction, population status, diseases, toxicological studies, and adaptability to extreme environmental cues of the eel. The review also discusses the prevailing socioeconomic status of cuchia catchers and the strategies required to provide them with better employment and boost their social status. The review also discusses several conservative measures of the eel including induced breeding and developing genetic and molecular markers.

AB  - Fipronil is a broad-use insecticide with severe toxicity to fish. Biomarkers responses and bioaccumulation were evaluated on Prochilodus lineatus after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of fipronil (0.5 mu g L-1, 9 mu g L-1, and 100 mu g L-1) in a prolonged flow-through assay and ex vivo gills short-term exposition. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), oxidatively modified proteins (PO), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), the content of reduced glutathione (GSH), antioxidant capacity against peroxyles (ACAP), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were evaluated. Besides, levels of fipronil and metabolites were analyzed by GC-ECD. At the end of the flow-through assay, fipronil, Fp. sulfone and Fp. desulfinyl were detected in fish, being liver the target organ. Fipronil prolonged exposition promoted oxidative damage in lipids and proteins, alterations in the defense system and low-antioxidant capacity in organs of P. lineatus. The brain AChE activity was affected after prolonged exposition. Ex vivo gills exposition to fipronil promoted changes in antioxidant capacity and damage to lipids, providing a fast and suitable test to assess the pesticide exposure in fish. The results revealed that fipronil at environmental concentrations would be an inducer of oxidative stress in this fish, becoming a vulnerable species to the effects of fipronil in aquatic environments.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos is a broad-spectrum organophosphorus insecticide (O,O-diethyl -O-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl phosphorothioate) that is used in numerous agricultural and urban pest controls. The primary metabolite of chlorpyrifos is 3,5,6-trichloro pyridine-2-phenol (TCP). Because of its strong water solubility and mobility, this harmful metabolite exists in the environment in a large amount. Although TCP has potentially harmful effects on organisms in the environment, few studies have addressed TCP pollution. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the effect of chlorpyrifos and TCP on the microsomal cytochrome P450 content in the liver, on the activity of NADPH-P450 reductase and antioxidative enzymes [catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)], and on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage in zebrafish. Male and female zebrafish were separated and exposed to a control solution and three concentrations of chlorpyrifos (0.01, 0.1, 1 mg L-1) and TCP (0.01, 0.1, 0.5 mg L-1), respectively, sampled after 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 days. The results indicated that the P450 content and the NADPH-P450 reductase and antioxidative enzyme (CAT and SOD) activities could be induced by chlorpyrifos and TCP. DNA damage of zebrafish was enhanced with increasing chlorpyrifos and TCP concentrations. Meanwhile, chlorpyrifos and TCP induced a significant increase of ROS generation in the zebrafish hepatopancreas. In conclusion, this study proved that chlorpyrifos (0.01-1 mg L-1) and TCP (0.01-0.5 mg L-1) are both highly toxic to zebrafish.

AB  - The present systematic experiment was conducted to estimate the impact of behavioral and pathological indices on freshwater fish Channa punctatus exposed to sub-lethal concentration (5ppm) of an organophosphorus insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). Fish were segregated into four experimental groups (G1, control; G2, 10days; G3, 20days; and G4, 30days exposure), each group comprises 15 fish in triplicate. The behavioral and histological changes were assessed in each group. Severe behavioral changes were observed in the 30days, moderate changes in the 20days, and mild changes in the 10days exposure groups respectively when compared with the control group. The pathologic lesions such as inter lamellae space, necrotic lamellae, fused lamellae, and lifting of lamellae epithelium in gills; vacuolation, blood conjunctions, and necrotic hepatocytes in the liver; and lamina propria, fusion of villi, and flattened villi in the intestine were observed. These structural alterations of the gills, liver, and intestine could affect respiration, osmotic and ionic regulation; absorption, storage and secretion; digestion; and absorption of nutrients respectively, which in turn could adversely affect the growth and survival of freshwater fish Channa punctatus. This study serves as a biomonitoring tool for the effects of organophosphorus insecticide CPF on the aquatic biota.

AB  - Tilapia were exposed to sublethal concentrations of 0, 0.2, 2, 20, or 200 g/L for 30 days, and then transferred to methomyl-free water for 18 days. GST, GPx, GR, GSH, and GSSG in tilapia serum were examined at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 days after methomyl exposure and at 18 days after transferring to methomyl-free water. There were no significant changes in antioxidants activities and contents in serum of tilapia exposed to 0.2 g/L. Significant increases in GST, GR, GPx, and GSSG accompanied by a decrease in GSH were observed following methomyl exposure to 2, 20, or 200 g/L, suggesting the presence of oxidative stress. Thus, it would appear the 0.2 g/L methomyl might be considered the no observed adverse effect level. Recovery data showed that the effects produced by lower concentration of 20 g/L were reversible but not at the higher 200 g/L concentration. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Sticklebacks (Gasterosteiformes) are increasingly used in ecological and evolutionary research and have become well established as role model species for biologists. However, ecotoxicology studies concerning behavioural effects in sticklebacks regarding stress responses, mainly induced by chemical mixtures, have hardly been addressed. For this purpose, we investigated the swimming behaviour (including mortality rate based on 96-h LC50 values) of two ecologically similar three-spined (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) to short-term (up to 24 h) metal mixture (MIX) exposure. We evaluated the relevance and efficacy of behavioural responses of test species in the early toxicity assessment of chemical mixtures. Fish exposed to six (Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Cr) metals in the mixture were either singled out by the Water Framework Directive as priority or as relevant substances in surface water, which was prepared according to the environmental quality standards (EQSs) of these metals set for inland waters in the European Union (EU) (Directive 2013/39/EU). The performed behavioural analysis showed the main effect on the interaction between time, species, and treatment variables. Although both species exposed to MIX revealed a decreasing tendency in swimming activity, these species' responsiveness to MIX was somewhat different. Substantial changes in the activity of G. aculeatus were established after a 3-h exposure to MIX solutions, which was 1.43-fold lower, while in the case of P. pungitius, 1.96-fold higher than established 96-h LC50 values for each species. This study demonstrated species-specific differences in response sensitivity to metal-based water pollution, indicating behavioural insensitivity of P. pungitius as model species for aquatic biomonitoring and environmental risk assessments.

AB  - The use of agrochemicals has grown in recent years following the increase in agricultural productivity, to eliminate weeds that can compromise crop yields. The intensive use of these products combined with the lack of treatment of agricultural wastewater is causing contamination of the natural environments, especially the aquatics. Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] is the most commonly used herbicide in agriculture worldwide. Studies have shown that this compound is toxic to a variety of fish species at the concentrations of environmental relevance. Glyphosate-based herbicides can affect fish biochemical, physiological, endocrine, and behavioral pathways. Changes in behaviors such as foraging, escaping from predators, and courtship can compromise the survival of species and even communities. The behavior patterns of fish has been shown to be a sensitive tool for risk assessment. In this sense, this review summarizes and discusses the toxic effects of glyphosate and its formulations on the behavior of fish in different life stages. Additionally, behavioral im-pairments were associated with other negative effects of glyphosate such as energy imbalance, stress responses, AChE inhibition, and physiological and endocrine disturbances, which are evidenced and described in the literature.

AB  - Propiconazole (PCZ), a triazole fungicide, is widely present in the aquatic environment, but little is known regarding its chronic toxicity in the fish brain. This study assessed the effects of long-term exposure to PCZ on the antioxidant defense system and Na+-K+-ATPase activity of rainbow trout brain. Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of PCZ (0.2, 50, and 500 mu g/l) for 7, 20, and 30 days, respectively. Oxidative stress indices (reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and carbonyl protein) and antioxidant parameters (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and reduced glutathione) were measured, as well as Na+-K+-ATPase activity. Adaptive responses to PCZ-induced stress were observed at 7 days. With prolonged exposure, significantly higher levels of oxidative indices were indicative of oxidative stress, as also were the significant inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activity and reduced glutathione content. Na+-K+-ATPase activity was significantly inhibited after prolonged exposure. Chemometrics of all parameters by principal component analysis, enabled the separation of sampled individuals into four groups with 93.39% of total accumulated variance. A low level of oxidative stress can induce the adaptive responses of the antioxidant defense system, while prolonged exposure to PCZ may lead to serious oxidative damage in fish brain. We suggest that selected biochemical markers in fish brain could be used as potential biomarkers for monitoring residual fungicides present in the aquatic environments.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are a class of small noncoding RNAs, can modulate the expression of many protein-coding genes when an organism is exposed to an environmental chemical. We previously demonstrated that miR-155 was significantly downregulated in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in response to fipronil (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl) sulphinyl]1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile) exposure. However, the regulation of this miRNA's predicted target gene cyb561d2, which is a member of the cytochrome b561 (cyt b561) family involved in electron transfer, cell defence, and chemical stress, has not been experimentally validated to date. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR-155 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish. The expression of miR-155 was downregulated, whereas cyb561d2 was upregulated in both mRNA and protein level in a dose-dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil. The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR-155 interacted with cyb561d2 30-untranslated regions (3'-UTR). The expression of cyb561d2 was reduced in both mRNA and protein levels when ZF4 cells were transfected with an miR-155 mimic, whereas its expression levels of both mRNA and protein were increased when endogenous miR-155 was inhibited by transfection with an miR-155 inhibitor. The results improved our understanding of molecular mechanism of toxicity upon fipronil exposure, and presents miR-155 as a potential novel toxicological biomarker for chemical exposure.

AB  - Individual and combined toxicities of endosulfan (ENDO) with phenanthrene (PHE) were evaluated using zebrafish (Danio redo) adults. The 96-h LC50 values for ENDO and PHE were 4.6 mu g L-1 and 920 mu g L-1, respectively. To evaluate the mixture toxicity, LC10 and LC50 concentrations were grouped into four combinations as ENDO-LC10 + PHE-LC10, ENDO-LC10 + PHE-LC50, ENDO-LC50 + PHE-LC10, and ENDO-LC50 + PHE-LC50, and their acute toxicities were determined. The combination of LC50-ENDO and LC10-PHE exhibited a synergistic effect. In addition, acetylcholinesterase activity decreased in zebrafish bodies exposed to ENDO with or without PHE. Combined treatments induced higher glutathione S-transferase activity compared to individual treatments. Carboxylesterase activity increased in both heads and bodies of ENDO-treated fishes compared with PHE-treated fishes. Using RT-qPCR technique, CYP1A gene expression significantly up-regulated in all combinations, whereas CYP3A was unchanged, suggesting that enzymes involved in defense may play different roles in the detoxification. CYP7A1 gene responsible for bile acid biosynthesis is dramatically down-regulated after exposure to the synergistic combination exposure, referring that the synergistic effect may be resulted from the reduction of bile production in zebrafishes. Among gender-related genes, CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 genes in female zebrafish decreased after treatment with ENDO alone and combination of LC50-ENDO and LC10-PHE. This might be related to a reduction in cortisol production. The overall results indicated that ENDO and PHE were toxic to zebrafish adults both individually and in combination, and that their co-presence induced changes in the expression of genes responsible for metabolic processes and defense mechanisms.

AB  - Brown trout (Salmo trutta) are known to have effects on multiple trophic levels in New Zealand streams, but their impacts on lower trophic levels are less well understood within lentic systems. We examined the effects of brown trout removal using rotenone on zooplankton and phytoplankton community composition in the Upper Karori Reservoir, New Zealand. Significant shifts were observed in zooplankton and phytoplankton composition following removal of brown trout from the reservoir. Shifts in zooplankton community composition did not occur immediately following trout removal (February), but instead followed the likely timing of galaxiid spawning (July). The removal of brown trout likely resulted in reduced predation pressure on galaxiids. A major change occurred in the zooplankton community with the dominance shifting from larger crustaceans to smaller rotifers, indicating an increased predation pressure from the larval native galaxiid. A delayed response in zooplankton community composition change indicates rotenone was not the direct cause of this. A major shift in phytoplankton community composition occurred immediately following trout removal. This was not consistent with the trophic cascade hypothesis of reduced grazing pressure from larger zooplankton due to increased galaxiid predation as a result of brown trout removal.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate leucocyte responses to inflammation as well as some innate immune parameters of Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis, following challenge with two strains of Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida belonging to the European and Japanese clones described for this bacterium. Pathogenicity assays were performed to assess the virulence of each Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida strain for sole. Subsequently, fish were intraperitoneally injected with phosphate-buffered saline (control) or two concentrations (2x102 and 2x106CFUmL1) of each bacterial strain and sampled after 6 and 24h. Results showed that the European isolate induces a higher degree of response than the Japanese strain. While blood neutrophilia and monocytosis correlated well with the increase in neutrophil and macrophage numbers in the peritoneal cavity, fish infected with the European isolate presented higher peritoneal cell numbers than fish challenged with the Japanese strain. In addition, alternative complement pathway activity and respiratory burst of head kidney leucocytes increased significantly in fish infected with the European isolate. The enhanced innate immune response displayed by Senegalese sole challenged with the European isolate is probably due to the higher degree of virulence presented by this Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida strain.

AB  - Scale and ontogeny are important in understanding how various ecological processes structure populations. This is expected to be the case for density-dependent effects (DDE), which influence the population dynamics of many organisms. Our goal was to evaluate stage-specific DDE on the growth, movement, and survival of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar from the individual to the group level over varying spatial scales (20 160 m). We used passive integrated transponder tags and associated technology to assess individual growth, survival, and movement histories in a single stream in Maine undergoing restoration efforts via stocking of fry. We studied six life stages over 18 months for four cohorts of presmolt Atlantic salmon. Our findings show that the DDE on growth can be detected at multiple stages well past the young-of-the-year stage in juvenile salmon. We saw a clear development of decreasing DDE on size and growth as cohorts aged. This trend appears to coincide with a tendency for mean fish size to become more variable in low-density reaches. Density had limited effects on individual movements and mortality during most of juvenile rearing, with such effects largely being confined to the period from spring through fall of the age-1 year. Shifting the focus of analysis from individuals to group means spanning larger spatial scales had pronounced effects on both the detection of DDE, the magnitude of apparent density effects, and the amount of variation in fish size explained by density.

AB  - Data on persistent organochlorines (OCs) in sharks are scarce. Concentrations of OCs such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were determined in the muscle tissue of 13 shark species (n=105) collected from offshore (Indian and Pacific Oceans) and coastal waters of Korea, to investigate species-specific accumulation of OCs and to assess the potential health risks associated with consumption of shark meat Overall OC concentrations were highly variable not only among species but also within the same species of shark. The concentrations of PCBs, DDTs, chlordanes, hexachlorobenzene, and heptachlor in all shark species ranged from < LOQ (limit of quantification) to 184 (mean: 35.0), < LOQ to 1135 (58.2), < LOQ to 56.2 (4.31), < LOQ to 18.8 (1.64) and < LOQ to 77.5 (1.37) ng/g lipid weight, respectively. The determined concentrations of PCBs and DDTs in shark in our study were relatively lower than those reported in other studies. Aggressive shark species and species inhabiting the Indian Ocean had the highest levels of OCs. Inter-species differences in the concentrations and accumulation profiles of OCs among shark species could be explained by differences in feeding habit and sampling locations. Several confounding factors such as growth velocity, trophic position, and regional contamination status may affect the bioaccumulation of OCs in sharks. Hazard ratios of non-cancer risk for all the OCs were below one, whereas the hazard ratios of lifetime cancer risks of PCBs and DDTs exceeded one, implying potential carcinogenic effects in the general population in Korea. This is the first report to document the occurrence of OCs in sharks from Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diazinon is a widely used organophosphorus pesticide in agriculture and environmental health, hence its adverse effects on nontarget animals, especially on fish is to be determined. The present study therefore aimed at detecting the biochemical changes caused by diazinon. To accomplish this aim, we studied the effects of sublethal concentrations (0.0036, 0.018, and 0.036 ppb) of diazinon on acetylcholine esterase activity, antioxidant enzyme activities, and lipid peroxidation in the liver of Cyprinus carpio on days 5, 15, and 30 after the exposure. The results revealed that the antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase were induced by diazinon exposure. In addition, the highest catalytic activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) was obtained with 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). GST activity toward 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB) was also observed in the liver, yet it was relatively low as opposed to the other substrates tested. On the other hand, hepatic malondialdehyde level did not show any significant alteration except after the exposure on day 15. The exposure of low concentrations of diazinon to C. carpio can induce oxidative stress in liver; yet restoring susceptibility and adapting to oxidative stress are likely to occur when low level of oxidative stress is administered. Furthermore, no significant change was observed in hepatic lipid peroxidation after diazinon treatment indicating that liver tissue resisted to oxidative stress by enhancing their antioxidant mechanisms. The level of lipid peroxidation was assumed to be associated with the concentrations of diazinon and experimentation periods. The induction of glutathione S-transferase and antioxidant enzyme activities were also assumed to have resulted from the defense against the toxicity of diazinon. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The visualization of specific activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) directly in the zebrafish embryo (Danio rerio) via live-imaging is a reliable tool to investigate the presence of dioxin-like substances in environmental samples. The co-existence of inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases (CYP1A) is typical of complex environmental mixtures and requires modifications of the in vivo EROD assay: For this end, zebrafish embryos were used to evaluate the EROD-modifying potentials of common single-compound exposures as well as binary mixtures with the PAH-type Ah-receptor agonist beta-naphthoflavone. For chemical testing, chlorpyrifos and Aroclor 1254 were selected; beta-naphthoflavone served as maximum EROD induction control. Chlorpyrifos (<= EC10) could be documented to be a strong CYP1A inhibitor causing characteristic edema-related toxicity. Aroclor 1254 resulted in inhibition of CYP1A catalytic activity in a concentration-and specific time-dependent manner. Next to a fast CYP1A induction, CYP1A inhibition could also be detected after 3 h short-term exposure of zebrafish embryos to chlorpyrifos. This communication also describes techniques for the quantification of fluorescence signals via densitometry as a basis for subsequent statistical assessment. The co-exposure approach with zebrafish embryos accounts for the nature of potential interaction between CYP1A inducers and inhibitors and thus pays tribute to the complexity of environmental mixtures. The co-exposure EROD live-imaging assay thus facilitates a better understanding of mixture effects and allows a better assessment and interpretation of (embryo) toxic potentials.

AB  - Diazinon is an organophosphate toxicant that has been identified to induce oxidative stress within biological systems through altering biochemical and hematological indices, by generating free radicals while deteriorating the cellular antioxidant defense system. The present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), a synthetic food additive, in serving as an antioxidant against sub-lethal diazinon-induced oxidative stress in male Wistar rats. Animals were randomly divided into 4 groups: Control (treated with corn oil as a vehicle), diazinon (10 mg/kg/day), TBHQ (0.028 g/kg of diet) and a combination group of TBHQ (0.028 g/kg of diet) plus diazinon (10 mg/kg/day). All animals were treated orally once a day by gastric tube and treatments were continued for 7 weeks. Hematological indices, including red blood cell (RBC) indices and white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, were measured at the end of the treatment schedule. On comparison of the treatment groups with the untreated control group, RBC count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were significantly decreased in the diazinon and TBHQ+diazinon groups, while MCHC in the TBHQ group and MCV in the diazinon and TBHQ+diazinon groups were significantly increased. When the diazinon and TBHQ+diazinon groups were compared with the TBHQ group, RBC, Hb, Hct, and MCHC were significantly decreased whereas MCV was increased in both groups. Additionally, when comparing the TBHQ+diazinon group with the diazinon group, MCHC was determined to be significantly decreased. The results of the current experiments suggested that TBHQ could not efficiently protect blood cells against diazinon toxicity.

AB  - The excessive levels of aquatic endocrine disruptors (EDs) and namely heavy metals plus xenoestrogens account for irregular gas exchange processes, reduced reproductive success, as well as abnormal social interactions of marine teleost fish. These effects at the encephalic level appear to derive from the interference of major signaling factors such as histamine (HA) neuroreceptor subtypes (H1-4R). HA is one of the main biogenic amine neuronal system responsible for regulatory homeostatic functions, including sleep-wake rhythms and motor activities. Recently, interests have begun to focus attention on toxic effects of some heavy metals, i.e., cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and how they are capable of eliciting motor dysfunctions via HAergic receptor subtypes. Interestingly, subtype 2 (H2R) proved to be a preferential target of heavy metal-dependent altered locomotor maneuvers, as displayed by its specific antagonist (cimetidine)-inducing non-synchronous swimming activities (Santos et al., 2003, Pharmacol Biochem Behav 75:25-33). Conversely, although the preferential H3R antagonist (thioperamide) did not interfer with normal swimming behaviors, it surprisingly did ameliorate heavy metal-dependent hyperactive states (Giusi et al., 2008, Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 227:248-256). In the case of the xenoestrogens atrazine and endosulfan, their actions tend to mostly account for feeding alterations through hypothalamic H3R-dependent mechanisms. The aim of this review is to highlight the type of ED-HAergic neuroreceptor variations that are involved in stressor-dependent neurobehavioral responses of commercially valuable marine teleosts.

AB  - Blooms of Phaeocystis globosa have been reported accountable for massive fish mortality worldwide. The toxigenic mechanisms of P. globosa, however, remain largely unclear due to the multiple structures and/or synergistic or antagonistic effects of hemolytic compounds. External stressors could lead to the regulation of photoprotective or antioxidative defense system, as well as the potential hemolytic activity. Therefore, the light-induced photosynthetic system, including the accessory photosynthetic growth, the relative electron transfer rate (ETR), photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m), quantum yield of photosystem II (Yield), together with the hemolytic activity of P. globosa were investigated under variable environmental conditions in the present study. Results confirmed that hemolytic activity of P. globosa was initiated by the light, but inhibited by low temperature (16 degrees C), high light intensity (> 100 mu mol/(m(2)center dot s)), and iron-limited conditions. Interestingly, the hemolytic activity was not impacted by photosynthetic electron inhibitors (Diuron, atrazine, paraquat, and dibromothymoquinone), which significantly inhibited the photosynthetic activity of P. globosa. The correlated response of hemolytic and photosynthetic activity of P. globosa under those environmental factors suggested that the hemolytic compounds of P. globosa would be involved in the photosynthetic process but not in the electron transfer chain of P. globosa.

AB  - Photobacteriosis is a septicaemic bacterial disease affecting several marine species around the globe, resulting in significant economic losses. Although many studies have been performed related to the pathogen virulence and resistance factors, information regarding the host defence mechanisms activated once an infection takes place is still scarce. The present study was designed to understand innate immune responses of farmed juvenile gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) after Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) infection. Therefore, two groups of seabream juveniles were intraperitoneally injected with 100 mu L of PBS (placebo) or 100 mu L of exponentially growing Phdp (1 x 10(6) CFU/mL; infected). The blood, plasma, liver, and head kidney of six fish from each treatment were sampled immediately before infection and 3, 6, 9, 24 and 48 h after infection for the broad screening of fish immune and oxidative stress responses. Infected animals presented marked anaemia, neutrophilia and monocytosis, conditions that are correlated with an increased expression of genes related to inflammation and phagocytic activity. Similar studies with different fish species and bacteria can be useful for the definition of health biomarkers that might help fish farmers to prevent the occurrence of such diseases.

AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of deltamethrin on biomarkers and behavior of Palaemon serratus (common prawn), since this attempt to link different levels of biological organization will allow determining which biomarkers might be ecologically relevant and will be useful to complement the information about the effects of pesticides by using behavioral parameters. Therefore, parameters of liver antioxidant status, energy metabolism and neurotransmission were determined in different tissues of the common prawn and used to assess the effects at sub-individual level, whereas swimming velocity was used to assess the effects at the individual level. It was also investigated if the swimming velocity can be used as an endpoint in ecotoxicology bioassays and if it can be as sensitive as biomarker endpoints.
   Swimming velocity was significantly reduced in prawns exposed to deltamethrin, showing a lowest observed effect (LOEC) of 0.6 ng L-1. Eye acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was significantly increased in prawns exposed to 0.6, 1.2 and 2.4 ng L-1 deltamethrin, whereas muscle cholinesterase (ChE) activity was significantly increased in prawns exposed to 19 and 39 ng L-1. On the other hand, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was significantly increased in muscle of prawns exposed to 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 4.9 ng L-1 deltamethrin, showing that organisms were requiring additional energy, but probably using it for detoxification processes rather than locomotion, since swimming velocity was inhibited. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly increased in the digestive gland of common prawn exposed to 19 and 39 ng L-1 deltamethrin. Catalase (CAT) activity was significantly increased in digestive gland of prawn exposed to 19 ng L-1 deltamethrin. However, CAT activity decreased in digestive gland of prawn exposed to 39 ng L-1, suggesting an antioxidant defense system failure concomitant with high levels of lipid peroxidation. Thus, global results showed that decreased swimming velocity was not associated with cholinesterase inhibition. In fact, the impairment of swimming velocity may be due to allocation of energy for detoxification and antioxidant protection instead of swimming activity. The present study showed that swimming velocity could be used as an ecologically relevant tool and a sensitive endpoint to assess and complement the study of pesticide effects on marine organisms.

AB  - The present study aimed to ascertain the cytotoxicity of pesticides commonly used in rice cultivation, through in vitro assays employing the ZF-L cell line. The in vitro analyses investigated three cellular targets (cell membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity and lysosomal stability) in cells exposed to concentrations of Roundup Transorb (67.7 pg L-1, 135.4 pg L-1 and 270.8 pg L-1), Furadan 350 SC (0.1 gg L-1, 0.05 lig L-1 and 0.02 pg L-1). We also tested these products in combination. We analyzed the defensive capacity of the cells by measuring the activity of xenobiotic extruder proteins, as well as the expression of these same proteins. Cytotoxic effects of both pesticides were observed individually, as well as with the mixture of both products; including an inhibitory effect on the activity of xenobiotic extrusion. When exposed to the insecticide Furadan, and also the mixture of Furadan and Roundup, there was an increase in the expression of P glycoproteins (P-gps). There was also a negative correlation with cytotoxicity, mainly exhibited by mitochondrial activity and lysosomal integrity, but also with respect to the activity of P-gps. We observed that concentrations below those allowed by law were toxic regarding all parameters tested in this study, with the exception of mitochondrial function. Taken together, our results suggest that toxicity may be due to the surfactants present in the commercial formulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate population-related peculiarities of the adaptive responses of Carassius auratus gibelio. In order to do this, male specimens from polluted (B) and clean (Z) sites were exposed to commercial pesticides thiocarbamate Tatoo (9.1 mu g.L(-1)and 91 mu g.L-1) or tetrazine Apollo (2 mu g.L-1 and 10 mu g.L-1) during fourteen days. The control fish from site B was distinguished by weakness of antioxidant defence (measured from superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, redox index of glutathione (GSH), superoxide anion (O-2 center dot) and lipid peroxidation levels), imbalance of the concentrations of protein metallothionein (MT-SH) and MT-related metals (MT-Me) and neurotoxicity. Differences in glutathione-S-transferase activity in the liver and vitellogenin-like proteins in the serum were also showed between B and Z control groups. Common effects of pesticides were related to a decrease in GSH, an increase in O-2 center dot production, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity and hepatosomatic index. Apollo provoked particular elevation of MT-SH/MT-Me ratio. Population-related difference in the response was the activation of antioxidant defence in fish from site B and its inhibition in fish from site Z. The genotoxic effect of exposures was more expressed in fish from site B. Principal component analysis combine all exposed groups from site Z and control group from site B in one set, and separated each exposed group from site B. The main distinguishing index of each population selected by classification and regression tree analysis was MT-SH. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. nil fights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of the Neotropical freshwater fish matrinxa, Brecon amazonicus, exposed to Roundup Transorb degrees, a newer commercial formulation 50% stronger than the ordinary mixtures and with a new technology for quicker absorption and faster translocation. The median lethal concentration (96 h-LC50) was determined, and the effects of a sublethal concentration on oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated in the liver, gills, white muscle, and heart. During the acute toxicity test, fish mortality progressively increased with RT concentration along with behavioral abnormalities were detected. The calculated 96 h-LC50 value of RT was found as 1.21 mg/L. Fish exposed to 0.5 mg/L of RT (40% of 96 h-LC50) showed a significant increase in the hepatic somatic index (HSI) with a concomitant decrease in Fulton's condition factor (K). The sublethal exposure also induced significant increases (p < 0.05) in the hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, reduced glutathionc (GSH) content, and catalase (CAT) activity, with a concomitant decrease in the glutathionc S-tran.sferase (GST) activity. In the gills, RT exposure induced significant increases in the GST activity, GSH and LPO levels, whereas CAT activity was inhibited. RT also induced CAT and GST activities together with the content of GSH and LPO levels in the white muscle. On the other hand, significant decreases in the CAT and GST activities were detected in the heart with a marked increase in the GSH content and no changes in LPO levels. Therefore, the exposure to 0.5 mg/L of RT induced oxidative stress in the liver, gills and white muscle with tissue-specific responses related to antioxidant defenses. This study demonstrated that B. amazonicus is sensitive to Roundup Transorb (R) at sublethal and environmentally relevant concentrations, even at short-term exposures. The use of Roundup Transorb (R) should be carefully monitored due to its adverse non-target impacts.

AB  - The detection of ClO- is vital to comprehend the accurate effect of ClO- in various diseases and therapeutic interventions by fluorescent probe method. Herein, a special ratiometric probe DDD was designed and efficiently synthesized via a simple process for hypochlorite detection. The selectivity and sensitivity of probe DDD was excellent and the detection was not influenced by other reactive oxygen species. Probe DDD exhibited a fast response (<1 s), wide Stokes Shift (>100 nm), sensitive limit of detection (78 nM) and two well-separated emission (555 rim and 635 nm). The emission intensities ratio (I-555/I-635) was linearly enhanced (I-555/I-635 = 0.6273X - 1.9313) with the ClO- concentration range from 4.0 to 20.0 mu M. Furthermore, probe DDD has been successfully evaluated in monitoring exogenous HClO in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and zebrafish larvae with low cytotoxicity, good cell permeability and biocompatibility.

AB  - The present study reports concentrations and biomagnification potential of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) in species from the Barents Sea food web. The examined species included sea ice amphipod (Gammarus wilkitzkii), polar cod (Boreogadus saida), black guillemot (Cepphus grylle) and glaucous gull (Lai-us hyperboreus). These were analyzed for PFAS, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the predominant of the detected PFAS. Trophic levels and food web transfer of PFAS were determined using stable nitrogen isotopes (delta N-15). No correlation was found between PFOS concentrations and trophic level within species. However, a non-linear relationship was established when the entire food web was analyzed. Biomagnification factors displayed values >1 for perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), PFOS and Sigma PFAS(7). Multivariate analyses showed that the degree of trophic transfer of PFAS is similar to that of PCB, DDT and PBDE, despite their accumulation through different pathways. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: First Nations (FNs) populations in Canada experience a disproportionally higher rate of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to the general population. Recent data suggest that a high consumption of fish may help prevent T2D. On the other hand, fish might also be a potential source of environmental contaminants which could potentially be a risk factor for T2D.
   Objective: To investigate the potential associations between self-reported T2D and consumption of locally-harvested fish, dietary long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (n-3FAs) and persistent organic pollutants intake among adult FNs living on reserve in Ontario.
   Design: Data from the First Nations Food Nutrition and Environment Study, which included a cross-sectional study of 1429 Ontario FNs adults living in 18 communities across 4 ecozones in 2012 were analyzed. Social and lifestyle data were collected using household interviews. The consumption of locally-harvested fish was estimated using a traditional food frequency questionnaire along with portion size information obtained from 24hr recalls. Fish samples were analyzed for the presence of contaminants including dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Dietary intakes of DDE and PCBs were estimated using community-specific levels of DDE/PCBs in fish species. Multiple logistic regression models adjusted for potential covariates including age, gender, body mass index, physical activity, total energy intake, smoking, and education were developed.
   Results: The prevalence of T2D in Ontario FNs was 24.4%. A significant positive association between fish : consumption of one portion per week and more and T2D compared to no fish consumption was found (OR = 2.5 (95% CI: 1.38-4.58). Dietary DDE and PCBs intake was positively associated with T2D (OR = 1.09 (95%CI: 1.05-1.75) for DDE and OR = 1.07 (95%CI: 1.004-1.27) for PCBs) per unit increase in DDE/PCBs while n-3-FAs intake, adjusted for DDE/PCBs intake, showed an inverse effect against T2D among older individuals (OR = 0.86 (95% CI: 0.46-0.99).
   Conclusion: Our results support previous findings that exposure to DDE and PCBs may increase the risk of T2D. Elevated levels of contaminants in fish may counteract with potentially beneficial effects of n-3FAs from fish consumption. However, the overall health benefits of high consumption of fish with a high n-3 FAs content may outweigh the adverse effect of contaminants.

AB  - Increasingly, studies are revealing that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can alter animal behavior. Early life exposure to EDCs may permanently alter phenotypes through to adulthood. In addition, the effects of EDCs may not be isolated to a single generation - offspring may indirectly be impacted, via non-genetic processes. Here, we analyzed the effects of paternal atrazine exposure on behavioral traits (distance moved, exploration, bottom-dwelling time, latency to enter the top zone, and interaction with a mirror) and whole-brain mRNA of genes involved in the serotonergic system regulation (slc6a4a, slc6a4b, htr1Aa, htr1B, htr2B) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). F0 male zebraFIsh were exposed to atrazine at 0.3, 3 or 30 part per billion (ppb) during early juvenile development, the behavior of F1 progeny was tested at adulthood, and the effect of 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment on mRNA transcription was quantified. Paternal exposure to atrazine significantly reduced interactions with a mirror (a proxy for aggression) and altered the latency to enter the top zone of a tank in unexposed F1 offspring. Bottom-dwelling time (a proxy for anxiety) also appeared to be somewhat affected, and activity (distance moved) was reduced in the context of aggression. slc6a4a and htr1Aa mRNA transcript levels were found to correlate positively with anxiety levels in controls, but we found that this relationship was disrupted in the 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment group. Overall, paternal atrazine exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behavioral traits and showed signs of serotonergic system dysregulation, demonstrating intergenerational effects. Further research is needed to explore transgenerational effects on behavior and possible mechanisms underpinning behavioral effects.

AB  - Rare earth elements (REEs) are metallic elements with electronic, magnetic, optical and catalytic properties which make them essential in many industrial and medical fields. REEs are therefore becoming emerging pollutants and it is important to understand their implications for ecosystem health. However, little knowledge of REE bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms is available and especially on their internal distribution in fish. In the present study, REE organotropism was determined in Anguilla anguilla from the Loire estuary (France) by determining burdens in a wide set of tissues, organs and biological fluids. Differences have been observed between life stages and genders. For yellow eels, the most accumulating organ was the gills (126.90 +/- 50.78 mu g/kg dw) and for silver eels, it was the liver (181.78 +/- 62.04 mu g/kg dw for males; 203.79 +/- 111.86 mu g/kg dw for females). The comparison between female silver and yellow eels shown that female silver individuals accumulated significantly more REEs in the urinary system (US), muscles, gonads, spleen and liver, while yellow individuals accumulated more in gills. The comparison between male and female silver eels also highlighted differences, indeed the females accumulated significantly more REEs in the US, gonads, skin and spleen, compared to males which accumulated significantly more in muscles and gills. REEs abundances arc also different between organs, life stages and genders. The gonads of female silver eels exhibited a particular profile with the dominance of gadolinium (Gd) (up to 74.2% of Sigma REEs). Moreover, the presence of Anguillicola crassus in the swim bladder of organisms seemed to have an impact on REE bioaccumulation: parasitized yellow eels present higher concentrations of REEs in muscles, gills, gonads and liver than non-parasitized individuals. Regarding glass eels, REE contribution profiles in the whole body were close to those of yellow and silver eel skin. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study is aimed to evaluate the effect of sublethal exposure to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin, according to biometric parameters and important liver biomarkers in the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Fish were exposed for 4,15 and 30 days to deltamethrin mixed to the aquaria water at the concentrations of 0.08, 0.4 and 0.8 mu g/L. The exposure did not affect fish biometric parameters. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in liver (hepatopancreas) increased in fish exposed to the high concentration of pesticide only after 30 days when compared to controls. A significant increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) content (79.4% and 90.2% of control) was remarked after 15 and 30 days of exposure to the highest concentration of pesticide. Catalase activities (CAT) went up after 4 days of was to the concentration of 0.4 mu g/L and 0.8 mu g/L and at 15 days of exposure to 0.4 mu g/L. The most significant change of glutathione reductase (GR) activity was recorded at the fourth day, when GR activity was significantly increased after exposure to the concentrations of 0.4 mu g/L and 0.8 mu g/L of deltamethrin.

AB  - The present communication proposes a lumped kinetic and phenomenological model for glyphosate removal in synthetic agro-industrial wastewater using an electrocoagulation process (EC). A traditional filter press-cell electrochemical reactor is used for the EC experimental process. The outcomes of the current density, electrode material, and electrolysis process time were analyzed. The experimental results evidence a better removal performance for the aluminum than the carbon steel, and stationary removal conditions were reached at 40 min with a removal efficiency > 40% considering an input flow of 2 L min(-1 )and operational cost of 0.172 USD m(-3) at 7.5 mA cm(-2). The XRD analysis evidenced the interaction between the aluminum ion and the pesticide. The residual aluminum in the supernatant was < 10 mg L-1 at stationary removal conditions. The species distribution inside the reactor is described by the theoretical analysis, which takes into account the simultaneous solution of the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and kinetic-based mass conservation equation. Under full electrokinetic control (secondary current distribution), the electrode kinetics characterizing the flux generation of Al3+ on the anode is also taken into consideration. The model proposed here can explain the experimental COD removal attributed to the glyphosate concentration as a function of the aluminum dose due to the applied current density.

AB  - In the last decades, increased intakes of contaminants and the habitats' destruction have produced drastic changes in the aquatic ecosystems. The environmental contaminants can accumulate in aquatic organisms, leading to the distur-bance of the antioxidant/prooxidant balance in fish. In this context, we evaluated the level of organic, inorganic and microbiological pollutants in four leisure lakes (Chitila, Floreasca, Tei and Vacaresti) from Bucharest, the largest city of Romania, in order to compare their effects on hepatopancreas and gills metabolism and antioxidant defense

AB  - The adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to treated-effluent concentration of bisphenol A (BPA) or 17 beta-estradiol (E2) for 6 months to evaluate their effects on behavioral characteristics: motor behavior, aggression, group preference, novel tank test and light/dark preference. E2 exposure evidently dampened fish locomotor activity, while BPA exposure had no marked effect. Interestingly, BPA-exposed fish reduced their aggressive behavior compared with control or E2. Both BPA and E2 exposure induced a significant decrease in group preference, as well as a weaker adaptability to new environment, exhibiting lower latency to reach the top, more entries to the top, longer time spent in the top, fewer frequent freezing, and fewer erratic movements. Furthermore, the circadian rhythmicity of light/dark preference was altered by either BPA or E2 exposure. Our results suggest that chronic exposure of treated-effluent concentration BPA or E2 induced various behavioral anomalies in adult fish and enhanced ecological risk to wildlife.

TI  - Predicting black bass reproductive success from bull shoals reservoir hydrology
T2  - MULTIDIMENSIONAL APPROACHES TO RESERVOIR FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
CP  - 3rd National Reservoir Fisheries Symposium on Multidimensional Approaches to Reservoir Fisheries Management
AB  - Methods of predicting effects of changes in reservoir operations and water levels on in-pool fish populations are needed for inclusion of reservoir fisheries in multipurpose evaluations of water usage. We describe three methods for relating fish reproductive success in reservoirs to hydrology; responses of young black bass (Micropterus spp.) in Bull Shoals Reservoir, Arkansas, are used as an example. Reproductive success was quantified as biomass (kg/ha) in two length-classes of young largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, sported bass M. punctulatus, and smallmouth bass M. dolomieu from 34 years of August cove rotenone samples. In the first method, we derived hydrology variables from inflow, release, volume, mean area, change in area, and selected ratios of inflow to release or release to volume from time segments ranging from one season to 2 years before fish sampling in August. This segmented-temporal approach produced 36 hydrology variables, many of which were intercorrelated. Biomass of small and intermediate length-classes of black bass were regressed on all hydrology variables in simple-linear regression and on subsets of independent hydrology variables in multiple-linear regression. Although time consuming, this approach usually provided the best-fitting and most easily interpreted predictive models. In the second method, biomass was regressed on variables derived from principal components analysis of 14 segmented-temporal variables. Four components explained 91% of the variation in hydrology variables, but only the first two components (explaining 82%) could be readily interpreted and were significant in regression models. This method was fast and avoided intercorrelations, but interpretation of third and fourth principal components was difficult, and the method did not produce the best-fit models. In the third method, we fit cosine functions to monthly discharge of the unregulated White River (1920-1949) and to end-of-month area of Bull Shoals Reservoir (1955-1993). We derived eight independent variables related to amplitude, phase, differences in the phase of the reservoir from the preproject river, and error in fit of the harmonic function to reservoir hydrology. This harmonic approach provided a good explanation of variations in surface area (r(2) = 0.84; N = 465) and in largemouth bass and spotted bass biomass; however, it did not yield predictive models that were significantly better than the principal components method. All three methods are potentially useful for quantifying effects of operations and hydrology on reservoir fish populations for multiple-use assessments of water resources.

AB  - In the present study, we aimed at characterizing the effect of prochloraz, an imidazole fungicide, on the oocyte meiotic maturation process in a freshwater teleost species, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Full-grown post-vitellogenic ovarian follicles were incubated in vitro with prochloraz, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), or a combination of prochloraz and LH. The occurrence of oocyte maturation was assessed by monitoring germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) after 62-h in vitro incubation. Experiments were repeated in presence of actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or trilostane. The effect of prochloraz on the production of 17,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta P), the natural maturation-inducing steroid, was quantified by radioimmunoassay. In addition, the effect of prochloraz on ovarian expression of 12 genes was monitored by real-time PCR. Prochloraz (10(-5)M) administered alone was able to induce 100% GVBD in the most responsive females. The occurrence of GVBD observed after prochloraz stimulation of follicles originating from various females was similar and highly correlated with the occurrence of GVBD observed after stimulation with low LH concentration. In addition, oocyte maturation induced by LH or prochloraz was totally inhibited by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and trilostane. Similarly to LH, prochloraz was able to trigger 17,20 beta P production by the ovarian follicle. Finally, prochloraz induced the overexpression of genes participating in 17,20 beta P production, intercellular communication, and paracrine control of preovulatory follicular differentiation such as igf, igf2, connexin 43, and 20 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsbd20). Together, our results demonstrate that prochloraz administered alone is able to trigger oocyte maturation through the induction of specific genes, some of them being also triggered by LH. Finally, our results clearly indicate that the effects of prochloraz and LH on oocyte maturation are synergistic.

AB  - Background: Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have grown in usage since concerns about the health effects of the previously used polybrominated flame retardants led to their being phased out. The potential for OPFRs to cause adverse health effects of their own is still unexamined. Becaute of their structural similarities to organophosphate pesticides, which have themselves been heavily researched and shown to be neurobehavioral teratogens, we investigated the possibility that developmental exposure to two OPFRs, triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) might lead to behavioral impairment across the lifespan, as has been observed with the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos.
   Methods: Zebrafish were exposed to 0.03 or 03 mu M of TPHP, TDCIPP, or chlorpyrifos from 0 to 5 days post fertilization. Vehicle control consisted of 0.03% solution of DMSO. At 6 days post fertilization, larvae were tested on a locomotor assay. Separate cohorts of 6 day old larvae that were not tested on the larval assay were allowed to grow to adulthood. At 12 weeks post fertilization, these adult zebrafish were tested on a battery of behavioral assays that included tests of novel environment exploration, startle habituation, social affiliation, and predator escape.
   Results: Developmental exposure altered zebrafish behavior across the lifespan. Larval zebrafish exposed to the 0.03 mu M doses of chlorpyrifos or TDCIPP exhibited significant (p < 0.05) hyperactivity in the locomotor assay. Organophosphate exposure significantly (p < 0.05) altered the time course of adult zebrafish behavior in the novel environment, startle habituation, and social affiliation assays. Predator escape behavior was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in fish exposed to the 03 mu M dose of TDCIPP. Exposure also caused hyperactivity in adult fish, with fish exposed to the 03 mu M dose of TDCIPP exhibiting significantly (p < 0.05) elevated locomotor behavior in the novel environment assay.
   Discussion: Early developmental exposure to OPFRs produced behavioral impairment that persisted into adulthood. These findings support broader research investigating the role of organophosphate compounds, including the OPFRs used here, in developmental neurotoxicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Molecularly imprinted silica layers appended to quantum dots (MIP-QDs) with customized selective artificial recognition sites were fabricated in this study by optimizing the ratio of the functional monomer to the template. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunaueremmett-teller, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and selectivity assay analyses were also performed. Results demonstrated that the selective fluorescence quenching properties of MIP-QDs toward cypermethrin (CYP) are due to strong interactions between these molecules. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-like method based on the MIP-QDs was established under optimal conditions. The fluorescence quenching observed from this method showed a linear relationship with CYP concentration over the range of 0.05-60.0 mg/kg with a correlation coefficient of 0.9838. Good recovery (82.7-92.4%) and a relative standard deviation of less than 10.1% were obtained from fish samples spiked with three levels of CYP. This method also demonstrated a low detection limit of 1.2 mu g/kg. The ELISA-like method based on MIP-QDs can be successfully employed to detect residual of CYP in fish samples.

AB  - Recently, residual fungicides are generally recognized as relevant sources of aquatic environmental pollutants. However, the toxicological effects of these contaminants have not been adequately researched. In this study, the chronic effect of PCZ, a triazole-containing fungicide commonly present in aquatic environment, on GSH-related antioxidant system and oxidative stress indices of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were investigated. Fish were exposed at sub-lethal concentrations of PCZ (0.2, 50 and 500 mu g/L) for 7, 20 and 30 days. GSH levels and GSH-related enzyme activities, including GPx, GR and GST, were quantified in three tissues liver, gill and muscle. The levels of LPO and CP were also measured as makers of oxidative damage. In addition, the correlations of the measured parameters in various tissues were evaluated by using PCA. The results of this study indicate that chronic exposure of PCZ has resulted in different responses in various tissues and the gill was the most sensitive tissue; however, before these parameters are used as potential biomarkers for monitoring residual fungicides in aquatic environment, more detailed experiments in laboratory need to be performed in the future.

AB  - This review article provides a summary of the studies relying on oxidative stress biomarkers (lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes in particular) to investigate the effects of atrazine and terbuthylazine exposure in experimental animals and humans published since 2010. In general, experimental animals showed that atrazine and terbuthylazine exposure mostly affected their antioxidant defences and, to a lesser extent, lipid peroxidation, but the effects varied by the species, sex, age, herbicide concentration, and duration of exposure. Most of the studies involved aquatic organisms as useful and sensitive bio-indicators of environmental pollution and important part of the food chain. In laboratory mice and rats changes in oxidative stress markers were visible only with exposure to high doses of atrazine. Recently, our group reported that low-dose terbuthylazine could also induce oxidative stress in Wistar rats. It is evident that any experimental assessment of pesticide toxic effects should take into account a combination of several oxidative stress and antioxidant defence biomarkers in various tissues and cell compartments. The identified effects in experimental models should then be complemented and validated by epidemiological studies. This is important if we wish to understand the impact of pesticides on human health and to establish safe limits.

AB  - Difenoconazole is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002,(3) as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.(4)
   Difenoconazole was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 January 2009 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007 (hereinafter referred to as, the Regulation.). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as, the Commission.) in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.
   Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on difenoconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 22 December 2006. The peer review was initiated on 6 March 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier Syngenta Ltd. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that EFSA should conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology, environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on difenoconazole.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of difenoconazole as a fungicide on pome fruit, carrot, wheat, barley, triticale, rye and oats as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   No critical areas of concern were identified in the physical-chemical properties section. However, data gaps were identified for data to support the ranges of the cis/trans isomers in the technical specification, the biological activity of the isomers, the validation of the isomer method, the consequence for the physical-chemical properties of the active substance of the wide range of isomer content and the formulation's adhesion to seeds.
   No critical areas of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicology section. Two data gaps were identified: for an assessment of the toxicological relevance of some impurities; and to clarify the uncertainties related to the isomer ratio of the tested compound (for which reference values have been derived), the isomer ratio to which the workers will be exposed and the relative toxicity of the different isomers.
   Based on the metabolism studies conducted on four plant groups, the residue in plants was defined as difenoconazole for monitoring and provisionally as difenoconazole and TDM for risk assessment. Residue definitions were also proposed for animal products. No critical areas of concern were identified in the residue section. Data gaps were identified to provide information on the possible residues of TDM metabolites in primary crops, rotational crops, processed commodities and animal products. Additional residue trials and processing studies on carrots are also required. No acute or chronic intake concerns were identified for consumers, but this evaluation has to be considered provisional, since the contribution of the TDM metabolites and the isomeric composition of the residues were not taken into account.
   The data available on environmental fate and behaviour were generally sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at the EU level for the representative uses assessed. The potential for groundwater contamination consequent to these uses by difenoconazole and the metabolites 1,2,4-triazole and CGA 205375 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was assessed as low. However, data gaps were identified for identification of the metabolites V3 and M4 formed in soil incubation, and for the rate of dissipation of difenoconazole in the field under Southern European conditions. The assessment of the environmental behaviour and consequent exposure levels of individual enantiomers of difenoconazole was not finalised.
   Data gaps were identified in the ecotoxicology section. Further refinement of the risk to aquatic sediment-dwelling organisms for the use in cereals is necessary. Furthermore, the potential endocrine disruption effects in fish should be addressed. A data gap was also identified to demonstrate that the increase in body weight would not lead to adverse effects on earthworm populations in order to be able to use the reproduction NOEC from the reproduction study. Data gaps were identified to address the chronic risk to earthworms and Collembola. The possible impact on the ecotoxicity and the environment of potential enantio-selective biologically mediated metabolism/degradation or transformation needs to be addressed in order to the risk assessment for non-target organisms.

AB  - Fipronil is an important member of the phenylpyrazole group of insecticides and is widely used for various crops and vegetables to control insects, thereby exposing birds, animals, and humans to fipronil. Currently, there is limited information on the effects of fipronil exposure in Japanese quail. Therefore, our aim was to assess the reproductive toxicological effects of fipronil in the Japanese quail in a 15-day gavage study and then its recovery over a period of 60 days. Fipronil-administration led to significant losses in both feed intake and body weight. Whereas, the gonadosomatic index was not affected, and histological changes observed in the testes were reversible, particularly by day 45 and day 60 of recovery. Cloacal gland atrophy, reduced foam quantity and a reduction in fertility, sexual and aggressive behaviors, and serum testosterone with elevated estradiol (E2) hormone levels were also observed. All these changes gradually reversed during various recovery periods. Further, alterations in hepatic vitellogenin (Vtg) and estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) gene expression, assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, were also observed. Specifically, ER alpha 1 was induced after fipronil administration, while the Vtg transcript was elevated during both exposure and recovery periods. Our results showed that fipronil exposure has a profound negative influence on reproductive traits in the male Japanese quail and exhibits an estrogenic activity that can raise the incidence of infertility in males. Nevertheless, most of the changes could be reversed after a recovery period of 30-45 days. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Animals acquire new skills due to conditioned responses resulting from a sequence of neutral and unconditioned stimuli affecting their bodies; there is a constant time interval between the stimuli. Both stimuli become associated after a number of repetitions and animal bodies start to respond to the initially neutral stimulus as to the unconditioned one. The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure of fish to a pyrethroid-deltamethrin (an active ingredient in Decis 2.5 EC pesticide that disturbs the proper operation of the nervous system) affects the ability to learn in common carp.
   Materials and Methods. Production of new types of behaviour was triggered in fish by using the unconditioned stimulus (an irritating electric impulse) and the conditioned stimulus (light). The experiment was performed in a tank divided into two compartments where fish could swim freely from one compartment to another. The ability to learn was assessed on the basis of the following types of behaviour evoked in response to the conditioned stimulus: locomotor agitation, preference to occupy or avoid certain areas in the tank, an escape response, etc.
   Results. In fish exposed to 0.35 mu g . L-1 deltamethrin (for common carp concentration 10 times lower than lethal) for 35 min the ability to produce and remember the conditioned defence response was reduced and time interval since presenting the conditioned stimulus till occurring the initial signs of the conditioned response was prolonged.
   Conclusion. The classical conditioning method revealed that sublethal concentration of deltamethrin restricted ability to learn and retain information in common carp, despite absence of observable intoxication symptoms.

AB  - Diazinon is one of the insecticides that represent a high risk for Costa Rican estuarine environments due to its widespread use in pineapple plantations. In estuaries, organisms are frequently submitted to stress caused by natural factors (e.g., continuous changes in salinity levels) and, additionally, to stress due to contamination. Therefore, the driving question of this study was: will organisms be more susceptible to suffer the deleterious effects caused by diazinon because of the stress resulting from the salinity changes? The estuarine shrimp Penaeus vannamei was used as the model organism and two responses were measured: osmoregulation (the physiological effect after a forced and continuous 24 h-exposure) and avoidance [the behavioural effect after a short (3 h) non-forced, multi-compartmented exposure]. Juveniles were exposed to diazinon (0.1, 1, 10 and 100 mu g/L) at three different salinities (10, 20 and 30). Disruption in the capacity to regulate the haemolymph osmotic pressure was observed at a salinity of 30 in individuals exposed to diazinon and methanol (used as vehicle). At that salinity, the ability of shrimps to detect and avoid the highest diazinon concentrations was impaired. P. vannamei juveniles inhabit environments with a high variation in salinity, but with an optimum osmotic point close to a salinity of 20; therefore, the higher the salinity, the greater the vulnerability of shrimps to the effects of diazinon. From an ecological point of view, this combined effect of salinity and contamination might also limit the spatial distribution of the organisms.

AB  - Recent investigations have focused on the potential role of gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The 'dual-hit' hypothesis of PD speculates that a putative pathogen enters the brain via two routes: the olfactory system and the GI system. Here, we investigated (1) whether local exposures of the neurotoxin rotenone in the gut or the brain of mice could induce PD-like neurological and GI phenotypes as well as a characteristic neuropathology in accordance with this 'dualhit hypothesis' and (2) the effects of a diet containing uridine and fish oil providing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in both models. Mice were given rotenone either orally or by an injection in the striatum. Dietary interventions were started 1 week before rotenone exposures. We found that (1) both oral and intrastriatal administration of rotenone induced similar PD-like motor deficits, dopaminergic cell loss, delayed intestinal transit, inflammation, and alpha-synuclein accumulation in the colon; (2) the uridine and DHA containing diet prevented rotenone-induced motor and GI dysfunctions in both models. The models suggest possible bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain for the genesis of PD-like phenotype and pathology. The dietary intervention may provide benefits in the prevention of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD.

AB  - Strobilurins represent the most widely used class of fungicides nowadays andare considered relatively non-toxic to mammals and birds but highly toxic to aquatic biota. Dimoxystrobin is one of the novel strobilurins, recently included in the 3rd Watch List of the European Commission as available data indicate that it could pose a sig-nificant risk to aquatic species. As yet, the number of studies explicitly assessing the impact of this fungicide on terrestrial and aquatic species is extremely low, and the toxic effects of dimoxystrobin on fish have not been reported. Here we investigate for the first time the alterations induced by two environmentally relevant and very low concentrations of dimoxystrobin (6.56 and 13.13 mu g/L) in the fish gills. morphological, morphometric, ul-trastructural, and functional alterations have been evaluated using zebrafish as a model species. We demon-strated that even short-term exposure (96 h) to dimoxystrobin alters fish gills reducing the surface available for gas exchange and inducing severe alterations encompassing three reaction patterns: circulatory disturbance and both regressive and progressive changes. Furthermore, we revealed that this fungicide impairs the expression of key enzymes involved in osmotic and acid-base regulation (Na+/K+-ATPase and AQP3) and the defensive response against oxidative stress (SOD and CAT). The information presented here highlights the importance of combining data from different analytical methods for evaluating the toxic potential of currently used and new agrochemical compounds. Our results will also contribute to the discussion on the suitability of mandatory ecotoxicological tests on vertebrates before the introduction on the market of new compounds.

AB  - An emerging alternative to conventional animal models in toxicology research is the zebrafish. Their accelerated development, regenerative capacity, transparent physical appearance, ability to be genetically manipulated, and ease of housing and care make them feasible and efficient experimental models. Nonetheless, their most esteemed asset is their 70% (+) genetic similarity with the human genome, which allows the model to be used in a variety of clinically relevant studies. With these attributes, we propose the zebrafish is an excellent model for analyzing cognitive and neuromuscular responses when exposed to toxicants. Neurocognition can be readily analyzed using visual discrimination, memory and learning, and social behavior testing. Neuromuscular function can be analyzed using techniques such as the startle response, assessment of activity level, and evaluation of critical swimming speed. Furthermore, selectively mutated zebrafish is another novel application of this species in behavioral and pharmacological studies, which can be exploited in toxicological studies. There is a critical need in biomedical research to discover ethical and cost-effective methods to develop new products, including drugs. Through mutagenesis, zebrafish models have become key in meeting this need by advancing the field in numerous areas of biomedical research.

AB  - Bifenthrin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bifenthrin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 December 2005. The peer review was initiated on 01 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and on 12. May 2006 to the sole applicant, FMC Chemicals. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in February 2008. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in cereals, grape and pome fruit for the control of a broad range of foliar pests, sucking and biting insects, mites, aphids. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Talstar 8 Sc", a suspension concentrate(SC) containing 80 g/1 bifenthrin.
   Since clarification is required with respect to the proposed maximum levels of certain impurities in the technical material, the specification as a whole should currently be regarded as provisional. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor bifenthrin residues in food/feed of plant origin, soil and water, however data gaps were identified for residue methods in food/feed of animal origin air and body fluids and tissues.
   As for mammalian toxicity, bifenthrin is "Toxic if swallowed" (R 25), it is toxic by inhalation (R 23 "Toxic by inhalation" proposed). Bifenthrin is a skin sensitiser (R43 "May cause skin sensitisation by skin contact" proposed). It is not a skin or eye irritant.
   The main effect observed for repeated exposures is tremor and/or neurotoxic effects. The relevant short term toxicity NOAEL is 2.5 mg/kg bw/day in dogs whereas for long term exposures the NOAELs is 4.7 mg/kg bw/day in rats. Bifenthrin did not show any genotoxic potential. Due to the occurrence of bladder leiomyosarcomas/hemangiopericytomas in mice, as their relevance to humans could not be excluded and since the historical control data were not conclusive, R40 (Carc. Cat. 3) was proposed. In multigeneration studies the relevant maternal NOAEL is 3.0 mg/kg/day and the reproductive NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day, based on the occurrence of tremors and marginally lower body weight in the P and F1 generation females during gestation and lactation. Bifenthrin did not show any teratogenic potential (maternal NOAEL>7.4 mg/kg bw/day and developmental NOAEL >2 mg/kg bw/day). Bifenthrin did not show developmental neurotoxicity potential. The ADI is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog studz with an SF 100, supported by the developmental study in rats. The ARfD is 0.03 mg/kg bw based on the 90-day neurotoxicity study with a SF 100. The AOEL is 0.0075 mg/kg bw/day (SF 100 and correction factor of 50% for limited oral absorption). The operator, worker and bystander exposure showed levels below the AOEL.
   In metabolism studies on apples, cotton seed and corn plants bifenthrin was found to be the predominant residue. No significant cis-trans-isomerisation and translocation of residues through the plant were observed. Only for wheat/triticale and rye grown in Northern Europe sufficient residue trials have been submitted. Additional residue trial data are required to cover the notified use on n cereals in Northern and Southern Europe. On the basis of the available trials in cereals MRLs were only provisionally proposed. The representative uses in pome fruit and grapes are currently not supported by residue trials carried out according to the notified cGAP.
   For the use on cereals no processing studies are required. The requirement of such studies for the uses on pome fruit and grapes has to be evaluated once sufficient data on residue trails are available.
   Metabolism studies on rotational crops show that no significant residues are expected in parts of rotational crops intended for human consumption after application of bifenthrin on cereals according to the notified GAP.
   Metabolism studies on lactating goats and laying hens show that metabolism, mainly by oxidation, cleavage of the ester binding and conjugation, is more extensive in some of the compartments. The experts meeting decided to include metabolites in the provisional residue definition for risk assessment for liver and kidney and eggs respectively. On the basis of provisional dietary burden calculations for intake of cereal and straw only, significant up-take of residues is only expected for cattle.
   Taking into account the intake of cereals and of animal products only, consumer exposure is expected to be below the toxicological reference values. However, this risk assessment is only indicative and pending additional data for diverse areas of the residue section.
   In soil under aerobic conditions bifenthrin exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolite TFP acid(2) (accounting for up to 11.6% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits moderate persistence and the minor non transient metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin(3) (accounting for up to 8.3% AR) which exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation of both the cyclopropyl and phenyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 30-39% AR after 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink that accounted for 14-18 % AR after 90 days. Bifenthrin is immobile in soil, 4'-OH bifenthrin is expected to be immobile in soil though there is a data gap identified to confirm this and a data gap is identified for soil mobility data on TFP acid. There was no indication that adsorption of either bifenthrin or 4'-OH bifenthrin was pH dependent. TFP acid might be expected to exhibit pH dependent adsorption.
   In dark natural sediment water systems bifenthrin degraded exhibiting high persistence in sediment to the metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin in sediment (max 11.1% AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance from both the cyclopropyl and phenyl radiolabels accounting for a maximum of 3-27 % AR at 99 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues accounted for 6-14 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for bifenthrin at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4 for the applied for intended uses on cereals. For the metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin, appropriate FOCUS step 2 sediment calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. A data gap was identified for PEC in surface water for the major soil metabolite TFP acid that may runoff or drain to surface water. There is also a data gap identified for a further runoff mitigation assessment with respect to bifenthrin in the FOCUS runoff scenarios.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses on cereals by bifenthrin and 4'-OH bifenthrin above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However for the metabolite TFP acid, data gaps are identified for the information required to further assess groundwater exposure potential. Contamination of groundwater above the 0.1 mu g/L limit by TFP acid might be expected in at least some, if not all FOCUS groundwater scenarios if all the necessary data to complete exposure simulations were available. Thus it is expected that a non relevance assessment will be necessary for TFP acid. Such an assessment that could be considered by the peer review is not available. Satisfactory environmental exposure assessments are not available for the applied for intended uses on grapes and pome fruit.
   A low risk was indicated in the first-tier risks assessment for birds and mammals for all the evaluated uses except for the long-term risk to insectivorous birds and for the acute risk to mammals in orchards. A potential high long-term risk from the exposure of bifenthrin to mammals was identified for all the intended uses. A data gap was identified for the applicant to refine the long-term risk for mammals for all the intended uses. A new data gap was identified after the PRAPeR meeting by EFSA, for the applicant to refine the long-term risk to insectivorous birds and the acute risk to mammals in orchards. The risk of bifenthrin to earthworm-eating birds was considered to be low in cereals. A potential risk was identified for earthworm-eating mammals in cereals and a refinement of the risk was required. The risk assessment for fish eating birds and mammals should be re-estimated when the revised BCF would become available. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals was however considered to be low.
   The first tier risk assessment indicated a potential high acute and long-term risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The estimated TER values based on the FOCUS PECsw step 4 (20-25 m non-spray buffer zone) were below the Annex VI trigger values. Two higher tier studies were available to refine the assessment for invertebrates. From the mesocosm study a NOAEC of 0.015 mu g a.s./L was derived. It was proposed to apply an assessment factor of 3 to this value to cover variation in potential for recovery depending on the nature of the ecosystem. The higher tier risk assessment resulted in a TERit=3 based on the NOAEC from the mesocosm and initial FOCUS PECaw, Step 4 with 20 m no spray buffer zones in cereals. No safe use was identified for fish when applying the maximum 25m no spray-buffer zone. Due to the logP(OW) of 7.3 for bifenthrin the potential to bioconcentrate was considered to be high. The experts agreed that the potential for bifenthrin to accumulate in aquatic organisms needs to be further addressed. Two data gaps were identified during the experts meeting, The first one was for the submission of a refined risk assessment for fish and the second for the submission of the ecotoxicological studies with the TFP acid since there is the potential for exposure to this metabolite in water bodies associated with treated crops.
   The experts concluded that a high risk was identified for bifenthrin to bees for all the evaluated uses. Risk mitigation measures were identified as being necessary. It could be concluded from the available information that there is a high risk to non-target arthropods (NTA) for in-field and off-filed areas within the treated area from the use in cereals. Risk mitigation measures are required to refine the risk to NTA in the off-field areas. A non-spray buffer zone of 5 m was identified as being necessary for cereals. A data gap was identified for the applicant to refine the risk to non-target arthropods. The acute risk assessment of bifenthrin and TFP acid to earthworms was assessed as low in cereals. However, the long-term risk to earthworms in cereals from exposure to both these compounds was considered to be potential high, and needed to be further addressed. A litterbag study (Walker H. 2005) was included in the dossier and this study did not show any effects of bifenthrin to the litter bag decomposition. Member State experts at the PRAPeR 52 meeting agreed that for pyrethroid compounds, the litter bag study does not cover the potential for there being a risk for soil macro organisms. A data gap was identified to the applicant to address the risk to non-target soil macro organisms. The risk to non-target plants needs to be addressed. The risk to micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for all the applied for representative uses evaluated.

AB  - Aquatic organisms are concomitantly exposed to multiple noxious chemicals that can be discharged into water bodies. We aimed to investigate the single and simultaneous sub-acute exposure to copper and methomyl on juvenile Oreochromis niloticus. Compared to the controls, the outcomes revealed that brain of methomyl-exposed fish displayed significant declines in the activities of SOD, CAT, and GST in addition to higher MDA and lower GSH levels. Methomyl induced notable declines in levels of GABA and acetylcholine esterase in brain and muscle of exposed fish. Noteworthy downregulated gene expression levels of TNF-??, HSP-70 together with upregulated c-fos were evident in brain of fish expose to either of tested compounds. Marked apoptotic changes were observed in fish brain exposed to copper and methomyl indicated by augmented immune expression of caspase-3. Conclusively, the results indicated the possible interaction between both compounds with subsequent toxic ef-fects that differ from their single exposure.

AB  - Deltamethrin (DLM) is a synthetic pyrethroid used for agricultural purposes to control insects and has been found to pollute the aquatic environment and leads to serious health problems. Lactobacillus plantarum L-137 (L-137) has gained more popularity as functional supplement for its immunomodulatory effects and antioxidant potential. This study was designed to examine the potential of L-137 on liver function, histopathology, immune and antioxidant related gene expressions in Nile tilapia exposed to subacute DLM for 30 days. Fish (mean weight of 28.18 +/- 1.34 g) was distributed into four groups (triplicates): the first and second groups fed the control diet, while the third and fourth groups fed L-137 at 50 mg/kg and the second and fourth groups were exposed to DLM (15 ig/L) in rearing water (control, DLM, L-137 and DLM + L-137, respectively). DLM-treated fish groups showed a significant increase in blood biochemical parameters (creatinine, urea and bilirubin) as well as hepatic enzymes (ALP, AST and ALT) (P < 0.05). Blood total protein, globulin, albumin, WBCs, RBCs, Hb, phagocytic index, phagocytic and lysozyme activities were significantly decreased in fish exposed to DLM (P < 0.05). Additionally, DLM toxicity downregulated the transcription of immune genes (IL-1 beta and IL-8), while upregulated the stress related genes (HSP70 and CASP3). The histopathological images of Nile tilapia exposed to DLM revealed damage in gills, intestine, spleen and liver which confirmed the toxic effects. Conversely, L-137 presented protective effects and restored the aforementioned parameters when fish exposed to DLM and fed L-137. Further, L-137 restored the antioxidative capacity (CAT and GPx). Thus, L-137 supplementation exhibited defensive effects against DLM toxicity in Nile tilapia through improving blood biochemical responses, immune, and antioxidant related gene expressions as well as histopathological effects.

AB  - The neonicotinoids, the newest major class of insecticides, have outstanding potency and systemic action for crop protection against piercing- sucking pests, and they are highly effective for flea control on cats and dogs. Their common names are acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam. They generally have low toxicity to mammals (acute and chronic), birds, and fish. Biotransformations involve some activation reactions but largely detoxification mechanisms. In contrast to nicotine, epibatidine, and other ammonium or iminium nicotinoids, which are mostly protonated at physiological pH, the neonicotinoids, are not protonated and have an electronegative nitro or cyano pharmacophore. Agonist recognition by the nicotinic receptor involves cation-pi interaction for nicotinoids in mammals and possibly a cationic subsite for interaction with the nitro or cyano substituent of neonicotinoids in insects. The low affinity of neonicotinoids for vertebrate relative to insect nicotinic receptors is a major factor in their favorable toxicological profile.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sublethal effects of the beta-cypermethrin on calling behavior and fecundity of a major fruit-boring pest of apple, Carposina sasakii Matsumura. The mating rate, fertility (total number of eggs laid per female), and adult longevity of adults were remarkably decreased as compared with that in control when the adults were exposed to 10% lethal concentrations (LC10) of beta-cypermethrin (LC10 female x LC10 male), and the age-specific survival rate (l(x)) was also negatively affected by sublethal beta-cypermethrin especially for the LC10 female x LC10 male, mating combination. However, the age-specific fecundity (m(x)) was stimulated particularly in the combination of CK female x LC10 male,. Furthermore, the oviposition period was prolonged and the number of eggs was significantly increased for combinations of CK female x LC10 male, and LC10 female x CK male. In the mating experiments, males in control or LC10-beta-cypermethrin treatments preferred to mate with females in control. It might be because of lower calling rate of female survivors treated with sublethal beta-cypermethrin. Our data indicate that treatment of beta-cypermethrin had a sublethal effect on the development and production of C. sasakii, and their mating behavior changes in surviving adults that may contribute to assortative mating.

AB  - Herbicides and their metabolites are often detected in water bodies where they may cause adverse effects to non-target organisms. Their effects at environmentally relevant concentrations are often unclear, especially concerning mixtures of pesticides. This study thus investigated the impacts of one of the most used herbicides: S-metolachlor and its two metabolites, metolachlor oxanilic acid (MOA) and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (MESA) on the development of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to the individual substances and their environmentally relevant mixture until 120 hpf (hours post-fertilization). The focus was set on sublethal endpoints such as malformations, hatching success, length of fish larvae, spontaneous movements, heart rate and locomotion. Moreover, expression levels of eight genes linked to the thyroid system disruption, oxidative stress defense, mitochondrial metabolism, regulation of cell cycle and retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway were analyzed. Exposure to S-metolachlor (1 mu g/L) and the pesticide mixture (1 mu g/L of each substance) significantly reduced spontaneous tail movements of 21 hpf embryos. Few rare developmental malformations were observed, but only in larvae exposed to more than 100 mu g/L of individual substances (craniofacial deformation, non-inflated gas bladder, yolk sac malabsorption) and to 30 mu g/L of each substance in the pesticide mixture (spine deformation). No effect on hatching success, length of larvae, heart rate or larvae locomotion were found. Strong responses were detected at the molecular level including induction of p53 gene regulating the cell cycle (the pesticide mixture - 1 mu g/L of each substance; MESA 30 mu g/L; and MOA 100 mu g/L), as induction of cyp26a1 gene encoding cytochrome P450 (pesticide mixture - 1 mu g/L of each substance). Genes implicated in the thyroid system regulation (dio2, thra, thrb) were all overexpressed by the environmentally relevant concentrations of the pesticide mixture (1 mu g/L of each substance) and MESA metabolite (1 mu g/L). Zebrafish thyroid system disruption was revealed by the overexpressed genes, as well as by some related developmental malformations (mainly gas bladder and yolk sac abnormalities), and reduced spontaneous tail movements. Thus, the thyroid system disruption represents a likely hypothesis behind the effects caused by the low environmental concentrations of S-metolachlor, its two metabolites and their mixture.

AB  - Bifenthrin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023 as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the European Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the European Commission.
   France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bifenthrin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 December 2005. The peer review was initiated on 1 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and on 12 May 2006 to the sole applicant FMC Chemicals. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in February 2008. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June -July 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 30 September 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 186).
   Following the Commission Decision of 30 November 2009 (2009/887/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of bifenthrin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant FMC Chemicals made a resubmission application for the inclusion of bifenthrin in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/125/08) as follows:
   The fate and behaviour in soil and water, due to the possible presence of major soil metabolites, the relevance of which must be determined and, if necessary, further assessed. As a consequence, the risk to groundwater, could not be finalised;
   The risk to aquatic organisms which, with the exception of invertebrates and algae, does not generate an acceptable use;
   The risk to several species of mammals, non-target arthropods, non-target plants and nontarget soil macro-organisms.
   and concerns were identified with regard to:
   The risk to consumers, which may be underestimated, given the data gaps identified in the residue section, and the possible impact of the different isomers constituting bifenthrin;
   The potential for contamination of groundwater by the major soil metabolite TFP acid;. The unacceptable high risk to aquatic vertebrates;
   The long term risk to mammals;
   The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm-eating mammals;
   The risk from bioaccumulation through the aquatic food chain which is not finalised;
   The risk to non-target arthropods (in-field), non-target plants and non-target soil macroorganisms which remains inconclusive.
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, France, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 6 August 2010.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 10 August 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 23 September 2010.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the European Commission requested the EFSA to deliver its conclusions on bifenthrin.
   The conclusion of the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide, which comprise of foliar spraying in cereals, grape and pome fruit for the control of a broad range of foliar pests, sucking and biting insects, mites, aphids. Full details of the GAP can be found in Appendix A. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of bifenthrin as an insecticide on cereals, ornamentals and head cabbage, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Talstar 8 SC', a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 80 g/l bifenthrin.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor bifenthrin residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin, in the environmental matrices and in body fluids and tissues.
   As for mammalian toxicity, bifenthrin is "Toxic if swallowed" (R25), it is toxic by inhalation (R23 "Toxic by inhalation" proposed). Bifenthrin is a skin sensitiser (R43 "May cause skin sensitisation by skin contact" proposed). It is not a skin or eye irritant.
   The main effect observed for repeated exposures is tremor and/or neurotoxic effects. The relevant short-term toxicity NOAEL is 2.5 mg/kg bw/day in dogs whereas for long-term exposures the NOAELs is 4.7 mg/kg bw/day in rats. Bifenthrin did not show any genotoxic potential. Due to the occurrence of bladder leiomyosarcomas/hemangiopericytomas in mice and as their relevance to humans could not be excluded, and the historical control data were not conclusive, R40 (Carc. Cat. 3) was proposed.
   In multigeneration studies the relevant maternal NOAEL is 3.0 mg/kg bw/day and the reproductive NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day, based on the occurrence of tremors and marginally lower body weight in the P and F1 generation females during gestation and lactation. Bifenthrin did not show any teratogenic potential (maternal NOAEL> 7.4 mg/kg bw/day and developmental NOAEL >2 mg/kg bw/day). Bifenthrin did not show developmental neurotoxicity potential. The ADI is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study with a SF of 100, supported by the developmental study in rats. The ARfD is 0.03 mg/kg bw based on the 90-day neurotoxicity study with a SF of 100. The AOEL is 0.0075 mg/kg bw/day (SF 100 and correction factor of 50% for limited oral absorption). The operator, worker and bystander exposure showed levels below the AOEL.
   In the metabolism studies on apples (fruit crops), cotton seed (pulses and oilseeds) and maize plants (cereals) bifenthrin was found to be the predominant compound of the total residues. No significant cis-trans isomerisation and translocation of residues through the plant were observed. The proposed global residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in plant commodities is bifenthrin (sum of isomers). Complete residue database were provided to support the representative uses on cereals (wheat, triticale, rye, barley and oat) for both Northern and Southern Europe and to propose MRLs while 4 additional residue trials are required on head cabbage (Northern Europe). The nature of the residues in processed commodities was sufficiently addressed for pasteurisation and baking, brewing and boiling but not for sterilisation. A data gap was identified to require a new hydrolysis study simulating the conditions of sterilisation to determine the nature of the residues in processed commodities. Based on the metabolism studies in ruminants and poultry, the proposed residue definition for monitoring for animal commodities is bifenthrin (sum of isomers). For risk assessment, the residue definition proposals are as follows:
   -ruminant liver and kidney: sum of bifenthrin (sum of isomers) and BP-acid, expressed as bifenthrin (conversion factor of 2 for monitoring to risk assessment);
   -eggs, poultry liver: sum of bifenthrin (sum of isomers) and hydroxyl-methyl bifenthrin and its fatty acid conjugates, expressed as bifenthrin (conversion factor of 2 for monitoring to risk assessment);
   -for milk and all other animal products: bifenthrin (sum of isomers).
   The storage time interval of the samples from the residue trials on cereals and head cabbage and of the animal tissues from the feeding studies can be considered as covered by the available storage stability data. Under normal agricultural practices, bifenthrin residue levels in the edible parts of the rotational crops intended for human consumption and as feed items are expected to be below 0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively. No chronic and acute intake concerns were identified according to EFSA PRIMo rev. 2A model. The consumer risk assessment should be regarded as provisional pending the submission of the additional residue trials on head cabbage. The potential for a different degradation of bifenthrin enantiomers in plant and animal commodities was considered as sufficiently addressed since the S/R enantiomeric ratio of the parent bifenthrin was shown to remain unchanged (S/R ratio: 1/1) both in cereals and head cabbage samples from the residue trials and in fat samples from the rat. Based on the available residue datasets an MRL of 0.05 mg/kg is proposed for wheat, triticale and rye grain and a MRL of 0.1 mg/kg is set for barley and oat grain. A provisional MRL of 0.3 mg/kg is proposed for head cabbage. MRLs were also defined for animal matrices.
   In soil under aerobic conditions bifenthrin exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolite TFP acid (accounting for up to 11.6% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence and the minor non-transient metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin (accounting for up to 8.3% AR) which exhibits moderate persistence. Mineralisation of both the cyclopropyl and phenyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 30-39% AR after 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink that accounted for 14-18 % AR after 90 days. Bifenthrin is immobile in soil, 4'-OH bifenthrin is expected to be immobile in soil though there was a data gap identified to confirm this. Metabolite TFP acid exhibited very high to medium mobility. There was no indication that adsorption of either bifenthrin or 4'-OH bifenthrin was pH dependent, whereas TFP acid exhibited pH dependent adsorption.
   In dark natural sediment water systems bifenthrin degraded exhibiting high persistence in sediment to the metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin in sediment (max. 11.1% AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance from both the cyclopropyl and phenyl radiolabels accounting for a maximum of 3-27 % AR at 99 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues accounted for 6-14 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for bifenthrin at steps 1-4, with spray drift and run-off mitigation being applied at step 4 for the applied for representative uses on cereals and head cabbage. For the metabolite TFP acid and additionally for the 4'-OH bifenthrin, appropriate FOCUS step 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. Regarding the outdoor uses on ornamentals, a data gap was identified for exposure estimations for surface water and sediment.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses on cereals and head cabbage by bifenthrin, TFP acid and 4'-OH bifenthrin above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by the relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The potential for groundwater exposure from the uses on ornamentals was accepted to be covered by the estimations available for cereals.
   Since bifenthrin and its two metabolites relevant for the environment consist of 2 enantiomers and because only limited information on the behaviour of the enantiomers of bifenthrin in the environment was available, a data gap regarding this issue remained.
   Low acute, short-term and long-term risks were indicated with the first-tier risk assessment for birds and a low acute risk was indicated for mammals for the outdoor representative uses. A potential high long-term risk to mammals was identified with the first tier for outdoor representative uses; however, the risk was assessed as low with a subsequent assessment based on the Guidance Document on Birds and Mammals (EFSA, 2009). The risk of bifenthrin to earthworm-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low for the outdoor representative uses, based on PECsoil plateau of 0.027 mg/kg. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals was considered to be low based on the BCF value for fish of 1709.
   Since bifenthrin has a potential for biomagnification i.e. potential for accumulation observed in a metabolism study on rat and estimated biomagnification factor (BAF)>1, a food chain modelling has been carried out. However, the experts at the PRAPeR 87 experts' meeting identified several uncertainties in the model assumptions and parameterization and therefore they concluded that a high risk from biomagnification in the terrestrial food chain cannot be excluded. Therefore the experts agreed to identify a data gap for the applicant to further address this risk.
   The risk to birds and mammals for the indoor representative use in ornamentals is low since no exposure is expected.
   The first tier risk assessment indicated a potential high acute and long-term risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The estimated TER values, based on the FOCUS PECsw step 4 (20-25 m no-spray buffer zones and run-off reduction) and higher tier toxicity end points, were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating a low risk. To fulfil the data gap identified during the PRAPeR 53 to further address the risk from bioaccumulation through the food chain, a biomagnification modelling has been carried out and provided in the Additional Report. This modelling has been discussed at the PRAPeR 87. The experts agreed that a high risk from bioaccumulation through the food chain for aquatic organisms could not be excluded on the basis of the available data. Therefore, a data gap was identified to further address the risk from biomagnification in the aquatic food chain and to address the uncertainties raised.
   The experts concluded that a high risk was identified for bifenthrin to bees for all the outdoor representative uses. Risk mitigation measures should be applied to avoid the exposure of bees and effects from residual toxicity (by considering an appropriate interval between the last application and flowering).
   It could be concluded from the available information that there is a high risk to non-target arthropods for in-field and off-field areas within the treated area from the outdoor representative uses. Risk mitigation measures are required to reduce the exposure of non-target arthropods in the off-field areas. A data gap was identified for the applicant to provide further data to address the residual toxicity of bifenthrin to non-target arthropods and the potential for recovery/recolonisation.
   The acute and long-term risk of bifenthrin and TFP acid to earthworms was assessed as low.
   The risk to soil macro-organisms, micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for all the representative uses evaluated.

AB  - The protective role of beta-glucan (BG) on liver function, histopathology, immune and antioxidant related gene expressions in Nile tilapia exposed to subacute deltamethrin (DLM) was investigated for 30 days. Fish (28.18 +/- 1.34 g) of the 1st and 2nd groups fed the control diet, while the 3rd and 4th groups fed BG at 0.5 g/kg and the 2nd and 4th groups were exposed to DLM (15 mu g/L) in rearing water. DLM-treated fish displayed a considerable increase in blood biochemical parameters (creatinine, urea and bilirubin) as well as hepatic enzymes (ALP, AST and ALT) (P < 0.05). Blood total protein, globulin, albumin, WBCs, RBCs, Hb, phagocytic index, phagocytic and lysozyme activities were significantly decreased in fish subjected to DLM (P < 0.05). Fish fed BG showed significantly the lowest cortisol and glucose levels, while fish exposed to DLM without feeding BG showed the highest cortisol and glucose levels (P < 0.05) after 15 and 30 days. Additionally, DLM toxicity caused downregulation in antioxidant (CAT and GP(x)) and immune (IL-1 beta and IL-8) related gene expressions, while and IFN-gamma, HSP70 and CASP3 were upregulated. The histopathological examination of Nile tilapia exposed to DLM revealed damage in gills, intestine, spleen and liver which confirmed the toxic effects. Conversely, BG presented protective effects and restored the above-mentioned parameters when fish exposed to DLM and fed BG. Thus, BG supplementation exhibited defensive effects against DLM toxicity in Nile tilapia through improving blood biochemical responses, immune, and antioxidant related gene expressions as well as histopathological effects.

AB  - The neonicotinoid imidacloprid is a widely used insecticide worldwide. We assessed the effects of acute and chronic imidacloprid exposure on the social behavior of adult zebrafish. We assembled simple apparatus to detect 2D locomotion: a single camera capture system and two specially designed water tanks. We then used the tracking and heat maps of the behavior trajectories of zebrafish subjected to sham and imidacloprid exposure and compared their social behavior. Furthermore, histomorphology and immunohistochemistry of their brain tissue sections were performed to clarify possible neurotoxicity due to imidacloprid exposure in our adult zebrafish. Our results showed that imidacloprid exposure significantly reduced the zebrafish's swimming speed, distance traveled, acceleration, and deceleration. The longer the imidacloprid exposure, the more severe the locomotor behavior disability. Furthermore, imidacloprid exposure significantly reduced heterosexual attractive behavior between the different sexes, as well as defensive alert behavior among males. Our histomorphology and immunohistochemistry evidence showed imidacloprid exposure may lead to neuronal oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and damage in the telencephalon of adult zebrafish. Thus, we suggested that neonicotinoid imidacloprid exposure can damage the telencephalon neurons of adult zebrafish through oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis and then affect the social behavior of adult zebrafish.

AB  - Aquatic environments are constantly exposed to a cocktail of contaminants mainly due to human activities. As polluted ecosystems may simultaneously present other multiple natural stressors, the objective of the present study was to evaluate joint effect of stressors (natural and anthropogenic) on life history traits of the Neotropical cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia silvestrii. For this purpose, the effects of water conditioned with predator kairomones (fish) and environmental concentrations (sublethal) of two pesticides widely used in sugarcane monoculture in Brazil, the insecticide Regent(R)800 WG (active ingredient-a.i. fipronil) and the herbicide DMA(R)806 BR (a.i. 2,4-D) were evaluated using chronic toxicity testing, isolated and in mixture, for this cladoceran species. The environmental risks of pesticides for tropical freshwater biota were also estimated from the risk quotient MEC/PNEC. Among the characteristics of the life history of C. silvestrii evaluated after 8 days of exposure, compared with the mean value of control, the age of primiparous females was not affected by any evaluated treatment. However, species average survival decreased in the treatment of kairomones mixed with fipronil (FK) and in the treatment with a mixture of fipronil, 2,4-D, and kairomones (MFKD). The body length of maternal females was shorter than in the control after exposure in treatments with only kairomones (K) and FK. Fecundity of this cladoceran was reduced when exposed to FK and MFKD treatments, and the intrinsic rate of population increase significantly decreased for organisms exposed to treatment with fipronil (F) and to mixtures of fipronil and 2,4-D (MFD), MFDK, and FK. The results indicated that the combination of anthropogenic and natural stressors causes changes inC. silvestriilife history traits, which can contribute to the decline in populations, and our preliminary risk assessment results are a matter of concern regarding biota conservation.

AB  - Simple Summary
   We identified the sequence encoding galectin-9 from Pagrus major and subsequently investigated the molecular characteristics and changes in gene expression patterns in response to artificial infection with major pathogens. Overall, our data suggest that galectin-9 plays a pivotal role in the immune system of P. major. The findings of this study can potentially serve as a reference for understanding the function of galectin-9 in the P. major immune system; moreover, galectin-9 has been identified as a potential candidate for use as a disease-related molecular marker.
   Galectin (Gal) is a member of a family of beta-galactoside-binding lectin. The members of this family play important roles in the recognition of carbohydrate ligands and in various other biological processes. In this study, we identified the gene encoding Gal-9 in Pagrus major (PmGal-9) and analyzed its expression in various tissues after pathogen challenge. Alignment analysis revealed that the two galactose-binding lectin domains of the deduced protein were highly conserved among all the teleosts. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PmGal-9 is most closely related to the Gal-9 gene of gilthead sea bream. PmGal-9 was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues analyzed but was predominantly expressed in the spleen, head kidney, and intestine. After challenges with major microbial pathogens (Edwardsiella piscicida, Streptococcus iniae, or red sea bream iridovirus) of red sea bream, PmGal-9 mRNA expression was significantly regulated in most immune-related tissues. These results suggested that PmGal-9 not only plays an important role in the immune system of red sea bream but is also a possible inflammatory marker for pathogenic diseases.

AB  - MicroRNA (miRNA) can regulate the expression of its target gene by mediating mRNA cleavage or by translational repression at a post-transcriptional level. Usually, one miRNA may regulate many genes as its targets, while one gene may also be targeted by many miRNAs. We previously demonstrated that cyb561d2, whose protein product is involved in cell defense, and chemical stress, is targeted by miR-155 in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) when exposed to fipronil (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl) sulphinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile). Microcosm Targets prediction showed that the cyb561d2 gene is also highly possibly targeted by miR194a, miR-216b, miR-429, and miR-499. These interactions need to be further validated experimentally. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR-194a, miR-216b, miR-429, miR-499 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish and investigated whether these four miRNAs could regulate the expression of cyb561d2 in both mRNA and protein levels. The expression of cyb561d2 was upregulated in both mRNA and protein level in a dose-dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil, and miR-216b and miR-499 were downregulated concurrently, whereas there was no significant changes were observed in the expression level of miR194a and miR-429. The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR-216b and miR-499 interacted with cyb561d2 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR), miR-194a and miR-429 did not stimulate degradation of cyb561d2 mRNA. The expression of cyb561d2 was reduced in both mRNA and protein level when ZF4 cells were transfected with miR-499 mimic, whereas expression level of both mRNA and protein was increased when endogenous miR-499 was inhibited by transfection with miR-499 inhibitor. Likewise, the mRNA and protein level of cyb561d2 was affected by treatment with the mimics and the inhibitor of miR-216b. In contrast, when ZF4 cells were transfected with a mimic of miR-194a or miR-429, the expression of cyb561d2 mRNA was not significantly changed. As a result, cyb561d2 is targeted by miR-155, miR-216b and miR-499 upon fipronil exposure, and miR-194a and miR-429 can not target cyb561d2. The expression pattern of these 3 miRNAs presents novel fipronil responses that could be used as a toxicological biomarker. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are multifunctional phase II detoxification enzymes with primary function of glutathione conjugation of various endogenous and exogenous compounds. Teleost-specific Gstr1 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) was previously shown to have high expression in toxicologically relevant tissues and high activity towards model substrates. The aim of this study was a detailed functional characterization of zebrafish Gstr1. Molecular docking analyses were used to get novel insight into structural characteristics of Gstr1 and elucidation of the mechanistic interactions with both GSH and various Gstr1 substrates or inhibitors. An initial screening inhibition assay performed using model fluorescence substrate monochlorobimane (MCB) revealed interactions of different endogenous compounds and environmentally relevant xenobiotics with zebrafish Gstr1. All interacting compounds were further analyzed to determine their inhibition type and K-i values. Our data revealed that pregnenolone, progesterone, testosterone, DHEAS and corticosterone competitively inhibited transformation of MCB by Gstr1 with the calculated K-i values in the range 14-26 mu M, implying that these hormones are physiological substrates of zebrafish Gstr1. Estrogens had no effect on Gstr1 activity. Taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC) expressed lower inhibition potency toward Gstr1 with the K-i value of 33 mu M. Among tested xenobiotics tributyltin chloride and rifampicin non-enzymatically bound Gstr1 enzyme (the calculated K-i values are 0.26 mu M and 65 mu M, respectively) and inhibited its activity, showing that these compounds are reversible noncompetitive inhibitors of zebrafish Gstr1. Insecticide diazinon competitively inhibited Gstr1 activity with calculated K-i value of 27 mu M, while other Gstr1-interacting insecticides, chlorpyrifos-methyl (CPF-methyl) and malathion, showed allosteric activation like effect. Among tested pharmaceuticals, tetracycline, erythromycin and methotrexate demonstrated competitive type of inhibition with the calculated K-i values of 17.5, 36.5 and 29 mu M, respectively. In summary, we suggest that zebrafish Gstr1 has an important role in steroidogenesis, metabolism and/or physiological actions of androgens, but not estrogens in fish. Finally, our results imply the role of Gstr1 in metabolism of xenobiotics and protection of fish against deleterious environmental contaminants such as organophosphate insecticides and pharmaceuticals.

AB  - Levels of individual polychlorinated dibenzodioxin (PCDD) congeners were measured in pooled herring gull eggs collected from colonies in the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River between 1981 and 1991. Polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) were quantified from 1984 to 1991. 2,3,7,8-TCDD, 1,2,3,7,8-PnCDD, 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD, and 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF were detectable in all samples; 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD, OCDD, 2,3,7,8-TCDF, 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxDF, and 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxDF were frequently detected. Eggs from Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, had the highest PCDD/PCDF levels. Levels of TCDD, PnCDD, and HxCDD declined in most colonies between 1981 and 1984. There were no obvious temporal trends after 1984. Using multivariate analyses, colonies were separated into two classes based upon differences in egg bioaccumulation patterns. PCDD and PCDF patterns in a variety of potential sources were compared to these two herring gull classes. Patterns of PCDD accumulation were similar in herring gull eggs, lake trout, and walleye emphasizing the similarity of these species as regional indicators of PCDD/PCDF contamination.

AB  - A new selective molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) for solid phase extraction of profenofos (PFF) from aqueous solutions was synthesized by acrylonitrile grafted cotton fibers with hydrazine hydrate in presence of PFF as a template and glutraldhyde as a cross linker. The properties and structure of MIP was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental analysis (EA). Furthermore, the extracted PFF was detected by gas chromatography (GC). Various parameters such as (pH, contact time, temperature, initial concentration of PFF and also washing eluent composition) affecting the extraction efficiency was evaluated to investigate the selectivity and preconcentration from different matrices. Kinetic studies revealed that pseudo second order kinetic equation is the best model describes the adsorption behavior of PFF on MIP. Moreover, the obtained thermodynamic parameters (Delta G(0) < 0, Delta H-0 > 0, Delta S-0 > 0) indicated a spontaneous and endothermic reaction. Furthermore, the maximum sorption capacity was 17.24 mg g(-1). Under the experimental work conditions, limit of detection and limit of quantification were found to be 0.294 mg L-1 and 0.98 mg L-1, respectively. Finally, the proposed imprinted polymer was successfully applied for the extraction of PFF from wastewater and commercial plant samples. The recoveries of PFF were in the range between 94 and 104% with relative standard deviations (RSD) less than 5.0%.

AB  - Pesticides are widely used chemicals in agriculture, but these chemicals reach aquatic animals and pollute their habitats. In our study, the effects of Glufosinate-ammonium, a widely used herbicide, on the liver and gill tissues of the zebrafish (Danio rerio), which is a model organism, were examined. Primarily, the dose that would kill fifty percent of these fish was determined. In the next step, zebrafish were exposed to sublethal doses (50 mg/L and 100 mg/L) for 120 hours. The effects of the herbicide on oxidative stress parameters were evaluated as enzymatic (Catalase-CAT and Acetylcholinesterase-AChE enzyme activity) and non-enzymatic (Glutathione-GSH, Malondialdehyde-MDA and Total Protein levels). In conclusion, MDA, Total Protein, GSH levels and CAT enzyme activities decreased at low dosing (50 mg/L) in laboratory conditions in zebrafish liver and gill tissues associated with oxidative stress, while it increased at high dosing (100 mg/L). AChE enzyme activity showed a similar picture in liver tissue, but increased in gill tissue at both doses. It can be said that the effect of Glufosinate-ammonium may increase depending on the dose and its presence may pose a serious threat to fish.

AB  - Measurement of behavioral responses have been recently considered as an important method for monitoring risk assessment. Computational processing could be applied to continuous data for automatic determination of changes in behavioural states of indicator specimens. Behavioral monitoring could be used as an alternative toot to fill the gaps between large (e.g., ecological survey) and small (e.g., molecular analysis) scale methods for risk assessment. While the points were conventionally used for indicating movement of test specimens, the line shapes of blackworms, Lumbriculus variegatus, were trained by Artificial Neural Networks in this study. We proposed an unsupervised temporal model, Recurrent Self-Organizing Map (RSOM), to detect sequential changes in the line-movement of blackworms after the treatments of a toxic substance, copper, in this study. RSOM was feasible in addressing the stressful behaviors of indicator specimens such as body contraction, high degree of folding, etc. We demonstrated that the unsupervised temporal model is efficient in classifying temporal behavior patterns and could be used as an alternative toot for the real-time monitoring of toxic substances in aquatic ecosystems in the future.

AB  - An electrochemical sensor strip was used for sarin assay. Three different acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) were chosen as promising recognition elements. viz., human recombinant, electric eel, and bovine erythrocytes origin. Human recombinant AChE seems to be the most sensitive to inhibition by sarin when the achieved limit of detection (0.45 x 10(-8) mol/l) and IC50 [(9.77 +/- 8.08) x 10(-6) mol/l] are considered. On the contrary, AChE from bovine erythrocytes proved to reach highest IC50 (5.37 +/- 4.52) x 10(-7) mol/l and the one from electric eel reached the highest limit of detection 0.93 x 10(-8) mol/l. From the AChEs tested as biorecognition element, human recombinant seems to be the best for construction of new ChE detectors.

AB  - Fish are able to accumulate by ingestion various contaminants of aquatic environment, with negative consequences on their intestine, being continuously threatened worldwide by heavy metals, pesticides and antibiotics resulted from the human activities. Consequently, the health of other species can be affected by eating the contaminated fish meat. In this context, our study aimed to perform a comparison between the changes in intestine samples of Carassius gibelio individuals collected from different artificial lakes in Bucharest (Romania), used by people for leisure and fishing. The presence of various metals, pesticides and antibiotics in the gut of fish was assessed in order to correlate their accumulation with changes of antioxidative enzymes activities and microbiome. Our results showed that fish from Bucharest lakes designed for leisure (Chitila, Floreasca and Tei lakes) have an increased level of oxidative stress in intestine tissue, revealed by affected antioxidant enzymes activities and GSH levels, as well as the high degree of lipid peroxidation, compared to the fish from protected environment (Vacaresti Lake). Some heavy metals (Fe, Ni and Pb) and pesticides (aldrin and dieldrin) were in high amount in the gut of fish with modified antioxidative status. In conclusion, our study could improve the knowledge regarding the current state of urban aquatic pollution in order to impose several environmental health measures.

AB  - Harness((R)) is a commercial herbicide that contains acetochlor at a concentration of 84% as an active ingredient. Ubiquitous, persistent, and substantial uses of Harness((R)) in agricultural processes have resulted in the pollution of nearby water sources, posing a threat to various aquatic biotas, including fish. The effects of Harness((R)) toxicity on fish health are little known. So, this study aimed to describe the impact of herbicide Harness((R)) on the oxidative stress and reproductive and thyroid performance of male and female tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and also investigate the prospective role of the natural antioxidant lycopene supplementation in dismissing the adverse properties of Harness((R)). Antioxidant enzyme (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and total antioxidant capacity) and hormone measurements (T, E2, T3, and T4) were carried out, and gonadal and thyroid follicle histological sections were examined as a method to investigate the effects of Harness((R)) toxicity on fish. Male and female tilapia were exposed to 10 mu mol/L and 100 mu mol/L of Harness((R)) and treated with 10 mg lycopene/kg for 15 days of exposure. Our results demonstrated that the antioxidant enzyme activity was altered by Harness exposure and serum T for both males and females dropped; also, female E2 levels decreased, but male E2 increased. Exposure to higher dose of Harness((R)) induced elevation in both T3 and T4 levels, although the low exposure dose stimulated T4 levels. Harness((R)) exposure prompted histological variations and degenerative changes in testicular, ovarian, and thyroid follicle tissues. Lycopene supplement administration diminished oxidative stress induced by Harness((R)), alleviating its endocrine disparaging effects by neutralizing T3, T4, T, and E2 and ameliorating the histological structure of gonadal and thyroid tissues. In conclusion, lycopene supplementation was preformed to normalize the alterations and oxidative damage caused by Harness((R)) in Nile tilapia, suggesting that lycopene-supplemented diet functioned as potent antioxidants and had the ability to alleviate oxidative stress and thyroid and reproductive toxicity caused by herbicide Harness((R)). Moreover, it is crucial to take appropriate care when consuming herbicides to defend the aquatic environment.

AB  - Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters 1852) are native to the eastward flowing rivers of central and southern Africa but from the early 1930s they have been widely distributed around the world for aquaculture and for biological control of weeds and insects. While O. mossambicus are now not commonly used as an aquaculture species, the biological traits that made them a popular culture species including tolerance to wide ranging ecological conditions, generalist dietary requirements and rapid reproduction with maternal care have also made them a 'model' invader. Self-sustaining populations now exist in almost every region to which they have been imported. In Australia, since their introduction in the 1970s, O. mossambicus have become established in catchments along the east and west coasts and have the potential to colonise other adjacent drainages. It is thought that intentional translocations are likely to be the most significant factor in their spread in Australia. The ecological and physical tolerances and preferences, reproductive behaviour, hybridization and the high degree of plasticity in the life history traits of O. mossambicus are reviewed. Impacts of O. mossambicus on natural ecosystems including competitive displacement of native species, habitat alteration, predation and as a vector in the spread of diseases are discussed. Potential methods for eradicating or controlling invasive populations of O. mossambicus including physical removal, piscicides, screens, environmental management and genetic technologies are outlined.

AB  - To assess species-specific differences in organochlorine (OC) concentrations and sport harvest of Lake Michigan salmonines, and how this may affect human exposure to OC compounds, creel survey and OC analysis data for salmon and trout collected from the western waters of Lake Michigan in 1985 and 1990 were examined. In all species, total concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) attained the highest concentration of the OC compounds quantified in both study years. DDT and metabolites attained the second highest concentration of OC compounds, in those species in which these compounds were quantified, followed by chlordane and its constituents and dieldrin, respectively. The relative concentrations of PCBs and OC pesticides remained constant between study years in all species, except for brook trout as limited 1990 data prevented analysis. For the mean lengths of each species of salmonines taken by anglers in 1985, lake trout showed the highest concentrations of OC compounds followed by brown trout, chinook salmon, brook trout, rainbow trout, and coho salmon, respectively. In 1990 lake trout again had the highest concentration of OCs followed by chinook salmon, brown trout, rainbow trout, and coho salmon. Brook trout were not in the analysis. Chinook salmon contributed the greatest proportion of OCs to the 1985 sport catch because of its dominance in total biomass of fish harvested. Lake trout contributed the greatest proportion of OCs to the 1990 sport catch, although the second highest in biomass harvested, because of the higher concentration of OC compounds in this species. The concentrations of PCBs declined between study years in all species except brook trout becaused limited 1990 data prevented this comparison. Study results indicate salmonine stocking policies can significantly influence the exposure of sport fish consumers in the Great Lakes region to OC compounds.

AB  - Glutahione-dependent defense against xenobiotic toxicity is a multifaceted phenomenon that has been well characterized in mammals. In the present study, eels of species Anguilla anguilla were exposed to 15 ppm of the herbicide thiobencarb (S-4-chlorobenzyl diethylthiocarbamate) for 96 h. Eels exposed to the pesticide were grouped in 24-h intervals according to their time of death, while surviving intoxicated eels constituted another group (live animals). Glutathione content (GSx, GSH, GSSG) was determined in liver and muscle tissues of the dead and live (intoxicated) animals and compared to control values (nonexposed eels). The fish that died before 96 h of exposure were considered susceptible to thiobencarb, while those dead after 96 h and the surviving ones were called resistant. Hepatic glutathione (GSH) content in susceptible eels was lower than that in the control fish, while resistant eels presented GSH levels threefold higher than those of controls. Muscle glutathione levels in dead eels mere practically unaffected, but there was a significant decrease in GSH levels in the surviving intoxicated eels. These results indicate that the eels that were able to induce glutathione synthesis in the liver due to the presence of thiobencarb in the medium demonstrated a greater longevity than those who lost glutathione homeostasis.

AB  - Toxic effects of penoxsulam herbicide on acetylcholinesterase, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and protein carbonyl were studied in silver catfish (Rhamdia sp.) and carp (Cyprinus carpio). Acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited in both brain and muscle tissue, with the inhibition being greater in carp than in silver catfish. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), an indicator of lipid peroxidation, decreased in silver catfish brain tissue, but increased in the carp brain. MDA also increased significantly in muscle tissue of silver catfish. The levels of protein carbonyl, another measure of oxidative damage, increased in the brain of both fish species, and in the muscle of carp. However, silver catfish exhibited a decrease in muscle protein carbonyl. It appears that silver catfish may possess better mechanisms of defense against penoxsulam toxicity than carp.

AB  - Animal behaviour is the interaction between environment and an individual organism, which also can be influenced by its neighbours. Variations in environmental conditions, as those caused by contaminants, may lead to neurochemical impairments altering the pattern of the behavioural repertoire of the species. Atrazine (ATZ) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture that is frequently detected in surface water, affecting non-target species. The zebrafish is a valuable model organism to assess behavioural and neurochemical effects of different contaminants since it presents a robust behavioural repertoire and also all major neurotransmitter systems described for mammalian species. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of subchronic ATZ exposure in defensive behaviours of zebrafish (shoaling, thigmotaxis, and depth preference) using the split depth tank. Furthermore, to investigate a putative role of cholinergic signalling on ATZ-mediated effects, we tested whether this herbicide alters acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain and muscle preparations. Fish were exposed to ATZ for 14 days and the following groups were tested: control (0.2% acetone) and ATZ (10 and 1000 mu g/L). The behaviour of four animals in the same tank was recorded for 6 min and biological samples were prepared. Our results showed that 1000 mu g/L ATZ significantly increased the inter-fish distance, as well as the nearest and farthest neighbour distances. This group also presented an increase in the shoal area with decreased social interaction. No significant differences were detected for the number of animals in the shallow area, latency to enter the shallow and time spent in shallow and deep areas of the apparatus, but the ATZ 1000 group spent significantly more time near the walls. Although ATZ did not affect muscular AChE, it significantly reduced AChE activity in brain. Exposure to 10 mu g/L ATZ did not affect behaviour or AChE activity. These data suggest that ATZ impairs defensive behaviours of zebrafish, which could be related to its action on brain cholinergic neurotransmission. Moreover, the use of the split depth tank could be an alternative strategy to assess group behaviour and depth preference after exposure to chemical compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Acetochlor is one of the 79 substances of the third stage, part A, of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on acetochlor in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 4 April 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 December 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force consisting of Dow AgroSciences and Monsanto Europe S.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in August September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 27 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on maize, for full details of the GAP please refer to the attached end points.
   The representative formulated products for the evaluation were "GF-675" and "Mon 69447" a 400 g/L capsule suspension (CS) and a 840 g/L emulsifiable concentrate (EC).
   The residue definition for monitoring in plants has not been concluded on. Acetochlor residues in maize can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For Noxamic acid metabolite 68(2) a LC-MS/MS method is available this metabolite can not be analysed by a multi method. For products of animal origin there are no methods available. At this stage it can not be concluded if this is a data gap or not as the assessment for residues is not complete.
   For soil a LC-MS/MS method is available that analyses for acetochlor, t-oxanilic acid (2)3, t-sulfonic acid (7) (4), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3) (5), s-sulfonic acid (13)(6) and t-norchloroacetochlor (6) (7). For surface/ground/drinking water LC-MS/MS methods are available for acetochlor, t-oxanilic acid (2), tsulfonic acid (7), s-sulfonic acid (13) t-norchloroacetochlor (6) and t-sulfinylacetic acid (3). In addition to this there is also a LC-MS/MS method for t-norchloroacetochlor (6) in drinking water. Air can be analysed for acetochlor by LC-MS/MS.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, it should be noted that there are no spectra, analytical methods or storage stability data for the relevant impurities in the technical material.
   Acetochlor has a moderate acute toxicity. The proposed classification is Xn, R20/22 Harmful by inhalation and if swallowed; Xi, R37/38 Irritating to respiratory system and skin; R43 May cause sensitisation by skin contact. In short term studies the dog was the most sensitive species showing decreased body weight gain and histopathological findings in kidneys and testes. Many in vitro genotoxicity studies showed positive results but the in vivo tests did not indicate clearly a mutagenic potential. In long term studies different types of tumours were observed with increased incidences and the classification Carc. cat.3, R40 Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect was proposed. No specific effect on the reproductive parameters was found in multigeneration studies with rats, and no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits. The groundwater metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7) and ssulfonic acid (13) were considered relevant taking into account the limited information available and the carcinogenic potential of the parent compound. The relative toxicity of the plant and potential surface water metabolite t-norchloro acetochlor (6) in comparison with acetochlor could not be concluded.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.0036 mg/kg bw/day using the LOAEL from the 78-week mouse study with a safety factor of 300. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, with the use of a safety factor of 100. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 1.5 mg/kg bw, derived from the acute rat neurotoxicity study with the application of a safety factor of 100. Two representative formulations were considered in the exposure assessment. For GF-675, the operator exposure is below the AOEL with the use of gloves. For MON 69447, the estimates with the German and UK models are above the AOEL but a biomonitoring study measured exposures below the AOEL with the use of closed cabins and gloves.
   Metabolism of acetochlor was studied in maize plants upon a pre-emergence treatment. Total residues in the mature grain were low and did not permit an extensive identification of metabolites. The rate of identification in other maize plant parts was limited and the need for further data was identified, in particular with regard to the nature of the residue in plant parts fed to livestock and in immature maize kernels (sweet corn use withdrawn during the peer review). Also early-post emergence uses are currently not sufficiently addressed by metabolism data. Based on the available data a number of metabolites were identified and some of them are considered toxicological relevant (potential carcinogenicity). Therefore the residue definition was extensively discussed and it was concluded that for risk assessment all compounds forming EMA (34)8 and HEMA (33)(9) on hydrolysis as well as hydroxy-oxamic acid (68), all expressed as acetochlor should be considered for maize grain and preliminary also for rotational crops (the latter restricted to cereal grains, root and tuber crops and leafy crops). The need for further rotational crop data was identified. For monitoring purposes three options for a residue definition were proposed, and risk management consideration is required to decide on the final monitoring definition. Residue trials confirmed that residues in maize kernels, when analysed for the risk assessment residue definition, are below the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.05 mg/kg. However, currently insufficient data in terms of quality and magnitude of residues are available to assess the dietary burden of livestock. Consumer exposure estimates therefore only include the exposure from maize grain but don't consider potential exposure from food of animal origin and certain rotational crops. Therefore the consumer risk assessment should be considered as not finalised. It is also noted that there is potential consumer exposure to acotochlor metabolites from ground water used as drinking water, in particular to t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinyl acetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7) and s-sulfonic acid (13). A risk assessment showed that the ADI of acetochlor, when applied to the metabolites, might be exceeded only due to the consumption of water containing these metabolites at the level estimated in FOCUS scenarios.
   In topsoil under aerobic conditions acetochlor exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the major soil metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2) (max 17 % applied radioactivity (AR)) and t-sulfonic acid (7) (max 11.8%AR) which exhibited moderate to high persistence and t-sulfinylacetic acid (3) (max 18%AR) which exhibited medium to high persistence. The minor soil metabolites s-sulfonic acid (13) (max 9.8%AR) which exhibited moderate to medium persistence and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) (max 3.3%AR) were also identified. Mineralisation of the phenyl radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted only 0.3-3.1 % of applied radioactivity (AR) after 96 days. The formation of unextractable residues was also a significant sink accounting for 15-41 % AR after 84-90 days. Acetochlor exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinyl acetic acid (3) and t-sulfonic acid (7) exhibit very high to high mobility in soil and s-sulfonic acid (13) exhibits very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either acetochlor or these 4 metabolites was pH dependant.
   In natural sediment water systems acetochlor exhibited moderate persistence degrading to the major metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2) (max. 13.1%AR in water) and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) (max 10.4%AR in water 19.2%AR in sediment). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for only 1.4-2.7 % AR at 100 days. Unextracted sediment residues were the most significant sink for radioactivity representing 24-50 % AR at 100 days. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for acetochlor at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1p.g/L by parent acetochlor was concluded to be low, in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. A high potential for groundwater contamination >0.1 mu g/L over significant areas of the EU by the metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7) and s-sulfonic acid (13) that have (on the basis of the available mammalian toxicology data) been concluded as relevant metabolites was identified. It was considered that a lysimeter study would be essential to exclude the potential for the presence of additional metabolites in groundwater.
   The short-term TER for birds and the acute and long-term TERs for mammals were above the trigger of 10 and 5 in the first-tier risk assessment. A residue decline study was submitted. The acute risk to herbivorous birds was sufficiently addressed on the basis of measured residues. However it was not possible to conclude on the reliability of the suggested PD and PT values to refine the long-term risk to herbivorous birds since no summaries of the supporting studies were made available. The refined risk assessment for insectivorous birds based on crested lark (Galerida cristata) was agreed by the meeting. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was assessed as low for mammals. The risk assessment for uptake of contaminated drinking water was discussed in the expert meeting. It was agreed that the risk to mammals is low. However a high acute risk cannot be excluded for birds for post-emergence applications where accumulation of water in leaf axils of maize plants can occur. The risk from secondary poisoning of fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low in the first tier but further refinement was required for earthworm-eating birds and mammals. The risk was sufficiently addressed using data from a bioconcentration study with earthworms. The risk from soil metabolites was considered to be low because their log Pow is <3 suggesting a low potential of bioconcentration and bioaccumulation in the food chain. Endpoints from acute toxicity studies with rats were available for the major plant metabolite 68 (N-(6-ethyl-3-hydroxy-2-methylphenyl) and for metabolite 3 (t-sulfonylacetic acid). No information on the toxicity to birds was available. In the risk assessment it was assumed that the metabolites have a similar toxicity to birds as the parent. The acute and long-term TERs for birds and mammals were above the triggers of 10 and 5. However some uncertainty remains because of the high proportion of not identified residues in the residue trials (up to 39% of TRR) and one of the unknown compounds exceeded the threshold of 10% of TRR. Acetochlor is very toxic to all groups of aquatic organisms and a high risk was indicated in the risk assessment with FOCUS step3 PECsw. A risk refinement based on endpoints from a static mesocosm and from a mesocosm with a pulsed exposure regime was used to refine the risk in lentic and lotic waterbodies. The experts agreed that the NOAEC of 0.2 lag acetochlor/L for lentic water bodies and the NOAEC of 2 mu g acetochlor/L for lotic waterbodies should be used in the risk assessment together with an assessment factor of 2-3. A new risk assessment was prepared by the RMS in addendum 5 (not peer-reviewed) taking into account the recommendations of the expert meeting. The TERs were below the trigger of 2 for all FOCUS step 3 scenarios. In addendum 6 (not peer-reviewed) TERs were calculated for no-spray buffer zones of 25 and 50m. No full scenario resulted in TERs >2 with a no spray buffer zone of 25m. TERs >= 2 were observed in two full scenarios (D4, D5) out of 8 scenarios if a no-spray buffer zone of 50m is applied but no full scenario achieved TERs >= 3. Overall it is concluded that the risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to acetochlor is high for the representative uses evaluated. The risk from metabolites in water and sediment was assessed as low. The bioconcentration potential of acetochlor was assessed as low.
   A high in-field risk was identified for both indicator species for the representative uses with the lead formulation GF-675. Extended laboratory studies indicated a low risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi but the LD50 for Typhlodromus pyri was below the suggested application rate. However the trigger is met for the off-field area and considering the short half life of acetochlor on vegetation it was considered as likely that recolonisation is possible. In addition no mortality was observed in the standard laboratory tests with the leaf dwelling species C. carnea at dose rates of 2000 g a.s./ha. Therefore it was concluded in the expert meeting that the risk to leaf dwelling arthropods is low. The risk to soil surface dwelling arthropods from exposure to acetochlor and its soil metabolites was considered to be low.
   The acute risk of acetochlor to earthworms was assessed as low. No long-term risk assessment is triggered because the representative uses cover only one application per year and the field DT90 is <100 days. The acute and long-term risk from soil metabolites to earthworms was assessed as low.
   A high risk to non-target terrestrial plants was identified and risk mitigation measures such as a 5m in-field no spray buffer zone are required.
   The risk to bees, earthworms, soil-micro organisms, organic matter breakdown and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses of acetochlor.

AB  - Background: Rotenone (ROT) is currently being used in various research fields, especially neuroscience. Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a Parkinson's disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochondria. Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination with different potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT-2.5 mu g/L, valproic acid (VPA)-0.5 mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)-250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics (PROBIO)-3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti-social profile and mirror tests and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a) CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views, this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05). Four out of eight studied groups-(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA-displayed an impaired, often antithetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.0005). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT + PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the above groups (p > 0.05). Except for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a normalized trend in terms of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental groups exhibited exacerbated levels of aggression (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001) not only near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001). Conclusions: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement compared with (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT-treated zebrafish (e-h). Independently of the aggressive-like reactions and fluctuations among the testing day(s) and groups, ROT disrupted the social behavior, while VPA promoted a specific typology in contrast with LEV/CARB.

AB  - DNA mismatch repair (MMR) of simple base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops in eukaryotes is initiated by the binding of the MutS homolog 2 (MSH2)-MSH6 heterodimer to mismatched DNA. Cadmium (Cd) is a genotoxic heavy metal that has been recognized as a human carcinogen. Oxidant stress and inhibition of DNA repair have been proposed as major factors underlying Cd genotoxicity. Our previous studies indicated the ability of Cd to disturb the gene expression of MSH6 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. This study was undertaken to explore if Cd-induced oxidative stress down-regulated MSH gene activities. Following the exposure of zebrafish embryos at 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to sublethal concentrations of Cd at 3-5 mu M for 4 or 9 h, a parallel down-regulation of MSH2, MSH6 and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) gene expression was detected by real-time RT-PCR and the expression levels were 40-50% of control after a 9-h exposure. Cd exposure also induced oxidative stress, yet no inhibition of catalase gene activity was observed. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed a wide distribution of msh6 mRNA in the head regions of 10 hpf embryos and pretreatment of embryos with antioxidants butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), D-mannitol or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 1-10 mu M restored Cd-suppressed msh6 expression. QPCR confirmed the protective effects of antioxidants on Cd-suppressed msh2/msh6 mRNA production. Down-regulated MSH gene activities reaching about 50% of control were also induced in embryos exposed to paraquat, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating herbicide, or hydrogen peroxide at 200 M. Hence, Cd at sublethal levels down-regulates msh2/msh6 expression primarily via ROS as signaling molecules. The transcriptional activation of human msh6 is known to be fully dependent on the specificity factor 1 (Spl). Cd failed to inhibit the DNA binding activity of zebrafish Spl unless at lethal concentrations based on band shift assay, therefore excluding the involvement of Spl inactivation in Cd-induced MSH gene inhibition in zebrafish embryos. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Paraquat and juglone generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are widely used to investigate defense mechanisms against ROS in model animals. We cloned cDNA encoding hsp70 from the rotifer Asplanchna brightwelli. The full-length cDNA was 2134 bp and had an open reading frame of 1929 bp encoding 642 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the Asphsp70 was a cytoplasmic protein and has the highest similarity 87% with Mus musculus, 86% identity with orthologs of Danio rerio, 84% with Apis mellifera and 81% with Xenopus laevis. Expression of Asphsp70 was analyzed under 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/L paraquat and 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 mu g/L juglone. With paraquat, mRNA expression of Asphsp70 significantly increased immediately after exposure for 1 h (P < 0.05). Expression of Asphsp70 temporarily increased after exposure to 2.5 mg/L for 3 and 6 h, and after 10 mg/L for 3 h (P < 0.05). With exposure to 6.25 mu g/L juglone, mRNA for Asphsp70 significantly increased at 1, 3 and 12 h; with 12.5, 25 and 50 mu g/L, mRNA expression of Asphsp70 significantly increased immediately for 1 h (P < 0.05). These results indicated that the Asphsp70 gene was important in the response to oxidative stress.

AB  - P>1. Wetland insect predators can structure aquatic prey communities via selective predation, but receive considerably less attention than vertebrate predators. We conducted laboratory experiments to test selective predation by two species of larval dytiscid beetles (Agabus; Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) and the potential contribution of these beetles to suppression of mosquito populations in constructed wetlands.
   2. Agabus consumed copepods, ostracods and mosquito larvae in no-choice tests. When offered a choice, 76% of all prey consumed were mosquito larvae, indicating selective predation. Subsequent experiments revealed this preference was due to ease of capture of mosquito larvae over alternative prey.
   3. Cannibalism and intraguild predation were common within and between species of Agabus, which may reduce the overall impact of the observed selective predation.
   4. Agabus larvae selectively preyed on mosquito larvae over alternative prey, which is not characteristic of some fish used as biological control agents for mosquitoes. Predator exclusion or similar experiments in the field could document how these results translate into a natural setting.
   5. The findings of this study suggest developing mosquito suppression strategies focused on conservation of native wetland predators. These strategies are preferable to introducing non-native generalist predators, or applying pesticides.

AB  - The effects of endosulfan, a widely used organochlorine pesticide in the Niger-Delta ecological zone were examined on cortisol secretion, glutathione S-transferase and acetylcholinesterase enzymatic activities in the serum of a dominant fresh water fish species, Clarias gariepinus. Juveniles stage of C. gariepinus were used for the toxicity study. Lethal concentration of 50% mortality of sample (LC50) was determined using semi-static method. From the result of the LC50 determination lower concentrations of endosulfan were prepared for sub-lethal test. Ten fish per test concentration in three replicates were exposed to varying concentrations of endosulfan (0.00, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075 and 0.01) mu g/L. Signs of stress and mortality were monitored during the experimental duration. Cortisol levels, GST and AChE activities were measured spectrophotometrically. No visible changes in behaviour and appearance were observed in the treated fishes and no mortality recorded. Significant (p < 0.05) declined in cortisol secretion was observed and the change in the concentration was dose and time dependent. Glutathione S-transferase activity was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the control and the concentrations increase with increased in concentration and exposure duration. No clear trend was observed in acetylcholinesterase activity. The findings showed that the cortisol levels and GST activity of test organism were affected by the test chemical and therefore could be considered as a suitable marker to evaluate the effect of organochlorine pesticide on fish and other aquatic organisms.

AB  - Imidacloprid is the most widely used of the nicotinoid insecticides, the fastest growing class of pesticides on the global market. Although less toxic to mammals and birds compared to organophosphates, nicotinoids have the potential to impact non-target invertebrates, especially through sublehal effects on behavior, physiology, reproduction, and development. We investigated the impact of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on the defensive responses of rusty crayfish Orconectes rusticus exposed to 0, 1, 10, and 100 mu g.L-1 of imidacloprid for 10 days (n = 7 crayfish per treatment). Defensive behaviors were examined with the rod test, in which a glass rod was jabbed into the crayfish's container at a 90 degree angle from the bottom and about 0.5 cm directly in front of the crayfish. Crayfish responded to the rod aggressively with claw raising and pinching, neutrally (no response), or by backing or tail-flipping away. The frequency of neutral responses more than doubled after four days in the high (100 mu g.L-1) group and after eight days in the low (1 mu g.L-1) exposure group. Furthermore, most crayfish in the 100 mu g.L-1 treatment were not able to right themselves within 30 s when placed on their backs. Several studies have reported concentrations of imidacloprid contamination in freshwater ecosystems that exceed this study's lowest exposure scenario, 1 mu g.L-1. We therefore conclude that imidacloprid contamination reduces the defensive behaviors of crayfish, impairing their ability to survive in habitats where they play important ecological roles.

AB  - Acetochlor is one of the 79 substances of the third stage, part A, of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3) as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007. This Regulation required the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the European Commission.
   Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on acetochlor in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 4 April 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 December 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force consisting of Dow AgroSciences and Monsanto Europe S.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in August - September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007.
   A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 27 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 31 July 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 153)
   Following the Commission Decision of 05 December 2008 (2008/934/EC)(4) concerning the non-inclusion of acetochlor in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicants made a resubmission application for the inclusion of acetochlor in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(5). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues and concerns identified in the DAR leading to the decision on non-inclusion.
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Spain being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 22 April 2010.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicants for comments on 26 April 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 9 June 2010.
   The collated comments were also forwarded to the RMS for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table. The applicants were invited to respond to the comments in column 3 of the Reporting Table. The comments and the applicant's response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the European Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focussed peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology, residues, fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on acetochlor.
   The conclusion of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on maize as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in Appendix A.
   The representative formulated products for the evaluation were "GF-675" and "Mon 69447" a 400 g/L capsule suspension (CS) and an 840 g/L emulsifiable concentrate (EC) respectively
   Residues in food of plant origin are analysed using a common moiety method by LC-MS/MS, data gaps have been identified for validation of the extraction and hydrolysis steps for each metabolite and ILV for the method. Consequently, no valid method is available to quantify residues in food of plant origin. For products of animal origin a method is not required as no MRLs are proposed.
   For soil a LC-MS/MS method is available that analyses for acetochlor, t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfonic acid (7), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3) and s-sulfonic acid (13). For surface/ground/drinking water LCMS/MS methods are available for acetochlor, t-oxanilic acid (2), t- sulfonic acid (7), s-sulfonic acid (13) t- norchloroacetochlor (6) and t-sulfinylacetic acid (3). In addition to this there is also a LCMS/MS method for t-norchloroacetochlor (6) in drinking water. Air can be analysed for acetochlor by LC-MS/MS.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Acetochlor has a moderate acute toxicity. The proposed classification is Xn, R20/22 Harmful by inhalation and if swallowed; Xi, R37/38 Irritating to respiratory system and skin; R43 May cause sensitisation by skin contact. In short term studies the dog was the most sensitive species showing decreased body weight gain and histopathological findings in kidneys and testes. Based on the findings in the 52-week study in dog the risk phrase R48/22 "Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed". Many in vitro genotoxicity studies showed positive results but the in vivo tests did not indicate clearly a mutagenic potential. In long term studies different types of tumours were observed with increased incidences and the classification Carc. cat. 3, R40 Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect was proposed. No specific effect on the reproductive parameters was found in multigeneration studies with rats, and no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits.
   The groundwater metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7), s-sulfonic acid (13) and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) were considered toxicologically relevant taking into account the limited information available and the carcinogenic potential of the parent compound. The reference values of acetochlor are applicable to the plant metabolite N-oxamic acid (68).
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.0036 mg/kg bw/day using the LOAEL from the 78-week mouse study with a safety factor of 300. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, with the use of a safety factor of 100. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 1.5 mg/kg bw, derived from the acute rat neurotoxicity study with the application of a safety factor of 100. Two representative formulations were considered in the exposure assessment. For 'GF-675', the operator exposure is below the AOEL with the use of gloves and coverall during mixing/loading and application, and sturdy footwear during application. For 'MON 69447', the estimates with the German and UK models are above the AOEL but a bio-monitoring study measured exposures below the AOEL with the use of tractors and gloves during mixing/loading and coverall during application.
   Metabolism of acetochlor was studied in maize plants upon pre-emergence and post-emergence application. Acetochlor was seen to be extensively metabolised, the residues being composed of numerous individual metabolites of which, more than 30 were identified, each accounting for less than 3% of the TRR. The residue definitions were therefore extensively discussed during the PRAPeR 20 and the teleconference TC46 and it was finally agreed to define the residue for monitoring as "all compounds forming EMA (34) and HEMA (33) on hydrolysis expressed as acetochlor", considering that the common moieties method developed by the applicant is able to take into account a significant part of the residues. The N-oxamic acid (68) metabolite was added to the EMA and HEMA forming metabolites, in the residue definition for risk assessment and a conversion factor of 2 was proposed for the consumer risk assessment. These residue definitions are also relevant to assess the residues in rotational crops.
   Supervised trials confirmed that residues in maize grains, when analysed for EMA and HEMA, are below the limit of quantification. Inversely, significant residues were detected in maize forage. Based on the different ruminant metabolism studies, it was concluded that no residues are expected to be present in animal matrices when considering the intakes resulting from the residues present in maize forage and maize grains. Therefore, the setting of a residue definition and MRLs for products of animal origin was considered not necessary.
   No chronic or acute risks were identified when the consumer exposures to food commodities are calculated using the EFSA PRIMo Model and the MRL proposed for maize grains and oil seeds. However, it must be highlighted that the potential consumer exposure exceeds the ADI value in many scenario, when the predicted concentrations of the ground water metabolites are considered. In addition, intakes for toddlers and infants resulting from the water consumption are at times above the threshold value of 20% ADI recommended by the WHO, when calculations are conducted using the concentrations measured in a monitoring program conducted in Northern Italy.
   In topsoil under aerobic conditions acetochlor exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the major soil metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2) (max 17 % applied radioactivity (AR)) and t-sulfonic acid (7) (max 11.8% AR) which exhibited moderate to high persistence and t-sulfinylacetic acid (3) (max 18% AR) which exhibited medium to high persistence. The minor soil metabolites s-sulfonic acid (13) (max 9.8% AR) which exhibited moderate to medium persistence and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) (max 3.3% AR) were also identified. Mineralisation of the phenyl radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted only 0.3-3.1 % of applied radioactivity (AR) after 96 days. The formation of unextractable residues was also a significant sink accounting for 15-41 % AR after 84-90 days. Acetochlor exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinyl acetic acid (3) and t-sulfonic acid (7) exhibit very high to high mobility in soil and s-sulfonic acid (13) and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) exhibit very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either acetochlor or these 5 metabolites was pH dependant.
   In natural sediment water systems acetochlor exhibited moderate persistence degrading to the major metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2) (max. 13.1% AR in water) and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) (max 10.4% AR in water 19.2% AR in sediment). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for only 1.4-2.7 % AR at 100 days. Unextracted sediment residues were the most significant sink for radioactivity representing 24-50 % AR at 100 days. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for acetochlor at steps 1-4, with spray drift and runoff mitigation being applied at step 4. These exposure assessments as required for metabolites were completed at steps 1-2. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L by parent acetochlor was concluded to be low, in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. A high potential for groundwater contamination > 0.1 mu g/L over significant areas of the EU by the metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7) and s-sulfonic acid (13) that have (on the basis of the available mammalian toxicology data) been concluded as relevant metabolites was identified. A data gap is identified for the stability of the metabolites t-norchloroacetochlor (6) and thydroxyacetochlor (17) in stored frozen groundwater samples. These data are required to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment for these two metabolites.
   The short-term TER for birds and the acute and long-term TERs for mammals were above the trigger of 10 and 5 in the first-tier risk assessment. A residue decline study was submitted. The acute risk to herbivorous birds was sufficiently addressed on the basis of measured residues. However the suggested PD and PT values to refine the long-term risk to herbivorous birds were assessed and considered as not supported by the submitted data. The refined risk assessment for insectivorous birds based on crested lark (Galerida cristata) was agreed by the meeting. The risk from consumption of contaminated water was assessed as low for mammals.. It was agreed in the expert meeting, that the risk to mammals is low. However a high acute risk was indicated for birds for post-emergence applications where accumulation of water in leaf axils of maize plants can occur. The risk from secondary poisoning of fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low in the first tier but further refinement was required for earthworm-eating birds and mammals. The risk was sufficiently addressed using data from a bioconcentration study with earthworms. The risk from soil metabolites was considered to be low because their log Pow is <3 suggesting a low potential of bioconcentration and bioaccumulation in the food chain. Endpoints from acute toxicity studies with rats were available for the major plant metabolite N-oxamic acid (68) and for metabolite 3 (t-sulfinylacetic acid). No information on the toxicity to birds was available. In the risk assessment it was assumed that the metabolites have a similar toxicity to birds as the parent. The acute and long-term TERs for birds and mammals were above the triggers of 10 and 5. However some uncertainty remains because of the high proportion of unidentified residues in the residue trials (up to 39% of TRR) and one of the unknown compounds exceeded the threshold of 10% of TRR. The risk from plant metabolites to herbivorous birds was addressed in the additional report.
   Acetochlor is very toxic to all groups of aquatic organisms and a high risk was indicated in the risk assessment with FOCUS step3 PECsw. A risk refinement based on endpoints from a static mesocosm and from a mesocosm with a pulsed exposure regime was used to refine the risk in lentic and lotic water bodies. The experts agreed that the NOAEC of 0.2 mu g acetochlor/L for lentic water bodies and the NOAEC of 2 mu g acetochlor/L for lotic water bodies should be used in the risk assessment together with an assessment factor of 2-3. No FOCUS step 4 scenario resulted in a TER exceeding the trigger of 2 even when no-spray buffer zones of 20m and vegetated filter strips of 20m were applied to mitigate the risk. Overall it is concluded that the risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to acetochlor is high for the representative uses evaluated. The risk from metabolites in water and sediment was assessed as low. The bioconcentration potential of acetochlor was assessed as low.
   A high in-field risk was identified for both indicator arthropod species for the representative uses with the lead formulation GF-675. Extended laboratory studies indicated a low risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi but the LD50 for Typhlodromus pyri was below the suggested application rate. However the trigger is met for the off-field area and considering the short half life of acetochlor on vegetation it was considered as likely that re-colonisation is possible. In addition no mortality was observed in the standard laboratory tests with the leaf dwelling species C. carnea at dose rates of 2000 g a.s./ha. Therefore it was concluded in the expert meeting that the risk to leaf dwelling arthropods is low. The risk to soil surface dwelling arthropods from exposure to acetochlor and its soil metabolites was considered to be low.
   The acute risk of acetochlor to earthworms was assessed as low. No long-term risk assessment is triggered because the representative uses cover only one application per year and the field DT90 is < 100 days. The acute and long-term risk from soil metabolites to earthworms was assessed as low.
   A high risk to non-target terrestrial plants was identified and risk mitigation measures such as a 5m infield no spray buffer zone are required.
   The risk to bees, soil macro-organisms, soil-micro organisms, organic matter breakdown and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses of acetochlor.

AB  - To evaluate the effects on biochemicals, antioxidants, immune responses and disease resistance of the snakehead fish, following exposure to deltamethrin at 0.061, 0.121, 0.242, 0.485 and 0.970 mu g/L. After 28 d, the biochemical, the levels of antioxidant enzymes and immune enzymes in liver, spleen, kidney and intestine were negatively related to the concentrations of deltamethrin exposure. Likewise, the survival rates of the fish after 7 d challenge with Aeromonas veronii were negatively related. The levels of IL-1 beta, IL-8, TNF-alpha, Hsp70 and malondialdehyde in liver, spleen, kidney and intestine were positively connected to the concentrations of deltamethrin exposure. Results demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations (0.121, 0.242, 0.485 and 0.970 mu g/L) inhibited the biochemicals, antioxidants and immune responses and disease resistance of snakehead fish.

AB  - In the marine aquaculture industry, photobacteriosis caused by the Photobacterium damselae subspecies piscicida, Phdp is a globally significant disease. A number of clinical photobacteriosis outbreaks among yearling cultured and broodstocks of gilthead sea bream were sampled and submitted to our laboratory during the summer and autumn of 2013. The tissues of infected fish were subjected to an ordinary bacteriological identification and were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry techniques. The results indicated that the selective primers that have been designed for detecting the gene encoding the apoptotic-induced protein, AIP56, represent a powerful tool for sensitive and specific detection of virulent strains of Phdp. AIP56 toxin triggers apoptosis of host macrophages and neutrophils, contributing to the lesions observed during the pathological investigation. Immunohistochemistry allows bacterial identification and antigen expression to be directly correlated to the disease; the immune-positive bacteria were detected in gills, liver, kidneys, spleen, and brain tissues in acute photobacteriosis. These also appeared in the necrotic areas of the granulomas of chronically infected fish. Molecular and immunohistochemical methods were useful as research and diagnostic tools in different stages of the disease; moreover, they appear to have enormous potential in retrospective epidemiological investigations.

AB  - Simple Summary
   There is an increasing interest in botanical insecticides worldwide. Plants from the genus Tephrosia are rich in bioactive phytochemicals, particularly rotenoids which include rotenone, deguelin, rotenolone, and tephrosin. Rotenoids have strong insecticidal activities against a wider range of pests. However, there has been no treatise thus far focusing on Tephrosia as insecticidal plants. This article is intended to review phytochemicals produced by selected species, their insecticidal activities, and the current status on the use of Tephrosia as botanical insecticidal plants for insect pest control.
   Synthetic insecticides are effective in controlling insect pests but can also harm nontarget organisms and the environment. During the last 40 years, there has been an increasing interest in alternative insecticides, particularly those derived from plants, commonly known as botanical insecticides. However, commercially available botanical insecticides remain limited. Rotenone is one of the earliest identified compounds and was used as fish poison and pest management. Due to its link with Parkinson disease, the use of rotenone was banned in many developed countries. Rotenone used to be isolated from Derris spp. and Lonchocarpus spp., and it can also be isolated from Tephrosia species. In this article, we present basic botanical information on selected Tephrosia species and their major compounds related to insecticidal activities and highlight the current use of extracts derived from some species, Tephrosia vogelii in particular, for control of insect pests in stored grains and crop production. The crude extracts contain multiple bioactive compounds, mainly rotenone, deguelin, rotenolone, and tephrosin, which act in either additive or synergistic fashion, resulting in effective control of insect pests. There are about 400 species in the genus Tephrosia, and species and even strains or variants vary greatly in these active compounds. We argue that a systematic evaluation of bioactive compounds in different species are needed, and species or strains with high insecticidal activities should be selected for use in the sustainable control of insect pests.

AB  - The effects of different dietary levels of algae (Sargassum angustifolium) extract were investigated on the antioxidant system of common carp, Cyprinus carpio. Fish (30.2 +/- 2.1 g) were fed 0 (control), 5, 10 and 15 g/kg basal diet of Sargassum angustifolium extract (SAE) for 60 days and then exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of diazinon (2 mg/l) for 24 h. The biochemical assays was conducted in two times including at the end of feeding period and after 24 h exposure to diazinon. According to the results, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the liver remained unchanged (P>0.01) during feeding period, while significantly increased in response to diazinon in control and fish fed 5 and 10 g/kg diet SAE (P<0.01). The hepatic metabolic enzymes (AST: Aspartate aminotransferase, ALT: alanine aminotransferase, LDH: lactate dehydrogenase, CK: creatine kinase) showed no significant changes in all groups during feeding period, while these enzymes increased in Non-SAE supplemented fish and those fed 5 and 10 g/kg SAE after exposure to diazinon (P<0.01). Although little elevations were observed in the activity of hepatic antioxidant enzymes (CAT: catalase, SOD: superoxide dismutase, GPx: Glutathione peroxidase) in fish fed SAE, these elevations were not significant (P>0.01). After exposure to diazinon, antioxidant enzymes significantly decreased in control and fish fed 5 g/kg diet SAE, while the fish of 10 and 15 g/kg diet SAE treatments showed significant elevations (P<0.01). The antioxidant-related genes (sod, cat, gpx) significantly expressed more in response to dietary SAE compared to control (P<0.01). After exposure to diazinon, all groups showed significant elevations in antioxidant-related genes (P<0.01). In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed the antioxidant enhancing effects of SAE at dietary levels of 10 and 15 g/kg diet, which this effect may be attributed to some antioxidant components in the chemical composition of the macro-algae or to the direct effect of SAE on antioxidant defence system of the fish.

AB  - Zebrafish represent an economical alternative to rodents for developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing. Mechanistic understanding is the key to successfully translating zebrafish findings to humans. In the present study, we used a well-known dopaminergic (DA) neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahy-dropyridine (MPTP) as a model chemical to uncover the molecular pathways for observed DNT effects. To enhance the specificity of potential molecular targets, we restricted our exposure to a concentration that is nonteratogenic yet exhibits high DNT effects and an exposure window sensitive to MPTP. Our DNT assessment based on a battery of motor and social behavioral tests revealed an effective concentration of 1 mu M and a sensitive window of 48-96 h postfertilization (hpf) for MPTP-induced hypoactivity. It is worth noting that this hypoactivity persisted into later larval development until 28 dpf. We observed increased cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and decreased ATP levels in larvae immediately after exposure at 96 hpf. Significant reductions of DA neurons were found in the retina at 72, 96, and 120 hpf. No visible deformity was found in motoneurons at 72, 96, and 120 hpf. Transcriptome analysis uncovered a novel pathway manifested by significant upregulation of genes enriched with erythropoiesis. Sensitive window exposure of MPTP and other DA neurotoxins rotenone and paraquat exhibited a concentration-dependent effect on transcriptional changes of embryonic hemoglobins and anemia. Given that anemia is a significant risk factor for Parkinson's disease and MPTP is known to cause parkinsonism in humans, we concluded that anemia resulting from dysregulation of primitive erythropoiesis during embryonic development might serve as a common mechanism underlying DA neurotoxin-induced DNT effects between zebrafish and humans.

AB  - The present communication deals with the effect of fenitrothion (0.04 ppm) on the carbohydrate metabolism of the european eel Anguilla anguilla and its recovery from intoxication. Analysis of various parameters such as glycogen, lactate and glucose was made on different eel tissues after 2, 8, 12, 24, 32, 48, 56, 72 and 96 hr of fenitrothion exposure. Subsequently, the fish were allowed recovery periods of 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 144 and 192 hr in clean water, and the same parameters were evaluated. Muscle glycogen content decreased significantly during the exposure time, while blood glucose levels increased markedly. Gill, muscle and blood lactate values increased during pesticide exposure. Most of the metabolic disorders did not persist after allowing recovery in clean water during less than a week. The observed effects of fenitrothion on fish metabolism are discussed in relation to a stress syndrome and probable reasons for alterations have been exposed.

AB  - Atrazine is the most commonly detected pesticide in ground and surface waters, with seasonal spikes that often exceed the Environmental Protection Agency's "Recommended Water Quality Criterion" of 350 parts per billion (ppb). Although numerous studies have shown atrazine produces adverse effects on growth, development, immune and endocrine system functions in a wide range of species, few describe gene expression changes concurrent with atrazine-induced changes in phenotype during development. In this report, developing Xenopus laevis tadpoles were chronically exposed to 400 ppb atrazine, an environmentally relevant concentration. Affymetrix microarrays and Taqman qRT-PCR were used to define gene expression changes that underlie atrazine-induced phenotypic alterations. Atrazine significantly reduced survival and growth (weight, length and fat body size) in male and female tadpoles. Microarray analysis showed atrazine altered expression of 44 genes in male tadpoles (18 upregulated, 26 downregulated) and 77 genes in female tadpoles (23 upregulated, 54 downregulated). Classification of the genes into functional groups showed the majority of genes were associated with the following biological functions: growth and metabolism, proteolysis, fibrinogen complex formation and immune regulation. Seven genes associated with immune system function, specifically defense molecules present in the skin (e.g. magainin II, levitide A, preprocarulein, skin granule protein), were significantly downregulated in female tadpoles. These results support the idea that environmental contaminants such as atrazine compromise important gene pathways during frog development that may, ultimately, be relevant to global amphibian decline.

AB  - The Yellow River carp (Cyprinus carpio haematopterus) is a vital economically farmed fish of the Cyprinidae family. With the development of intensive aquaculture, carp production has increased dramatically, leading to the frequent occurrence of various diseases. Cell lines are considered the most cost-effective resource for in vitro studies and are widely used for physiological and pathological studies because of accessibility and convenience. This research established a novel immortal cell line CCM (Yellow River carp muscle cells) derived from the carp muscle. CCM has been passed over 71 generations for 1 year. The morphology of CCM and the adhesion and extension processes were captured by light and electron microscopy. CCM were passaged every 3 days with 20% FBS DMEM/F12 at 1:3. The optimum conditions for CCM growth were 28 degrees C and 20% FBS concentration. DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA and COI showed that CCM was derived from carp. CCM positively reacts to anti-PAX7 and anti-MyoD antibodies of carp. Analysis of chromosomes revealed that the chromosomal pattern number of CCM was 100. Transfection experiment demonstrated that CCM might be utilized to express foreign genes. Furthermore, cytotoxicity testing showed that CCM was susceptible to Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sal-monicida, Aeromonas veronii, and Staphylococcus Aureus. The organophosphate pesticides (chlorpyrifos and glyphosate) or heavy metals (Hg, Cd, and Cu) exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity against CCM. After LPS treatment, the MyD88-IRAKs-NF & kappa;B pathway stimulates inflammatory-related factor il1 & beta;, il8, il10, and nf & kappa;b expression. LPS did not seem to cause oxidative stress in CCM, and the expression of cat and sod was not affected. Poly (I:C) through TLR3-TRIF-MyD88-TRAF6-NF & kappa;B and TRIF-TRAF3-TBK1-IRF3 activated the transcription of related factors, increased expression of anti-viral protein, but no changes in apoptosis-related genes. To our knowledge, this is the first muscle cell line in Yellow River carp and the first study on the immune response signal pathways of Yellow River carp based on the muscle cell line. CCM cell line provides a more rapid and efficient experimental material for fish immunology research, and this study preliminarily elucidated its immune response strategy to LPS and poly (I:C).

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the risk assessment, median lethal concentration LC50-96h, development, and mortality of Nile tilapiaOreochromis niloticuslarvae exposed to atrazine after stress management. An LC(50-96h)trial was carried out using fish (n = 147; 8.5 +/- 1.0 mg; seven larvae/aquarium), which were allocated randomly in 21 aquaria (1 L) and exposed to five concentrations of atrazine: 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 mg L(-1)plus one control (without herbicide) and a control with a solubility adjuvant (acetone). Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and total ammonia were measured daily. In addition, a stress test was performed with fish (n = 150; 17.9 +/- 1.7 mg; 10 larvae/aquarium) submitted to air exposition (five minutes) and posteriorly distributed randomly in 15 aquaria (1 L), and exposed to atrazine at 0.18, 6, 12, and 18 mg L-1. The LC(50-96h)of atrazine for Nile tilapia larvae was 17.87 mg L-1. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found for weight and final length, pH, and dissolved oxygen that was responsive to the increased levels of herbicide. Larvae mortality post-stress was registered to 6, 12, and 18 mg L(-1)of atrazine, and was more critical at 24 h. The increased doses of atrazine used in LC(50-96h)test depressed the development of Nile tilapia larvae. Fish submitted to stress (air exposition) and exposed to sub-lethal doses of atrazine showed significant mortality, indicating that stressors may increase the toxic effect of atrazine for Nile tilapia larvae. On the other hand, based on risk assessment atrazine can be classified as herbicide with low toxicity for Nile tilapia larvae and low toxicological risk.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a well-recognized anthropogenic xenoestrogen, has been identified as a causative agent responsible for inducing carcinogenicity, cognitive impairment, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, etc. However, BPA-induced neurotoxicity and its possible amelioration through natural compound intervention remain elusive. The current study was performed to elucidate the neumtoxic potential of BPA in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by waterborne exposure and its possible amelioration by quercetin co-supplementation. Protective effect of quercetin against BPA-induced altered neurobehavioral response, oxidative stress and neuromorphological changes were evaluated in zebrafish brain. The present findings reveal that BPA-induced altered neurobehavioral response was ameliorated by quercetin. Biochemical studies advocate the potential therapeutic efficacy of quercetin against BPA-induced oxidative stress in zebrafish brain. Quercetin also shows neuroprotection against BPA-induced augmented neuronal pyknosis in periventricular grey zone (PGZ) of zebrafish brain. These basic findings indicate that quercetin may act as an effective intervention against BPA-induced neurotoxicity in zebrafish through down-regulation of oxidative stress.

AB  - Background: Neurodegenerative diseases have been one of the major concerns for human health. Genetic and environmental factors are believed to be responsible for neuronal diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alz-heimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. It is difficult to restore normal nervous function after neuro -degeneration; hence, prevention could be the best strategy against these diseases. Ayurved medicines such as Suvarna Bhasma (SB) have enormous potential to treat these neurological diseases.Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the protective effect of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish. Materials and methods: In this study, we induced Parkinson's-like disease model in zebrafish by inducing it with rotenone (7 mu g/L). We examined the behavioural, proteomics and dopamine alterations of rotenone induced zebrafish of SB pre-treated group as compared to the control group.Results: The behavioural experiments showed that due to rotenone exposure, Parkinson's-like behavioural ab-normality was induced in zebrafish. However, because of SB treatment, this behavioural abnormality was reduced. The proteomics study of zebrafish brains clearly showed that the SB-treated group was not significantly affected due to rotenone exposure. However, in the SB non-treated group, expression of nine proteins that are linked to Parkinson's disease (gene name: sncgb, ywhae1, ywhah, uchl1, ywhaba, psma6a, ywhabl, ywhaqb, and ywhabb) were differentially expressed after rotenone exposure. Finally, prevention of dopamine alteration in SB-treated fish brains confirmed the protective action of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish. Conclusions: This study finds that Suvarna Bhasma has neuroprotective effects against Parkinson's-like disease model.

AB  - Acetochlor (ACT) is a widely detected pesticide globally, and the neurotoxic effects of its chiral isomers on humans and environmental organisms remain uncertain. Zebrafish were used to study the neurotoxicity of ACT and its chiral isomers. Our study reveals that the R-ACT, Rac-ACT, and S-ACT induce neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae by impairing vascular development and disrupting the blood-brain barrier. These detrimental effects lead to apoptosis in brain cells, hindered development of the central nervous system, and manifest as altered swimming behavior and social interactions in the larvae. Importantly, the neurotoxicity caused by the S-ACT exhibits the most pronounced impact and significantly diverges from the effects induced by the R-ACT. The neurotoxicity associated with the Rac-ACT falls intermediate between that of the R-ACT and S-ACT. Fascinat-ingly, we observed a remarkable recovery in the S-ACT-induced abnormalities in BBB, neurodevelopment, and behavior in zebrafish larvae upon supplementation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. This observation strongly suggests that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway serves as a major target of S-ACT-induced neuro-toxicity in zebrafish larvae. In conclusion, S-ACT significantly influences zebrafish larval neurodevelopment by inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, distinguishing it from R-ACT neurotoxic effects.

AB  - Tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol (TCPM) is a by-product in the manufacture of technical grade DDT, which is known to alter properties and functions of the female reproductive, system. We investigated whether in vitro TCPM has an influence on the function of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication (GJIC) and gap junction protein expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) in cultured bovine granulosa cells. GJIC was assessed by fluorescent dye microinjection (dye-coupling). After a 1-h exposure to TCPM at a concentration of 32 mum, a significant (P<0.05) reduction in dye coupling occurred. The same result was obtained with o,p'-DDT. At a concentration of 32 mum both pesticides were cytotoxic as indicated by significant (P<0.05) increased propidium iodide staining of the cell nuclei. Little or no effect on the stainable pattern of connexons occurred after 1 h incubation time, while after 3 h treatment from 16 to 64 km TCPM, a significant inhibition in the immunostaining resulted and the concentrations of 32 and 64 mum TCPM were cytotoxic for the granulosa cells. The freeze-fracture electron microscopy resulted in small differences in the morphology of gap junction plaques of cell cultures treated for 3 h with 8 or 16 mum TCPM in comparison to untreated cells. After treatment with 32 pm TCPM, gap junction plaques were very rarely detected and the lateral intramembraneous particles (IMP) distribution of many plasma membranes was strongly altered. Estimation of the cellular parameters may lead to an enhanced understanding of the mechanism of chemically induced toxicity by TCPM, that causes a general toxic effect on granulosa cells. We can conclude that TCPM is a toxic risk in the same manner as DDT. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Constant exposure to a variety of environmental factors has become increasingly problematic. A variety of illnesses are initiated or aided by the presence of certain perturbing factors. In the case of autism spectrum disorder, the environmental component plays an important part in determining the overall picture. Moreover, the lack of therapies to relieve existing symptoms complicates the fight against this condition. As a result, animal models have been used to make biomedical research easier and more suited for disease investigations. The current study used zebrafish as an animal model to mimic a real-life scenario: acute exposure to an increased dose of pesticides, followed by prospective intervention-based therapy with vitamin B-12 (vit. B-12). It is known that vit. B-12 is involved in brain function nerve tissue, and red blood cell formation. Aside from this, the role of vit. B-12 in the redox processes is recognized for its help against free radicals. To investigate the effect of vit. B-12, fish were divided into four different groups and exposed to a pesticide mixture (600 mu g L-1 fipronil + 600 mu g L-1 pyriproxyfen) and 0.24 mu g L-1 vit. B-12 for 14 days. The impact of the compounds was assessed daily with EthoVision XT 11.5 software for behavioral observations, especially for sociability, quantified by the social interaction test. In addition, at the end of the study, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. The results showed significant improvements in locomotor activity parameters and a positive influence of the vitamin on sociability. Regarding the state of oxidative stress, high activity was found for SOD and GPx in the case of vit. B-12, while fish exposed to the mixture of pesticides and vit. B-12 had a lower level of MDA. In conclusion, the study provides new data about the effect of vit. B-12 in zebrafish, highlighting the potential use of vitamin supplementation to maintain and support the function of the organism.

AB  - Toxicity imposed by organophosphate pesticides to the freshwater cultivable fish species mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala) was assessed under laboratory conditions. Healthy juveniles were exposed to chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, and their equitoxic mixture in geometric series. Median lethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos were found to be 0.906 (0.689-1.179), 0.527 (0.433-0.633), 0.435 (0.366-0.517) and 0.380 (0.319-0.450) mg/L and dichlorvos were found to be 38.432 (33.625-47.866), 22.477 (19.047-26.646), 12.442 (9.619-14.196) and 11.367 (9.496-13.536) mg/L after 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h of exposure respectively. Surprisingly, the joint toxicity of these organophosphates in the binary mixture was less than additive during most of the exposure periods. Behavioral changes exhibited by individual as well as mixture pesticide treatments were loss of schooling behavior, aggregating at corners of the test chamber, elevated opercular beatings, surplus mucus secretion, slight color changes and sudden and rapid body movements before death. Loss of fish equilibrium was noticed only in chlorpyrifos treated fish, whereas sluggish behavior was noticed only in mixture pesticide treatment. Such behavioral studies can be applied as a non-invasive bio-monitoring tool for water quality assessment for fish growth and development. Despite the same mode of action of both pesticides, the antagonistic action in the binary mixture is an interesting outcome of this research that requires further investigation for a lucid understanding of the joint toxicity mechanism of such pesticides.

AB  - In this study the black worm Lumbriculus variegatus was tested for suitability as biomonitor for moderately contaminated sediments. The response capacity of the biotransformation system phase II enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and the oxidative defense enzyme catalase (CAT) to contaminated sediment and atrazine was investigated to establish them as sensitive biomarkers. To get an integrated view on the enzyme activity kinetics, increasing concentrations of the herbicide atrazine were applied to stimulate GST response, and relationship between enzyme activity and herbicide concentration was observed at various exposure durations. Furthermore , animals were exposed for up to 1 week to sediments Of four typical urban river sections with high anthropogenic impact. L. variegatus was capable to accomplish the environmental stress and the selected enzymes showed elevation. Significant changes of GST (membrane-bound and Soluble) were detected after at least 4 days Of exposure to atrazine and contaminated sediments. Although CAT increase could be observed already after 1 day of exposure to sediments, an exposure tirne of one week is considerable for accurate interpretation of the enzymatic response. The clear enzymatic response of especially the membrane-bound GST indicated charges with organic lipophilic substances at all sampling sites. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study was aimed to evaluate the toxicological effect on antioxidant defense system in Monopterus cuchia induced by commercial formulation of Glyphosate EXCEL MERA 71. In the study, fish were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of 1 and 2 mg L-1. LC50 value for glyphosate at 96 h exposure could not be determined because no fish mortality was observed even at the maximum concentration tested 200 mg L-1. After 6, 24, 96 and 168 h of exposure, there were significant decrease in the level of red blood cells, haemoglobin concentration and a significant increase in white blood cells count in both treated groups. The enzyme alanine aminotransferase decreased whereas aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase showed increase in comparison to control which were analyzed in serum. The fish showed transient decrease in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and the non-enzymatic antioxidant reduced glutathione showed repressed activity after glyphosate exposure. However, glutathione-S-transferase activity significantly increased in kidney and intestine and decreased in liver in treated groups. Moreover, the present study also investigated the possible stimulation of heat shock protein 70 ( Hsp70) mRNA and glyphosate exposure led to a significant increase in the levels of mRNA transcript in liver and kidney.

AB  - Aquatic organisms are susceptible throughout their lives to chemical and physical stressors, which negatively affect their health. Various aquatic pollutants derived from industrial effluents, overuse of some agricultural pesticides, herbicides and insecticides may cause devastating toxicological aspects of aquatic organisms and deteriorate their health and growth. They also led to oxidative stress to fish due to the stimulation of the production of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the need for using natural antioxidants to be used as feed additives is of great importance to counteract the hazardous oxidative stress responses. The use of phytochemicals, which characterized by substantial antioxidative effects, has been raised. Lycopene is the principal carotenoid pigment found in tomatoes and their products, vegetables and red fruits. Numerous studies have recommended the use of lycopene as a powerful antioxidant to attenuate the oxidative stress responses in several fish species exposed to various toxicants or any other stress conditions. Lycopene maintains the health condition of fish by enhancing the immune and antioxidative responses. This review article aimed to elucidate the current information about the potential use of dietary lycopene for several fish species and its capability to attenuate the oxidative stress and haemato-immunological alterations resulted from aquatic environmental pollutants and other physical stressors. Additionally, the review discusses some aspects regarding the lycopene mode of action to assess the profits that would be of importance in the aquaculture industry.

AB  - Although dietary concerns of Laurentian Great Lakes (GL) fish focus on the risk from persistent bioaccumulative toxicant (PBT) contaminants, fish are also an important source of nutrients beneficial to human health such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic acid). This study presents PBT trend data from the GL tribal fisheries over the past 20years. PBT contaminants (282 analytes) from fillet portions of lake trout and whitefish were analyzed for trending patterns from 1992 to 2011 and are reported on five of the ATSDR/USEPA Great Lakes biomonitoring legacy contaminants (Hg, sigma DDE, sigma DDT, HCB, mirex, and sigma PCBs), two of the optional biomonitoring PBTs (toxaphene and sigma dioxins/furans) and PCB 153 as a specific congener marker. Similar to other recent reports our data indicate that most PBT contaminant concentrations in the GL biota have decreased, which may indicate progress in reducing environmental emissions. Our research confirms that all contaminants demonstrate significant declines except Hg and toxaphene. Both of those remained constant after correcting for known independent factors of age, lipid, and size. These results are potentially encouraging and may provide useful data for the long distance and perhaps global influences of PBTs on the safety of fish consumption.

AB  - Marine pollutants bioaccumulate at high trophic levels of marine food webs and are transferred to humans through consumption of apex species. Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) are marine predators, and one of largest commercial fisheries in the world. Previous studies have shown that yellowfin tuna can accumulate high levels of persistent organic pollutants, including Transporter Interfering Chemicals (TICs), which are chemicals shown to bind to mammalian xenobiotic transporters and interfere with their function. Here, we examined the extent to which these same compounds might interfere with the activity of the yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) ortholog of this transporter. To accomplish this goal we identified, expressed, and functionally assayed tuna ABCB1. The results demonstrated a common mode of vertebrate ABCB1 interaction with TICs that predicts effects across these species, based on high conservation of specific interacting residues. Importantly several TICs showed potent inhibition of Ta-ABCB1, such as the organochlorine pesticides Endrin (EC50 = 1.2 +/- 0.2 mu M) and Mirex (EC50 = 2.3 +/- 0.9 mu M). However, unlike the effects observed on mouse ABCB1, low concentrations of the organochlorine pesticide TICs p,p'-DDT and its metabolite p,p'-DDD co-stimulated verapamil-induced Ta-ABCB1 ATPase activity possibly suggesting a low transport activity for these ligands in tuna. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the potential vulnerability of tuna to these ubquitous pollutants.

AB  - BACKGROUND Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense) is one of the weeds that evolves resistance to glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)-glycine], the most widely used herbicide, and the weed may cause agronomic troublesome in the southern USA. This paper reports a study on developing a hyperspectral plant sensing approach to explore the spectral features of glyphosate-resistant (GR) and glyphosate-sensitive (GS) plants to evaluate this approach using machine learning algorithms to differentiate between GR and GS plants. RESULTS On average, GR plants have higher spectral reflectance compared with GS plants. The sensitive spectral bands were optimally selected using the successive projections algorithm respectively wrapped with the machine learning algorithms of k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) with Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) to classify between GS and GS plants. At 3 weeks after transplanting (WAT) KNN and SVM could not acceptably classify the GR and GS plants but they improved significantly with the stages to have their overall accuracies reaching 73% and 77%, respectively, at 5 WAT. RF and FLDA had a better ability to classify the plants at 3 WAT but RF was low in accuracy at 2 WAT while FLDA dropped accuracy to 50% at 4 WAT from 57% at 3 WAT and raised it to 73% at 5 WAT. CONCLUSIONS Previous studies were conducted developing the hyperspectral imaging approach to differentiate GR Palmer amaranth from GS Palmer amaranth and GR Italian ryegrass from GS Italian ryegrass with classification accuracies of 90% and 80%, respectively. This study demonstrated that the hyperspectral plant sensing approach could be developed to differentiate GR johnsongrass from glyphosate-sensitive GS johnsongrass with the highest classification accuracy of 77%. The comparison with our previous studies indicated that the similar hyperspectral approach could be used and transferred from classification across different GR and GS weed biotypes, such as Palmer amaranth, Italian ryegrass and johnsongrass, so it is highly possible for classification of more other GR and GS weed biotypes as well. On the basis of classic pattern recognition approaches the process of plant classification can be enhanced by modeling using machine learning algorithms.

AB  - In this study, the cDNA fragments of cytokines (i1-8) and toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway signaling molecules (myd88, irak-1, irf5, and irj7) in the Chinese rare minnow were cloned and exhibited a high amino-acid sequence identity compared to other cyprinid fish orthologs. The mRNA expressions of these genes in the different tissues (liver, brain, spleen, kidney, and skin) were observed. The highest expression levels of myd88, irak-1, and irf5 were detected in the spleen, whereas iI-8 and irf7 were detected in the kidney and liver respectively. The mRNA expression of irak-1, irf5, and irf7 in the liver from 0.1 mu g/L. and 0.5 mu g/L CPF treatments were significantly increased on day 7 (p < 0.05), whereas the levels of only irak-1 and irf7 were markedly increased on day 28 (p < 0.05). Moreover, the mRNA expression of il-8 in the spleen following 0.5 mu g/L CPF treatments was significantly decreased on day 7 (p < 0.05), whereas significantly decrease were observed in the levels of irf7 in the spleen at 2.5 mu g/L CPF on days 7 and 28 (p < 0.05). The 0.1 mu g/t. and 0.5 mu g/L of CPF significantly induced the levels of irak-1 and myd88 in the spleen after 28 d exposure (p < 0.05). Therefore, the high induction of cytokines and TLR pathway signaling molecules demonstrated that Chinese rare minnow was immune-compromised exposed to CPF. Moreover, our finding indicated that these immune-related genes could be feasible to screen for substances hazardous to the immune system of fish. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mitochondria are central players in host immunometabolism as they function not only as metabolic hubs but also as signaling platforms regulating innate immunity. Environmental exposures to mitochondrial toxicants occur widely and are increasingly frequent. Exposures to these mitotoxicants may pose a serious threat to organismal health and the onset of diseases by disrupting immunometabolic pathways. In this study, we investigated whether the Complex I inhibitor rotenone could alter C. elegans immunometabolism and disease susceptibility. C. elegans embryos were exposed to rotenone (0.5 mu M) or DMSO (0.125%) until they reached the L4 larval stage. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by rotenone and disruption of mitochondrial metabolism were evidenced by rotenone-induced detrimental effects on mitochondrial efficiency and nematode growth and development. Next, through transcriptomic analysis, we investigated if this specific but mild mitochondrial stress that we detected would lead to the modulation of immunometabolic pathways. We found 179 differentially expressed genes (DEG), which were mostly involved in detoxification, energy metabolism, and pathogen defense. Interestingly, among the down-regulated DEG, most of the known genes were involved in immune defense, and most of these were identified as commonly upregulated during P. aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, rotenone increased susceptibility to the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14). However, it increased resistance to Salmonella enterica (SL1344). To shed light on potential mechanisms related to these divergent effects on pathogen resistance, we assessed the activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), a well-known immunometabolic pathway in C. elegans which links mitochondria and immunity and provides resistance to pathogen infection. The UPRmt pathway was activated in rotenone-treated nematodes further exposed for 24 h to the pathogenic bacteria P. aeruginosa and S. enterica or the common bacterial food source Escherichia coli (OP50). However, P. aeruginosa alone suppressed UPRmt activation and rotenone treatment rescued its activation only to the level of DMSO-exposed nematodes fed with E. coli. Module-weighted annotation bioinformatics analysis was also consistent with UPRmt activation in rotenone-exposed nematodes consistent with the UPR being involved in the increased resistance to S. enterica. Together, our results demonstrate that the mitotoxicant rotenone can disrupt C. elegans immunometabolism in ways likely protective against some pathogen species but sensitizing against others.

AB  - Many classes of environmental pollutants can enhance the intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species, which can conduce to the damage of macromolecules and changes in oxidant defences levels in fish. In the present study it was analysed the hepatic levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in males and females of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus exposed to paraquat (PQ), at 17 and 27 degrees C. Tilapia were exposed to a sublethal concentration of PQ (0.5 mg L-1) during 45 days. Condition factor and hepatosomatic index of males and females exposed to PQ were significantly higher when compared with the control group, except in females at 17 degrees C. SOD and GST activities were higher in males and females exposed to PQ than in the control group at 17 and 27 degrees C. The levels of both enzyme activities revealed that they are sex-dependent with males exposed to PQ showing higher SOD activity (5.05 +/- 0.13 and 4.84 +/- 0.23 U/g protein, respectively at 17 and 27 degrees C) than females (4.21 +/- 0.07 and 3.87 +/- 0.27 U/g protein, respectively at the same temperature). Similar results were observed in GST activity. A GR activity significantly higher (9.09 +/- 0.44 and 7.97 +/- 1.08 U/g protein at 17 and 27 degrees C, respectively) was observed in PQ-exposed females, but not in exposed males. Fish exposed to PQ showed higher values of SOD and GST activities than the control group at both temperatures. These results are gender-dependent, while GR activity was higher only in PQ-exposed females. No significant differences were found for SOD, GST and GR activities between fish exposed to 17 and 27 'C, although males and females showed higher values at 17 'C. In short, this work advanced new knowledge on influence of gender in same biochemical parameters in tilapia exposed to PQ and demonstrated that their effects could be observed at different temperatures.

AB  - Aphanizomenon flos-aquae secretes paralytic shellfish poisons (PSPs), termed aphantoxins, and endangers environmental and human health via eutrophication of water worldwide. Although the molecular mechanism of neuronal PSP toxicity has been well studied, several issues remain unresolved, notably the in vivo hepatic antioxidative responses to this neurotoxin. Aphantoxins extracted from a natural isolate of A. flos-aquae DC-1 were resolved by high performance liquid chromatography. The primary components were gonyautoxins 1 and 5 and neosaxitoxin. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated intraperitoneally with either 53 or 7.61 (low and high doses, respectively) mu g saxitoxin (STX) equivalents (eq)/kg of A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins. Antioxidative responses in zebrafish liver were examined at different timepoints 1-24 h post-exposure. Aphantoxin administration significantly enhanced hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content 1-12 h post-exposure, indicative of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. By contrast, levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in zebrafish liver declined significantly after 3-24 h exposure, suggesting that GSH participates in MDA metabolism. A significant upregulation of the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was observed, suggesting that aphantoxins induce lipid peroxidation in zebrafish liver and are likely to be hepatotoxic. Hepatic levels of MDA and GSH, and of the three enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx), therefore provide potential biomarkers for studying environmental exposure to aphantoxins/PSPs from cyanobacterial blooms.

AB  - The effects of concentration (1, 10, 100 mu g/L) and duration (4, 8, 12 h) of exposure to carbofuran were assessed on the swimming activity, social interactions, and behavioral responses of goldfish to a flow (0.1 L/min) of water, with or without chironomids. Observations were also made on the behavioral responses of unexposed goldfish to a flow (0.1 L/min) of carbofuran-contaminated water. A 4-h exposure of gold fish 1 mu g/L carbofuran produced a significant increase in sheltering, burst swimming, and nipping. Responses were enhanced at 100 mu g/L. After a 12-h exposure, the behavioral effects of 1 mu g/L carbofuran were less apparent. However, burst swimming at 10 mu g/L, and sheltering, nipping and burst swimming at 100 mu g/L, were still significantly increased after a 12-h exposure to carbofuran. Grouping was not consistently affected by exposure conditions. Chemical attraction to a filtrate of chironomids was significantly reduced after the 4-h exposure to 1 mu g/L carbofuran. Decreased attraction to the food extract was less apparent after the 12-h exposure, except at 100 mu g/L carbofuran. A significant decrease in attraction to a flow of uncontaminated water was also observed after a 4-h exposure to 10 and 100 mu g/L carbofuran. Unexposed goldfish did not show avoidance reaction to a flow of carbofuran-contaminated water, even at a concentration (10 mg/L) exceeding the mean 96-h LC-50 in cyprinids (0.5-1 mg/L). However, at all concentrations tested (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L), goldfish quickly reacted to the introduction of the solution of carbofuran by increased burst swimming and nipping. These results are discussed in the light of the data concerning behavioral and neurotoxic effects of carbamate and organophosphorous insecticides in fish.

AB  - While the spatial distribution pattem of fish is increasingly used for toxicological test of chemicals or wastewater, no ideal parameter is available for quantitative assessment of spatial distribution, especially uneven distribution with multiple hotspots. Here, to develop a quantitative assessment parameter for spatial distribution, the zebrafish were exposed to ethanol, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), paraquat dichloride (paraquat) and wastewater, followed by a behavioral test in a narrow tank. Behavioral data was acquired and analyzed by idTracker and MATLAB. By comparing the effects of all treatments on behavior parameters, we confirmed that the spatial distribution was more easily altered rather than general locomotor parameters, e.g. 0.7-70 mg/L PTZ and 5-20 mg/L paraquat being effective for altering spatial distribution but having little effects on general locomotor parameters. Based on the heatmap, i.e., the cumulative proportion of grids and that of frequency in grids, we calculated the behavioral Gini coefficient (Gb) for quantitative assessment of fish spatial distribution. The Gini coefficient ranged from zero to 1, with larger values meaning poorer evenness of spatial distribution. Of note, Gb showed smaller coefficient of variations (CV) with 3%-19% between replicate tanks in all treatments than the highest frequency (4%-79%), displaying well robustness. Especially, Gb addressed the challenge of the complicated heatmap with multiple hotspots. Overall, the behavioral Gini coefficient we established is an ideal parameter to quantitatively assess spatial distribution of fish shoal, which is expected to be applied in toxicity testing for chemicals and wastewater and automatic quality monitoring for surface water and aquaculture water.

AB  - The majority of ecotoxicological studies performed measure average responses from individuals which do not account for the inter-individual variation in the responses of animals to environmental stimuli (i.e. the personality of individuals). Thus, these designs assume that all individuals will respond to contaminant exposure in a similar manner. Additionally, commonly used constant, static exposure regime designs neglect to recognize the spatial and temporal variation in contaminant plume structures as they move throughout fluid environments. The purpose of this study was to understand the effects of the structural characteristics (concentration, duration, and frequency) of temporally and spatially variant contaminant plumes on the personality of individuals. This experimental design aimed to construct a sensitive definition of exposure by connecting sublethal effects of toxicants and realistic exposure regimes. This study used escape response of Faxonius virilis crayfish from the predatory odor of Micropterus saltnoides prior to and following exposure to the herbicide, atrazine. Atrazine was delivered in pulses to flow through exposure arenas for a total of 47 h while manipulating the concentration, frequency, and duration of the herbicide pulses. Escape response of crayfish prior to exposure was used to categorize animals into bold and shy personalities. The change in escape response was analyzed and resulted in a personality-dependent behavioral sensitivity to the polluted environment. Individuals classified as bold showed increased change in response to predatory odor relative to shy animals. Bold animals exhibited decreased activity after exposure where no change was presented in shy individuals. Shifts in individual behavior have impacts on the population level (e.g. resource acquisition/value; interspecies competition) and the ecosystem level (e.g. food web dynamics; trophic cascades). This study demonstrates the importance of sensitive measures in ecological risk assessment methods.

AB  - Fipronil is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fipronil in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 10 February 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 15 July 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises seed dressing to control soil insects and wireworms in sunflower and maize at application rate up 30 g fipronil per hectare for sunflower (up to 500 g fipronil per 100 kg seeds) and up to 50 g per hectare for maize (up to 250 g per 100 kg seeds), respectively. It should be noted that due to the fact that the applicant has changed, some representative uses are not longer supported for the EU review by the new applicant. Fipronil can be used as insecticide and acaricide. It should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated that only the use as insecticide will be supported in the EU review programme.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Regent 500FS" ("EXP80415A"), a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS), registered in some Member States of the EU. The WG-and the GB formulation (EXP60720A and EXP61840A, respectively) are not longer supported for the EU review process (i.e. with respect to Annex I inclusion) by the new applicant. However, the submitted data package was evaluated in the DAR, but the peer review was not completed.
   Adequate methods to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition are available only for food and air. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-residue method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of fipronil.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Rapidly and extensively absorbed and distributed, fipronil may bioaccumulate but is readily metabolised, and slowly excreted via faeces. Fipronil is toxic by oral, inhalation and dermal acute exposure. It is slightly skin and eye irritating, and weakly sensitising, but not sufficiently to be classified. The proposed classification is T, R23/24/25 "Toxic by inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed".
   Adverse effects in the short term studies are observed in the central nervous system, liver and thyroid. The proposed classification by ECB is T, R48/25 "Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed", to be voted in the 30th ATP. No genotoxic or carcinogenic potential is demonstrated. The mechanism for induction of thyroid tumours was discussed by the experts and considered rat specific and not relevant to humans.
   Neither reproductive or developmental toxicity is observed. In specific neurotoxicity studies, no histopathological findings are observed in the nervous system.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.0035 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) 0.009 mg/kg bw, with a safety factor of 100.
   As the use of the Seed Tropex model was considered not fully appropriate by the experts, the operator exposure was evaluated with a field study, resulting in an exposure below the AOEL without PPE. Worker exposure is 89% of the AOEL without PPE, for a 8-hour working day. Bystander exposure is not likely to be an issue for seed treatments and has to be addressed at Member State level.
   The metabolism of fipronil has been investigated on five different crops representative for cereals, pulses and oilseed, roots and tubers using either soil applications or seed treatment. A common metabolic pathway could be defined for the three crop groups tested and a relevant metabolite (sulfone metabolite MB 46136) was demonstrated to be present. Even though there were concerns on an acutely toxic by oral administration photo degradation product of fipronil, MB 46513, the experts' meeting on residues concluded that the compound is basically not relevant in relation to seed treatment uses. However, a label restriction has been proposed to ensure that treated seed remains stored in the dark to prevent photo degradation processes. In supervised residue trails no residues of fipronil and of its sulfone metabolite were observed at harvest of maize grain and sunflower seed. Trials results are suitable to propose MRLs at LOQ level. Even though calculated animal intakes were well below the trigger of 0.1 mg/kg, there is a need to consider residues in animal products since fipronil is classified fat soluble and the ADI is very low. Based on the available livestock metabolism and feeding studies, MRLs for food of animal origin were proposed.
   In a consumer risk assessment the TMDI was demonstrated to exceed the ADI for toddlers and infants, mainly due to the fact that milk consumption accounted for the most significant contribution of pesticide intake in terms of the total dietary assessment. However, in a refined chronic dietary risk assessment the IEDI/NEDI was below the ADI for all considered consumer groups (adults, toddles, infants) and thus, it is unlikely that exposure to fipronil and fipronil sulfone residues from seed treatment will pose a high chronic risk to consumers. In an acute dietary risk assessment the estimated exposure of all considered consumer groups was well below the proposed ARfD. Under laboratory aerobic conditions fipronil is moderate to high persistent in soil. Major metabolites are the amide RPA 200766(3), the sulphone MB 46136(4) and the sulphide MB 45950(5). Mineralization is very low.
   Under dark aerobic conditions at metabolite RPA 20076(6) is high persistent, RPA 200761(6) moderate to high persistent, MB 45950 medium to high persistent, MB 46136 high persistent and MB 46513(7) moderate to medium persistent. Most of the measured half lives are longer than the duration of the studies and therefore uncertain.
   Photolysis may contribute slightly to the environmental dissipation of fipronil in soil yielding two metabolites not previously detected in the dark aerobic degradation studies: MB 46513 (more acutely orally toxic than fipronil) and RPA 104615(8).
   Available field studies confirmed that fipronil is medium to high persistent in soil when not exposed to light (soil incorporated). When exposed to light the toxic metabolite MB 46513 is detected. Two field accumulation studies were submitted by the applicant after the DAR was finalised. A clear tendency for accumulation of fipronil metabolites is demonstrated. Plateau for metabolites had not been reached after the five or six years of repeated applications. The PEC soil calculation submitted by the applicant after the DAR was finalised do not represents a worst case with respect to the parent compound. Furthermore, the assumptions taken in the calculation are not well justified. Calculation of the initial and 21 d TWA-PECS for the parent compound and soil metabolites are also needed to finalise the ecotoxicological risk assessment. According adsorption / desorption studies fipronil is low to medium mobile, MB 45950 and MB 46136 are immobile to low mobile, MB 46513 is low mobile and RPA 200766 is medium to high mobile.
   Hydrolysis will not contribute to the degradation of fipronil in the environment. However, photolysis may contribute to the degradation of fipronil and its major metabolites in water. Fipronil is not readily biodegradable in water.
   In water/sediment system fipronil is adsorbed on the sediment where degrades to MB 45950. In the water phase fipronil and the major metabolite RPA 200766 reached levels above 10 % AR.
   PECSW/SED were provided by the applicant after the DAR was finalised. However, new calculations are needed with parameters updated following FOCUS guidance. New PECGW were provided by the applicant after the DAR had been finalized. Only the application rate of 50 g/ha for maize has been simulated. Results of these new calculations show that metabolite RPA 200766 exceeds the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L for five of the seven scenarios simulated. This metabolite has been assessed to be not toxicological relevant (see 2.8) but it is considered ecotoxicological relevant (see 5.2). Due to the deviations with respect to guidelines on the input parameters selection and the need of justification for the use of field kinetic parameters a data gap for new FOCUS PECGW calculation with appropriate input parameters has been identified.
   Long range transport and deposition of fipronil may be considered negligible.
   A high acute, short and long term risks to granivorous birds were identified in the first tier risk assessment for the representative use as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower. The risk to birds should focus on the acute and short term risk as there is no indication that fipronil is a reproductive toxin. A new risk assessment for granivorous birds taking into account the concerns raised at the EPCO 27 experts' meeting is required. The risk to small and large granivorous birds must be quantified. The current proposed extrapolation from maize to sunflowers is not acceptable.
   Also for granivorous mammals a high acute and long term risk were identified in the first tier risk assessment for the representative use as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower. A revised risk assessment for granivorous mammals taking into account the concerns raised at EPCO 27 is required. The availability of treated seeds for mammals should be assessed to indicate whether mice consumed drilled maize and sunflower seeds. The risk to granivorous birds and mammals from the use of fipronil as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower can only be concluded once recently submitted data are evaluated.
   The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from the representative uses of fipronil as a seed dressing is considered to be low.
   The risk to earthworm and fish-eating birds and mammals can be considered low based on the currently available PECs and PECsw-values. The risk to earthworm and fish eating birds and mammals from the representative uses with the FS formulation can not be concluded due to still open questions regarding the calculation of PEC in surface water and soil.
   The risk to aquatic organisms is based on the most sensitive species, Mysidopsis bahia. If the applicant would like to pursue the argument that marine species are more sensitive than freshwater species then a more robust justification must be provided. The risk to aquatic organisms from the representative uses with the FS formulation can not be concluded due to still open questions regarding the calculation of PECsw values. Based on the available provisional PECsw values a high acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms was identified for the representative use as a seed treatment in maize. The risk to aquatic organisms for the representative use in sunflower can be regarded as low. The RMS proposed to refine the long term risk by using an endpoint for M. bahia from a study in the presence of sediment. The EFSA considers that in order to accept this refinement option, an assessment in line with the conclusion of the PPR Panel on dimoxystrobin should be presented. The experts' meeting agreed that it might be possible to reduce the standard uncertainty factor due to the number of species tested. The EFSA would like to refer to the opinion of the PPR Panel regarding the reduction of the uncertainty due to the availability of several single species studies and proposes to take this opinion into account at MS-level. Based on the present PECsw values the risk from the metabolites MB 46136, MB 45950 and RPA 200766 for the representative uses as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower can be regarded as low except for the long term risk to aquatic invertebrates from MB 46136 in maize. Also for the refinement of this risk the EFSA would like to refer to the opinion of the PPR Panel on the lowering of aquatic trigger values. The risk for bioaccumulation in fish from fipronil is considered to be low. The EFSA proposes that a study on bioaccumulation in fish from the metabolites MB 46136, MB 45950 and RPA 200766 should be submitted as the Log Pow of these metabolites exceeds 3.
   A very high acute contact and oral toxicity of fipronil to bees were observed in the laboratory toxicity studies. The metabolite MB 46136 showed a similar toxicity to bees as fipronil and the metabolite RPA 200761 showed a lower toxicity to bees than fipronil. The EPCO experts' meeting considered the risk to adult bees for the representative uses as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower addressed based on the low exposure situation observed in monitoring studies and the observation of no adverse effects in the tunnel studies. The risk to bees can only be concluded once recently submitted data on the risk to bee brood are evaluated. Furthermore the EFSA would like to highlight that the available monitoring studies were mainly performed in France and MS should consider the relevance of these studies for the circumstances in their country.
   A high toxicity to NTA was observed in the laboratory. The EPCO experts' meeting identified the need for a new risk assessment for soil dwelling arthropods taking into account final results from the ongoing aged residue studies on A. bilineata and F. candida. This assessment should cover the potential for recovery of impacted species in the field. Furthermore the meeting noted that the risk assessment should cover the plateau soil PEC for total residues (parent + metabolites). The risk to non-target arthropods from the representative uses with the FS formulation can only be concluded once recently submitted studies on A. bilineata and F. candida are evaluated and the open questions for the calculation of PECsoil have been solved.
   The risk to soil macro-organisms can be considered low at a concentration of 0.785 mg a.s./kg soil and the risk to soil micro-organisms can be considered as low at a concentration of 0.667 mg a.s./kg soil for fipronil and 0.60, 0.133 and 0.267 mg/kg soil for MB 46136, MB 45950 and RPA 200766 respectively. The risk to soil non-target macro-and micro-organisms from the representative uses with the FS formulation can not be concluded due to still open questions regarding the calculation of PECsoil.
   The risk to earthworms, non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low.

AB  - Chronic exposure to paraquat (Pq), a toxic herbicide, can result in Parkinsonian symptoms. This study evaluated the effect of the systemic administration of Pq on locomotion, learning and memory, social interaction, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels, and dopamine transporter (DAT) gene expression in zebrafish. Adult zebrafish received an i.p. injection of either 10mg/kg (Pq10) or 20mg/kg (Pq20) of Pq every 3 days for a total of six injections. Locomotion and distance traveled decreased at 24h after each injection in both treatment doses. In addition, both Pq10- and Pq20-treated animals exhibited differential effects on the absolute turn angle. Nonmotor behaviors were also evaluated, and no changes were observed in anxiety-related behaviors or social interactions in Pq-treated zebrafish. However, Pq-treated animals demonstrated impaired acquisition and consolidation of spatial memory in the Y-maze task. Interestingly, dopamine levels increased while DOPAC levels decreased in the zebrafish brain after both treatments. However, DAT expression decreased in the Pq10-treated group, and there was no change in the Pq20-treated group. The amount of TH protein showed no significant difference in the treated group. Our study establishes a new model to study Parkinson-associated symptoms in zebrafish that have been chronically treated with Pq.

AB  - It is not feasible to conduct toxicity tests with all species that may be impacted by chemical exposures. Therefore, cross-species extrapolation is fundamental to environmental risk assessment. Recognition of the impracticality of generating empirical, whole organism, toxicity data for the extensive universe of chemicals in commerce has been an impetus driving the field of predictive toxicology. We describe a strategy that leverages expanding databases of molecular sequence information together with identification of specific molecular chemical targets whose perturbation can lead to adverse outcomes to support predictive species extrapolation. This approach can be used to predict which species may be more (or less) susceptible to effects following exposure to chemicals with known modes of action (e.g., pharmaceuticals, pesticides). Primary amino acid sequence alignments are combined with more detailed analyses of conserved functional domains to derive the predictions. This methodology employs bioinformatic approaches to automate, collate, and calculate quantitative metrics associated with cross-species sequence similarity of key molecular initiating events (MIEs). Case examples focused on the actions of (a) 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol on the human (Homo sapiens) estrogen receptor; (b) permethrin on the mosquito (Aedes aegypti)voltage-gated para-like sodium channel; and (c) 17 beta-trenbolone on the bovine (Bos taurus) androgen receptor are presented to demonstrate the potential predictive utility of this species extrapolation strategy. The examples compare empirical toxicity data to cross-species predictions of intrinsic susceptibility based on analyses of sequence similarity relevant to the MIEs of defined adverse outcome pathways. Through further refinement, and definition of appropriate domains of applicability, we envision practical and routine utility for the molecular target similarity-based predictive method in chemical risk assessment, particularly where testing resources are limited.

AB  - In this study, it was aim to investigate oxidative stress in scaly carp (Cyprinus carpio) exposed to delthamethrin in different temperatures. For this purpose, fish were stocked to six different glass aquarium which was adjusted to 23 degrees C water temperature with adjustable thermostat heaters. After fifteen days adaptation period, temperatures of two aquarium were decreased to 18 degrees C, while temperatures of the other two were increased to 28 degrees C. These groups were exposed to 0.036 mu g/L concentration of deltamethrin for 14 days. At the end of the experimental period, the liver and gills were taken. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level as an indicator of lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH) level and glutathione S- transferase (GST) activity were determined in these samples. The MDA levels were increased in the liver and gill of the groups at 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C when compared to the control group. The liver and gill MDA levels of the groups treated deltamethrin simultaneously with the change in temperature were higher than the groups at 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C. This increase was also observed in the group treated deltamethrin at 23 degrees C. The GSH levels and GST activities were decreased in the liver and gill of the groups at 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C when compared to the control group. The GSH level and GST activity of the groups treated deltamethrin simultaneously with the change in temperature were lower than the groups at 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C. This increase was also observed in the group treated deltamethrin at 23 degrees C.

AB  - Recently, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fish farmers have applied a combination of deltamethrin and azamethiphos in high-concentration and short-duration immersion treatment to improve protection against sea-lice (Lepeophtheirus sp.). In this work we aimed to study the effects of deltamethrin, alone or in combination with azamethiphos, on the transcription of stress and detoxification marker genes. Atlantic salmon kept at 12 degrees C (one group was also kept at 4-5 degrees C) were treated with deltamethrin alone or in combination with azamethiphos for a total of 40 min, and gill and liver tissue harvested for transcriptional analysis 2 and 24 h post treatment. No lethality was observed during the experiment. The result showed that deltamethrin, alone or in combination with azamethiphos, affected the transcriptional levels of several oxidative stress markers, including MnSOD (SOD2) and HSP70 (HSPA8) in the liver, and GPX1, CAT, MnSOD, HSP70 and GSTP1 in the gills. Significant responses for CASP3B, BCLX, IGFBP1B and ATP1A1 (Na-K-ATPase a1b) by some of the treatments suggest that the pharmaceutical drugs may affect apoptosis, growth and ion regulation mechanisms. In fish kept at 4-5 degrees C, different effects were observed, suggesting a temperature-dependent response. In conclusion, the observed responses indicate that short-term exposure to deltamethrin has a profound effect on transcription of the evaluated markers in gills and liver of fish. Co-treatment with azamethiphos appears to have small mitigating effects on the transcriptional response caused by deltamethrin exposure alone. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxic effects of chlorpyrifos (CPF) at environmental concentrations on the shrimp Palaemonetes argentinus, a South American native species. Organisms were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of CPF (from 3.5 to 94.5 ng CPF L-1) at laboratory conditions for 96 h. A wide battery of biochemical responses including bioaccumulation, damage and defense biomarkers were measured in cephalothorax and abdomen of shrimp.
   The concentration of CPF was below the detection limit of the method in both body sectors (8 ng CPFg(-1) ww), probably indicating fast biotransformation of the parental compound. Our results showed that CPF exposure inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity from 3.5 ng CPF L-1, a concentration below the suggested Argentinean guidelines for the protection of aquatic biota. Moreover, oxidative stress was evidenced by increased H2O2 content and increased levels of TBARs and carbonyl groups in proteins. The induction of antioxidant enzymes like catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase seems not be sufficient to prevent oxidative damages. In addition, the mobilization of alpha-tocopherol from abdomen to cephalothorax was observed and reported for the first time in non-reproductive condition. Likewise, a strong diminution of metallothioneins occurred in cephalothorax from the lowest CPF concentration while induction occurred from the same treatment in abdomen as an oxidative stress response. Finally, significant correlation between Integrated Biomarker Response values and exposure concentrations suggest the usefulness of P. argentinus as bioindicator of CPF exposure at concentrations as low as environmental ones.

AB  - In the context of massive summer mortality events of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, the aim of this study was to investigate the early effects on genes, enzymes and haemocyte parameters implicated in immune defence mechanisms in C. gigas oysters exposed to a potentially hostile environment, i.e. to an herbicide alone or within a mixture. Following 2 h of exposure to the herbicide diuron at 1 mu g L-1 the repression of different genes implicated in immune defence mechanisms in the haemocytes and the inhibition of enzyme activities, such as laccase-type phenoloxidase (PO) in the plasma, were observed. The inhibition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the plasma was also observed after 6 and 24 h of exposure. In the mixture with the herbicides diuron and isoproturon, and the pharmaceutical ibuprofen, catecholase-type PO activity in the plasma and the percentage of phagocytosis in the haemocytes were reduced after 6 h of exposure. Our results showed that early effects on molecular, biochemical and cellular parameters can be detected in the presence of diuron alone or within a mixture, giving an insight of its potential effect in situations that can be found in natural environments, i.e. relatively high concentrations for short periods of time.

AB  - Glyphosate can cause tissue damage such as liver and kidney in mammals. Tannin has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of glyphosate on the growth of L8824 cell line and the effect of tannin on antagonism of glyphosate through the ROS/PTEN/PI3K/AKT axis are unclear. In this study, L8824 cells were treated with glyphosate (50 mu g/mL) and/or tannin (4.5 mu M) for 24 h to establish a model. The results showed that glyphosate exposure increased ROS and MDA levels, decreased CAT and SOD activities. PTEN was activated and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inhibited. The P53/Bcl-2/Bax/CytC/ Caspase3 and RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathways were also activated. In addition, the cytokines and antimicrobial peptides LEAP-2, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta were increased while beta-defensin, Hepcidin, IL-2 and IFN-gamma were decreased. The use of tannin reduced the adverse effects of glyphosate exposure on L8824 cells significantly. In conclusion, tannin can trigger oxidative stress via PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway to cause apoptosis, necroptosis and immune dysfunction of L8824 cells.

AB  - In recent years, the increase in the use of agricultural pesticides has endangered the production of marine creatures. However, exposing farmed creatures to water contaminated with pesticides is one of the current challenges. This study aims to investigate the defensive impact of diets containing varying amounts of vitamin C on the growth, digestive enzyme activity, immune response, and resistance of Caspian roach (Rutilus rutilus caspicus) exposed to diazinon. Fish (average weight: 1.12 & PLUSMN; 0.17 g) were fed diets containing 0 (control; C0), 500 (C1), 1000 (C2), and 1500 (C3) mg/kg of vitamin C for 56 days. Then they were exposed to diazinon stress for 14 days (0.32 mg/liter). The highest final weight and lowest feed conversion ratio were obtained in fish fed a diet containing vitamin C. The highest protease activity and lowest amounts of lipase and amylase were observed in the C3 group. At the end of the feeding period, lysozyme activity, total immunoglobulin amount, and comple-ment (ACH50) in the C3 treatment were significantly higher than in the control treatment. After the stress period, lysozyme and complement activity were higher in all groups fed vitamin C supplements than in the control treatment. The highest levels of stress indicators (cortisol and alkaline phosphatase) were detected in the control group before and after stress. Based on the preparation of gill tissue sections, most lesions included edema, hyperplasia, adhesion of secondary lamellae, and necrosis of gill-covering cells. Overall, the results indicate that adding vitamin C to the diet can be used as a sustainable bioremediation tactic and reduce the adverse effects of diazinon exposure in Caspian roach.

AB  - In this work, the effects of a pulse exposure of endosulfan on hepatopancreas, gills and ovary of the burrowing crab Zilchiopsis collastinensis were evaluated. The crabs were exposed to three sublethal concentrations in a pulse system with controlled dilutions. Water samples for pesticide concentrations measurements and crab tissue samples were taken when applications were made and 2, 8, 15 and 22 days after administering the pesticide. The exposure to endosulfan caused an increase in B cell number and a decrease in F and R cell number (p <0.05). Necrotic tubules, abnormal lumen and other histopathologies were observed in the hepatopancreas of crabs exposed to endosulfan. There was an increase in the proportion of collapsed gills caused by endosulfan effects. Other effects as hyperplasia were also observed. There were no changes in the gonadosomatic index of exposed crabs; however there were changes in the volume of oocytes of exposed crabs in certain days (p < 0.05). The increase in B cell number and the consequent reduction in F cell number may be related to the detoxification processes. The changes in cell number within the hepatopancreas and the histopathologies observed both in hepatopancreas and gills might be used as endosulfan exposure indicators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In many populations, males compete for mates and contribute to genetic diversity, but are assumed to have little impact on population growth rates and density, because one father is all that is necessary to fertilize a large number of eggs and sire a potential cohort. A factor affecting male reproductive output is exposure to contaminants that either disrupt endocrine function or mimic hormones. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) persist in aquatic ecosystems and may interfere with the reproductive contribution of male fish to populations. We quantified 28 PCB congeners in adult male bluegills across eight Illinois lakes. In spring 2011 and 2012, mature male bluegills from lakes with conspecifics with PCB whole-body residues ranging from undetectable to high (2,000 ng/g dry mass total PCBs) were placed in experimental ponds with mature females containing no detectable PCB body residues and allowed to reproduce in spring under natural conditions. The presence of PCBs in fish had no effect on the presence of intersex or other gonadal deformities in adult males nor was gonad size, lipid concentration, and survival affected. Males with high PCBs were heavier than those from lakes with low PCB concentrations. The relative density of juvenile bluegills produced in ponds by fall, a fitness endpoint in this species, was negatively related to contaminant concentration in fathers. Contaminant exposure and other factors that affect male reproduction may not only suppress the relative contribution of males to genetic diversity, but also the overall density of cohorts within populations.

AB  - Diazinon is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Portugal being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on diazinon in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 8 July 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 9 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Makhteshim Agan. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6-7 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses in Southern Europe as an insecticide and acaricide as proposed by the applicant with application via orchard air blast sprayers and tractor mounted hydraulic sprayers. Application is made to apples and pears with a maximum total dose of 2.7 kg diazinon per hectare and to sugar beet with a maximum total dose of 0.72 kg diazinon per hectare. It should be noted that the use in apples and pears were withdrawn during the EU peer review process. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Diazol 60 EC, an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. However, it should be noted that full validation of the method of analysis for food commodities is not available as no independent laboratory validation data are available. As well as this further validation data are required for the method of analysis for air.
   Some analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are still some outstanding data gaps for the relevant impurities.
   Acute toxicity during oral exposure is higher than by dermal application or inhalation. Therefore the proposed classification is Xn; R22 "Harmful if swallowed". The main effect observed during short term or long term exposure is the inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase activity. Based on this, the relevant oral short term NOAEL is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day in the dog studies.
   There is no genotoxic potential for diazinon, no carcinogenic effect in rats and mice, and no reproductive or developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits. No delayed neurotoxicity was observed in hens, and the NOAEL in the subchronic neurotoxicity study with rats is the same as the short term NOAEL, based on acetyl cholinesterase inhibition. The groundwater metabolites G 27550(3) and GS 31144(4) are not considered toxicologically significant, having no phosphate group susceptible to produce acetyl cholinesterase inhibition. They were concluded not relevant. The three impurities TEPP5, O, S-TEP6 and S, S-TEPP7 were very toxic in acute oral studies and considered of toxicological concern. Acute and subchronic human studies were submitted, but were either not acceptable, or had scientific deficiencies.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.025 mg/kg bw, with the use of the safety factor 100. For the supported use on sugar beets, the estimated operator exposure according to the German or the UK models is largely above the AOEL, with or without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (2700% of the AOEL with the use of PPE and respiratory protective equipment (RPE) according to the German model).
   The metabolism of diazinon in plants is clearly elucidated. The degradation pathway proceeds first through hydrolysis of the phosphorothioate ester link, leading to metabolite G 27550, which given its chemical structure has no cholinesterase activity. This compound is further hydroxylated and conjugated to glucose. Diazoxon is not observed. The amount of metabolites in comparison to the parent level is variable from crop to crop, but the residue definition can be restricted to parent compound only for monitoring and risk assessment as no other compound expected to add a contribution to the toxicological effects of diazinon was identified. Supervised residue trials were conducted suggesting the setting of a MRL at 0.5 mg/kg in pome fruits, and indicating that residues in sugar beet roots are below 0.01 mg/kg. No residues are expected in following crops and no plant- back restriction is needed.
   Processing of apples leads to a clear reduction of the diazinon levels in juice and sauce. However, the formation of a degradation product (desethyl diazinon), identified under specific hydrolysis conditions, was not investigated in practical conditions. This compound is recommended for inclusion in the residue definition for risk assessment in processed commodities.
   The metabolism of diazinon in livestock has been investigated and parent compound was found to be the major compound of toxicological relevance in animal tissues. Diazinon exhibits a lipophilic behaviour. Two metabolites, diazoxon and a hydroxylated form of diazinon were also present. The residue definition in animal commodities can be restricted to diazinon on the basis of the representative uses considered in this peer-review, leading to a low livestock dietary exposure and non significant transfer of residues to animal tissues, as demonstrated by feeding studies.
   The short and long term exposure assessments were conducted and indicated potential exceedences of the ADI and ARfD, which in some cases appear to be severe, in particular for infants and toddlers, with high consumption levels of pome fruits.
   In soil diazinon exhibited low to moderate persistence. Significant sinks for the pyridine ring-C-14-radiolabel used in the aerobic laboratory studies were residue not extracted by acetonitrile: water or methanol/water (9-38% of applied radioactivity (AR) after 76-119 days) and mineralisation to CO2 5.8-86% AR at 76-119 days. The major (>10% AR) metabolite in soil extracts was G 27550 accounting for up to 82% AR which exhibited high soil persistence. This metabolite may have the potential to accumulate in soil if applications are made to the same field in successive years. Diazinon exhibited medium to low soil mobility and G 27550 exhibited very high mobility based on the results of guideline batch laboratory adsorption experiments. The minor soil degradation product (max. 4.7% AR) GS 31144 was also characterised as exhibiting very high soil mobility on the basis of quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) computer modelling.
   In aerobic laboratory natural sediment water system experiments, diazinon exhibited low persistence (dissipation DT50 in water 3.9-4.7 days) as a consequence of a combination of partitioning to sediment (accounting for up to 77%AR at 0 days) and biodegradation. In the water phase the metabolite G 27550 accounted for a maximum of 47%AR 30 days after application, levels subsequently declined (DT50 in water estimated at 87 days). G 27550 was also present in sediment (maximum 22.7%AR). Residues not extracted from sediment by acetonitrile and acetonitrile: water represented 22-49%AR at study end (100 days). Mineralisation to CO2 of the pyridine ring-C-14-radiolabel used accounted for only 4.7-5.1 % AR by 100 days. The available surface water exposure assessment just considered the spray drift route of entry to surface water. The potential exposure of surface water with parent diazinon and the soil metabolite G 27550 via the drainage and runoff routes of entry has not been assessed in the available EU level exposure assessment. Member States should therefore carry out a surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessment for diazinon and G 27550 from the runoff and drainage routes of exposure at the national level, should diazinon be included in Annex 1.
   Appropriate FOCUS groundwater modelling is not available. This is required. Based on the available FOCUS PEARL modelling that utilised too favourable input parameters, annual average recharge concentrations leaving the top 1m soil column >0.75 mu g/L are already indicated for G 27550. For GS 31144 these concentrations are indicated to be >0.1 mu g/L. Based on current information it cannot be excluded that these concentrations for GS 31144 may be shown by appropriate modelling to be >0.75 mu g/L. Non relevance assessments are therefore required for both these potential groundwater contaminants. A significant dissipation route of diazinon from plants and soil will be volatilisation to the atmosphere. However calculated relatively rapid photooxidation through reaction with the hydroxyl radicals present in the upper atmosphere, indicate that diazinon is unlikely to be subject to long range atmospheric transport.
   A high acute, short and long term risk for insectivorous birds was identified in the first tier assessment for both evaluated uses. Based on actual measured concentrations of diazinon and degradation of residues in orchards the short and long term risk in apples/pears is considered low. However, the high acute risk remains. For sugar beet no valid residue data are available to refine the assessment. A high long term risk to insectivorous mammals was identified in both sugar beet and orchards. A risk for secondary poisoning was identified for earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals for the use in orchards and for earthworm-eating mammals for the use in sugar beet. Diazinon is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Risk mitigation measures comparable to 30 m buffer zones are required in orchards, and to 5 m in sugar beet. The toxicity to bees is high. Sugar beet is however not attractive to bees and application in orchards is late in the season after flowering. The risk to bees is therefore considered to be low. Non-target arthropods outside the field would be affected from the treatment in orchards. A potential for recolonisation has been shown in an aged residue study. However, a prerequisite for recolonisation from off-field non-target arthropod populations is that off-field populations are not affected. Therefore the risk to off-field non-target arthropods needs to be further addressed for the use in orchards. The acute risk to earthworms from diazinon and the soil metabolites is low and long term studies are not considered necessary. However, the risk to earthworms and other soil macro-organisms from the more persistent metabolite G 27550 needs to be addressed for a full conclusion. The risk to soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.

AB  - Triazines are an important group of herbicides, which have been used extensively or selectively both in agricultural and non-agricultural areas worldwide for more than fifty years to control broadleaf and some grassy weeds. As a consequence of their massive application, they have become and remain significant environmental pollutants, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Fish are an integral part of the aquatic environment and are, therefore, suitable models for the study of the behavioral, biological, and biochemical effects of triazine exposure. We have summarized and evaluated the effects of triazine herbicides on fish in order to provide an overview of current information on triazines. The overall effects of triazine herbicide exposure on the physiology of fish were evaluated by considering a variety of parameters in a number of reports. Haematological and biochemical profiles of blood provide important information about the internal environment of the organism and the general physiology and health status of triazine exposed fish. According to studies using biotransformation and bioaccumulation indices to estimate the effects of triazines on fish, changes in fish metabolism reflect the pollution of the environment by these herbicides. The responses of antioxidant defence systems in fish to triazine exposure could be an adaptive mechanism to protect the fish from triazine-induced oxidative stress. Acute exposure to triazines affects reproduction or reproductive development in fish; however, some triazines did not affect fish behavior during long-term exposure to low concentrations. Nevertheless, an impact on the overall behavioral response of fish cannot be excluded.

AB  - An underwater closed-circuit video system was used to remotely monitor and record the behavior of bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus) and redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus) guarding their nests before, during, and after applications of aquatic herbicides. Nests were sprayed to achieve a nominal concentration of 4 mg/L of either a dipotassium salt of endothall (Aquathol-K(R)), a dimethylamine salt of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), or water (control). No significant differences in rates of nest abandonment existed among the three treatments (p > 0.10). Abandonment averaged 5.17 min for both species and herbicide treatments, whereas the herbicides persisted in the water column for at least 45 min. When abandonment occurred, congeners nearly always intruded on the nest to feed on eggs or fry. After spraying, the adjusted mean frequency of rim circling, fanning, and agonistic behaviors exhibited by bluegills guarding eggs did not differ among the three treatments (p greater-than-or-equal-to 0.35). These results suggest the two herbicides will not elicit pronounced shifts in reproductive behavior of sunfish when they are properly applied.

AB  - Antioxidants like lipoic acid (LA) are known to trigger augmented antioxidant and phase II and III responses. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of LA in P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, total antioxidant competence, levels of lipid peroxides (TBARS) and accumulation of the organochlorine insecticide endosulfan (Endo: alpha-, beta-isomers and sulfate metabolite) in different organs of the fish Jenynsia multidentata. One hundred and twenty females (1.55 +/- 0.07 g) were fed during 8 days with (n = 60) or without (n = 60) a LA enriched ration (6000 mg/kg). Four experimental groups were defined: -LA/-Endo; +LA/-Endo; -LA/+Endo; and +LA/+Endo. Endo groups were exposed during 24 h to 1.4 mu g of insecticide/L. Results showed that only LA induced a significant increment in liver Pgp expression. GST activity was augmented in liver after exposure to LA or Endo. TBARS levels were lowered in liver and gills after LA pre-treatment. Total antioxidant capacity was lowered in liver of Endo exposed fish, a result that was reversed by LA pre-treatment. It is concluded that LA induced the expected effects in terms of Pgp expression, GST activity and reduced TBARS levels although favored alpha-Endo accumulation in brain. However, the Endo metabolism to the more persistent endosulfan sulfate was not facilitated by LA pre-treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of 96 h exposure of the goldfish Carassius auratus to two different types of bioplastic particles, originating from commercial shopping bag (Bag, similar to 5 mm) and polylactic acid-based (PLA) cup (Cup, <= 5 mm), and petroleum-based polyamide particles (PA, 0-180 mu m) was studied. All particles were studied as virgin and after simulated UV-degradation (at concentration 30 mg L-1). The experiments were conducted according to OECD 203 test guidelines. The toxicity endpoint evaluated in fish brain and gills was lipid peroxidation (LPO) quantified as nmol thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) mg(-1) protein. The results indicated that indicatively compostable PLA bioplastic Cup induced significant LPO in the brain and/or gills of the goldfish, in contrast to the particles from Bag and PA (in the brain, Cup > Bag > PA; in the gills, Cup > Bag). The UV-degradation of the particles of all studied types had no significant effect on the LPO level compared to virgin particles. While the increase of LPO in fish gills and brain upon exposure to PLA-plastic particles can be transitory in the long-term perspective, our results point to the necessity of a thorough investigation of the hazard of bioplastics at different state of environmental degradation/weathering.

AB  - Atrazine (ATR) is a commonly used triazine herbicide, which will remain in the water source, soil and biological muscle tissue for a long time, threatening the survival of related organisms and future generations. Tannic acid (TAN), a glucosyl compound found in gallnuts, has previously been shown to antagonize heavy metal toxicity, antioxidant activity, and inflammation. However, it is unclear whether TAN can antagonize ATR-induced Grass carp hepatocytes (L8824 cells) cytotoxicity. Therefore, we treated L8824 cells with 3 mu g mL(-1) ATR for 24 h to establish a toxic group model. The experimental data of flow cytometry and AO/EB staining together showed that the ratio of apoptosis and necrosis in L8824 cells after ATR exposure was significantly higher than that in the control group. Furthermore, RT-qPCR showed that inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, INF-gamma) were upregulated and antimicrobial peptides (hepcidin, beta-defensin and LEAP2) were induced down-regulated in L8824 cells, leading to immune dysfunction. The measurement results of oxidative stress-related indicators showed that the levels of ROS and MDA increased after ATR exposure, the overall anti-oxidative system was down-regulated. Western blotting confirmed that TNF-alpha/TNFR 1-related genes were also up-regulated. This indicates that ATR stimulates oxidative stress in L8824 cells, which in turn promotes the binding of TNF-alpha to TNFR 1. In addition, TRADD, FADD, Caspase-3, P53, RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL were found to be significantly upregulated by Western blotting and RT-qPCR. Conditioned after ATR exposure compared to controls. It indicates that ATR activates apoptosis and necrosis of TNF-alpha/TNFR 1 pathway by inducing oxidative stress in L8824 cells. Furthermore, the use of TAN (5 mu M) significantly alleviated the toxic effects of ATR on L8824 cells mentioned above. In conclusion, TAN restrains ATR-induced apoptosis, programmed necrosis and immune dysfunction through the ROS/TNF-alpha/TNFR 1 pathway.

AB  - We have investigated the effect of free radicals on the electrical gap junctions between horizontal cells in the carp retina. In our previous study, L-buthionine sulfoximine. an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis. caused uncoupling of horizontal cells four days after injection. In the present study, we have used paraquat, a generator of exogenous reactive oxygen species, to investigate whether it was the depletion of glutathione or an increase in the level of reactive oxygen species which resulted in horizontal cell uncoupling after L-buthionine sulfoximine injection. Intracellular recordings were made from L-type horizontal cells at various time-points after intravitreal injection of paraquat. Injection of 25 nmol paraquat caused an increase in response amplitude to central spot light stimuli by two days after injection, which continued for a further two to three days and had almost disappeared by seven days after injection. There was also a sharp increase in reactive oxygen species production, peaking at four days and disappearing by seven days after injection, and an accompanying depletion and a restoration of glutathione levels with a similar rims-course. Marking cells with Lucifer Yellow clearly illustrated uncoupling of horizontal cells after paraquat injection. If paraquat and L-buthionine sulfoximine were injected simultaneously, the increase in response to central spots was observed as early as one day after injection. This response amplitude was not more enhanced than that observed after L-buthionine sulfoximine injection alone, although a dramatic increase in the level of reactive oxygen species was observed.
   From these results. we suggest that reactive oxygen species are involved in uncoupling. while recovery from uncoupling is dependent on glutathione. Furthermore, we conclude that a balance between glutathione and reactive oxygen species levels is the most important Factor controlling gap junctional intercellular communication of L-type horizontal cells in the carp retina.

AB  - Cholinesterases can be used as sensitive biorecognition elements for widely used agricultural pesticides. This requires highly purified and inhibitor-free enzyme preparations. In the present work the cocaine derivative benzoylecgonine was for the first time used as the molecular recognition element for the purification of acetylcholinesterase from Electrophorus electricus by affinity chromatography. The preparation of enriched enzyme without the contamination by an inhibitor, which is traditionally used for eluting the "affinity" bound protein, was achieved. The specific activity was 2.2-fold increased to 3100 U mg(-1). The same cocaine derivative was immobilized on the surface of a piezoelectric crystal in order to analyze the binding of acetylcholinesterases from two different species, E. electricus and Drosophila melanogaster, to the immobilized inhibitor. Evaluation of the binding curves allowed the analysis of the binding kinetics. These experiments are fundamental for the development of a (competitive) biosensor for inhibitors of cholinesterase.

AB  - Penconazole is a systemic fungicide commonly used in agriculture as the commercial preparation Topas. Although triazole fungicides are widely found in the aquatic environment, little is known about their acute toxicity on fish. In this study we assessed the effects of short-term exposure to Topas on some parameters of homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the levels of markers of oxidative stress and parameters of the antioxidant defense system of goldfish (Carassius auratus L.). Gills appeared to be the main target organ of Topas toxicity, showing the greatest number of parameters affected. Gills of Topas-treated fish showed a higher content of low (L-SH) and high (H-SH) molecular mass thiols and higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) as well as reduced carbonyl protein content (CP), as compared with those in the control group. In the liver, goldfish exposure to 15-25 mg L-1 Topas resulted in a higher L-SH and H-SH content, but lower CP levels and activity of GST. In kidney, Topas exposure resulted in higher activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and G6PDH, but lower L-SH content and activity of GST. The results of this study indicate that acute goldfish exposure to the triazole fungicide Topas increased efficiency of the antioxidant system in fish gills, liver, and kidney. This could indicate the development of low intensity oxidative stress which up-regulates defense mechanisms responsible for protection of goldfish against deleterious ROS effects.

AB  - Glyphosate is the active ingredient of some of the most highly produced and used herbicides worldwide. The intensive applications of glyphosate-based herbicides and its half-life in water lead to its presence in many aquatic ecosystems. Whereas recent studies have reported neurotoxic effects of glyphosate including autism related effects, most of them used extremely high (mg/L to g/L) concentrations, so it is still unclear if chronic, low environmentally relevant concentrations of this compound (ng/L to mu g/L) can induce neurotoxicity. In this study we analyzed the neurotoxicity of glyphosate in adult zebrafish after waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 3 mu g/L) for two weeks. Our data showed that exposed fish presented a significant impairment of exploratory and social behaviors consistent with increased anxiety. The anterior brain of the exposed fish presented a significant increase in dopamine and serotonin levels, as well as in the DOPAC/dopamine and homovanillic acid/dopamine turnover ratios. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in the dopaminergic system, as th1, th2, comtb, and scl6a3 was downregulated. Finally, the brain of exposed fish presented a significant increase in the catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, with a concomitant decrease of glutathione stores. These changes in the antioxidant defense system are consistent with the observed increase in oxidative stress, reflected by the increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation in the brain. The presented results show that current glyphosate concentrations commonly found in many aquatic ecosystems may have detrimental consequences on fish survival by decreasing exploration of the environment or altering social interactions. Furthermore, as zebrafish is also a vertebrate model widely used in human neurobehavioral studies, these results are relevant not only for environmental risk assessment, but also for understanding the risk of chronic low-dose exposures on human health.

AB  - A water-soluble anthraquinone derivative (2-[methylamino-N-(1'-methylethyl)]-9,10-anthraquinone monophosphate), previously found to be selectively toxic towards Planktothrix perornata at submicromolar concentrations, was studied to determine its toxic mode of action towards this cyanobacterium. Chlorophyll fluorescence was monitored as an indicator of photosynthetic efficiency, and measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was performed using the ROS-sensitive probe 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. The effects of the herbicide paraquat (a ROS generator) as well as ascorbate and of.-tocopherol (ROS scavengers) on ROS formation by P. perornata were studied. Also, the effects of different concentrations of ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol, and the herbicide diuron on reducing the toxicity of the water-soluble anthraquinone derivative towards P. perornata were determined. Our results indicate that the water-soluble anthraquinone derivative does not inhibit photosynthetic electron transport directly, but does generate ROS at levels that may cause toxicity towards P. perornata, (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Besides several endogenous elements, exogenous factors, including exposure to pesticides, have been recognized as putative factors contributing to the onset and development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Considering the availability, success rate, and limitations associated with the current arsenals to fight PD, there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic interventions. Therefore, based on the previously reported beneficial functions of the L1 cell adhesion molecule, we hypothesized that L1 mimetic compounds may serve to neutralize neurotoxicity triggered by the pesticide paraquat (PQ). In this study, we attempt to use PQ for inducing PD-like pathology and the L1 mimetic compounds phenelzine sulfate (PS) and tacrine (TC) as potential candidates for the amelioration of PD symptoms using zebrafish as a model system. Administration of PQ together with the L1 mimetic compounds PS or TC (250 nM) improved survival of zebrafish larvae, protected them from locomotor deficits, and increased their sensorimotor reflexes. Moreover, application of PQ together with PS (500 nM) or TC (1000 nM) in adult zebrafish counteracted PQ-induced toxicity, maintaining normal locomotor functions and spatial memory in an open field and T-maze task, respectively. Both L1 mimetic compounds prevented reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine levels, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, protected against impairment of mitochondrial viability, improved the antioxidant enzyme system, and prevented a decrease in ATP levels. Altogether, our findings highlight the beneficial functions of the agonistic L1 mimetics PS and TC by improving several vital cell functions against PQ-triggered neurotoxicity.

AB  - Imidacloprid is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on imidacloprid in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 13 June 2005. The peer review was initiated on 25 January 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded to by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in March-May 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in April 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide seed treatment for sugar beet and as a foliar spray for apples and tomatoes. Full details of the GAP are in the attached list of end points.
   The representative formulated products for the evaluation were "Confidor", a soluble concentrate formulation (SL) and "Gaucho" a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS).
   Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. However it should be noted that the residue definition in plants and surface water for monitoring purposes has not been finalised. In addition to this as the peer review process found that the active substance should be classified as toxic a data gap for a method of analysis for body fluids was identified. Sufficient data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. A method of analysis is available for the active substance in the FS formulation but not in the SL.
   Within the toxicological assessment, imidacloprid is almost completely absorbed by oral administration, does not bioaccumulate and is excreted mainly by the urine. Showing a high acute oral toxicity in mice but a low toxicity after dermal or inhalative exposure, imidacloprid was not irritant to the skin or the eye and had no skin sensitisation potential. The proposed classification for the acute toxicity was T, R25 Toxic if swallowed. In short term studies with rats and mice, the most sensitive parameter was the decreased body weight development. In the dog studies, indications of an effect on the central nervous system were observed (clinical signs). No evidence of genotoxic or carcinogenic effects was observed with imidacloprid. Likewise it did not affect the reproductive parameters in rats, or the embryofoetal development in rats and rabbits. In neurotoxicity studies, effects occurred in the functional observational battery, without histopathological findings in the nervous tissues. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was 0.06 mg/kg bw/day based on the chronic rat study, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.08 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day dog study supported by the subchronic rat neurotoxicity study, and the acute reference dose (ARfD) was 0.08 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day dog study. All reference values were derived with a safety factor of 100.
   The agreed dermal absorption values for Confidor SL 200 were 0.3% for the concentrate and 8% for the dilution, whereas the default value of 100% was adopted for Gaucho FS 600 in the absence of experimental data. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL for Confidor SL 200 without the use of personal protective equipment whereas it is above the AOEL for Gaucho FS 600 with the use of coveralls and gloves. Similarly the exposure estimates for workers re-entering crops treated with Confidor SL 200 are lower than the AOEL, whereas the estimates for workers loading and sowing seeds treated with Gaucho FS 600 are higher than the AOEL. And finally, the bystander exposure to both formulations is not expected to exceed 6% of the AOEL.
   The plant metabolism of imidacloprid has been clearly elucidated after foliar, seed and soil treatments. Considering all information available, the residue definition for risk assessment is proposed to include the active substance and all metabolites containing the 6-chloropyridinyl moiety. A residue definition for monitoring was not agreed under the peer review process. The EFSA is however of the opinion that 2 options are possible (either parent compound or the same residue definition as for risk assessment).
   A sufficient amount of field supervised residue trials is available in support of all representative uses. These data allow assessing acute and chronic consumer exposure. They also provide appropriate information for setting MRLs in accordance with the 2 options proposed for the residue definition. No significant transfer of soil residues to rotational crops is expected under practical conditions.
   No change in the nature of residues is expected under processing.
   Livestock may be exposed to residues of imidacloprid and its metabolites, but the metabolism and feeding studies demonstrate that the transfer of residues to animal commodities is limited and below the limit of quantification of analytical methods.
   No risk for the consumer has been identified under acute or chronic exposure to residues resulting from the representative uses of imidacloprid. This conclusion needs however to be consolidated by further information first confirming that the metabolism of the compound in plants does not lead to compounds of particular toxicological concern.
   In soil under aerobic conditions imidacloprid exhibits moderate to very high persistence. Mineralisation of the pyridinyl-C-14-methylene radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for 3.3-17% AR after 91-100 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 17-27 % AR after 91-100 days. No metabolite accounted for > 3.4% AR at any sampling time. The soil accumulation assessment for imidacloprid residues under conditions represented by 2 UK soil accumulations studies was not finalised. Under anaerobic soil conditions the metabolite M09(2) was a major metabolite accounting for a maximum of 51% AR after 249 days of anaerobic conditions. Imidacloprid exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. M09 would be expected to exhibit low mobility. There was no indication that adsorption of imidacloprid was pH dependant.
   In dark natural sediment water systems imidacloprid exhibited moderate to high persistence. No metabolite accounted > 6.3% AR at any sampling time. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 2.5 % AR at 92 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were the major sink representing 66 % AR at study end in the system with 4.09% organic carbon (oc). In the lower oc content system (0.89%) unextracted residues accounted for a lower proportion at 15% AR at study end. Photolysis mediates the degradation of imidacloprid in aquatic systems to 4 major identified degradation products with imidacloprid exhibiting low to moderate persistence in a German outdoor mesocosm study (summer application). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments are available using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for imidacloprid at steps 3 and 4, with spray drift and runoff mitigation being applied at step 4.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by imidacloprid above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Evidence from the available guideline lysimeter studies indicated that contamination of groundwater by imidacloprid or its minor soil metabolites is unlikely from the applied for intended uses assessed in this conclusion.
   The representative uses are spray application in apples (northern Europe and southern Europe) and tomatoes (southern Europe) indoors and outdoors and seed treatment of sugar beet. The risk assessment for birds and mammals was conducted for uptake of contaminated food items for the outdoor uses only. No exposure of birds and mammals was assumed for the glasshouse use. The acute, short-term and long-term endpoints used in the risk assessment for birds were discussed in the meeting of experts and the values which were proposed by the RMS in the DAR were confirmed in the meeting of experts. The first-tier TERs the uptake of sugar beet seed pellets as a food item and as grit were significantly below the Annex VI trigger values. The suggested refinements based on the low attractivity as food items and the low availability of sugar beet seed pellets (provided a high drilling efficiency leaving only 0.17% of the seed pellets on the soil surface and seed pelletages are removed from the soil surface) was accepted and the risk to birds was considered as low. However the suggested refinements of the risk assessment for granivorous mammals were not sufficiently supported by data and therefore rejected by the experts. A data gap was identified for the applicant to refine the risk to granivorous mammals. The risk to medium herbivorous mammals from uptake of residues in sugar beet seedlings was assessed as low but the risk assessment for birds for the uptake of residues in sugar beet seedlings needed refinement. Wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) was accepted as a focal species. As a refinement step it was proposed that wood pigeons feed in bouts and one filling of the crop with sugar beet seedlings would constitute 20% of the daily food intake. This was used as a crop-filling factor of 0.2 in the exposure calculation. However it was noted by the experts that the birds may feed several times in one day on the same field and considerations of metabolic processes was missing. An open point was identified by the experts for the RMS to include information on the toxicokinetics to support the risk refinement. The RMS noted in addendum 6 (not peer-reviewed) that the available studies on the metabolic processes cannot be used to support the suggested use of the crop limiting factor of 0.2. The RMS proposed using the crop-limiting factor of 0.2 also for the short-term and long-term risk assessment. This was not accepted and it was proposed that real PD data would be a more appropriate refinement step for the short-term and long-term risk assessment. The suggested PT value of 0.1 was rejected by the experts because it was not sufficiently justified by data. The experts concluded that a high risk to birds from uptake of sugarbeet seedlings cannot be excluded for the representative use.
   The first-tier TER values were below the triggers for insectivorous birds for the uses in tomatoes and orchards. The applicant suggested a PT of 0.61 for blue tit (Parus caeruleus) in orchards and 0.1 for yellow wagtail (Motacilla flava) in tomato. An insect residue study was submitted and discussed in the expert meeting. The results of the study were considered as not reliable by the experts. The PD refinements (relative proportion of small and large insects) were accepted by the experts. The suggested PT value for yellow wagtail was not supported by data and hence rejected by the experts as well as the PT to refine the acute risk of blue tit. The TERs based on accepted refinements indicate a low risk to insectivorous birds for the use in tomato but the acute TER for blue tits is below the trigger of 10 requiring further risk refinements for the use in orchards.
   The first-tier acute and long-term TERs for herbivorous mammals were below the Annex VI trigger values of 10 and 5. The risk to herbivorous mammals from spray application in tomatoes was considered as low since tomatoes are not attractive as a food source. The risk assessment for herbivorous mammals in orchards resulted in TERs above the trigger taking interception factors into account and also residue decline to refine the long-term risk assessment.
   The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from uptake of plant metabolites is considered as covered by the risk assessment for imidacloprid.
   The lowest endpoints from the tested aquatic organisms were observed for Chironomus riparius. The spray formulation Confidor SL 200 was tested with Chironomus riparius. The toxicity of formulated imidacloprid was similar to technical imidacloprid.
   Testing with the granular formulation Gaucho FS 600 Uncoloured was considered as not necessary since aquatic organisms are expected to be exposed to the active substance but not to the formulation. The TER values based on maximum PECsw of the worst case FOCUSsw scenario R3 were well above the Annex VI triggers for fish, daphnids and algae. The acute and chronic TER for Chironomus riparius were below the Annex VI trigger of 10. The experts agreed that the endpoints from the mesocosm of 0.6 jug imidacloprid/L should be used in the risk assessment. No agreement was reached on the safety factor which should be applied. It was proposed that MSs use a safety factor of 1-3 in combination with the NOEC of 0.6 itg imidacloprid/L. The TER values based on the endpoint of 0.6 jug imidacloprid/L and FOCUS step3 PECsw were in the range of 0.09 and 1 indicating a high risk to aquatic insects for the uses in tomatoes and apples. The TERs for the use as a seed treatment were >3 suggesting a low risk. With no-spray buffer zones of 20 m a TER of >1 is achieved in the full FOCUS step4 drainage scenarios (D3, D4, D5) and in the run-off scenarios R1, R2, R3 (without additional run-off mitigation) and R4 (including 50% run-off mitigation) for the use in orchards. A TER of >3 was reached in none of the full FOCUS step4 scenarios. The drainage scenario D6 resulted in a TER of >1 with spray drift reduction by 95% (equivalent to 35-40 m no-spray buffer zone) but no full run-off scenario resulted in a TER >1 for the use in tomatoes. If run-off is mitigated by 90% then the TERs were >1. However none of the scenarios except R3 resulted in TERs >3. The metabolites MO 1, M07, were about 1 order of magnitude acutely less toxic and the metabolites M09, M12, M16 and M23 were more than 2 orders of magnitude less chronically toxic to Chironomus riparius than imidacloprid. The TER values based PECsw values from FOCUSsw scenario R3 (which resulted in highest PECsw values for imidacloprid) were above the trigger of 100 except for metabolite M07 where a TER of 46 was observed. It is concluded that the risk from metabolites is low for all representative uses and that the risk from metabolite M07 is covered by the risk mitigation required for imidacloprid. No toxicity data were made available for the photolysis metabolite M14. The risk from this metabolite to aquatic organisms needs to be addressed.
   The risk of bioaccumulation from imidacloprid and its metabolites which are predicted to reach surface water is considered as low.
   Imidacloprid is acutely very toxic to bees. In addition to the standard acute toxicity tests also chronic tests and studies to investigate sublethal effects (bee behaviour) were conducted. The HQ values for oral and contact exposure were far in excess of the HQ trigger value of 50 indicating a high risk to bees from the use as a spray application in orchards and tomatoes. Imidacloprid has a distinct systemic mode of action. Therefore the uptake in plants from soil/seed treatment applications was investigated in different crops. Imidacloprid is preferentially translocated to leaves and shoots and to a much lower extend to the reproductive organs. No major soil metabolites were detected in the soil degradation studies. Bees would therefore only be exposed to imidacloprid residues in succeeding crops. The RMS presented a TER calculation based on NOEC values (acute and chronic lethal effects, behavioural impacts including bee hive development) and residue levels in nectar and/or pollen of <5 ppb resulting in TER values of >9.2, >10, >4.8 and >4 indicating a low risk to bees from the representative use as a seed treatment. Furthermore sugar beet is harvested before flowering hence the risk to bees is expected to be low from the use as a seed treatment in sugar beet.
   The risk from exposure to honeydew excreted from aphids was considered as low based on the argumentation that the acute oral LD50 for aphids is several orders of magnitude lower than for bees and hence it would be highly unlikely that aphids would survive exposure to imidacloprid at concentrations in sap which could lead to the excretion of honeydew which is toxic to bees. The line of argumentation was agreed by the experts but it was not clear how the toxicity value for aphids was derived and the experts suggested a data gap for the applicant to clarify this point.
   Overall it is concluded that the spray applications of imidacloprid pose a high risk to bees. Risk mitigation is required for the use in orchards. The risk to bees is considered to be low if the product is not applied during flowering and if flowering weeds are removed/mown before the application. However it should be noted that bees potentially foraging in the off-crop area would still be exposed via spray drift and hence not be protected by the suggested risk mitigation measure. Flowering tomato plants are visited by honey-bees and other pollinators. The risk mitigation suggested for orchards is not an option for the use in tomato since the tomato plants flower almost continuously.
   The spray application of imidacloprid will cause severe impacts on non-target arthropods in the infield and off-field area. However in semi-field and field studies it was demonstrated that recolonisation of the in-field area is possible. The available data suggest that ageing of residues of 273 days is required in order not to be hazardous to larvae of Poecilus cupreus. A high risk to soil dwelling arthropods cannot be excluded for the seed treatment use. The available semi-field test with P. cupreus was conducted at too low concentrations of imidacloprid to allow a conclusion on the risk from the representative use in sugar-beet.
   The first tier risk assessment for earthworms resulted in TERs below the trigger. Field studies were submitted. However it was not clear whether the application pattern in the field studies were the same as suggested in the GAP and whether the plateau PECsoil is covered. An open point was set in the meeting for the RMS to check whether the exposure in the field studies were in accordance to the GAP. The RMS confirmed that the application patterns were different from the representative uses but suggest that the application rates of 133 g a.s./ha (seed treatment) and 150 g a.s./ha (spray application) would cover the representative uses. However the estimated PECsoil in the field studies (0.1773 mg a.s./kg and 0.2 mg a.s./kg) are below the accumulated maximum PECs. Therefore uncertainty remains with regard to the long-term risk to earthworms. This uncertainty needs to be addressed further.
   Organic matter breakdown was not affected in litterbag studies with the spray formulation Imidacloprid SL 200 and the seed treatment formulation Gaucho FS 600. However the maximum PECsoil values calculated are about 2-3 times higher than the concentrations in the litterbag studies. Therefore it cannot be concluded that the risk to organic matter breakdown is addressed.
   No adverse effects were observed in a test with technical imidacloprid and the predatory mite Hypoaspis aculeifer at the highest tested application rate of 120 g a.s./ha. The NOEC observed for technical imidacloprid and Folsomia candida was 1.25 mg a.s./kg soil The endpoint observed for the formulations were lower compared to technical imidacloprid and the TERs for the formulations are below the trigger of 5 if the NOECs are compared to the accumulated maximum PECsoil concentrations indicating a potential high risk to soil dwelling arthropods. The risk from the metabolites M06 and M07 was assessed as low.
   The risk to non-target soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - The widespread use of atrazine, a herbicide used to control weeds, has contributed to the increased contamination of aquatic environments. To assess the toxicological effects of a xenobiotic on a nontarget organism in the laboratory, different models of toxicological exposure systems have been widely used. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the action of sublethal concentrations of atrazine on the hepatic histology of Oreochromis niloticus, considering two models of exposure: static (where atrazine was only added once) and semi-static (where atrazine was periodically renewed). Fish were exposed to a concentration of 2 ppm atrazine for 15 days, which was verified by high-performance liquid chromatography. The livers were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and histopathological data were collected. In addition, they were submitted to immunohistochemistry for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). A maximum variation of 45% (static) and 12.5% (semi-static) was observed between the observed and nominal atrazine concentration. Nuclear and cytoplasmic changes were observed in both experimental models. Hepatocytes from the livers of the static system showed a degenerative appearance, while in the semi-static system, intense cytoplasmic vacuolization and necrosis were observed. iNOS positive cells were identified only in macrophages in the hepatocytes of fish in the semi-static system. These results directly showed how the choice of exposure system can influence the results of toxicological tests. However, future analysis investigating the by-products and nitrogen products should be carried out since the histopathological findings revealed the possibility of these compounds serving as secondary contamination routes.

AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition proteins are members of the family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), that play important roles in the recognition of peptidoglycan and various biological processes. In this study, we have characterized peptidoglycan recognition protein-SC2 (PGRP-SC2) in rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) (RbPGRP SC2) and analysed its expression in various tissues after pathogen challenge. A sequence alignment revealed that the residues essential to zinc binding of the deduced protein were highly conserved among all the organisms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RbPGRP-SC2 is most closely related to the large yellow croaker PGRP-SC2. RbPGRP-SC2 was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues analysed, predominantly distributed in muscle and skin. After challenge with microbial pathogens (Edwardsiella piscicida), Streptococcus iniae or red seabream iridovirus [RSIN]), RbPGRP-SC2 was up-regulated in all the tissues examined, especially in liver. We produced recombinant RbPGRP-SC2 (rRbPGRP-SC2) using an Escherichia coli expression system. The rRbPGRP-SC2 had agglutination activity towards both Gram-negative (E. piscicida) and Gram-positive bacteria (S. iniae). In addition, rRbPGRP-SC2 induced leukocyte apoptosis and promoted leukocyte phagocytosis. These results suggest that the RbPGRP-SC2 plays an important role in the immune system and in maintaining cellular homeostasis of rock bream.

AB  - Eels are exposed to pollutants due to their unusual life cycle and are vulnerable to contamination associated with sediment due to their diet, feeding habits and territoriality. Since the 1980s, a decline in American and European eel populations has been recorded. The causes of this decline still are unknown but pollution from domestic and industrial effluents is known to be involved. Since little data is available on PCB contamination in eels from Italian waters, PCBs were measured in muscle of Anguilla anguilla captured in 2001 in two brackish ecosystems of the Mediterranean: the lagoons of Orbetello and Santa Giusta (Italy). PCBs were higher in samples from Orbetello lagoon than in those detected from Santa Giusta lagoon (P < 0.05). Congener and isomer analyses indicated Aroclor 1260 as a likely source of PCBs in the Orbetello and Santa Giusta samples. Only the toxic equivalents (TEQs) of mono-ortho PCBs were calculated.

AB  - Herbicide pollution is persistent, which not only has a negative impact on individual organisms, but also may endanger the interspecific relationship between predators and prey. Cladocerans, i.e. zooplankton that plays an important role in the energy flow and material circulation in freshwater ecosystem, usually develop induced defense in response to predation risk. We used atrazine, one of the most used herbicides in the world, and Daphnia pulex, a representative cladocerans, to test the possible interference effect of herbicides on the induced defensive traits of cladocerans in response to predator fish (Rhodeus ocellatus) kairomone, including morphological defense, life history strategies, and the expression of defense-related genes. Atrazine reduced the body size, spine size, growth rate, total offspring, and the relative reproductive output of D. pulex, which further affected the response strength of the morphological and life history defenses, i.e., atrazine significantly reduced the spine size, relative spine size, and fecundity of D. pulex in response to R. ocellatus kairomone. Exposure to atrazine affected the expression of defense-related genes, and we speculated that atrazine affected the signaling process in the induced anti-predation defense of cladocerans. Specially, fish kairomone attenuated the negative effects of high concentrations of atrazine on the life history traits of D. pulex. Our results will help to accurately assess the potential risk of artificial compounds in freshwater ecosystems from the perspective of interspecific relationships, and help to understand the impact of environmental changes on the inducible anti-predator defense of prey in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Metals are environmentally ubiquitous and can be found at high concentrations in seawater and subsequently in marine organisms. Metals with high redox potential can trigger oxidative stress mechanisms with damaging effects in biological tissues. In aquatic species, oxidative stress has been evaluated by assessing antioxidant enzymes activities and oxidative damages in tissues. The purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative stress biomarkers and metal residues in white seabream (Diplodus sargus), a species entering aquaculture production in Portugal. Metal residues (Cu, Cd, As and Pb), in liver and muscle, as well as oxidative stress biomarkers were assessed at different stages in the life cycle of white seabream under culture conditions and in wild specimens, of a marketable size. Metal concentrations in tissues were low, and below the established limits. However, wild white seabream showed higher accumulation than cultured ones. Antioxidant enzymes, namely catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were correlated with metal accumulation. Oxidative damages to tissues were low, with wild white seabream showing lower levels than cultured fish. This study showed that white seabream has a good antioxidant defense system, capable of reducing oxidative damages in tissues resulting from the presence of metals. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, usually named 2,4-D is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. Acute toxicity of 2,4-D herbicide was investigated through its effects on guppies (Poecilia vivipara Bloch et Schneider 1801). Fish were exposed to the herbicide at concentrations of 10,20 and 40 mu l per liter of water for 24 hours to determine its effects on gills and liver epithelia. The estimated LC50 was 34.64 mu l of 2,4-D per liter of water. Histochemical analyses and Feulgen's reaction were conducted to detect glycoconjugates and DNA, respectively, in gills and liver epithelia. Histochemistry revealed qualitative variations of glycoconjugates present on mucous cells and granules. The four types of mucous cells contained neutral granules, acids, or both. Increasing amounts of syalomucins were observed from the control group to the group exposed to the highest concentration of 2,4-D, suggesting increased mucous viscosity and the formation of plaques that could inhibit gas exchange and osmoregulation. Lamellar fusion observed in the group exposed to 40 mu l of 2,4-D suggests a defense mechanism. Hepatocytes showed vacuolization in the 10 and 20 mu l/L groups. The 40 mu l/L group showed normal hepatocytes as well as changed ones, many Ito cells, micronuclei, and nuclear swelling. These effects may be associated with toxicity or adaptative processes to cellular stress. The data from this study indicates the importance of assessing similar risks to aquatic species and suggests that Poecilia vivipara is an adequate biological model for analysis of environmental contamination.

AB  - Since pesticide residues in food have attracted increasing concern worldwide, it is crucial to develop rapid and sensitive analytical methods to detect pesticide residues and ensure food safety. In this work, via the biotin-streptavidin (SA) recognition system, we constructed a magnetic relaxation switching (MRS) immunosensor for sensitive detection of chlorpyrifos (CPF). With a competitive immunoassay mode, H2O2 and Fe2+ were firstly optimized as the reaction substrates. Wherein, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) acted as enzyme label to catalyze H2O2 and mediated the conversion of Fe2+/Fe3+. By introducing Fe2+/Fe3+ interconversion as MRS signal output, CPF was detected by the immunoreaction induced variations of the transverse relaxation time (Delta T-2). The proposed MRS immunosensor exhibited a detection linear range from 0.01 to 1000 ng mL(-1) (R-2 = 0.9916), with the limit of detection (LOD) of 6 pg mL(-1) (3S/M, n = 3). As a proof-of-concept, CPF was easily detected among five different pesticides at a low concentration level (0.1 ng mL(-1)), as well as in real samples (apple, tea, and lettuce) with recoveries of 80.70-115.30%. Besides, the sensor can realize one step of "separation and detection" towards CPF with the aid of magnetic nanoparticles, which demonstrate its promising potential for pesticide residue detection in food samples and environment.

AB  - An efficient magnetic dummy template molecularly imprinted polymer nanocomposite was prepared using multi-walled carbon nanotubes as a support and metolachlor deschloro as a dummy template. The obtained nanocomposites were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The adsorption performance of the obtained nanocomposites was evaluated through binding experiments, including static adsorption, kinetic adsorption, and selective recognition studies. The obtained nanocomposites were successfully applied as selective sorbents for the magnetic solid-phase extraction of seven amide herbicides (alachlor, acetochlor, pretilachlor, butachlor, metolachlor, diethatyl ethyl, and dimethachlor) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry from fish samples. Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection was 0.01-0.1 mu g/kg. The obtained recoveries of the amide herbicides from the fish samples were in the range of 88.0 to 102.1% with a relative standard deviation of less than 7.5%. This method, which eliminated the effect of template leakage on qualitative and quantitative analysis was found to be superior to the methods reported in the literature. The results indicated that it could be successfully applied to analyze amide herbicides in fish samples with satisfactory recoveries.

AB  - Limited reports are available on polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in sharks. In this study, PBDEs were measured in dorsal muscles (n = 105) from 13 shark species collected from offshore and coastal waters of Korea. The PBDE concentrations varied greatly not only among species but also within species of sharks. The major PBDE congeners detected in our samples were BDEs 47, 28, 99, 153, 100, and 154. Concentrations of PBDEs in sharks in this study were lower than those reported for previous studies. The high PBDE concentrations were found for aggressive shark species. Inter-species differences in the concentrations and accumulation profiles of PBDEs are explained by differences in feeding habits and sampling locations. Several contributing factors such as growth velocity, trophic level, and local contamination may affect the bioaccumulation of PBDEs in sharks. The present study provides baselines for the occurrence and accumulation status of PBDEs in various shark species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pesticide usage has contributed to increasing food production; it has also caused them to be found in ecosystems inducing adverse effects on biota. Fish are the most abundant and diverse vertebrates in the world and are of great importance both economically and ecologically. Some fishes are indicators of the environmental quality of aquatic ecosystems and provide insight as to how pollutants might influence public health. The tilapias species can be considered biomonitors because they present little displacement representing the contamination level of a site. This study aimed at three goals: (1) to determine the concentration of 20 pesticides in tilapia muscle in the Ayuquila-Armeria basin, (2) to describe the spatiotemporal variation of analytes and (3) to evaluate the risk of consuming contaminated fish. The presence of 11 pesticides was determined. Ametrine, glyphosate and malathion concentrations showed significant differences by season. The risk assessment showed that the consumption of tilapia muscle from the Ayuquila-Armeria basin does not represent a risk for the population. Diazinon concentrations were relatively low compared to the other pesticides concentrations, but its toxic characteristics were the ones that most negatively influenced the risk assessment. The results obtained are relevant from the social and economic points of view.

AB  - Selection of a laboratory colony of the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens with the pyrethroids permethrin and lambda -cyhalothrin increased its resistance to both insecticides. Biochemical analysis and synergistic studies with metabolic inhibitors indicated that elevated glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) with a predominant peroxidase activity conferred resistance to both pyrethroids, whereas esterases conferred part of the resistance to permethrin. Purified esterases hydrolysed permethrin at a slow rate, but incubation of either pyrethroid or their primary metabolites with partially purified GSTs had no effect on the metabolic profile. Although GSTs were sensitive to inhibition by both pyrethroids, they did not serve as binding proteins, as previously hypothesized [Grant and Matsumura (1988) Insect Biochem. 18, 615-622]. We demonstrate that pyrethroids, in addition to their neurotoxic effect, induce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in insects. Pyrethroid exposure induced lipid peroxides, protein oxidation and depleted reduced glutathione. Elevated GSTs in the resistant strains attenuated the pyrethroid-induced lipid peroxidation and reduced mortality, whereas their in vivo inhibition eliminated their protective role. We therefore hypothesize that the main role of elevated GSTs in conferring resistance in N. lugens is through protecting tissues from oxidative damage. Our study extends the GSTs range of efficacy to pyrethroid insecticides and possibly explains the role of elevated GSTs in other pyrethroid-resistant insects.

AB  - Considering the intriguing relationship between immune system and behavior recently described in mammals, and the lack of information of this relationship in fish, here we describe for the first time the interaction between the immune system and social and exploratory behavior in zebrafish. Fish high responders to novelty (HRN) presented a proinflammatory profile, with increased IL-1 beta and reduced IL-10 expression compared to fish low responders to novelty (LRN). Likewise, fish less responsive to social stimuli have a reduced expression of INF-gamma We show that fish with different behavior patterns have differences in the immune response. Our findings indicate that the interplay between immune system and behavior in zebrafish is similar to that found in mammalian models and that zebrafish should be considered as a potential model organism to study the relationship between immune system and behavior.

AB  - In the present study, the status of antioxidant response and molecular regulation in Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis under the exposure of synthetic pyrethroid deltamethrin were investigated by means of measuring the antioxidative enzyme activity and relative mRNA expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in hepatopancreas. The results showed that activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) decreased remarkably in all treatments except the SOD activity at concentration of 0.073 mu g/L. The oxidative stress products malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) increased significantly at high concentrations while no significant difference was observed at concentrations of 0.073 and 0.146 mu g/L throughout the experiment. Meanwhile, the relative mRNA expression of HSP 60, HSP 70 and HSP 90 was significantly up-regulated in all treatments at each time point. All resutis above indicated that deltamethrin has prominent toxic effect on E. sinensis based on antioxidative enzyme inhibition and oxidative products accumulation at environmental related concentrations, and a protective response by up-regulation of HSPs was carried out by animals to mitigate the oxidative stress. In addition, SOD, CAT, MDA, H2O2 and the expression of heat shock proteins, especially HSP 70 in hepatopancreas could be sensitive biomarkers in the assessment of toxic effect of deltamethrin on E.sinensis.

AB  - Exposure to environmental contaminants, including various pesticides and trace metals, can disrupt critical olfactory-driven behaviors of fish such as homing to natal streams, mate selection, and an ability to detect predators and prey. These neurobehavioral injuries have been linked to reduced survival and population declines. Despite the importance of maintaining proper olfactory signaling processes in the presence of chemical exposures, little is known regarding chemical detoxification in the salmon olfactory system, and in particular, the antioxidant defenses that maintain olfactory function. An understudied, yet critical component of cellular antioxidant defense is phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx/GPx4), an isoform within the family of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzymes that can directly reduce lipid peroxides and other membrane-bound complex hydroperoxides. In this study, we cloned two gpx4 isoforms (gpx4a and gpx4b) from Coho salmon olfactory tissues and compared their modulation in olfactory and liver tissues by cadmium, an environmental pollutant and olfactory toxicant that cause oxidative damage as a mechanism of toxicity. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the two gpx4 isoforms shared 71% identity, and also relatively high sequence identities when compared with other fish GPx4 isoforms. Sequence comparisons with human GPx4 indicated conservation of three important active sites at selenocysteine (U46), glutamine (Q81), and tryptophan (W136), suggesting similar catalytic activity between fish and mammalian GPx4 isoforms. Tissue profiling confirmed the expression of gpx4a and gpx4b in all ten Coho tissues examined. The expression of gpx4 mRNAs in the Coho olfactory system was accompanied by comparably high initial rates of GPx4 enzymatic activity in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. Exposure to low (3.7 ppb) and high (347 ppb) environmental Cd concentrations for 24-48 h significantly decreased gpx4a expression in Coho olfactory rosettes, whereas olfactory gpx4b mRNA expression was not modulated by exposures at these concentrations. In summary, Coho salmon express two paralogs of gpx4, a key enzyme in the maintenance of signal transduction processes that protect against cellular oxidative damage. The Cd-associated downregulation of salmon olfactory gpx4a expression in particular, may be associated with the loss of olfactory signal transduction that accompanies metal-associated loss of olfaction in salmonids.

TI  - AN UNUSUAL CASE OF ACUTE AGGRESSION IN A CAT ASSOCIATED WITH SERUM ORGANOPHOSPHATE (DIAZINON)
T2  - FELINE PRACTICE
LA  - English
AB  - A 2-year-old, neutered female Domestic Shorthair cat was referred for behavioral evaluation of acute and unprecedented aggressiveness toward her owners. Behavioral changes began 4 weeks before the house call and coincided with the introduction of a new toy. Several days following initial exposure to the toy, agitation and inappropriate vocalization were noticed. By the end of the week, the cat was found to be disoriented, profusely salivating, and intensely sucking on the toy's carpeted base. The next morning, the cat viciously, repeatedly, and without cause attacked its owners. A tentative diagnosis of organophosphate (OF) intoxication was later confirmed by the identification of serum levels (3.5 mu g/mL) of diazinon at 10 times the permissible blood levels in humans. The toy's carpeted base was the suspected source of contamination. Cholinesterase levels (1.047 mu mol/L/minute and 1.088 mu mol/L/minute) were within the normal reference range for cats. This may be because laboratory analysis was performed on serum drawn during the acute clinical signs many weeks earlier. Toxic levels of serum diazinon confirm a diagnosis of organophosphate exposure even in the absence of depressed cholinesterase. This is the first report of confirmed OP exposure, and specifically diazinon, associated with predominantly aggressive behavioral alterations in the cat. It highlights a potential source of contamination and serious health risk to both pets and children.

AB  - This study describes the use of a panel of immune assays, originally developed by the National Toxicology Program for assessing xenobiotic-induced immunotoxicity in mice, to quantify the effects of sublethal malathion exposure on the immune responses of fish. For this study, Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed subchronically to the organophosphate pesticide malathion in a series or two experiments. In the first set of studies, fish were exposed for 7 or 14 d to untreated well water (i.e., controls) or to waterborne malathion at 0.2 or 0.8 mg/L. Following exposure, fish from each group were sacrificed and their kidneys (primary organ of leukopoiesis in fish and equivalent to mammalian bone marrow) were used to provide cells for assessing any malathion-induced effects upon nonspecific and acquired immune defense mechanisms. Effects upon humoral-mediated immunity were determined by enumerating antibody plaque-forming cell (PFC) numbers from a subset of fish exposed to malathion for 14 d and then injected intraperitoneally (ip) with sheep erythrocytes (sRBC). Results of these studies demonstrated that while malathion exposure had no significant effect upon hematocrit/leukocrit values or upon mitogen-stimulated T-cell lymphoproliferation, PFC numbers in the kidney of exposed fish were significantly reduced (compared to control fish) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, total recoverable kidney cell numbers.

AB  - Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) is a Gram-negative fish pathogen with worldwide distribution and broad host specificity that causes heavy economic losses in aquaculture. Although Phdp was first identified more than 50 years ago, its pathogenicity mechanisms are not completely understood. In this work, we report that Phdp secretes large amounts of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) when cultured in vitro and during in vivo infection. These OMVs were morphologically characterized and the most abundant vesicle-associated proteins were identified. We also demonstrate that Phdp OMVs protect Phdp cells from the bactericidal activity of fish antimicrobial peptides, suggesting that secretion of OMVs is part of the strategy used by Phdp to evade host defense mechanisms. Importantly, the vaccination of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) with adjuvant-free crude OMVs induced the production of anti-Phdp antibodies and resulted in partial protection against Phdp infection. These findings reveal new aspects of Phdp biology and may provide a basis for developing new vaccines against this pathogen.

AB  - Thiodan (R) is an insecticide which can cause morphological changes in fish tissues, dependent on the concentration. To investigate possible morphological changes, this study evaluated the number and diameter of ovarian follicles in lambaris Astyanax bimaculatus exposed to Thiodan (R) for 96 h in different treatments at three sub-lethal concentrations: 1.15, 2.3 and 5.6 mu g L-1 and a control group without Thiodan (R). Females exposed to Thiodan (R) were divided into four treatments: (i) without acclimation and without food, (ii) without acclimation and with food, (iii) with acclimation for 10 days and without food; (iv) with acclimation for 10 days and with food. In this study, it was noted that the action of Thiodan (R) at sub-lethal concentrations in a static system did not affect the morphology of follicular development. However, the treatments with acclimation showed lower numbers of primary and secondary follicles when compared to fish from treatments without acclimation. For the groups exposed to Thiodan (R), a greater number of atretic follicles were observed compared to the control groups. The follicular diameter of secondary follicles in fish exposed to Thiodan (R) in the treatment with acclimation and with food was highest in the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the mean gonadosomatic (GSI) and hepatosomatic (HSI) indices of treatments with acclimation were lower than those for treatments without acclimation. These data suggest that the fish may be being affected by the pesticide to which the fish were submitted, and may cause impairment to the follicular development.

AB  - Deltamethrin is a pyrethroid pesticide contaminating aquatic ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to clarify the acute toxicity of deltamethrin on the fatty acids of phospholipid (PL) classes in liver and gill of Nile tilapia. The fatty acids of PL classes were analyzed by gas chromatography. Deltamethrin brought about differences in the fatty acids of the PL classes in the liver and gill. In the liver of exposed fish, 16:0, 18:2(n-6), 22:6(n-3) in phosphatidylcholine (PC); 16:0, 18:1(n-9), 18:2(n-6), 20:4(n-6), 22:6(n-3) in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE); 16:0, 18:0, 18:1(n-9), 20:4(n-6), 22:6(n-3) in phosphatidylinositol (PI) and in phosphatidylserine (PS) 16:0, 18:1(n-9), 20:4(n-6), 22:6(n-3) were the affected fatty acids. There were significant alterations in Sigma MUFAs (monounsaturated fatty acids), a(n-3)PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) and Sigma(n-6)PUFAs in PC; Sigma SFAs (saturated fatty acids), Sigma MUFAs, Sigma PUFAs, Sigma(n-3)PUFAs and Sigma(n-6)PUFAs in PE; Sigma SFAs, Sigma MUFAs, Sigma(n-3)PUFAs and Sigma(n-6)PUFAs in PI and Sigma SFAs, Sigma MUFAs,Sigma PUFAs and Sigma(n-3)PUFAs in PS. In the gill, 18:2(n-6), 20:4(n-6), 22:6(n-3) in PC; 16:0, 18:1(n-9), 20:4(n-6), 22:6(n-3) in PE; 16:0, 18:0, 18:1(n-9), 18:2(n-6) in PI and in PS 16:0, 18:0,18:1(n-9), 20:3(n-6), 20:5(n-3), 22:6(n-3) affected. The alterations in Sigma SFAs, Sigma MUFAs, Sigma PUFAs and Sigma(n-6)PUFAs in PC; Sigma SFAs, Sigma MUFAs, Sigma PUFAs, Sigma(n-3)PUFAs and Sigma(n-6)PUFAs in PE; Sigma(n-3)PUFAs and Sigma(n-6)PUFAs in PI; Sigma SFAs, Sigma MUFAs, Sigma PUFAs, Sigma(n-3) PUFAs and Sigma(n-6)PUFAs in PS were significant in gill. The changes in the fatty acids of the PL classes in response to deltamethrin can influence structure and functions of the membrane systems. Changes in fatty acids may be one defense mechanism against the deltamethrin.

AB  - Glyphosate, a globally prevalent herbicide known for its selective inhibition of the shikimate pathway in plants, is now implicated in physiological effects on humans and animals, probably due to its impacts in their gut microbiomes which possess the shikimate pathway. In this study, we investigate the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate on the gut microbiota, neurotransmitter levels, and anxiety in zebrafish. Our findings demonstrate that glyphosate exposure leads to dysbiosis in the zebrafish gut, alterations in central and peripheral serotonin levels, increased dopamine levels in the brain, and notable changes in anxiety and social behavior. While the dysbiosis can be attributed to glyphosate's antimicrobial properties, the observed effects on neurotransmitter levels leading to the reported induction of oxidative stress in the brain indicate a novel and significant mode of action for glyphosate, namely the impairment of the microbiome-gut-axis. While further investigations are necessary to determine the relevance of this mechanism in humans, our findings shed light on the potential explanation for the contradictory reports on the safety of glyphosate for consumers.

AB  - The use of pesticides is a widely spread practice in Brazilian agriculture, and dispersion of these substances is an important factor for the fauna and flora. Atrazine is an endocrine disruptor in the xenoestrogen class that is used worldwide in agricultural practices. In Brazil, its use is permitted in several crops. Podocnemis expansa is a representative of the Testudines order that is the largest freshwater reptile of South America. Its distribution enables it to get in contact with molecules that are commonly used as pesticides, which may cause deleterious effects in target populations. In order to evaluate the possible effects of the exposure to atrazine on bone ontogeny of this species, eggs were artificially incubated in sand moistened with water contaminated with atrazine at concentrations equal to 0, 2, 20 or 200 mu g/L. Embryos were collected throughout incubation and submitted to diaphanization of soft tissues with potassium hydroxide (KOH); bones were stained with Alizarin red S and cartilages by Alcian blue. Embryos were evaluated for the presence of abnormalities during the different stages of pre-natal development of skeletal elements. No effect of atrazine was observed on bone development during the embryonic phase in P. expansa individuals, in the conditions of this study.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the ameliorative properties of lycopene against the toxic effects of deltamethrin (DM) by examining oxidative damage markers such as lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant defense system components in carp (Cyprinus carpio). The fish were divided into seven groups of 15 fish each and received the following treatments: Group 1, no treatment; Group 2, orally administered corn oil; Group 3, oral lycopene (10 mg/kg body weight); Group 4, exposure to 0.018 mu g/L DM; Group 5, exposure to 0.018 mu 4/L DM plus oral administration of 10 mg/kg lycopene; Group 6, exposure to 0.036 mu g/L DM; and Group 7, exposure to 0.036 mu g/L. DM plus oral administration of 10 mg/kg lycopene. Treatment was continued for 14 days, and at the end of this period, blood and tissue (liver, kidney, and gill) samples were collected. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were determined in blood and tissues for measurement of oxidant-antioxidant status. A significant elevation in the level of MDA, as an index of lipid peroxidation, and reductions in antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px) and low molecular weight antioxidant (GSH) levels were observed in DM-exposed fish. Treatment with lycopene attenuated the DM-induced oxidative stress by significantly decreasing the levels of MDA. In addition, lycopene significantly increased the SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities and the level of GSH. The present results suggest that administration of lycopene might alleviate DM-induced oxidative stress. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of interactions between pesticide exposure and perceived predation risk on the lethal and sub-lethal responses of two aquatic insects was investigated using the pesticide imidacloprid, and a combination of predator-release kairomones from trout and alarm substances from conspecifics. Laboratory experiments examined feeding and respiration rates of the caddisfly Sericostoma vittatum as well as the growth, emergence and respiration rates of the midge Chironomus riparius, exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of imidacloprid. The effects of the two stressors on burrowing behaviour of both species were also assessed. The results show significant effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of imidacloprid on all endpoints studied. Perceived predation risk also elicited sub-lethal effects in C. riparius and S. vittatum, the latter species being less responsive to predation cues. The effects of simultaneous exposure to both types of stressors were assessed using two different approaches: analysis of variance and conceptual models [concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA)] normally used for the evaluation of contaminant mixture exposure. Both statistical approaches showed no significant interactions on responses in simultaneous exposures in the majority of parameters assessed with only a signification deviation from the reference CA and IA models being found for C. riparius respiration data contrary to the ANOVA results.
   Exposure to imidacloprid also compromised antipredator behavioural responses of both insect species, with potential negative consequences in terms of mortality from predation in the field.
   The results obtained demonstrate that natural and anthropogenic stressors can be treated within the same framework providing compatible data for modelling. For an improved interpretation of ecological effects it will be important to expand the mechanistic study of effects of combined exposure to pesticides and perceived predation risk by measuring different endpoints over a wider range of pesticide concentrations.

AB  - Coral and rocky reef fish populations are widely used as model systems for the experimental exploration of density-dependent vital rates, but patterns of density-dependent mortality in these systems are not yet fully understood. In particular, the paradigm for strong, directly density-dependent (DDD) postsettlement mortality stands in contrast to recent evidence for inversely density-dependent (IDD) mortality. We review the processes responsible for DDD and IDD per capita mortality in reef fishes, noting that the pattern observed depends on predator and prey behavior, the spatial configuration of the reef habitat, and the spatial and temporal scales of observation. Specifically, predators tend to produce DDD prey mortality at their characteristic spatial scale of foraging, but prey mortality is IDD at smaller spatial scales due to attack-abatement effects (e. g., risk dilution). As a result, DDD mortality may be more common than IDD mortality on patch reefs, which tend to constrain predator foraging to the same scale as prey aggregation, eliminating attack-abatement effects. Additionally, adjacent groups of prey on continuous reefs may share a subset of refuges, increasing per capita refuge availability and relaxing DDD mortality relative to prey on patch reefs, where the patch edge could prevent such refuge sharing. These hypotheses lead to a synthetic framework to predict expected mortality patterns for a variety of scenarios. For nonsocial, nonaggregating species and species that aggregate in order to take advantage of spatially clumped refuges, IDD mortality is possible but likely superseded by DDD refuge competition, especially on patch reefs. By contrast, for species that aggregate socially, mortality should be IDD at the scale of individual aggregations but DDD at larger scales. The results of nearly all prior reef fish studies fit within this framework, although additional work is needed to test many of the predicted outcomes. This synthesis reconciles some apparent contradictions in the recent reef fish literature and suggests the importance of accounting for the scale-sensitive details of predator and prey behavior in any study system.

AB  - Atrazine (ATZ) is a frequent contaminant in freshwater ecosystems within agricultural regions. The capacity of this herbicide to interfere with the vertebrate endocrine system is broadly recognized, but the mechanisms and responses usually differ among species. In this study, ATZ effects on hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis key genes expression and early gonadal development were evaluated in Odontesthes bonariensis larvae waterborne exposed during the gonadal differentiation period. Fish were treated to 0, 0.7, 7.0, and 70 mu g ATZ/L at 25 degrees C from the 2nd to 6th week after hatching (wah), and a group was kept in clean water until the 12th wah. Parallelly, a group was submitted to 0.05 mu g/L of ethinylestradiol (EE2) as a positive estrogenic control. From each treatment, eight larvae were sampled at 6 wah for gene expression analysis and twelve larvae at 12 wah for phenotypic sex histological determination. The expression of gnrh1, lhb, fshb, and cyp19a1b was assessed in the head, and the ones of amha, 11 beta hsd2, and cyp19a1a in the trunk. Fish growth was significantly higher in fish exposed to 7 and 70 mu g ATZ/L in the 6 wah, but the effect vanished at the 12 wah. The expression of lhb was upregulated in both sex larvae exposed from 7 mu g ATZ/L. However, a dimorphic effect was induced on cyp19a1a expression at 70 mu g ATZ/L, up or downregulating mRNA transcription in males and females, respectively. Delayed ovarian devel-opment and increased number of testicular germ cells were histologically observed from 7 to 70 mu g ATZ/L, respectively, and a sex inversion (genotypic male to phenotypic female) was found in one larva at 70 mu g ATZ/L. The lhb expression was also upregulated by EE2, but the cyp19a1a expression was not affected, and a complete male-to-female reversal was induced. Further, EE2 upregulated gnrh1 in females and cyp19a1b in both sexes, but it did not alter any assessed gene in the trunk. In conclusion, ATZ disrupted HPG axis physiology and normal gonadal development in O. bonariensis larvae at environmentally relevant concentrations. The responses to ATZ only partially overlapped and were less active when compared to the model estrogenic compound EE2.

AB  - Cytokines are a family of proteins derived from macrophages, lymphocytes, granulocytes, mast cells and epithelial cells and can be divided into interferons (IFNs), Interleukins (ILs) and Tumor Necrosis factors (TNFs) among others. The presence of cytokines in a wide number of fish species has been proved and several molecules types have been already cloned and sequenced. In this work some proinflamatory molecules and Mx gene were detected in the liver of vaccinated sea bream juveniles with an average body weight of 5 g. The method of immunization was by short bath and three different bacterins against the marine pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida were designed and used to immunize fish. Five genes encoding for five different molecules were analyzed by real time PCR: IL-1 beta, IL Ir-2, Cox-2, Mx and TNF alpha. Gene expression was quantified along four days after fish immunization and results were compared among groups. Results show that the heat-inactivated vaccine stimulates the up-regulation of IL-1 beta, IL Ir-2, Cox-2 and TNFa genes whereas the UV-light inactivated vaccine was the unique vaccine which stimulates the expression of Mx gene. The present is a novel study that shows by the first time the effect of the inactivation process of vaccines on the expression levels of genes involved in the defense against Photobacterium damselae subsp piscicida.

AB  - In amphibians and fishes, evidence is increasing that chemical cues from injured conspecifics can play a role in the chemical labelling and learned recognition of unfamiliar predators. In this laboratory study, we tested the prediction that prior chemical exposure to a non-native predator feeding on conspecific tadpoles will subsequently allow tadpoles of the common toad (Bufo bufo) to recognize the chemical cues specifically released by this starved predator. Furthermore, we investigated the vulnerability of this chemically-mediated process to herbicide contamination. With these aims in view, groups of tadpoles were kept either unexposed or exposed for ten days to chemical cues from Turkish crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) previously fed on tadpoles, both in uncontaminated water and in the presence of four sublethal concentrations of amitrole (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.l(-1)). We then assessed the effects of the six conditioning treatments on general activity and behavioural response to chemical cues from starved crayfish. Larval treatments did not affect the general activity of the tadpoles. By contrast, the treatments had significant effects on the behavioural response to the test solution prepared form starved crayfish. The only tadpoles to show an antipredator behavioural response to the chemical stimulation from starved crayfish belonged to the groups derived from chemical exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in uncontaminated water and in contaminated water with the lowest concentration of amitrole (0.01 mg.l(-1)). Conversely, this chemical stimulation produced no behavioural change in the control group or in the groups derived from exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in contaminated water containing 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.l(-1) of amitrole. This study demonstrates that chemical cues released during the predator's feeding activity can subsequently be used by common toad tadpoles in the recognition of an unfamiliar predator. In addition, our results show that the presence of sublethal amitrole concentrations can impair this recognition process. Such a pesticide effect might be especially detrimental for amphibian populations threatened by invasive predators.

AB  - In fish, as in other aerobic organisms, glutathione and glutathione-related enzymes are important components in the defences against oxidative stress. To study if hepatic glutathione levels and/or activities of glutathione-related enzymes can act as indicators of oxidative stress in fish, we injected rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) intraperitoneally with paraquat (PQ), menadione (MD), naphthazarin (DHNQ), or beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF), all known to cause a rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS). After 2 and 5 days of exposure, we measured the activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase (GPox), glutathione S-transferase (GST), gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS), and glutathione reductase (GR). We also measured total glutathione (tGSH) and oxidised glutathione (GSSG) in the liver of fish treated with PQ and MD. All chemicals caused an increase in GR activity after 5 days, which ranged from 160% in fish treated with beta-NF to 1500% in fish treated with PQ All chemicals except beta-NF caused moderate elevation in GST activity; GPox activity was lower in fish treated with DHNQ and MD, while GCS activity increased twofold in the fish treated with DHNQ, without being affected by beta-NF, PQ or MD. After 5 days of treatment with PQ or MD, tGSH content was elevated. Our findings demonstrated that of the parameters included in the study, GR activity was the most responsive to treatment with redox cycling compounds, indicating that GR activity is a promising biomarker of such compounds and possibly indicating oxidative stress in rainbow trout.

AB  - A wide range of pollutants in the aquatic environment have the capacity to induce toxic effects expressed as cellular oxidative stress. In the current study, the potential of an in vitro toxicity testing system was therefore investigated using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatocytes to assess different endpoints of oxidative stress. The pro-oxidants CuSO4 and paraquat were used as models for comparison to a complex environmental sample Results following 6, 24. 48 and 96 h exposure to different concentrations of these substances show cellular effects on intracellular ROS formation, glutathione levels and redox status, expression of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (GCS) and thioredoxin, as well as cytotoxicity parameters. The most consistent effects (maximum values within brackets), observed in dose and time parameters for both model compounds and environmental sample, were the depletion of total glutathione (94% of control), induced levels of oxidized glutathione (695% of control), and gene expression regulation depicted relative to the control gene beta-actin of GCS mRNA (239% of control) and catalase (29% of control) In conclusion, the responses on several antioxidant defence system parameters demonstrated the validity of the in vitro toxicity testing system Not only could multiple effects be detected at sub-lethal exposure concentrations. but these effects also gave valuable insight to the toxic mechanisms at the molecular level (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, one of the most important aquatic species in Egypt, has suffered intensive losses from bacterial pathogens; Aeromonas hydrophila and Photobacterium damselae during the onset of the summer season. The immune mechanisms involved in the infection of P. damselae in fish are still poorly recognized. In this study, O. niloticus intraperitoneally injected by two bacterial inocula (1.7 x 10(5) CFU ml(-1) for A. hydrophila and 2 x 10(6) CFU ml(-1) for P. damselae). Blood was sampled after 1, 3 and 7 days of each bacterial injection to evaluate total, differential leukocytic counts, and alterations in cellular innate immunity parameters; phagocytic activity, respiratory burst, serum lysozyme, bactericidal activity, complement system, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Simultaneously, the mRNA expression levels of three immune-relevant genes (TLR-7, NF kappa B, MHC-IIa) and four pro-inflammatory cytokines related genes (IL-6, IL-8, CC-chemokine, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha) were evaluated in the spleen and head-kidney using q-PCR. Our data implied that tested immunological parameters and its relevant genes expression showed distinct patterns. In general, a notable increase in the leukocyte counts and innate immune responses, mainly in the respiratory burst, lysozyme, and complement (C4), but with a marked decrease in the phagocytic activity, principally on days 3 and 7 of challenge experiment. Moreover, transcript levels of immune-related genes (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 beta, CC-chemokine, TLR-7, and NF-kappa B) were significantly down-regulated among different time points of the challenge experiment. A positive correlation was noted between gene expression obtained and tested phagocytic activity, implying that these pathogens can subvert the immune defense of the host. Together, these results symbolize the disparity in the kinetics of inherent immunity responses in peripheral blood and the molecular mechanism in immune organs used for combating these bacterial pathogens.

AB  - The Herring gull (HG) (Larus argentatus) is naturally exposed to halogenated organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) through its diet. During periods of food scarcity, arctic seabirds experience lipid mobilization, allowing stored lipid soluble contaminants to re-enter the body circulation. In the present study, we investigated the effects of PCB exposure and fasting on the antioxidant defense system in HG chicks. Forty newly hatched chicks were exposed to contaminated cod liver oil for 6 weeks and then fasted for 1 week. We assessed the hepatic total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) against peroxynitrite, hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, and measured glutathione (reduced: GSH, and oxidized: GSSG) levels and the enzymatic activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase. The results show that fasting significantly increased the HOC levels in the HG chick livers. Limited effects were observed on antioxidant responses; significant effects were only found for catalase (CAT) activity, Se-dependent GPX activity and the GSH/GSSG ratio in the exposed and fasted group. CAT and Se-dependent GPX activities correlated negatively with the PCB concentrations within this group, and a nonlinear relationship between glutathione and contaminant levels was also found. These effects were generally not observed after exposure or fasting alone and were likely related to the high PCB levels induced by the combination of exposure and fasting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Morphological abnormalities in wild animals can be indicators of the underlying health of a population and may be determined through routine photographic surveys. Here, we assess unusual rostrum conditions in Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea) inhabiting South African coastal waters to understand the rate of prevalence of abnormal rostrums and formulate hypotheses on potential causes. Photographic data were collated from systematic boat surveys and opportunistic sightings, obtained between April 1998 and March 2021 in various regions along the South African coast. Overall, 31 unique individuals were found with abnormal rostrum conditions, varying from slight misalignments to severe wounds and/or aberrant morphologies. In most cases, injuries were likely caused by natural events during the animal's life history such as interactions with sharks and/or reef-associated hunting strategies. Mark-recapture data indicated that individuals had survived with these injuries for up to 10 years. This study reports the highest incidence of rostrum abnormalities in the species. As numbers reflect only those that have survived their injuries, they are considered a minimum estimate. A better understanding of the cause(s) of these injuries is important given the endangered status of this species.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos is one of the substances of the first stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/923, as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 416/2008(4).
   Chlorpyrifos was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 July 2006 by Commission Directive 2005/72/EC5. It was a specific provision of the inclusion, that notifiers were required to submit to the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') further studies to confirm the risk assessment for birds and mammals within two years from the entry into force of the inclusion Directive.
   In accordance with the specific provision, Dow AgroSciences, on behalf of the Chlorpyrifos Task Force, submitted further studies in June 2008, which were evaluated by the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), Spain, in the form of an Addendum to the assessment report. In compliance with Guidance Document SANCO 5634/2009 rev. 3, the RMS distributed the Addendum to Member States and the EFSA for comments on 30 June 2009. The RMS collated all comments in the format of a Reporting Table, which was submitted to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) in November 2009.
   Following consideration of the comments received, and the further discussions in the SCFCAH, the Commission requested the EFSA to organise a peer review of the RMS's evaluation of the confirmatory data and to deliver its conclusions on the risk assessment for birds and mammals.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use of chlorpyrifos as an insecticide on grape vines, as proposed by the notifiers. Full details of the representative use can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   A high acute risk to birds and small herbivorous mammals such as voles cannot be excluded on the basis of the available data. A high long-term risk to mammals was identified in the refined risk assessment. Risk mitigation measures, such as no-spray buffer zones, are needed to protect fish-eating birds and mammals.

AB  - Shellfish farming is an important economic activity around the world. This activity often takes place in areas subjected to various recurring pollutions. The recrudescent use of herbicides in agriculture including atrazine implies pollutant transfer towards aquatic environment in estuarine areas. Harmful effects of such substances on animals in marine environment, particularly on cultured bivalves, are poorly documented. Bivalve molluscs such as mussels and oysters have been postulated as ideal indicator organisms because of their way of life. They filter large volumes of seawater and may therefore accumulate and concentrate contaminants within their tissues. Moreover, development of techniques allowing effect analysis of such compounds on bivalve biology may lead to the development of diagnosis tools adapted to analyze pollutant transfer towards estuarine areas. In this context, influence of atrazine on defence mechanisms was analyzed in Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas. Atrazine was tested in vitro and in vivo on oyster haemocytes, and its effects were analyzed by flow cytometry. Haemocyte viability, cell cycle and cellular activities were monitored. Atrazine induced no significant effect in oyster under tested conditions except for peroxidase activity.

AB  - Triadimefon (TDF) is a triazole fungicide extensively used in agriculture that has been found as a pollutant in numerous water sources. In mammals, it inhibits monoamine uptake through binding to the dopamine transporter, with a mechanism of action similar to cocaine, resulting in higher levels of dopamine at the synapse. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in a broad spectrum of processes such as locomotion, cognition, reward, and mental disorders. In this work we have studied, for the first time, the effects of TDF on behavior of both larval and adult zebrafish and its connection with changes in the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We evaluated the acute exposure of 5 dpf larvae to different concentrations of TDF, ranging from 5 mg/L to 35 mg/L. The lowest concentration does not alter neither locomotor activity nor dopamine levels but produced changes in the expression of two genes, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine transporter (dat). Besides, it induced a reduction in extracellular serotonin and had an anxiolytic-like effect, supported by a decrease in cortisol production. On the other hand, a high concentration of TDF produced a dose-dependent reduction in locomotion, which was reversed or enhanced by D1 (SCH-23390) or D2 (Haloperidol) dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively. Using in vivo electrochemistry, we show that these changes could be associated with higher levels of dopamine in the brain. Thus, in adult zebrafish, though not in larvae, TDF exposure increases locomotor activity, anxiety and aggressiveness, which coincides with the behaviors observed in mammals.

AB  - The 8-oxodG content has been measured in chromosomal DNA of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) by HPLC-EC. Susceptibility of different tissues to oxidative DNA damage was studied by exposing fish to model pollutants. Cu(II), paraquat (PQ) and malathion failed to promote DNA oxidation in liver, while dieldrin significantly increased the 8-oxodG content in this organ, but not in gills or blood. After PQ exposure, fish liver showed high levels of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (G-6PDH) and GSSG reductase activities. The increased antioxidant status and the lack of a specific transport system could explain the lack of susceptibility of liver to DNA oxidative damage induced by PQ. Increased levels of 8-oxodG were detected in the gills of PQ-exposed fish after 8 and 24 h. In contrast, after 48 h exposed fish contained lower 8-oxodG levels than controls. The existence of a PQ transport system in this O-2-rich organ and the lack of a significant increase in antioxidant defenses would explain the sensitivity of gills to DNA damage promoted by PQ. Elimination of this soluble chemical and the putative induction of DNA-repair enzymes specific for oxidative damages could explain the drop of 8-oxodG levels at longer times. Fish exposed to moderate levels of urban and industrial pollution showed significantly high 8-oxodG content in hepatic DNA. We conclude that 8-oxodG determination in chromosomal DNA by HPLC-EC is a potentially useful biomarker of environmental pollution, although its response is still somewhat lower than that of other well-established biomarkers of oxidative stress.

AB  - The non-discriminatory use of pesticides and herbicides to increase agricultural production has caused great concern, as these products are likely to reach the aquatic environment, thus representing a health problem for aquatic species, but also for humans. Cypermethrin, a pyrethroid type II insecticide, is widely used in agriculture, but also for pest control of plants and stored agricultural products, as well as for combating the biological vectors of human and animal diseases. The administration of cypermethrin to Paracheirodon innensi determined ample variations in the activity of oxidative stress enzymes and malondialdehyde concentration, in close correlation with the concentration used, but also the occurrence of some locomotor deficiency and an anxiety state.

AB  - The synthetic pyrethroid derivatives permethrin and cyhalothrin are widely used insecticides that are considered to be relatively nontoxic to higher animals. However, a variety of toxic effects on mammals have been reported. We investigated the effect of these drugs on energy coupling by mitochondria and on the activity of the individual respiratory complexes. Using isolated rat liver mitochondria, a concentration-dependent inhibition of glutamate and succinate sustained state 3 respiration was found for both compounds in the micromolar range. The effect of pyrethroids on the activities of the complexes I to V were assessed individually in submitochondrial particles (complex I) and in freeze-thawed mitochondria (complexes Il-V). Complex I (EC 1.6.5.3) was found to be the most sensitive link within the electron transport chain. Half-maximal inhibition was observed at 0.73 mu M permethrin and 0.57 mu M cyhalothrin, respectively, and exhibited sigmoidal inhibition kinetics. Complexes II, III, IV and V (EC 1.3.5.1, 1.10.2.2, 1.9.3.1, 3.6.1.34) were not significantly inhibited by up to 50 mu M of these drugs. Thus, our results reveal a mode of action of synthetic pyrethroid insecticides not previously reported.

AB  - Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are frequently used as experimental animals in ecotoxicological studies, in which they are experimentally exposed to defined concentrations of test substances, such as heavy metals, pesticides, or pharmaceuticals. Following exposure to a broad variety of aquatic pollutants, early morphologically detectable toxic effects often manifest in alterations of the gills. Suitable methods for an accurate and unbiased quantitative characterization of the type and the extent of morphological gill alterations are therefore essential prerequisites for recognition, objective evaluation and comparison of the severity of gill lesions. The aim of the present guidelines is to provide practicable, standardized and detailed protocols for the application of unbiased quantitative stereological analyses of relevant morphological parameters of the gills of rainbow trout. These gill parameters inter alia include the total volume of the primary and secondary gill lamellae, the surface area of the secondary gill lamellae epithelium (i.e., the respiratory surface) and the thickness of the diffusion barrier. The featured protocols are adapted to fish of frequently used body size classes (300-2000 g). They include well-established, conventional sampling methods, probes and test systems for unbiased quantitative stereological analyses of light- and electron microscopic 2-D gill sections, as well as the application of modern 3-D light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) of optically cleared gill samples as an innovative, fast and efficient quantitative morphological analysis approach. The methods shown here provide a basis for standardized and representative state-of-the-art quantitative morphological analyses of trout gills, ensuring the unbiasedness and reproducibility, as well as the intra- and inter-study comparability of analyses results. Their broad implementation will therefore significantly contribute to the reliable identification of no observed effect concentration (NOEC) limits in ecotoxicological studies and, moreover, to limit the number of experimental animals by reduction of unnecessary repetition of experiments.

AB  - Giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta Mitchell) is a non-native' invasive aquatic fern that was recently introduced to the southern United States. The aggressive nature of the species has led to concerns over its potential adverse impacts to native plants, fish, and invertebrates. We conducted a study to determine the efficacy of glyphosate [isopropylamine salt of N-(phosphono-methyl)glycine] and several surfactants for control of giant salvinia. Studies were conducted over a 42-day period using static renewals (twice weekly) with 4% Hoagland's medium (10 mg/L N equivalent) in replicated 2-L containers. Five concentrations of glyphosate (0, 0.45, 0.91, 1.82, and 3.60% v:v) and five surfactants (0.25% concentration, v:v; Optima(TM), Kinetic(TM), Mon 0818(TM), Cygnet Plus(TM), and LI-700(TM)) were applied with a pressurized sprayer as a single surface application in a fully nested experimental design. Untreated giant salvinia grew rapidly and exhibited an increase of 800% wet weight biomass over the 42-day test duration. Glyphosate, with and without surfactants, exhibited efficacy at concentrations as low as 0.45% of the commercial formulation. Glyphosate with Optima was the only mixture that resulted in complete mortality of plants with no regrowth.

AB  - A series of compounds of general formula [Ru(eta(6)-fluoroarene)(pta)Cl-2] (fluoroarene = C6H5F, C6H5CF3, and 1,4-C6H4CH3F; pta = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphatricyclo[3.3.1.1]decane) have been prepared and characterized spectroscopically. Additionally, X-ray diffraction was employed to characterize two of the complexes and the corresponding precursors, i.e., [Ru(acac)(2)(eta(4)-cod)] and Ru(eta(6)-fluoroarene)(eta(4)-cod)] (cod = cycloocta-1,5-diene). The solubility, pK(a)'s, and the stability toward hydrolysis of the [Ru(eta(6)-fluoroarene)(pta)Cl-2] complexes were studied, and DFT calculations were performed to assist in rationalizing the observed properties at a molecular level. The cytotoxicities of the pta-based Compounds were evaluated in A2780 ovarian cancer cells, and the observed activities were correlated to the above-mentioned properties. The rate of hydrolysis of the Ru-Cl bonds in the C6H5CF3 derivative was found to increase significantly at low pH, which represents a possible method of tumor targeting based on the reduced pH of this particular cellular environment.

AB  - Multiview video plus depth (MVD) is the most popular 3D video format due to its efficient compression and provision for novel view generation enabling the free-viewpoint applications. In addition to color images, MVD format provides depth maps which are exploited to generate intermediate virtual views using the depth image-based rendering (DIBR) techniques. Compression affects the quality of the depth maps which in turn may introduce various structural and textural distortions in the DIBR-synthesized images. Estimation of the compression-related distortion in depth maps is very important for a high-quality 3D experience. The task becomes challenging when the corresponding reference depth maps are unavailable, e.g., when evaluating the quality on the decoder side. In this paper, we present a no-reference quality assessment algorithm to estimate the distortion in the depth maps induced by compression. The proposed algorithm exploits the depth saliency and local statistical characteristics of the depth maps to predict the compression distortion. The proposed 'depth distortion evaluator' (DDE) is evaluated on depth videos from standard MVD database compressed with the state-of-the-art high-efficiency video coding at various quality levels. The results demonstrate that DDE can be used to effectively estimate the compression distortion in depth videos.

AB  - This study evaluated the influence of the clomazone herbicide (2-[(2-chlorophenyl)methyl]-4,4-dimethyl-3-isoxazolidinone) contamination on the hematological parameters and histological changes in gills and liver of silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) from Madre River, Santa Catarina State, Southern Brazil. Fish were collected between March 2010 and January 2012 at two different sites of the Madre River, one site receiving residual water (contaminated site) from rice culture (n = 49) and another that do not receive residual water (reference site) (n = 48). The herbicide clomazone analysis detected 3.40 +/- 1.70g/L in the contaminated site and 1.1 +/- 0.33g/L in the reference site. Fish from contaminated site showed increased (P < 0.05) number of monocytes suggesting the possible defense response as a result of chronic exposure to clomazone. On the other hand, no difference was found in the hematocrit percentage, red blood cell count, total thrombocyte number, white blood cell count, lymphocytes, and neutrophils number. Fish from both sites showed histopathological changes in gills and liver, possibly caused by chronic exposure to contamination. The influence of herbicide sub doses on fish health is also discussed.

AB  - The main toxicity mechanism of organophosphate insecticides such as malathion is the acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition. However, fish responses to organophosphates may vary depending on the activation of different defense mechanisms as well as the length of exposure. As such, the evaluation of acetylcholinesterase activity, in combination with the evaluation of biotransformation and antioxidants enzymes levels, is useful for indicating damage in fish exposed to this insecticide. Moreover, evaluating mitochondrial activity might evidence how the hierarchic responses occur in relation to the length of time that the fish is exposed. Therefore, the aim of our study is to evaluate whether the length of exposure to malathion differentially affects the biochemical responses of tambaqui. Our hypothesis is that the physiological alterations due to exposure are time dependent. Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of the insecticide during 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Contrary to expectations, there was no acetylcholinesterase activity inhibition during the experiment, which indicates an absence of neurotoxicity. Phase II biotransformation mechanism was activated early, especially in the liver. Oxidative damage was evident in the first hours of exposure and was concurrent with the activation of antioxidant enzymes. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were differentially affected by the length of exposure. The data suggest that the tambaqui regulates mitochondrial respiration differently over time, seeking to maintain homeostasis and ATP demand, and ensures the activation of response mechanisms, thus minimizing oxidative damage and avoiding the neurotoxicity of malathion.

AB  - Diflubenzuron is a chitin-inhibiting insecticide that is registered for use in controlling a multitude of invertebrate pests. The selective mode of action of diflubenzuron provided us with a unique tool for examining the indirect responses of an experimental aquatic ecosystem following direct impacts at the primary consumer (invertebrate) trophic level. Twelve outdoor aquatic mesocosms (0.1 ha each) were randomly assigned to three treatments of diflubenzuron (four mesocosms/treatment): control, monthly (five total 10-mu g/L applications), or biweekly (twice monthly; nine total 10-mu g/L applications). Direct impacts on invertebrates (numbers and species composition of insects and zooplankton) and indirect impacts on fish (mortality, growth, and reproduction of bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass), phytoplankton (biomass and productivity), and water quality were measured over 16 weeks posttreatment. Both monthly and biweekly treatments of diflubenzuron decreased total numbers (fivefold reduction) and species richness (twofold reduction) and increased dominance (twofold increase) of zooplankton within 4 weeks posttreatment; Cladocerans, Copepods, and Rotifers were all sensitive. Diflubenzuron reduced species richness of emergent insects, which resulted in increased dominance by a few species; however, impacts on emergent insects were confounded by a treatment x time interaction. Direct reductions in invertebrate grazers caused indirect increases in algal biomass. Indirect effects on biomass (50% reduction) and individual weight (50% reduction) of juvenile bluegill occurred because of apparent decreases in invertebrate food resources. No statistically significant impacts were observed on adult bluegill or largemouth bass for the duration of the experiment. Results indicated that di8ubenzuron had both direct and indirect impacts on the experimental aquatic ecosystems under the conditions tested.

AB  - The Cueva del Azufre in Tabasco, Mexico, is a nutrient-rich cave and its inhabitants need to cope with high levels of dissolved hydrogen sulfide and extreme hypoxia. One of the successful colonizers of this cave is the poeciliid fish Poecilia mexicana, which has received considerable attention as a model organism to examine evolutionary adaptations to extreme environmental conditions. Nonetheless, basic ecological data on the endemic cave molly population are still missing; here we aim to provide data on population densities, size class compositions and use of different microhabitats. We found high overall densities in the cave and highest densities at the middle part of the cave with more than 200 individuals per square meter. These sites have lower H2S concentrations compared to the inner parts where most large sulfide sources are located, but they are annually exposed to a religious harvesting ceremony of local Zoque people called La Pesca. We found a marked shift in size/age compositions towards an overabundance of smaller, juvenile fish at those sites. We discuss these findings in relation to several environmental gradients within the cave (i.e., differences in toxicity and lighting conditions), but we also tentatively argue that the annual fish harvest during a religious ceremony (La Pesca) locally diminishes competition (and possibly, cannibalism by large adults), which is followed by a phase of overcompensation of fish densities.

AB  - Declines in 6 organochlorine (OC) contaminant groups; chlordane (CHL), DDT, HCH, toxaphene (CHB), PCB and chlorinated benzenes (CBz) were measured in biota of a sub-Arctic lake (Lake Laberge, YT) following the closure of a commercial fishery in 1991. This study examined morphological (length, weight, age), biochemical (lipid content, delta C-13, delta N-15), population and OC data for 9 fishes and zooplankton between 1993 and 2003 (2010 for lake trout) to investigate causes for the OC declines. Growth dilution was a major factor influencing the decrease of OCs in lake trout, round whitefish and possibly zooplankton most notably in the early 2000s. A decline in lipids of most fish species also contributed to OC declines, although no such change was evident for zooplankton. It is suspected that increases in fish populations or climate variations over the 1990s, may have contributed towards a shift in plankton community composition. From 1991 to 1999, CPUE increased for 7 of the fish species and declined for 2 others. Concurrently, the zooplankton community shifted from an abundance of C scutifer in 1993 to dominance by D. pribilofensis in 2001. Nitrogen and carbon stable isotope data suggested that food web interactions for most fish species have not changed over time. Although concentrations of OCs have declined in many fishes, the "rate" of OC transfer (using slopes of log OC vs. nitrogen isotope ratios) through the food web was greater in 2001 than in 1993. Overall, the declines in OC concentrations in the fish from Lake Laberge occurred concurrently with changes in their growth, lipid, and abundance, suggesting that ecosystem responses to the closure of the fishery were in part responsible for the lower contaminants in these fishes. As a result of this study, the Yukon government rescinded the health advisory for limiting the consumption of fish from Lake Laberge. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of exposure to the widely used herbicide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), at environmentally permitted (1 mg L-1), slightly toxic (10 mg L-1), and highly toxic (100 mg L-1) concentrations were analyzed in gills of goldfish, Carassius auratus, a popular fish model for ecotoxicological research. Fish were exposed to the pesticide in water for 96 h and an additional group of fish were treated by the highest 2,4-D concentration and then allowed to recover for further 96 h. Among markers of oxidative stress, goldfish exposure to 2,4-D did not affect carbonyl protein levels in the gills, but fish exposure to 100 mg L-1 of 2,4-D enhanced lipid peroxide concentrations (by 58 %) and oxidized glutathione levels (by 49 %), the latter also significantly increasing (by 33 %) oxidized/total glutathione ratio. Activities of three enzymes of antioxidant defence also increased under 2,4-D exposure: superoxide dismutase (by 29-35 %), catalase (by 41 %), and glutathione peroxidase (by 19-33 %). Activities of other antioxidant associated enzymes as well as other potential markers of stress (e.g. aminotransferase enzymes, acetylcholinesterase, lactate metabolism) showed little or no response in gills to 2,4-D exposure. However, virtually all affected parameters returned to control values during recovery period. A combination of selected indices of oxidative stress and antioxidant defence, measured in fish gills, may provide to be effective biomarkers to assess environmental hazards of 2,4-D to freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Background: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are subject of particular attention and in-depth studies which demonstrate their toxicity towards humans and biotope in general. POPs are therefore addressed by the Stockholm Convention globally with human milk or blood as matrix for effectiveness evaluation. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess plasma concentrations of certain chlorinated POPs in subjects from the urban population in Algiers. Methods: A total number of 207 adult subjects were recruited in Algiers and plasma concentrations of Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), p,p'Dichlorodiphenyl DichloroEthylene (4,4'DDE) and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) were determined by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). Results: The nanogram per gram of lipids (ng g???1 lipids) geometric means of plasma concentrations of studied compounds were: 6.09 for HCB, 131.60 for 4,4'DDE, 8.61 for PCB153, 7.95 for PCB138 and 8.39 for PCB180. PCB 180, PCB 153 and PCB 138 showed a high correlation with each other (r > 0.5). 4,4'DDE concentrations were significantly higher in women and in subject with low educational level, whereas POPs were higher in older participants (> 65 years old). Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and PCB153 concentrations were higher in overweight and obese subjects. There was no significant difference between POPs concentrations according to breastfeeding history, smoking status or fish consumption. Conclusions: Chlorinated POPs were detected in the blood plasma of adults living in Algiers. Plasma concentrations were consistent with those of several studies in the world. However, further investigations are needed to assess the exposure profile of subjects living near contaminated sites. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - All else being equal, inversely density-dependent (IDD) mortality destabilizes population dynamics. However, stability has not been investigated for cases in which multiple types of density dependence act simultaneously. To determine whether IDD mortality can destabilize populations that are otherwise regulated by directly density-dependent (DDD) mortality, I used scale transition approximations to model populations with IDD mortality at smaller "aggregation" scales and DDD mortality at larger "landscape" scales, a pattern observed in some reef fish and insect populations. I evaluated dynamic stability for a range of demographic parameter values, including the degree of compensation in DDD mortality and the degree of spatial aggregation, which together determine the relative importance of DDD and IDD processes. When aggregation-scale survival was a monotonically increasing function of density (a "dilution" effect), dynamics were stable except for extremely high levels of aggregation combined with either undercompensatory landscape-scale density dependence or certain values of adult fecundity. When aggregation-scale survival was a unimodal function of density (representing both "dilution" and predator "detection" effects), instability occurred with lower levels of aggregation and also depended on the values of fecundity, survivorship, detection effect, and DDD compensation parameters. These results suggest that only in extreme circumstances will IDD mortality destabilize dynamics when DDD mortality is also present, so IDD processes may not affect the stability of many populations in which they are observed. Model results were evaluated in the context of reef fish, but a similar framework may be appropriate for a diverse range of species that experience opposing patterns of density dependence across spatial scales.

AB  - Carbofuran is a neurotoxic pesticide acting as an inhibitor of enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The fact that carbofuran is able to inhibit AChE can be used for its assay using an appropriate sensor. Here, electrochemical biosensor having immobilized AChE and using acetylthiocholine as substrate was performed. The biosensor was consisted from a layer containing electric eel AChE and screen printed sensors. AChE was immobilized into gelatin membrane. The immobilization procedure was optimized considering temperature of drying and concentration of gelatin in mixture. Long term stability and interference of organic solvent was done as well. In the final experiment, carbofuran was assayed using the prepared biosensor. Limit of detection 5.01x10(-10) mol/l (0.111 ng/ml) was achieved.

AB  - Neonicotinoids are a popular class of systemic insecticides registered for use in over 120 countries. Recent global water surveys have found neonicotinoid insecticides in waterbodies adjacent to agricultural fields. The presence of neonicotinoids in surface waters raises the concern of the potential risk of exposure to non-target aquatic species, with relevance for both free-living and parasitic taxa. The susceptibility of aquatic free-living parasitic stages to the lethal effects of neonicotinoids may influence the prevalence and intensity of host infection, and their availability as prey for a variety of organisms (e.g., fish, invertebrates). We examined the effects of two commonly used neonicotinoids on the survival of free-living infectious stages (cercariae) from two trematode (flatworm) species (Diplostomum sp. and Haematoloechus sp.). We found that exposure to commercially formulated imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, individually and in a binary mixture, had no significant effect on cercarial survival for either species at environmentally relevant concentrations. Further study is required to understand if the ability of the surviving cercariae to infect the next host in their life cycle is compromised in the presence of neonicotinoids, or if host defenses are compromised, as changes in parasite infectivity or host susceptibility could influence infection dynamics and have community- and ecosystem-level implications.

AB  - Imidacloprid is a first-generation neonicotinoid that is frequently used to manage a variety of pests. Run-off problems, poor wettability, limited effectiveness, and high dosages are the main drawbacks of its current formulations, which negatively affect consumers, pollinators, and the environment. In response to all of these issues, a powerful and environmentally safe imidacloprid nanosuspension (NS) formulation is made using liquid engineering and the biosynergistic pepper oleoresin. The effects of surfactant types, concentration, sheer mixing speed, duration on particle size, and polydispersity index were thoroughly investigated using Zetasizer and scanning electron microscopy. Quality indicators including zeta potential (-36 mV), viscosity, and particle size (30 nm) were successfully modified using CIPAC principles. Oleoresin increases the viscosity while lowering the sedimentation velocity, giving the NS stability for long-term storage. On cotton whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci), the NS has shown superior effectiveness (92%), which may be attributed to its improved (30%) retention and penetration as well as a lower contact angle (37.10). GC-MS analysis found terpene-rich bioactive compounds such as limonene and caryophyllene that may have improved the insecticidal effects of imidacloprid. The NS is less detrimental (69%) to natural defenses, has minor acute toxicity to fish (LC50 = 136.3 mg L-1), and exhibits low phytotoxicity. The NS reduced the detrimental effects on seed germination and growth. HPLC estimates that the reduced deposits (0.06 mg kg(-1)) on flowers make the NS 3.5 times less harmful for pollinators and more advantageous for soil microbes. Since the residual level in the NS-treated cotton seed oil was below the maximum residue limit (0.01 mg kg(-1)), the oil was determined to be safe for human consumption. Scientific validation of the production of a similar toxin in stable, effective, and safe agricultural nanoforms may increase its efficacy even at lower doses, safeguarding human and environmental health and fostering sustainable growth of green plant protection.

AB  - Organochlorine pesticides were detected in El Carpincho shallow lake (Junin, Buenos Aires province, Argentina), and they could have negative effects on its users' health. The object of this study was to assess the human health risk (HR) associated with these pesticides during recreational bathing. The probabilistic HR assessment was based on aggregate and cumulative USEPA models and applied to alpha and delta HCH, Endosulfan and Endosulfan sulphate pesticides. The cancer and noncancer risks were estimated for accidental drinking and dermal contact. The exposure considered was one hour a day(-1) by a sport fisherman. The fisherman characteristics (annual fish trip frequency, event length, experience) were based on previous studies on social aspects of local anglers. The aggregate and cumulative noncancer and cancer risks were 3.19E(-05) and 1.76E(-08) (5 and 3 orders of magnitude lower than the level of hazard for each type of effect). Isomers of HCH were the major contributors in both cases. The recreational use of this shallow lake would not represent an adverse health risk considering the assumed conditions of exposure.

AB  - This study was conceptualized in order to assess the 96-h LC50 of bifenthrin (BF) in O. niloticus and also to measure the biochemical, behavioral, and molecular responses of the fish suchronically exposed to a sub-lethal concentration of the insecticide. The role of Petroselinum crispum essential oil (PEO) supplementation in mitigating the resulted neurotoxic insult was also investigated. The acute toxicity study revealed that the 96-h LC50 of BF is 6.81 mu g/L, and varying degrees of behavioral changes were recorded in a dose-dependent manner. The subchronic study revealed reduction of dissolved oxygen and increased ammonia in aquaria of BF-exposed fish. Clinical signs revealed high degree of discomfort and aggressiveness together with reductions in survival rate and body weight gain. The levels of monoamines in brain, and GABA and amino acids in serum were reduced, together with decreased activities of Na+/K+-ATPase and acetylcholine esterases (AchE). The activities of antioxidant enzymes were also diminshed in the brain while oxdative damage and DNA breaks were elevated. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in serum increased with overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain tissue. BF also upregulated the expression of brain-stress related genes HSP70, Caspase-3 and P53. Supplemention of PEO to BF markedly abrogated the toxic impacts of the insecticide, specially at the high level. These findings demonstrate neuroprotective, antioxidant, genoprotective, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptic effects of PEO in BF-intoxicated fish. Based on these mechanistic insights of PEO, we recommend its use as an invaluable supplement in the fish feed.

AB  - This study describes a long-term toxicity test within a period of 2 months using zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) as the test species and concentrations of 0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mug/l DDT as a model substance. By collecting and counting the number of sperm released during separate mating events we observed that gametes are released asynchronously. Sperm is released in the form of sperm trails laid on the nest surface, subsequently active spermatozoa leave the trails and move in the water for several minutes. Sperm trails consists of bands of viscous material in which sperm is embedded. The water samples for the estimation of sperm presence were collected gradually within 180 min after 24 hr, 2 weeks, 1 month and 2 months of exposure. It was established that the reduction in count, activity of sperm and the average life span of sperm trails were significant (p < 0.05) at the tested concentrations 5 mug/l and 50 mug/l DDT after 1 month of exposure. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that long exposure time and higher DDT tested levels accelerate the occurrence of negative effect on the number and activity of sperm released as well as the life span of their trails.

AB  - The use of feed additives in aquatic animals improves health conditions and well-being under pesticide toxicity. Thus, this study was aimed at evaluating the effect of an immunobiotic mixture (IM) on the growth performance, hemato-biochemistry, and immunity of Nile tilapia exposed to subacute deltamethrin (DMT). Fish were distributed into four groups: groups 1 and 2 were fed a control diet, while groups 3 and 4 were fed IM. Groups 2 and 4 were exposed to DMT (15 mu g/L) in rearing water. The results revealed that DMT-exposed fish exhibited significantly lower final body weights, weight gain, specific growth rate, and survival rate (P < 0.05), while IM feeding resulted in improved growth performance and survival rate in fish with or without DMT toxicity. After 15 and 30 days, DMT-treated fish showed a significant increase in blood urea and bilirubin as well as hepatic enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase) (P < 0.05), while supplementation of the IM mixture significantly lowered these levels in Nile tilapia. Blood total protein, globulin, albumin, white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, phagocytic index, and phagocytic and lysozyme activities were significantly decreased in tilapia subjected to DMT (P < 0.05), while supplementation of the IM mixture significantly increased these levels. Fish fed IM without DMT exposure showed the lowest cortisol and glucose levels, while fish exposed to DMT without IM showed the highest levels (P < 0.05) after 15 and 30 days. To conclude, IM supplementation exhibited defensive effects against DMT toxicity in Nile tilapia by improving growth performance, hematology, blood biochemistry, and immunity.

AB  - Background and Aim: The commercial formulations of the herbicide atrazine (cATZ) are widely employed in Brazilian agriculture, and, as a consequence, ATZ has been found at levels above that established by law in the river basins in Brazil. Although the toxicity of ATZ in fish is well documented, there are few studies on the recovery capacity after cATZ exposure. This work aimed to evaluate, using several biomarkers, the toxic effects of long-term exposure to the sublethal (3.57 mg/L) and nonlethal realistic (3.00 mu g/L) cATZ concentrations followed by a recovery assay, in fingerlings of a Brazilian teleost, the Piaractus mesopotamicus (pacu).
   Materials and Methods: Pacu fingerlings were housed in glass tanks and divided into the following experimental groups (two tanks/group): Exposure control = EC, recovery control = RC, the sublethal groups exposed to 3.57 mg/L of cATZ, (sublethal exposure group = SLE and sublethal recovery group = SLR) and the nonlethal groups treated with 3.00 mu g/L of cATZ (nonlethal exposure group = NLE and nonlethal recovery group = NLR). The exposure assay was semi-static with a duration of 30 days and the recovery assay (after cATZ withdrawal) lasted 14 days. Several biomarkers were evaluated in fingerlings from all groups: The swimming behavior, the body weight gain, the micronucleus formation and nuclear alterations in erythrocytes, and the hepatic and renal histopathology analyzed by qualitative and semi-quantitative morphological methods (using light and electron microscopy).
   Results: No significant difference in weight gain was observed among the groups after the exposure and recovery assays. The sublethal exposure induced impaired swimming movements, significant histopathological alterations, including necrosis in the liver and kidney, and a significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in erythrocytes. The nonlethal exposure induced only subtle histopathological changes in the liver and kidney. After recovery assay, no genotoxic alteration was noted in pacu exposed to sublethal concentration, while the cATZ-induced kidney damage was partially reversed but not the hepatic injury.
   Conclusion: cATZ exhibits long-term toxic effects on pacu, even at relatively low concentrations, affecting mainly the liver and the kidney, and the effects of sublethal concentration are only partially reversed after cATZ withdrawal.

AB  - A collaborative group of fisheries managers and researchers (Cherry Creek Working Group) took advantage of an 8-m waterfall, 100 km of upstream habitat, and a 3 ha-lake to eradicate nonnative trout and introduce native Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WCT) Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi in Cherry Creek, a tributary to the Madison River. This project was part of a larger, broad scale effort to restore WCT within the Madison River basin. The project was logistically and politically complex and required long-term commitments by state and federal agencies, a private landowner, nongovernmental partners and university researchers. We describe and discuss the social, legal, and logistical challenges that arose during this project and provide our perspective on why this project succeeded in spite of these challenges. Administrative and legal challenges delayed implementation of the project for several years, but all challenges were resolved in favor of the project's collaborators. Over a 12-year period, nonnative trout occupying the area were eradicated using piscicides, and more than 39,000 WCT eyed eggs and fry were introduced into four geographic areas (phases) that were separated by natural or temporary fish barriers. Population recovery, measured by comparing pre- and post-treatment trout densities and mean sizes, appeared to occur in 3-4 years. We summarize research that documents the effects of piscicides on nontarget species and the expansion of introduced WCT and their progeny to fill all available habitats, along with lessons learned that are helpful to others designing species conservation efforts of similar scale and complexity.

AB  - Extensive use of triazophos for the chemical control of pests in agriculture or aquaculture might strongly disturb the aquatic environment due to residue accumulation through various routes like surface run-off, spray-drift and effluent from factories, which have potential negative effects to non-target aquatic organisms. Previous studies have documented the antioxidative effects of triazophos to mammals, however, the oxidative toxicity of triazophos to fish has not been adequately studied to date. Thus, an acute exposure (96 h) to triazophos at different concentrations of 0.06, 0.3 and 1.5 mg/L (corresponding to 1/50th, 1/10th and 1/2th of 96 h-LC50, respectively), was conducted to investigate the triazophos-induced oxidative stress in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). The results showed that the time- and dose-dependent induction of oxidative stress except for the ROS level in liver after 24 and 48 h exposure, as indicated by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) level and a compromised antioxidant defense system, including increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase (CAT) activity, glutathione (GSH) content as well as the increased at first and decreased afterwards genes expression (Sod1, Sod2, Cat and Gpx) in brain. Simultaneously, ROS and MDA showed an increased trend, SOD activity, CAT activity and GSH content showed a trend of increasing at 24 h and decreasing at 48 h, and then increasing at 96 h and Sod1, Sod2, Cat and Gpx gene showed decreasing at first and then increasing in liver tissue. The present study concluded that the damage of the antioxidant system by triazophos induced oxidative stress in the brain and liver of zebrafish with concomitant lipid peroxidation, which is an important mechanism underlying the triazophos-induced acute toxicity.

AB  - This study evaluates the effects of exposure to manganese (Mn2+) for 96 hours at two different temperatures ( 24 and 27 degrees C) on juveniles of Centropomus parallelus through the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase ( CAT), micronuclei test (MN) and comet assay. The GST activity did not show any significant difference between the groups exposed to Mn2+ and the respective control groups; in contrast, a major increase in the CAT activity was observed at 27 degrees C in the group exposed to Mn2+ compared to the control group. The genotoxic analyses showed that in all animals exposed to Mn2+, the number of red cells with micronuclei increased significantly compared to the respective control groups. There was also a significant increase in the incidence of DNA damage in the groups exposed to Mn2+. At a temperature of 24 degrees C, animals exposed to Mn2+ had more DNA damage than those at 27 degrees C. It is likely that the increase in temperature can also induce oxidative stress. Thus, we conclude that manganese is toxic to the fat snook juveniles, causing genotoxic damage, and when associated with an increase in temperature, manganese can also provoke an increase in oxidative stress.

AB  - Applied pesticides end up in non-target environments as complex mixtures. When bioavailable, these chemicals pose a threat to living organisms and can induce oxidative stress (OS). In this article, attention is paid to OS and the physiological role of the antioxidant defense system. South African and international literature was reviewed to provide extensive evidence of pesticide-induced OS in non-target organisms, in vivo and in vitro. Although in vitro approaches are used internationally, South African studies have only used in vivo methods. Considering ethical implications, the authors support the use of in vitro bioassays to screen environmental matrices for their OS potential. Since OS responses are initiated and measurable at lower cellular concentrations compared to other toxicity endpoints, in vitro OS bioassays could be used as an early warning sign for the presence of chemical mixtures in non-target environments. Areas of concern in the country could be identified and prioritized without using animal models. The authors conclude that it will be worthwhile for South Africa to include in vitro OS bioassays as part of a battery of tests to screen environmental matrices for biological effects. This will facilitate the development and implementation of biomonitoring programs to safeguard the South African environment.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the role that tributyltin (TBT)-induced decreases in ATP levels may play in TBT-induced decreases in the tumor lysing (lytic) function of natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are a subset of lymphocytes that act as an initial immune defense against tumor cells and virally infected cells. TBT is an environmental contaminant that has been detected in human blood, which has been shown to interfere with ATP synthesis. Previous studies have shown that TBT is able to decrease very significantly the lytic function of NK cells. In this study NK cells were exposed to various concentrations of TBT and to two other compounds that interfere with ATP synthesis (rotenone a complex I inhibitor and oligomycin an ATP synthase inhibitor) for various lengths of time before determining the levels of ATP and lytic function. Exposures of NK cells to 10, 25, 50 and 100 nm TBT did not significantly reduce ATP levels after 24 h. However, these same exposures caused significant decreases in cytotoxic function. Studies of brief I h exposures to a range of TBT, rotenone and oligomycin concentrations followed by 24 h, 48 h and 6 day periods in compound-free media prior to assaying for ATP levels or cytotoxic function showed that each of the compounds caused persistent decreases in ATP levels and lytic function of NK cells. Exposures to 0.05-5 mu m rotenone or oligomycin for 1 h reduced ATP levels by 20-25% but did not have any measurable effect on the ability of NK cells to lyse tumor cells. ATP levels were also decreased by about 20-25% after 24 h or 48 h exposures to rotenone or oligomycin (0.5 mu m), and the lytic function was decreased by about 50%. The results suggest that TBT-induced decreases in ATP levels were not responsible for the loss of cytotoxic function seen at I h and 24 h. However, TBT-induced decreases of NK-ATP levels may be at least in part responsible for losses of NK-cytotoxic function seen after 48 h and 6 day exposures. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Intensive use of pesticides, particularly dithiocarbamates, in agriculture often leads to contamination of freshwater ecosystems. To our knowledge, the mechanisms of toxicity to fish by the carbamate fungicide Tattoo that contains mancozeb [ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate)] have not been studied. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of Tattoo on goldfish gills and blood, tissues that would have close early contact with the pollutant. Exposure of goldfish Carassius auratus to 3,5 or 10 mg L-1 of Tattoo for 96 h resulted in moderate lymphopenia (by 8 percent) with a concomitant increase in both stab (by 66-88 percent) and segmented (by 166 percent) neutrophils. An increase in the content of protein carbonyl groups in blood (by 137-184 percent) together with decreased levels of protein thiols (by 23 percent) and an enhancement of lipid peroxide concentrations (by 29 percent) in gills after exposure to 10 mg L-1 of Tattoo demonstrated the induction of mild oxidative stress in response to Tattoo exposure. At the same time, the activities of selected antioxidant enzymes were enhanced in gills: superoxide dismutase by 18-25 percent and catalase by 27 percent. A 34 percent increment in low molecular mass thiol concentrations (mainly represented by glutathione) also occurred in gills and could be related to increased activity (by 13-30 percent) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The results indicate that Tattoo exposure perturbs free radical processes, i.e. induces mild oxidative stress and enhances the activity of certain antioxidant and associated enzymes in goldfish gills. It is clear that goldfish respond to the presence of waterborne pesticide by adjusting antioxidant defenses through upregulation of activities of antioxidant and associated enzymes.

AB  - Risk assessment of toxic substances under ecologically-relevant scenarios which include the presence of natural stressors is essential to understand their indirect toxic effects and to improve prediction of the impacts of contamination on community structure and ecosystem function.
   Here, we study the effects of the pesticide imidacloprid on the responses of Daphnia magna to a combination of predator-release kairomones from trout and alarm cues from conspecifics, simulating different levels of perceived predation risk. The joint effects of simultaneous exposure to both types of stressors were assessed both by traditional analysis of variance and by employing conceptual models for the evaluation of contaminant mixture exposures. Results demonstrated that pesticide exposure can significantly increase the costs of inducible antipredator defences and impair life-history responses of daphnids to fish predation pressure. Since trait-mediated effects are well-known to play a key role in population dynamics, the combined direct and indirect effects of sub-lethal concentrations of pesticides could induce maladaptive responses in zooplankton populations in the field, reducing their longterm viability.

AB  - Environmental pollutants, found in aquatic ecosystems, have been shown to have an effect on olfactory-mediated behaviors including feeding, mate attraction, and other important social behaviors. Crayfish are polytrophic, meaning that they feed on and become prey for all levels of the aquatic food web as well as are also important for the transfer of energy between benthic and terrestrial food webs. Because crayfish are a keystone species, it is important to investigate any factors that may affect their population size. Crayfish are active at night and rely heavily on their sensory appendages (e.g., antennulues, maxillipeds, and pereopods) to localize food sources. In this experiment, we investigated the effects of atrazine (ATR) exposure on the chemosensory responses of male and female crayfish to food odors. We exposed crayfish to environmentally relevant, sublethal levels of ATR [80 ppb (A mu g/L)] for 72 h and then examined the behavioral responses of both ATR-treated and control crayfish to food odor delivered from one end of a test arena. We used Noldus Ethovision XT software to measure odor localization and locomotory behaviors of crayfish in response to food (fish) odor. We found that control crayfish spent more time in the proximal region of the test arena and at the odor source compared with ATR-treated crayfish. Furthermore, there were no differences in the time spent moving and not moving, total distance travelled in the tank, and walking speed (cm/s) when control and ATR-treated crayfish were compared. Overall, this indicates that acute ATR exposure alters chemosensory abilities of crayfish, whereas overall motor function remains unchanged.

AB  - Cryptobenthic fish communities are a rarely studied and ill-defined component of the marine benthos. Quantitative sampling of seventy-six 1 x 1 m plots at Cape ilo, Northern Adriatic Sea, yielded 522 cryptobenthic and 67 epibenthic individuals of 27 species. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identified variation of 3 out of 17 habitat variables (depth, presence of bedrock, and presence of short thallus algae on boulders) as significantly and strongly correlated with species occurrence. Interpretation of CCA triplots allowed the description of niches of the 13 most abundant species, as well as the tentative identification of three major habitat types structuring the cryptobenthic fish community (inclined bedrock, infralittoral algae, and the deeper infralittoral mixed bottom). The study highlights the largely unstudied ecological relevance of the cryptobenthic fish community as revealed by an unexpected high diversity and the numerical dominance of some species which previously were considered rare. An improved definition of cryptobenthic fishes is provided.

AB  - Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) is responsible for disease outbreaks in marine aquaculture worldwide. Solea senegalensis, a valuable fish species for aquaculture in the south of Europe, is frequently affected by this pathogen. It is well established that bacteria respond to environmental signals and, in the case of pathogens, this ability may determine the outcome of their interaction with the host. Determination of gene expression under in vivo conditions constitutes a valuable tool in the assessment of microbial pathogenesis. Considering that different hosts may represent different environments for the pathogen, expression of Phdp virulence and in vivo induced antigen (IVIAT) genes during S. senegalensis infection has been determined in the present work. Increased transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in iron acquisition (Irp1, Irp2, HutB and HutD), oxidative stress defence (AhpC and Sod), adhesion (PDP_0080), toxins (AIP56) and metabolism (Impdh, Shmt and AlaRS) were detected in Phdp infecting S. senegalensis head kidney or liver. The highest increases corresponded to genes involved in survival under iron limiting conditions and oxidative stress, indicating their essential role during infection of sole. Results obtained give insight into Phdp virulence strategies and contribute to the identification of promising targets for the control of photobacteriosis.

The N-protecting group could be a sulfonyl, carbamate, or carbonyl functionality and (cyclooctadiene)rhodium chloride dimer/1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene {[Rh(COD)Cl](2)/dppf} as well as tris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium chloride [Rh(PPh3)(3)Cl] proved to be active catalysts. In addition, these functionalized gem-enynes subsequently undergo selective gold(III)-catalyzed intramolecular hydroamination to give trisubstituted pyrroles under mild conditions.

AB  - Pesticides such as malathion, commonly used in agriculture and households, are toxic substances that lead to reactive oxygen species generation, which harms organisms. Ecotoxicological consequences of malathion, particularly its effects on antioxidants in fish, are not well understood. Thus, we investigated the effects of malathion (0.05 mg/L) on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant systems in Carassius auratus gibelio kidney, intestine, and gills following exposure times of 1, 2, 3, and 6 days. The lipid peroxidation and antioxidative defense mechanisms display different responses in investigated tissues. The lipid peroxidation was increased in all investigated tissues, especially after 1 day of malathion administration. Changes in reduced glutathione levels have been registered, mainly after 6 days of pesticide exposure. The modulation in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, catalase, gluthatione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione-S-transferase was time and tissue specific. The investigated parameters can be used as biomarkers of fish exposure to malathion. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 24: 523-530, 2009.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dimethoate, atrazine and carbendazim on the antioxidant defences and neuronal function of the soil organism Enchytraeus albidus. Effects were studied at concentrations known to affect their reproduction (EC20, EC50 and EC90) and along time (2, 4, 8, 14 and 21 days). In general, responses were more pronounced at periods of exposure longer than 8 days and at the highest concentrations. Multivariate statistics (RDA-PRC) clearly displayed that exposure duration had an effect itself, biomarkers' responses showed interaction for all pesticides and catalase scored consistently high, indicating its relevancy in the group of measured markers. Univariate analysis indicated oxidative stress for all pesticides and atrazine induced oxidative damage in lipids. Atrazine seems to be effectively metabolized by GST of the biotransformation system, as its activity significantly increased after exposure to this pesticide. Dimethoate caused ChE inhibition, indicating an impairment of the neuronal function. Carbendazim impaired the antioxidant system, but no oxidative damage was observed, along with any effects on the ChE activity. The integrated biomarker response analysis was performed but we suggest modifications due to limiting artefacts.

AB  - Invasive plants are one of the most serious threats to native species assemblages and have been responsible for the degradation of natural habitats worldwide. As a result, removal of invasive species and reestablishment of natural vegetation have been attempted in order to restore biodiversity and ecosystem function. This study examined how native arthropod assemblages, an abundant and functionally important group of organisms in many ecosystems, are affected by the incursion of the invasive wetland plant Phragmites australis and if the restoration of the native vegetation in brackish Spartina alterniflora marshes results in the reestablishment of the arthropod community. The invasion of Phragmites into a coastal Spartina marsh in southern New Jersey seriously altered arthropod assemblages and trophic structure by changing the abundance of trophic groups (detritivores, herbivores, carnivores) and their taxonomic composition. Herbivore assemblages shifted from the dominance of external free-living specialists (e.g., planthoppers) in Spartina to concealed feeders in Phragmites (stem-feeding cecidomyiids). Moreover, free-living arthropods in Phragmites became dominated by detritivores such as Collembola and chironomids. The dominant marsh spiders, web-building linyphiids, were significantly reduced in Phragmites habitats, likely caused by differences in the physical environment of the invaded habitats (e.g., lower stem densities). Thus, trophic structure of arthropod assemblages in Phragmites, as seen in the large shifts in feeding guilds, was significantly different from that in Spartina. Removal of Phragmites with the herbicide glyphosate resulted in the rapid return of Spartina (<= 5 yrs). Moreover, return of the dominant vegetation was accompanied by the recovery of most original habitat characteristics (e.g., live and dead plant biomass, water flow rate). The arthropod assemblage associated with Spartina also quickly returned to its preinvasion state and was not distinguishable from that in uninvaded Spartina reference sites. This study provides evidence that the reestablishment of native vegetation in areas previously altered by an invasive plant can result in the rapid recovery of the native arthropod assemblage associated with the restored habitat.

AB  - Pollution is one of the most relevant issues for the conservation of freshwater environments. Fishes are the main group of organisms studied in aquatic toxicology, and their behaviours, including feeding, courtship, parental care, and territoriality, are essential to their health. Cichlids are one of the most abundant fish families and are both economically and ecologically relevant. In this review, we found that metals, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and endocrine disruptor chemicals are the main groups of pollutants that have been studied in the context of cichlid behaviour. African tilapias are the most evaluated cichlids on this topic, and Nile tilapia was the most frequently studied species. Exposure to these pollutants has been shown to affect cichlid fish behaviours in aspects including erratic swimming, activity versus inactivity, preference for the bottom and/or the surface of the tank, aggressiveness, feeding, predation, and reproduction. Oxidative stress, failures in neurotransmission, energetic imbalances, and histopathological damage are among the most common mechanisms underlying the behavioural changes. It is necessary to establish a set of integrative criteria for evaluating the ecotoxicological behaviour of cichlid fish, given the current lack of standardised methods. It is also important to consider more pollutants-both individually and in combination-such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluoroalkyl substances, and microplastics, due the increasing relevance of these pollutants of emerging concern. In line with this, cichlid fish species with reduced native distributions are suitable study species to provide information for the conservation of freshwater environments.

AB  - Microglial activation-induced neuroinflammation contributes to onset and progression of sporadic and heredi-tary Parkinson's disease (PD). Activated microglia secrete pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, which subsequently promote neurodegeneration. Formyl peptide receptor-1 (FPR1) of CNS microglia functions as pattern recognition receptor and is activated by N-formylated peptides, leading to microglial activation, in-duction of inflammatory responses and resulting neurotoxicity. In this study, it was hypothesized that FPR1 activation of microglia causes loss of dopaminergic neurons by activating inflammasome and upregulating IL-10, IL-6 or TNF-alpha and that FPR1 antagonist HCH6-1 exerts neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons. FPR1 agonist fMLF induced activation of microglia cells by causing activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and upregu-lation and secretion of IL-10, IL-6 or TNF-alpha. Conditioned medium (CM) of fMLF-treated microglia cells, which contains neurotoxic IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, caused apoptotic death of differentiated SH-SY5Y dopaminergic neurons by inducing mitochondrial oxidative stress and activating pro-apoptotic signaling. FPR1 antagonist HCH6-1 prevented fMLF-induced activation of inflammasome and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglia cells. HCH6-1 co-treatment reversed CM of fMLF-treated microglia-induced apoptotic death of dopa-minergic neurons. FPR1 antagonist HCH6-1 inhibited rotenone-induced upregulation of microglial marker Iba-1 protein level, cell death of dopaminergic neurons and motor impairment in zebrafish. HCH6-1 ameliorated rotenone-induced microglial activation, upregulation of FPR1 mRNA, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, cell death of SN dopaminergic neurons and PD motor deficit in mice. Our results suggest that FPR1 antagonist HCH6-1 possesses anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting micro-glial activation and upregulation of inflammasome activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

AB  - A sample of infants was examined at conceptual age 67 weeks (6-month testing, N=230) and again at conceptual age 92 weeks (12-month testing, N=216) using the Fagan Test of infant Intelligence (FTII). Analysis of the results revealed a dose-dependent relationship between total umbilical cord-blood PCB levels and poorer FTII performance at both ages. A similar relationship was observed using a subset of the persistent and heavily chlorinated PCB congeners associated with Lake Ontario fish consumption (septa-, octa-, and nonachlorinated biphenyls) in children tested at 12-months but not at 6-months. These data replicate previous research (Jacobson et al., 1985) which demonstrated a dose-dependent relationship between prenatal PCB exposure and FTII performance in infants of Lake Michigan fisheaters. Analyses of FTII scores with cord-blood DDE and maternal hair methylmercury (MeHg) revealed no significant associations between FTII performance and either of these toxicants. The latter results replicate tt;lose of Myers et al., (1995) who found no effect of MeHg on FTII performance in Seychellois infants. (C) 2000 Inter Press, Inc.

AB  - Stress is one of the main problems of farmed fish, where it has been seen to result in a variety of disorders and negative effects. It is considered very important to minimize such effects and one option is the use of dietary additives. In the present experiment, meagre (Argyrosomus regius) specimens were fed three different diets: a control diet consisting of a commercial feed, a tryptophan-supplemented diet and an aspartate-supplemented diet. For each diet, fish were divided into three subgroups: non-stressed (resting), exposed to crowding or air-exposed. Just before the stress, and one and six hours post-stress, serum samples were taken to study several immune parameters (protease, antiprotease, peroxidase and lysozyme) and the bactericidal activity against three fish-pathogenic bacteria (Vibrio angillarum, V. harveyi and Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida). The results demonstrated that feeding the animals with the supplemented diets modulates the seric immune parameters, particularly when animals were stressed by air exposure.

AB  - Dinotefuran is a chiral insecticide widely used to control Nilaparvata lugens in agriculture. However, little is known about the toxic effects of dinotefuran enantiomers on aquatic organisms. In this study, zebrafish were exposed to 1.00 and 10.00 mg/L dinotefuran enantiomers for 96 h, after which multivariate pattern recognition, metabolite identification, and pathway analysis were performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were then conducted to reveal the metabolic perturbations caused by dinotefuran enantiomers. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed the perturbation of five main pathways, including phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis; phenylalanine metabolism; retinol metabolism; arginine and proline metabolism; and glycerophospholipid metabolism. These disturbed metabolic pathways were strongly correlated with energy, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Pathway analysis also indicated that the metabolic pathway changes induced by the same level of R and S-dinotefuran were enantioselective. Our research may provide better insight into the risk of chiral dinotefuran in aquatic organisms in the environment.

AB  - Emerging evidences having suggested that particular lncRNAs have a potential effect on PD progression through provoking damage and inflammatory responses of microglia/dopaminergic cells. In addition, paraquat can be accumulated in human body through various approaches and have an increased risk for Parkinson's disease. However, the specific role and mechanism of lncRNA related to neurotoxic in the progression of PD is unclear. In our study, a mouse PD model was established induced by the intraperitoneal injection of paraquat (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) every three days (10 times). We determined differential expression of lncRNA AK039862 and its potential targeted genes Pafah1b1/Foxa1 in PD mouse model, then we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to visualize the cellular distribution of AK039862. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and overexpression plasmids were designed for knockdown or overexpression of AK039862. To simulate the coexisting dopaminergic cells and microglia cells in vitro, we applied several non-contact co-culture models, including conditioned medium and Transwell co-culture systems. Cytotoxicity of PQ was evaluated using bv2 cells with the concentrations: 30, 60 mu M, and mn9d cells with the concentrations: 50, 100 mu M. As a result, we depicted multiple interesting individual and interactive features of inflammatory lncRNA AK039862 involved in PQ-induced cellular functional effects. First, we detected that AK039862 contributed to the neuronal injury process in PQ-treated mice and co-localization of AK039862 with dopaminergic cells in vivo. And interestingly, we demonstrated that PQ significantly inhibited microglia and dopaminergic cells proliferation and microglia migration in vitro. Further research indicated that the PQ-induced low expression of AK039862 rescued microglia proliferation and migration inhibition via the AK039862/Pafah1b1/Foxa1 pathway. Meanwhile, AK039862 also participated in the interaction between microglia and dopaminergic cells with PQ treatment in non-contact co-culture models. In summary, we found that PQ inhibited the proliferation and migration of microglial cells, and elucidated AK039862 played a key role in PQ-induced neuroinflammatory damage through Pafahlbl/Foxal. Finally, inflammatory AK039862 is involved in the complex communication between microglia and dopaminergic cells in the environment of PQ damage.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were analyzed in: sediment; coral (Porites evermanni); fish (Stegastes fasciolatus, Neoniphon sammara, Acanthurus triostegus and Mulloidichthys vanicolensis); crab (Grapsus tenuicrustatus); lobster (Panulirus marginatus); and eel (Conger cinereus, Gymnothorax flavimarginatus, G. undulatus and G. meleagris) samples collected from Tern Island and the corresponding reference samples from Disappearing Island. The two islands are part of French Frigate Shoals, a national wildlife refuge in the North Pacific Ocean. The dominant congeners 118, 138 and 153 represent 22-25, 32-34, 12-39, 37-46 and 30-55% of the sum of PCBs in the coral, sediment, fish, crab and eel, respectively. In general, high trophic species such as eels were found to highly bioaccumulate PCBs. The total average PCB concentrations were as high as 96 and 29 mu g/g dry wt, in eels and damselfish, respectively, from Tern Island. The localized behavior and high bioaccumulation potential for PCBs suggest that damselfish are an excellent species for monitoring PCBs in small areas in the ocean. The high average concentrations of the sum of PCBs in different food chain levels suggest that pollution source(s) are around Tern Island and possibly around Disappearing Island. Aroclor 1254 and its analogs are suspected sources responsible for PCBs in the samples. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 2007, samples of treated effluent were collected at point of discharge to the environment from 39 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located across Victoria, Australia grouped by treatment type. Sample genotoxicity was assessed with a high-throughput luminescent umu test method using Salmonella typhimurium TL210 strain, with and without addition of a commercially available metabolic activation system. Samples were also screened using a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric mass-structure database recognition method. A genotoxic response was observed in half of the samples tested without metabolic activation system (<LOR -0.19 mu g/L 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide equivalents). On addition of metabolic activation system, 75% of samples elicited a genotoxic response, the majority of responses were stronger than without metabolic activation (<LOR -2.97 mu g/L benzo[a] pyrene equivalents). The type of WWTP had no effect on genotoxicity. A large number of chemicals were identified in the effluents, although none could be unambiguously tied to the genotoxicity observed. Chemicals observed in one or more effluents included food additives (e. g. dibenzylether), various alkyl phenols, tyre leachates (e. g. 2(3H)-benzothiazolone), antioxidants, flame retardants (e. g. tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate), insect repellents (e. g. diethyltoluamide), stimulants (e. g. caffeine) and anticonvulsants (e. g. carbamazepine). Of the 451 pesticides screened, carbamate insecticides (e. g. bendiocarb, propoxur), plant growth regulators (e. g. propham) and herbicides (e. g. atrazine, metolachlor, simazine) were amongst the compounds observed.

AB  - Analysis of fish behaviour is an effective way to indirectly identify the presence of environmental pollutants that negatively affect fish life, its production and quality. Monitoring individual and collective behaviours produces large amounts of non-linear data that require tailor-suited computational methods to interpret and manage the information. Fractal dimension (FD) and entropy are two groups of such non-linear analysing methods that serve as indicators of the complexity (FD) and predictability (entropy) of the behaviours. Since behavioural complexity and predictability may be modulated by contaminants, the changes in its FD and entropy values have a clear potential to be embedded in a biological early warning system (BEWS), which may be particularly useful in Precision Fish Farming settings and to monitor wild populations. This work presents a review of the effects of a wide range of environmental contaminants, including toxic compounds, cleaning and disinfecting agents, stimulant (caffeine), anaesthetics and antibiotics, heavy metals (lead, cupper, and mercury), selenium, pesticides and persistent environmental pollutants, on the FD and entropy values of collective and individual behavioural responses of different fish species. All the revised studies demonstrate the usefulness of both FD and entropy to indicate the presence of pollutants and underline the need to consider early changes in the trend of the evolution of their values prior to them becoming significantly different from the control values, i.e., while it is still possible to identify the contaminant and preserve the health and integrity of the fish.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of heparin eye drops in the treatment of paraquat-induced ocular surface injury.
   Design and methods: In this retrospective study, we included 25 patients (31 eyes) with paraquat-induced ocular surface injury, who attended the Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University between October 2008 and October 2013. The patients were split into two groups according to whether or not received heparin eye drops. The clinical data were compared between the two groups, i.e. clinical histories, results of examinations, treatments and outcomes.
   Results: Eleven patients (group A, 15 eyes) received prompt irrigation with 0.9% saline every two hours, 0.1% pranoprofen eye drops four times a day, 20% autologous serum every two hours, recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor eye-gel two times a day, oral vitamin C 2.0 g and prednisone 30mg daily. Fourteen patients (group B, 16 eyes) received additional treatment with heparin eye drops. Ten eyes in group A and seven eyes in group B developed a pseudomembrane on the ocular surface at significantly different rate (mean +/- SD) of 1.20 +/- 1.01 and 0.43 +/- 0.51, respectively (t = 2.66, p = 0.01). Seven eyes among 10 had a pseudomembrane reoccurred in group A while none had a pseudomembrane reoccurred in group B (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.01). No significant differences were seen in the duration of epithelial recovery between the two groups: 15.13 +/- 5.13 days in group A and 16.81 +/- 5.56 days in group B (t = 0.87, p = 0.39). After the treatment, mild corneal opacity and pannus were observed in five patients of group A and four patients of group B, without any significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.70).
   Conclusions: The paraquat-induced ocular surface injury observed in this case series was characterized by the formation of conjunctival pseudomembrane with good prognosis and mild complications. Heparin eye drops reduce the occurrence, especially the reoccurrence of pseudomembrane. Further studies are warranted.

AB  - The present study assessed the impact of Panax ginseng essential oil (GEO) supplementation on physiological parameters related to productive performance and health status in Nile tilapia reared under standard conditions and exposed to a sub-lethal atrazine (ATZ) concentration. Fish were allocated into 6 groups: the control group was reared in clean water and fed with a commercial basal diet (CNT), two groups were fed with the basal diet supplemented with two different levels of GEO (GEO1 and GEO2, respectively), one group was intoxicated with 1/5 of ATZ 96-h lethal concentration 50 (1.39 mg/L) (ATZ group), and the remaining two groups were fed with the GEO-supplemented diets and concurrently exposed to 1.39 mg ATZ/L (GEO1+ATZ and GEO2+ATZ, respectively). The experiment lasted for 60 days. GEO supplementation exerted a significantly positive influence on fish growth, feed utilization, and hepatic antioxidant defense systems at both levels of supplementation. ATZ exposure significantly reduced fish survival rates and impaired fish growth and feed utilization, with the lowest final weights, weight gain, total feed intake, and the highest feed conversion ratio being recorded in the ATZ-intoxicated group. ATZ exposure caused significant changes in intestinal digestive enzyme activity (decreased lipase activity), hematological indices (decreased hemoglobin, packed cell volume, erythrocytes, and leukocytes), blood biochemical variables (decreased total proteins, albumin, globulins, and immunoglobulin M; increased total cholesterol, triglycerides, and cortisol), and hepatic oxidative/antioxidant indices (decreased glutathione level, superoxide dismutase and catalase enzyme activity and mRNA expression levels, and increased malondialdehyde content). Moreover, in the hepatic tissue of ATZ-intoxicated Nile tilapia, histopathological alterations and upregulated mRNA expression levels of stress- and apoptosis-related genes (Hsp70, caspase 3, and p53) were observed. GEO supplementation in ATZ-treated groups significantly attenuated the aforementioned negative effects, though some parameters did not reach the CNT values. These findings provide further and partly new evidence that sub-lethal ATZ toxicity induces reduced survivability, growth retardation, impaired digestive function, anemia, immunosuppression, hepatic oxidative stress damage, and overall increased stress level in Nile tilapia, and suggest that GEO supplementation may be useful for mitigating this toxicity and provide more general support to the productive performance and health status of this fish species.

AB  - Eprinomectin (EPM), a member of avermectin family, is a semi-synthetic antibiotic. It has been known that avermectin family enters the aquatic environments and adversely affects the aquatic organisms. Effects of EPM is fully unknown in aquatic organisms especially fish, thus the aim of the present study was to investigate transcriptional changes (sod, cat, gpx) and activities of some antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)) and transcriptional changes of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and cytochromes P4501A (CYP1A) in liver tissues of rainbow trout exposed to sublethal EPM concentration (0.001 mu g/L, 0.002 mu g/L, 0.01 mu gL, 0.05 mu g/L) for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h.
   The decrease in antioxidant enzyme (SOD, CAT and GPx) activity, transcriptional changes (sod, cat, gpx, HSP70 and CYP1A genes) and increase in MDA level and activity of 8-OHdG in a dose-time-dependent manner in the liver of rainbow trout were observed. The down-regulated of antioxidant (sod, cat and gpx), HSP70 and CYP1A obviously, the severity of which increased with the concentration of EPM and exposure time. The results imply that EPM could induce oxidative damage to the liver tissue of rainbow trout. The information presented in this study is helpful to understand the mechanism of veterinary pharmaceuticals-induced oxidative stress in fishes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Female juveniles of the Neotropical fish Astyanax altiparanae were exposed for 96 h to four treatments containing the active ingredient from Imidacloprid (R) commercial formulation (IMI 1, IMI 2, IMI 3, and IMI 4) and to a control treatment (only dechlorinated tap water). Glutathione content, glutathione S-transferase activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation levels, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and frequency of micronuclei and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENA) were measured in the fish. The muscle and gills were the most affected organs; their antioxidant defense was not enough to prevent oxidative damage (LPO) in the IMI 2 and IMI 4 treatment fish. IMI also inhibited AChE activity in the muscle (IMI 3 and IMI 4) and increased ENA frequency (IMI 4). IMI can affect the health of A. altiparanae in environmentally relevant concentrations, causing oxidative damage in different organs, neurotoxic effects in the muscle, and genotoxicity.

AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition protein 2 (PGRP2) is a Zn2+-dependent peptidase that plays important roles in binding to microbial components of the cell membrane, inducing phagocytosis and antimicrobial activity. Rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciams) PGRP2 (RbPGRP2) was identified in the intestine by next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. The open reading frame (ORF) the RbPGRP2 cDNA (470 amino acid residues) contains a peptidoglycan recognition protein domain (residues 300 to 446). Alignment analysis revealed that RbPGRP2 shares 37.6-53.5% overall sequence identity with the PGRP2s of other species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RbPGRP2 clustered together with PGRP2s from teleosts. In healthy rock bream, RbPGRP2 was found to be ubiquitously expressed in all of the examined tissues, especially in the liver. RbPGRP2 expression was significantly upregulated in all of the examined tissues of rock bream after infection with Edwardsiella piscicida, Streptococcus iniae and red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) compared with the control. Purified rRbPGRP2 interactions with bacteria and inhibited the growth of bacteria in the presence of Zn2+. These results indicate that RbPGRP2 plays an important role in the innate immune response against bacterial infection.

AB  - Pesticides reach aquatic ecosystems and interact with various targets in cells of fish and other living organisms. Toxicity originates during the metabolization process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) indicate toxicants interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant systems, i.e., they are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult) influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100%. Additionally, we identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of studies evaluating GSH on female fish. Future researchers may use these gaps as a guide towards enhanced experimental designs and, consequently, a better understanding of pesticide toxic effects on fish.

AB  - Fenitrothion (FN) is a widely used organophosphorous pesticide that has structural similarities with the clinical anti-androgen flutamide. The potential for FN to act as an anti-androgen (at exposures of 1, 50, and 200 mu g FN/l over a 26-day period) was assessed in male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring kidney spiggin concentration, nest-building, and courtship behavior. Spiggin is the glue protein that male sticklebacks use to build their nests and is directly controlled by androgens. FN exposure significantly reduced spiggin production as well as nest-building activity. It also adversely affected courtship-especially the 'zigzag dance' and biting behavior of the males. FN thus appears to have anti-androgenic effects on both the physiology and behavior of the male stickleback.

AB  - The Ilha River is one of the main tributaries of the Sinos River, consequently contributing to its ecological impact. The present study aimed to associate the use of different biomark-ers in vitro and in vivo to assess the water quality of three points along the Ilha River during 2019. For this purpose, water samples were collected at the source and mouth of the river, and in an intermediate section. In the laboratory, samples were used for in vitro toxicity tests with the V79 cell line, in which we evaluated the protein content and mi-tochondrial activity through the MTT assay. The results indicated a possible disruption in cellular mitochondrial activity. Acute toxicity tests were also carried out in Danio rerio and Daphnia magna , and a chronic toxicity test was performed in C. elegans. No significant dif-ferences were observed in the antioxidant defense enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx); however, the point of greatest agricultural impact inhibited the activity of muscle AChE in zebrafish. All samples delayed the development of C. elegans, characterizing toxicity. Phosphorus was above the limit established by Brazilian legislation at the three sampling points in two of the three collections, indicating the probable presence of agricultural components in the water. The results alert to the need for the association of different bioindicators and, whenever possible, the use of chronic toxicity tests for the best environmental diagnosis.(c) 2022 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Permethrin (PM) is one of the most used synthetic pyrethroid worldwide. Exposure to this compound during pregnancy and early childhood has been indicated as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders. We evaluated the long-term effects of embryonic PM exposure in different stages of zebrafish development. Briefly, embryos (3 hpf) were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of PM (25 and 50 mu g.L-1) during 24 h and then behavioral parameters were evaluated during embryonic (28 hpf), eleutheroembryonic (3 dpf), larval (7 dpf), and adult stages (90 dpf). PM exposure decreased spontaneous movement at 28 hpf and decreased thigmotaxis in eleutheroembryos. The long-term effects of PM include changes in non-motor behaviors such as fear and anxiety in larva and adults. Adults embryonically exposed to PM also showed a significant increase in aggressiveness parameters. These results demonstrated that embryonic exposure to PM induces persistent neurotoxic effects in adulthood, which can impair the cognitive and behavioral fitness of non-target species contributing to a rise in neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Enzyme biomarkers from several aquatic organisms have been used for assessing the exposure to contaminants at sublethal levels. Amongst them, the cholinesterases are commonly extracted from several organisms to evaluate/measure organophosphate and carbamate neurotoxic effects. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) is an enzyme of the group of serine esterases that acts on the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine allowing the intermittence of the nerve impulses responsible for the neuronal communication. This enzyme is the main target for the action of some pesticides and the inhibition of its activity in bivalve mollusks may be used as biomarker due to their filter-feeding habit. In this context, the present study aimed to characterize physicochemical and kinetic parameters of the AChE extracted from gills and viscera of the oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae and investigate the in vitro effect of pesticides (dichlorvos, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, methyl-parathion, temephos, carbaryl, carbofuran, aldicarb, diflubenzuron and novaluron) in search for assessing its potential as biomarker. Specific substrates and inhibitors evidenced the predominance of AChE in both tissues. The optimum pH found for gills and viscera AChE were 8.0 and 8.5, respectively. The maximum peak of activity occurred at 70 degrees C for gill AChE and 75 degrees C for viscera AChE. The enzymes of both tissues presented remarkable thermostability. The Michaelis-Menten constant for both enzymes were 1.32 +/- 0.20 mM for gills and 0.43 +/- 0.12 mM for viscera. The values for gills and viscera were 53.57 +/- 1.72 and 27.71 +/- 1.15 mU/mg, respectively. The enzymes were able to reduce the activation energy to 9.75 kcal mol(-1) (gills) and 11.87 kcal mol(-1) (viscera) obtaining rate enhancements of 3.57 x 10(5) and 1.01 x 10(4), respectively, in relation to non-catalyzed reactions. Among the pesticides under study, the carbamates carbaryl and carbofuran exerted the strongest inhibitory effects on the enzyme activity achieving important degrees of inhibition at concentrations below national and international current regulations. The first observation of the effects of benzoylurea pesticides (diflubenzuron and novaluron) on AChE from mollusks is reported here. The gills AChE of C. rhizophorae showed potential to be specific biomarker for the carbamate carbaryl while the viscera AChE showed it for carbofuran. According to their features, these enzymes may be proposed as promising tools for estuarine monitoring as well as biocomponent of biosensor devices.

AB  - This article presents a personal account of the important contribution a publication from David Noakes' lab (Pot, Noakes, Ferguson and Coker 1984, Quantitative sampling of fishes in a simple system: failure of conventional methods. Hydrobiologia 114:249-254) made to freshwater fish science in general and to the successful public defence of a doctoral thesis in particular. Pot et al. (1984) tested the accuracy of two conventional sampling approaches in their estimation of numbers of fish in a small pond (capture-mark-recapture and total sampling, following rotenone treatment). Their results demonstrated that even in a small and relatively uniform freshwater system (a pond of 0.1 ha), the so-called total sampling approach failed to provide the true number of any species of fish in the pond. The outcome of the study provided the evidence to debunk the assumption that absolute numbers of fishes can be obtained using rotenone treatment. This article therefore allowed me to defend my doctoral dissertation in the face of critical comments from a principal jury member, and firm proponent of 'absolute sampling', and it provided fish biologists with justification to focus on the development and application of sampling approaches, such as relative densities, which do not require futile attempts to obtain total fish numbers.

AB  - Liver is very sensitive to environmental contaminants such as pesticides, it being the first target of toxicity of a substance. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible effects of the insecticide imidacloprid (IMI) on the liver of Oreochromis niloticus according concentrations used for growing sugarcane. A semi-quantitative analysis of histopathological alterations of IMI on liver was performed by light microscopy and cellular labeling of heat shock proteins (HSP70) by immunohistochemistry. The most common changes in liver at all concentrations of IMI were hydropic degeneration, pyknotic nuclei, and loss of cell limits. Steatosis and increased levels of HSP70 were detected in hepatocytes with the highest concentration of IMI. In conclusion, the tested concentrations of IMI induced histopathological changes in the liver of O. niloticus and active defence mechanisms to maintain the morphophysiological integrity of the liver. This insecticide has a toxicity potential for these fish, which is a non-target organism of its action.

AB  - In this study, bioaugmentation potential of 1H-1,2,4-triazole (TZ) degrading strain namely Shinella sp. NJUST26 and tricyclazole (TC) degrading strain namely Sphingomonas sp. NJUST37 was evaluated in a bench-scale activated sludge tank. The performance of the bioreactor demonstrated the feasibility of bioaugmentation by NJUST26 and NJUST37 in terms of almost complete TC and TZ removal, significant COD and TOC removal, as well as toxicity reduction. The effect of influent pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and triazole fungicide concentration was investigated in order to reach an optimal treatment performance. The bioaugmented process after the inoculation of NJUST26 and NJUST37 could maintain stable performance in terms of TZ, TC, COD and TOC removal from the wastewater. High-throughput sequencing analysis suggested that higher diversity and significant shifts in bacterial community structure were achieved after the inoculation of NJUST26 and NJUST37. However, both NJUST26 and NJUST37 lost their dominance during long-term operation, despite of the key role of the inoculation of NJUST26 and NJUST37 in the formation of effective microbial community.

AB  - Industrial chemical solutions are widely used as a method to disinfection of aquaculture water and environments. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the toxicity effect of Betadine (10% solution of povidone-iodine) as a disinfectant solution on the survival and gill tissue of Oranda goldfish (Carassius auratus). For these purposes, 225 fingerling Oranda goldfish with an average weight 5 +/- 0.67 g were divided into 15 groups with 3 replications. Fish were exposed to series of concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220 and 240 mg/L) of Betadine for 96 h. The mortality of fish and the samples of gill were observed at 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after exposure. The results of the present study showed that the half-life of Betadine was less than 24 h and mortality were not record after 24 h. The highest mortality rate was at 240 mg/L, and LC50 24 h of Betadine was 158.800 mg/L. Histopathological results showed that lethal concentrations of Betadine lead to hyperemia, hypertrophy, hyperplasia and adhesion of secondary lamellar of the gill. Moreover, fish that were exposed to these concentrations displayed clinical signs such as anxiety, darkening of the skin. Overall results showed that Betadine have short half-life in the aquatic environment and are toxic to fish at very high concentrations, therefore it can be considered as practically non-toxic and useful for disinfection of the aquatic environment.

AB  - Spatial gradients of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides were examined in the young-of-the-year (YOY) bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) in the vicinity of a PCB Superfund Site in New Bedford Harbor, Massachusetts, and in the adjacent waters. PCB concentrations in bluefish varied between different locations, and also among fish from a given location. A generally decreasing gradient in PCB concentrations was evident as the bluefish were collected away from the Superfund Site. The average sum of PCB concentrations were highest for bluefish collected in the Upper Harbor between Inter-state-195 Bridge and Coggeshall Street Bridge (Upper Harbor), followed by bluefish in Lower Harbor from north of Popes Island Bridge (Lower Harbor), and bluefish from Outer Harbor south of Hurricane Barrier (Outer Harbor). The levels of PCBs in bluefish from Clarks Cove and PCBs in bluefish from Buzzards Bay were similar and lowest among all bluefish specimens analyzed in the present study. Pesticide concentrations were about one order of magnitude or lower than the PCB concentrations, and the gradient of pesticide concentrations generally followed the gradient of PCB concentrations. Some of the commonly detected pesticides in the order of decreasing concentrations included DDTs and metabolites, heptachlor epoxide, endosulfan sulfate, and alpha-chlordane. Distribution of PCBs and sulfate, and alpha-chlordane. Distribution of PCBs and organochlorine pesticides were examined in the tissues of YOY bluefish from Clarks Cove. PCBs and lipids in the brain samples of YOY bluefish were generally numerically greater than PCBs in the liver samples, but these differences were not statistically significant. PCBs and lipids in hypaxial muscle samples were numerically greater than PCBs in epaxial muscle samples, although these two groups of tissues were not statistically different. Despite the higher susceptibility of lighter PCB homologs to geophysical and biogeochemical weathering processes, the relative dominance of lighter homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor samples suggested ongoing or recent sources of these lighter PCBs, particularly Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016 in this area. The presence of heavier homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor bluefish samples could be attributed to Aroclor 1252 and Aroclor 1254 that were being used in relatively smaller quantities in the manufacture of electrical components in addition to Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016. The concentration of heavier PCB homologs appears to increase in YOY bluefish the further away from the PCB Superfund Site in the Acushnet Estuary the samples were collected. Principal component analyses of PCB 153 normalized concentrations of the individual PCB congeners resulted in two general groupings; a relatively tight group comprised of YOY bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor, and a rather loose and more dispersed group comprised of Buzzards Bay bluefish and the tissue samples of bluefish from Clarks Cove. Principal component analyses of major pesticides suggested close groupings of bluefish from Clarks Cove and bluefish from Buzzards Bay. Pesticides in bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor formed a loose group, with some bluefish from these locations populating close to Clarks Cove and Buzzards Bay bluefish.
   Although PCBs have been implicated in various behavioral and health effects in the experimental and field studies, the deleterious effects of chronic exposure to high concentrations of PCBs and the potential for recruitment of New Bedford Harbor YOY bluefish population to the adult stock remains obscure. Adaptive or evolutionary resistance to contaminants have been documented in resident species in some highly contaminated estuaries, however similar responses have not been investigated in the migratory species like bluefish. The results of the present study provide a reference baseline for YOY bluefish for "before-and-after" comparative studies and other toxicological studies for the New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site that is currently being remediated.

AB  - Paraquat (PQ) administration consists in a chemical model that mimics phenotypes observed in Parkinson's disease (PD), due to its ability to induce changes in dopaminergic system and oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the actions of PQ in behavioral functions of adult zebrafish and its influence on oxidative stress biomarkers in brain samples. PQ (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally with six injections for 16 days (one injection every 3 days). PQ-treated group showed a significant decrease in the time spent in the bottom section and a shorter latency to enter the top area in the novel tank test. Moreover, PQ-exposed fish showed a significant decrease in the number and duration of risk assessment episodes in the light-dark test, as well as an increase in the agonistic behavior in the mirror-induced aggression (MIA) test. PQ induced brain damage by decreasing mitochondrial viability. Concerning the antioxidant defense system, PQ increased catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, as well as the non-protein sulfhydryl content (NPSH), but did not change ROS formation and decreased lipid peroxidation. We demonstrate, for the first time, that PQ induces an increase in aggressive behavior, alters non-motor patterns associated to defensive behaviors, and changes redox parameters in zebrafish brain. Overall, our findings may serve as useful tools to investigate the interaction between behavioral and neurochemical impairments triggered by PQ administration in zebrafish.

AB  - In fishes, the impacts of environmental constraints undergone during development on the behavioural response of individuals are not well understood. Obtaining more information is important since the aquatic environment is widely exposed to pollution involving neurotoxic compounds likely to cause phenotypic changes that can affect animal fitness. We explored how early exposure to the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin (PM), a compound known for its neurotoxicity, influences the phenotypic traits in both larvae and adults of the self-fertilizing fish mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus. First, we investigated immediate effects of PM on larvae after oneweek exposure (0-7 days post-hatching): larvae exposed to high concentration (200 mu g.L-1) grew less, were less active, had negative thigmotaxis and were less likely to capture prey than control individuals and those exposed to low concentration (5 mu g.L-1). No difference was found between treatments when considering oxygen consumption rate and cortisol levels. Persistent effects of early exposure to PM on adults (147-149 days posthatching) showed that fish previously exposed to high concentration of PM overcompensated growth, leading them to finally be longer and heavier than fish from other treatments. Moreover, we evidenced that levels of cortisol interacted with early PM exposure to affect behaviours during dyadic contests. Fish were more likely to initiate fighting behaviours and were more likely to be aggressive when they have low pre-contest levels of cortisol, but these effects were less pronounced when individuals were exposed to PM. This study shows that PM can have both immediate and persistent effects on phenotypic traits in a self-fertilizing vertebrate and suggests that a pyrethroid can interact with hormones action to affect animal behaviour.

AB  - Haematophagous female blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae) are serious biting pests and obligate vectors of vertebrate pathogens, namely filarial Dirofilaria , Mansonella , Onchocerca and protozoal Leucocytozoon . Immature stages of Simuliidae inhabit lotic waterways, the sessile larvae filter-feeding and often forming a large proportion of the benthic biomass, usually aggregated in well-oxygenated sections of streams, rivers, waterfalls and spillways. Simuliid control practices depend on larvicidal chemicals, biological products (bacteria, nematodes) and environmental modification. The potential use of predators for biological control of Simuliidae has not been exploited. Predators of Simuliidae include examples of at least 12 families of Diptera and other predaceous arthropods (Crustacea and insects: Coleoptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera), invertebrates (notably Turbellaria), as well as browsing fish. Diptera impacting upon simuliid populations comprise mainly Chironomidae, Empididae and Muscidae, although several other families (Asilidae, Dolichopodidae, Phoridae, Drosophilidae, Scathophagidae) play a significant role as predators. Details of predator and prey species and life stages are presented, by zoogeographical region, including the prevalence of cannibalism among Simuliidae.

AB  - The mechanism for initiating DNA cleavage by DDE-family enzymes, including the RAG endonuclease, which initiates V(D)J recombination, is not well understood. Here we report six cryo-EM structures of zebrafish RAG in complex with one or two intact recombination signal sequences (RSSs), at up to 3.9-angstrom resolution. Unexpectedly, these structures reveal DNA melting at the heptamer of the RSSs, thus resulting in a corkscrew-like rotation of coding-flank DNA and the positioning of the scissile phosphate in the active site. Substrate binding is associated with dimer opening and a piston-like movement in RAG1, first outward to accommodate unmelted DNA and then inward to wedge melted DNA. These precleavage complexes show limited base-specific contacts of RAG at the conserved terminal CAC/GTG sequence of the heptamer, thus suggesting conservation based on a propensity to unwind. CA and TG overwhelmingly dominate terminal sequences in transposons and retrotransposons, thereby implicating a universal mechanism for DNA melting during the initiation of retroviral integration and DNA transposition.

AB  - The presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living organisms was described more than 60 years ago and virtually immediately it was suggested that ROS were involved in various pathological processes and aging. The state when ROS generation exceeds elimination leading to an increased steady-state ROS level has been called "oxidative stress." Although ROS association with many pathological states in animals is well established, the question of ROS responsibility for the development of these states is still open. Fish represent the largest group of vertebrates and they inhabit a broad range of ecosystems where they are subjected to many different aquatic contaminants. In many cases, the deleterious effects of contaminants have been connected to induction of oxidative stress. Therefore, deciphering of molecular mechanisms leading to such contaminant effects and organisms' response may let prevent or minimize deleterious impacts of oxidative stress. This review describes general aspects of ROS homeostasis, in particular highlighting its basic aspects, modification of cellular constituents, operation of defense systems and ROS-based signaling with an emphasis on fish systems. A brief introduction to oxidative stress theory is accompanied by the description of a recently developed classification system for oxidative stress based on its intensity and time course. Specific information on contaminant-induced oxidative stress in fish is covered in sections devoted to such pollutants as metal ions (particularly iron, copper, chromium, mercury, arsenic, nickel, etc.), pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides) and oil with accompanying pollutants. In the last section, certain problems and perspectives in studies of oxidative stress in fish are described.

AB  - Smaug is a conserved translational regulator that binds numerous mRNAs, including nuclear transcripts that encode mitochondrial enzymes. Smaug orthologs form cytosolic membrane-less organelles (MLOs) in several organisms and cell types. We have performed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays that revealed that SDHB and UQCRC1 mRNAs associate with Smaug1 bodies in U2OS cells. Loss of function of Smaug1 and Smaug2 (also known as SAMD4A and SAMD4B, respectively) affected both mitochondrial respiration and morphology of the mitochondrial network. Phenotype rescue by Smaug1 transfection depends on the presence of its RNA-binding domain. Moreover, we identified specific Smaug1 domains involved in MLO formation, and found that impaired Smaug1 MLO condensation correlates with mitochondrial defects. Mitochondrial complex I inhibition upon exposure to rotenone, but not strong mitochondrial uncoupling upon exposure to CCCP, rapidly induced the dissolution of Smaug1 MLOs. Metformin and rapamycin elicited similar effects, which were blocked by pharmacological inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Finally, we found that Smaug1 MLO dissolution weakens the interaction with target mRNAs, thus enabling their release. We propose that mitochondrial respiration and the AMPK-mTOR balance controls the condensation and dissolution of Smaug1 MLOs, thus regulating nuclear mRNAs that encode key mitochondrial proteins.

AB  - Squalamine is a novel aminosterol recently isolated from the dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias. This water-soluble steroid exhibits potent antibacterial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. In addition, squalamine is fungicidal and induces osmotic lysis of protozoa. We report here the structural determination of squalamine, 3beta-N-1-[N(3-[4-aminobutyl])-1,3 diaminopropane]-7alpha,24zeta-dihydroxy-5alpha-cholestane 24-sulfate, which was deduced from the analysis of fast atom bombardment spectra and a series of two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Squalamine is a cationic steroid characterized by a condensation of an anionic bile salt intermediate with the polyamine, spermidine. This molecule is a potential host-defense agent in the shark, and provides insight into a new class of vertebrate antimicrobial molecules.

AB  - One of the commonest pesticides used in agriculture is the fungicide carbendazim, which can cause deleterious effects on the physiology and behaviour of acutely and chronically exposed animals. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of carbendazim on fish behaviour and our main objective was to evaluate behavioural changes on adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to this fungicide. We studied 177 fishes, divided into control groups (not exposed) and treatment groups, exposed to a concentration of 120 mu g/L for 7, 14, 21 and 28. Behavioural data were collected using the scan sampling, with instantaneous recording every 30 s. We evaluated and compared fish behaviours and aquarium occupancy between treatments and controls using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. The results indicate that carbendazim initially elicited slow swimming and later fast swimming, decreased aggressiveness, and caused behavioural changes indicative of distress, like abnormal swimming and the gulping of air in water surface. In the wild, this behavioural change can result in an increased predation risk and consequent decrease or extinction of populations, revealing important ecological issues for animal communities living in polluted water bodies.

AB  - A sensitive screen-printed amperometric multielectrode biosensor for the rapid discrimination of the insecticides paraoxon and carbofuran in mixtures was developed. It was based on the principle of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition and chemometric data analysis using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Four types of native or recombinant AChEs (electric eel, bovine erythrocytes, rat brain, Drosophila melanogaster) were immobilised by screen printing on four-electrode thickfilm sensors in sets containing each AChE. The multisensors were used for quantitative inhibition analysis of binary reagent mixtures combining the AChE-multisensor with feed-forward ANNs. The sensors registered a detection range for both analytes of 0.2-26 mu g/l with an overall assay time of less than 60 min. The individual inhibition pattern of each AChE-analyte combination enabled the discrimination of both analytes by the use of neural network data processing. Thus, paraoxon and carbofuran in mixtures displaying a concentration range of 0-20 mu g/l for each analyte could be analysed with prediction errors of 0.9 mu g/l for paraoxon and 1.4 mu g/l for carbofuran.

AB  - Chemical pollutants enter aquatic systems through numerous pathways (e.g., surface runoff and ground water contamination), thus associating these contaminant sources with varying hydrodynamic environments. The hydrodynamic environment shapes the temporal and spatial distribution of chemical contaminants through turbulent mixing. The differential dispersal of contaminants is not commonly addressed in ecotoxicological studies and may have varying implications for organism health. The purpose of this study is to understand how differing routes of exposure to atrazine alter social behaviors and physiological responses of aquatic organisms. This study used agonistic encounters in crayfish Orconectes virilis as a behavioral assay to investigate impact of sublethal concentrations of atrazine (0, 40, 80, and 160 A mu g/L) delivered by methods mimicking ground water and surface runoff influx into flow-through exposure arenas for a total of 23 h. Each experimental animal participated in a dyadic fight trial with an unexposed opponent. Fight duration and intensity were analyzed. Experimental crayfish hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle tissue samples were analyzed for cytochrome P450 and acetylcholinesterase levels to discern mechanism of detoxification and mode of action of atrazine. Atrazine delivered via runoff decreased crayfish overall fight intensity and contrastingly ground water delivery increased overall fight intensity. The behavioral differences were mirrored by increases in cytochrome P450 activity, whereas no differences were found in acetylcholinesterase activity. This study demonstrates that method of delivery into fluvial systems has differential effects on both behavior and physiology of organisms and emphasizes the need for the consideration of delivery pathway in ecotoxicological studies and water-impairment standards.

AB  - Considering the antioxidant properties of sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) and the involvement of oxidative stress events in paraquat-induced neurotoxicity, this study investigated the protective effect of dietary Na2SeO3 on biochemical and behavioral parameters of zebrafish exposed to paraquat (PQ). Fish were pretreated with a Na2SeO3 diet for 21 days and then PQ (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally with six injections for 16 days. In the novel tank test, the Na2SeO3 diet prevented the locomotor impairments, as well as the increase in the time spent in the top area of the tank, and the exacerbation of freezing episodes. In the preference for conspecifics and in the mirror-induced aggression (MIA) tasks, Na2SeO3 prevented the increase in the latency to enter the area closer to conspecifics and the agonistic behavior of PQ-treated animals, respectively. Na2SeO3 prevented the increase of carbonylated protein (CP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels, as well as the decrease in non-protein thiols (NPSH) levels. Regarding the antioxidant enzymatic defenses, Na2SeO3 prevented the increase in catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities caused by PQ. Altogether, dietary Na2SeO3 improves behavioral and biochemical function impaired by PQ treatment in zebrafish, by modulating not only redox parameters, but also anxiety- and aggressive-like phenotypes in zebrafish.

AB  - A comparative enantioselective analysis using immobilized amylose tris-(3-chlorophenylcarbamate) as chiral stationary phase in conventional high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with Chiralpak ID (4.6mm IDx250mm, 5 mu m silica gel) and micro-HPLC with Chiralpak ID-3 (0.30mm IDx150mm, 3 mu m silica gel) was conducted. Pharmaceutical racemates of 12 pharmacological classes, namely, - and -blockers, anti-inflammatory drugs, antifungal drugs, dopamine antagonists, norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors, catecholamines, sedative hypnotics, diuretics, antihistaminics, anticancer drugs, and antiarrhythmic drugs were screened under normal phase conditions. The effect of an organic modifier on the analyte retentions and enantiomer recognition was investigated. Baseline separation was achieved for 1-acenaphthenol, carprofen, celiprolol, cizolirtine carbinol, miconazole, tebuconazole, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid, 1-indanol, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)ethanol, 1-phenyl-2-propanol, flavanone, 6-hydroxyflavanone, 4-bromogluthethimide, and pentobarbital on the 4.6mm ID packed with a 5 mu m silica column using conventional HPLC. Nonetheless, baseline separation was achieved for aminoglutethimide, naftopidil, and thalidomide on the 0.3mm ID packed with a 3 mu m silica capillary column. Chirality 26:677-682, 2014.

AB  - Bacterial modulation of phagocyte cell death is an emerging theme in pathogenesis. Here we describe the systemic destruction of macrophages and neutrophils by the Gram-negative Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida (Phdp) in fish pasteurellosis, a deadly systemic infection. Following experimental inoculation, Phdp spreads by bacteraemia and colonizes the organs, producing a septicaemic infection, and secretes the apoptogenic exotoxin AIP56 which is systemically disseminated. In experimental and natural pasteurellosis, destruction of macrophages and neutrophils by secondary necrosis following caspase-3-associated apoptosis was seen predominantly in the spleen, head kidney and gut lamina propria. Identical phagocyte destruction occurred after injection of rAIP56, but not of heat-inactivated rAIP56, or AIP56-negative Phdp strains, indicating that AIP56 is responsible for phagocyte destruction occurring in pasteurellosis. Active caspase-3 and active neutrophil elastase are present in the blood in advanced infection, indicating that phagocyte lysis by secondary necrosis is accompanied by release of tissue-damaging molecules. The AIP56-induced lysis of phagocytes represents a very efficient, self-amplifying etiopathogenic mechanism, because it results in two effects that operate in concert against the host, namely, evasion of the pathogen from a crucial defence mechanism through the destruction of both professional phagocytes, and release of tissue-damaging molecules. The induction by a bacterial exotoxin of in vivo systemic lysis of both professional phagocytes by secondary necrosis, now described for the first time, may represent an overlooked etiopathogenic mechanism operating in other infections of vertebrates.

AB  - H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabonomic method was used to characterize the profile of low-molecular-weight endogenous metabolites in mouse (Mus musculus) serum following exposure to Taihu Lake source water for 90 days. The H-1 NMR spectra of mice sera were recoded and a total of 21 metabolites were identified. Data reduction and latent biomarkers identification were processed by pattern recognition (PR) analysis. The principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) identified differences in metabolic profiles between control and treatment groups. A number of serum metabolic perturbations were observed in sera of source water treatment mice compared to control mice, including decreased levels of acetone, pyruvate, glutamine, lysine and citrate. These results indicated that Taihu Lake source water could induce energy metabolism changes in mouse related to fatty acid beta-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, citric acid cycle, and metabolism of some amino acids. H-1 NMR-based metabolic profiling provides new insight into the toxic effect of Taihu Lake source water, and suggests potential biomarkers for noninvasive monitoring of health risk.

AB  - Glufosinate-ammonium (Gla) is a broad-spectrum and non-selective herbicide that widely used in many countries worldwide, but the biological safety including potentially negative effects on aquatic organisms remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the immunotoxic effects of Gla exposure on zebrafish embryos. Firstly, Gla markedly decreased the survival rate and caused a series of morphological malformations in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the number of macrophages and neutrophils was substantially reduced upon Gla exposure. In addition, the levels of oxidative stress were changed and the antioxidant enzyme activities such as CAT and SOD were elevated with the increase of Gla concentrations. Secondly, comparative transcriptome analysis identified 1, 366 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 789 up-regulated and 577 down-regulated in zebrafish embryos after Gla exposure. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that metabolic pathways such as drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 was markedly regulated and proteolysis, oxidation-reduction process, and peptidase activity were significantly enriched by the GO analysis. Besides, 55 immunity-related genes were identified in the DEGs, and we found that the genes in the metabolism, redox and immunity display an unique expression profilings by clustering analysis. Finally, 8 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were further confirmed and they were differentially regulated after Gla exposure. In summary, a global survey of zebrafish defense against glufosinate was performed, and a large number of gene expression levels regarding metabolism, redox, and immunity-related genes were acquired from RNA-Seq. This study provides valuable informations for future elucidating the molecular mechanism of herbicide induced immunotoxicity in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A controversial debate in evolutionary biology has been to explain why deleterious mutations are usually recessive to their wild-type allele. For Fisher, dominance of the wild-type is the result of selection, whereas for Wright it is a mere consequence of the biochemical properties of physiological pathways. Over time, Wright's theory has appeared as the most appropriate, and Kacser and Burns explained why the widespread occurrence of recessive mutants is the inevitable consequence of the kinetic structure of enzyme networks. Does Wright and Kacser and Burns (W-K-B)'s theory apply for newly arisen adaptive genes? A survey of more than 70 studies shows that pesticide resistance conferred by mutations decreasing the affinity of the pesticide target-sites varies from complete recessivity to complete dominance. This review shows that dominance always has a purely physiological explanation that can be roughly, but not simply, predicted by W-K-B's theory. Thus, although W-K-B's theory remains powerful for predicting the recessivity of deleterious mutations involved in enzymatic pathways, no general theory emerges from the study of other situations, and molecular explanations are to be sought on a case by case basis.

AB  - Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been used extensively in the eastern regions of South Africa for agricultural and malaria control purposes, yet few data exist on the local environmental and social impacts of these compounds. Such issues have become of increasing concern in the iSimangaliso World Heritage Site, where the continued use of OCPs may pose risks to several sensitive and protected species. This study was designed to examine the bioaccumulation of OCPs in two common fish species, Oreochromis mossambicus (Mozambique tilapia) and Clarias gariepinus (African sharptooth catfish) from iSimangaliso Wetland Park. These species are targeted by local subsistence fishermen and sustain substantial bird and crocodile populations. Our findings indicate widespread contamination of the aquatic environment, with Sigma OCP fish tissue concentrations in the range of 6907-8740 ng g(-1) lw and 2953-5874 ng g(-1) lw for C. gariepinus and O. mossambicus, respectively. HCHs (471-1570 ng g(-1) lw), DDTs (645-2399 ng g(-1) lw), drin-related residues (589-1960 ng g-1 lw), chlor-related residues (455-2162 ng g-1 lw) and endosulfans (457- 1495 ng g-1 lw) were detected in all tissue samples. Concentrations detected in the majority of samples exceeded European Commission maximum residue limits and a health risk assessment indicated potential dietary risk associated with exposure to heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide and dieldrin. This study represents the first investigation into OCP bioaccumulation in fish species from iSimangaliso Wetland Park. Our findings highlight the need for more detailed investigations into the bioaccumulation and ecotoxicological effects of these contaminants in the food web and the associated risks to local ecosystems and human health.

AB  - Global warming represents a severe threat to existing ecosystems, especially for anuran tadpoles who encounter significant fluctuations in their habitats. Decreasing water levels in permanent and temporary water bodies is a significant risk for larval survival or fitness. On the other hand, the natural environment of amphibians is extremely polluted by various xenobiotics. This study evaluated how pre-exposure of Bombina variegata tadpoles to chronic environmental stress (desiccation) modulates the biochemical response of juvenile individuals to following acute chemical stressor (pesticide deltamethrin). Our results demonstrated that individually applied pesticide changed the thiol and lipid status of the treated juveniles but animals subjected solely to desiccation pressure were more tolerant to free radicals and showed no induction of lipid peroxidation. Comparison of juveniles exposed to deltamethrin revealed that desiccation pretreatment during the larval stage of development modified cellular protection in the juveniles. Higher activities of CAT, GSH-Px and GR were recorded in the preexposed group, as well as a lower degree of lipid peroxidation relative to the group that was not pre-exposed to low water stress. Pre-desiccated groups displayed the greatest range of coordination of investigated antioxidant parameters, supported by Pearson's correlations. Activation of the GSH-redox system is a significant marker in juveniles against stress caused by desiccation and a chemical stressor. The stressful environment experienced during tadpole development produced an adaptive reaction to subsequent exposure to another stressor in juveniles. To develop relevant management and conservation strategies, more studies of the interactive effects of environmental and chemical stressors are necessary.

AB  - Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic molecule playing vital roles in various signaling cascades, including cell proliferation, and activation of immune responses against infections. It is well known as a pivotal regulator of innate immunity. In this study, we have rescued and characterized two members of the MIF family, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (OfMIF) and D-Dopachrome tautomerase (OfDDT) from rock bream, Oplegnathus fasciatus. The deduced OfMIF and OfDDT protein sequences revealed the presence of the catalytic oxidoreductase (CXXC), motif. They also possessed highly conserved proline (P-2) and lysine residues (K-33), responsible for their isomerase and tautomerase functions. Rock bream MIF and DDT homologues shared higher identity with fish homologues and also with mammals and occupied a distinct position in the phylogenetic tree, depicting their evolutionary conservation. The spatial expression analysis revealed the highest expression of both OfMIF and OfDDT in liver, while portraying constitutive expression in other tissues. The recombinant proteins purified using the Escherichia coli system revealed potent oxidoreductase activity against insulin with both dithiothreitol and glutathione as reducing agents. Stimulation of rock bream head kidney cells with recombinant OfMIF and OfDDT proteins induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). These results together suggest their involvement in rock bream immune defense and this study on the novel MIF family member DDT from rock bream will pave the way for further studies of this homologue in other teleosts and delineate its multiple functions.

AB  - The inflammasome regulates the release of caspase activation-dependent cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-18 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)(1-5). By studying HMGB1 release mechanisms, here we identify a role for double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR, also known as EIF2AK2) in inflammasome activation. Exposure of macrophages to inflammasome agonists induced PKR autophosphorylation. PKR inactivation by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition severely impaired inflammasome activation in response to double-stranded RNA, ATP, monosodium urate, adjuvant aluminium, rotenone, live Escherichia coli, anthrax lethal toxin, DNA transfection and Salmonella typhimurium infection. PKR deficiency significantly inhibited the secretion of IL-1 beta, IL-18 and HMGB1 in E. coli-induced peritonitis. PKR physically interacts with several inflammasome components, including NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), NLRP1, NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and broadly regulates inflammasome activation. PKR autophosphorylation in a cell-free system with recombinant NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC, also known as PYCARD) and pro-caspase-1 reconstitutes inflammasome activity. These results show a crucial role for PKR in inflammasome activation, and indicate that it should be possible to pharmacologically target this molecule to treat inflammation.

AB  - Comparisons of cardinalfish (Apogonidae) assemblage structure were made using small rotenone samples within specific habitats from Belize, Honduras, and Puerto Rico in the Atlantic Ocean, and the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific Ocean. A total of 146 collections containing two or more apogonid species was made in the Gulf of Honduras, 22 in Puerto Rico, and 35 in the Hawaiian Islands. Detrended correspondence analysis determined whether collections from specific habitats clustered together in ordination space. Analysis of the Atlantic apogonid data did not result in the recognition of any exclusive assemblages corresponding to specific habitats, whereas collections from the Pacific Ocean demonstrated exclusive clusters of cardinalfish assemblages from different habitats. Horn's Index of Similarity was used to compare assemblages, and a randomization test was used to evaluate their significance. Because these differences could be the result of large differences in sample sizes between collections from the two oceans, subsamples of the much larger Atlantic dataset were taken. The subsamples demonstrated that with smaller samples the probability of visualizing polygons containing only samples from a single habitat are greater, but these samples did not result in the same level of habitat specificity as found for the Pacific samples, and similarity measures also differed. These data demonstrate for the first time that assemblage patterns within a single fish family differ between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This difference and earlier findings that different fish families exhibit various levels of associations of assemblages with habitats, support the conclusion that assemblage structure of coral-reef fishes cannot be explained by a single paradigm.

AB  - In Escherichia coli, the SoxR regulon orchestrates genes for defense against certain types of oxidative stress through the SoxR-regulated synthesis of the SoxS transcription activator. The Pseudomonas putida genome did not reveal a clear soxS homolog. The P. putida SoxR protein appears to be functional: its expression in an E coli Delta soxR strain restored the paraquat inducibility of soxS. Of nine candidate P. putida oxidative stress genes, which are known to be SoxR regulon in E coli, tested for response to superoxide or nitric oxide, fumC-1, sodA, zwf-1. and particularly fpr, encoding ferredoxin:NADP(+) reductase, were induced, all independent of P. putida soxR. Disruption of the fpr and fin R, a regulatory protein that is required for paraquat-dependent expression of the fpr, resulted in more oxidative stress sensitivity. However, a P. putida soxR-deletion strain had normal resistance to the superoxide-generating agent paraquat. The data presented here show that the genetic responses to superoxide stress in P. putida differ markedly from those seen in E coli and Salmonella, and the role of P. putida soxR remains to be established.

AB  - Pickerel Lake (Minnesota, USA) is a shallow, polymictic lake that has had eutrophication problems for decades. Although excess nutrient loading has been a problem in the past, the dominance of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) was considered to be a substantial factor driving and sustaining eutrophic conditions. To remove carp and restore the fish community, the lake was treated with rotenone in late 2009 and then restocked with native species. All water quality variables improved after carp removal, with mean values (May-Sep) for chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, and turbidity decreasing by 80% to 93% and Secchi disk transparency increasing nearly 600% when comparing means of pre- to post-treatment years. Macrophyte coverage also improved, from means of 4.6% before treatment to 90% after treatment, indicating a shift from an algal- to a macrophyte-dominated system. Sediment phosphorus (P) storage increased significantly after carp removal as well, with labile (releasable) forms of P increasing in the upper 10 cm of sediment in all cores (n = 7). The decrease in water column P equaled the increase in labile sediment P forms after treatment, indicating carp were a key driver of P transport from sediment to water. The results of this study indicate that an ecological (i.e., both abiotic and biotic) approach is needed when managing eutrophic lakes because management of nutrients alone will not likely be adequate to restore water quality in systems dominated by carp or other large benthic feeding fish.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls are a family of synthetic hydrocarbon compounds that were used historically for a broad range of industrial purposes. Although banned in the 1970s, they continue to be ubiquitous in landfills, sediments, and wildlife. Prenatal polychlorinated biphenyl exposure was evaluated in a sample of children born to women who had eaten relatively large quantities of polychlorinated biphenyl-contaminated bike Michigan fish. This exposure was found to be associated with poorer intellectual function after controlling statistically for a broad range of potential confounding variables. Deficits included poorer recognition memory in infancy, lower scores on a preschool IQ test, and poorer verbal IQ and reading comprehension at 11 years of age. Although breast-fed children were exposed postnatally to elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls from maternal milk, the adverse effects associated with prenatal exposure were markedly stronger in the children who were riot breast-fed. It is not clear whether the adverse effects were attenuated in the breast-fed children dire to certain nutrients in the breast milk or due to better quality of intellectual stimulation provided by the breast-feeding mothers. Virtually no adverse effects were found in relation to postnatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls from breast-feeding, indicating that the fetus is particularly vulnerable to this exposure.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are now chronically polluted by a cocktail of many chemical substances. There is now clear evidence of associations between exposure to pollutants and greater susceptibility to pathogens. The aim of the present study was to characterize the defense capacities of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), chronically exposed to pendimethalin (PD), to subsequent experimental challenge with the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). Immunological responses were examined at different organizational levels, from individuals to gene expression. No negative effects of PD were noted on the Fulton index nor on the liver or spleen somatic indices (LSI; SSI) before viral infection, but the infectious stress seems to generate a weak but significant decrease in Fulton and LSI values, which could be associated with consumption of energy reserves. During the viral challenges, the distribution of cumulative mortality was slightly different between infected groups. The impact of the virus on fish previously contaminated by PD started earlier and lasted longer than controls. The proportion of seropositive fish was lower in the fish group exposed to PD than in the control group, with similar quantities of anti-IHNV antibodies secreted in positive fish, regardless of the treatment. While no significant differences in C3-1 expression levels were detected throughout the experiment, TNF1&2, TLR3, Il-1 beta and IFN expression levels were increased in all infected fish, but the difference was more significant in fish groups previously exposed to herbicide. On the other hand, beta-def expression was decreased in the pendimethalin-IHNV group compared to that in fish only infected by the virus (control-IHNV group).

AB  - Numerous chemicals released into the environment by man are able to disrupt the functioning of the endocrine system by binding to hormonal receptors. Exposure to estrogenic endocrine disrupters during critical periods in fetal life can alter the development of reproductive organs, the neuroendocrine system and subsequent behavior. We present a series of studies on the effects of exposure during fetal life to low, environmentally relevant doses of two pesticides, o, p ' DDT and methoxychlor, and of low doses of the synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol on subsequent neuro-behavioral development in house mice. The main findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Mice prenatally exposed to methoxychlor showed changes in reflex development. Exposure to a very low dose of methoxychlor appeared to produce an increased reactivity during early postnatal life. (2) Methoxychlor exposed periadolescent mice showed a decreased reaction time exploring both a novel environment and a novel object. (3) The onset of male intrasex aggression appeared to be delayed in males prenatally exposed to low doses of methoxychlor, since exposed males showed low levels of aggressive interactions during early adolescence but not after they reached adulthood. (4) The rate of depositing urine marks in a novel environment was increased in males prenatally exposed to DES, and also to o, p ' DDT and methoxychlor. (5) The proportion of both males and females attacking a same-sex conspecific was increased in mice prenatally exposed to low doses of DES and, marginally, to o, p ' DDT. This effect appeared to be related to a decreased latency to attack. However, males prenatally exposed to o, p ' DDT displayed a decreased intensity of aggression. The possible implications of perturbing the hormonal milieu during fetal development on the modulation of developmental turnpoints and future behavioral responses are discussed.

AB  - We measured the residues of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the serum of 23 residents of the New Bedford, Massachusetts, area and from two homogenates each of bluefish and lobsters from the same area. We used congener-specific and total Aroclor quantitative approaches, both of which involved gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (electron ionization mode), we confirmed the presence of PCBs in the combined serum samples and in the aliquots of bluefish and lobsters. In measuring the PCB levels in serum, we found good agreement between the two electron capture detector approaches (r greater-than-or-equal-to 0.97) when the serum of specific congeners was compared to total Aroclor. We used univariate and multivariate quality control approaches to monitor these analyses. Analytical results for bluefish showed a better agreement between the two techniques than did those for lobsters; however, the small number of samples precluded any statistical comparison. We also measured levels of chlorinated pesticides in the serum samples of two groups of New Bedford residents, those with low PCB levels (< 15 ng/ml) and those with high PCB levels (greater-than-or-equal-to 15 ng/ml). We found that residents with high PCB levels also tended to have higher levels of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-di-(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE). The higher concentration of all three analytes appears to be influenced by employment in the capacitor industry, by seafood consumption, or both. Using Jaccard measures of similarity and principal component analysis we compared the gas chromatographic patterns of PCBs found in the serum of New Bedford area residents with high serum PCBs with the patterns found in homogenates of lobsters (inclusive of all edible portions except the roe), in homogenates of bluefish fillets taken from local waters, and in serum from goats fed selected technical Aroclors (e.g. Aroclors 1016, 1242, 1254, or 1260). The patterns found in human serum samples were similar to the patterns found in lobster homogenates. Both of these patterns closely resembled patterns found in the serum samples of the goat fed aroclor 1254, as demonstrated by both pattern recognition techniques.  In addition, the chromatographic patterns of human serum and of lobsters and bluefish homogenates all indicated the presence of PCBs more characteristic of Aroclors 1016 or 1242.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the toxic effect of PCZ, a triazole fungicide commonly present in surface and ground water, on the ROS defense system and Na+-K+-ATPase in gills of rainbow trout exposed to sublethal concentrations (0.2, 50 and 500 mu g L-1) for 7, 20 and 30 days. After prolonged exposure of PCZ at higher test concentrations (50 and 500 mu g L-1), oxidative stress was apparent as reflected by the significant higher ROS levels in fish gill, as well as the significant inhibition of SOD and CAT activities. In addition, Na+-K+-ATPase activities were significantly lower than those of the control with increasing PCZ concentration and prolonged exposure period. The results of this study indicate that chronic exposure to PCZ has altered multiple physiological indices in fish gill; however, before these parameters are used as unique biomarkers for monitoring residual pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments, more detailed laboratory experiments need to be performed.

AB  - Chemical communication is one of the most important ecological phenomena promoting the maintenance of ecosystem dynamics. In predator-prey interactions, mediation signals allow prey to detect their predators and can be crucial in the process of avoiding them. Since organisms in many natural waterbodies are often subjected to anthropogenic stressors, it is hypothesised that low concentrations a xenobiotic compounds can disturb this chemical communication, acting as infodisruptors. This study analyzes whether two anthropogenic pollutants (chromium and an insecticide) interfere in two freshwater predator-prey interactions, by altering the behavioural responses of a cladoceran and a copepod species to a fish chemical cue. The concentrations tested were lower than those considered innocuous under international water quality guidelines, and two types of behaviour were analysed: escape ability and depth selection in an artificial water column. Both species tested demonstrated a higher escape ability when exposed to the cue than when they were not exposed. Xenobiotics modified the responses of the copepod in opposite ways: chromium inhibited this behaviour and the insecticide prompted a higher than expected level of escape ability. The depth selection patterns were different between N. conifer and C. dubia. Fish kairomones did not modify them, however chromium and the insecticide caused important alterations in both cases. Such disruptions would be detrimental to the organisms' life cycle trajectories, which, in natural systems, would cause longterm damage in trophic structure and in evolutionary processes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of pesticide Fury 10 EW, containing zeta-cypermethrin 100 g.l(-1), on common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.).
   DESIGN: The toxicity tests were performed on common carp according to OECD 203 methodologies. The common carp were exposed to Fury 10 EW at concentrations, 5, 7, 10, 50 and 100 mu g.l(-1) for 96 h and compared to common carp in a non-treated control group. Acute toxicity tests were detected value 96hLC50=13.8 mu g.l(-1). On the basis of the results was assessed the effect on the hematological profile, oxidative stress parameters, and antioxidants biomarkers in tissues, in another acute test.
   RESULTS: The observed 96hLC50 value of Fury 10 EW was 13.8 mu g.l(-1). A significantly lower large lymphocyte and monocyte count, and a significantly greater number of segmented eosinophil granulocyte and higher hematocrit was found in the pesticide-exposed common carp compared to controls. Oxidative damage was not detected in the experimental common carp, however there were significant differences from control in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) in tissue after acute exposure to 13.8 mu g.l(-1) Fury 10 EW.
   CONCLUSIONS: Zeta-cypermethrin as Fury 10 EW was classified as a substance highly toxic to fish. The hematological profile well oxidative stress parameters and antioxidant defensive systems provide important information about the internal environment of organisms. There is a lack of experimental results about the effects of zeta-cypermethrin on fish in the literature.

AB  - A novel molecularly imprinted silica layer,appended to FeSe quantum dots (MIP-FeSe-QDs) was fabricated and utilized as a recognition element to develop a selective and sensitive fluorescent nanosensor for cyfluthrin (CYF) determination. The MIP-FeSe-QDs were characterized by fluorescence spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Excellent selectivity and high sensitivity of MIP-FeSe-QDs to CYF molecules were observed based on the fluorescence quenching of FeSe-QDs. Under optimal conditions, a good linear relationship was found between fluorescence quenching effect and increased CYF concentration within 0.010-0.20 mg/L, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9911. The practicality of the developed sensor method for CYF detection in fish and sediment samples was further validated. Good recoveries ranging from 88.0% to 113.9% with < 6.8% relative standard deviations were obtained. The detection limits of CYF in sediment and fish samples were 1.3 and 1.9 mu g/kg, respectively. This study established a novel, rapid fluorescent nanosensor detection method based on MIP-QDs for successfully analyzing CYF in fish and sediment samples.

AB  - Public Service Enterprise Group of New Jersey (PSEG) restored Delaware Bay marshes to enhance fish production as part of a mitigation negotiated in the company's New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. Restoration meant control of an introduced type of the common reed, Phragmites, which had displaced Spartina alterniflora and S. patens. Phragmites dominance altered the function and structure of the brackish marshes and reduced habitat value by raising and flattening marsh surface and covering smaller tidal creeks. A common control technique is to use an herbicide-glyphosate. Public concern about herbicide use led to public meetings where the concerns were discussed and data provided. The scientific information regarding the herbicide did not satisfy the public. PSEG and New Jersey regulators agreed to test other methods for reed control and limit the amount of herbicide used. Experiments with methods of Phragmites control indicate that herbicide application over three or more growing seasons, concentrating in an area until control was complete, is the most effective control method.

AB  - The prognosis of paraquat (PQ) poisoning is highly correlated to plasma PQ concentration, which has been identified as the most important index in PQ poisoning. This study investigated the predictive value of coagulation, liver, and kidney indices in prognosticating PQ-poisoning patients, when aligned with plasma PQ concentrations. Coagulation, liver, and kidney indices were first analyzed by variance analysis, receiver operating characteristic curves, and Fisher discriminant analysis. Then, a new, intelligent, machine learning-based system was established to effectively provide prognostic analysis of PQ-poisoning patients based on a combination of the aforementioned indices. In the proposed system, an enhanced extreme learning machine wrapped with a grey wolf-optimization strategy was developed to predict the risk status from a pool of 103 patients (56 males and 47 females); of these, 52 subjects were deceased and 51 alive. The proposed method was rigorously evaluated against this real-life dataset, in terms of accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficients, sensitivity, and specificity. Additionally, the feature selection was investigated to identify correlating factors for risk status. The results demonstrated that there were significant differences in the coagulation, liver, and kidney indices between deceased and surviving subjects (p<0.05). Aspartate aminotransferase, prothrombin time, prothrombin activity, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, urea nitrogen, and creatinine were the most highly correlated indices in PQ poisoning and showed statistical significance (p<0.05) in predicting PQ-poisoning prognoses. According to the feature selection, the most important correlated indices were found to be associated with aspartate aminotransferase, the aspartate aminotransferase to alanine ratio, creatinine, prothrombin time, and prothrombin activity. The method proposed here showed excellent results that were better than that produced based on blood-PQ concentration alone. These promising results indicated that the combination of these indices can provide a new avenue for prognosticating the outcome of PQ poisoning.

AB  - The present study focused on the assessment of oxidative stress induction by pesticides such as carbamates which are widely used as insecticides and nematicides and contaminate aquatic ecosystems on certain biomarkers in liver of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Biomarkers selected for stress monitoring were malondialdehyde (MDA), an index of lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant defence system enzymes, mainly catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities in liver of fish exposed to 0, 10, 50, or 100 mu g L-1 of carbofuran for 4, 15, or 30 days. Oxidative stress was found in liver of common carp exposed to carbofuran which was manifested by a decrease in CAT and GR activities after 4 and 30 days of exposure. An adaptive response was probably produced since at day 15 no modifications in the CAT activity and increased GR activity were observed. In addition, a decrease in MDA content with the highest concentration of carbofuran used was found after 30 days of exposure. However, no significant changes were found in GST activity showing a varied response. The results concerning oxidative and antioxidant profiles indicate that subchronic exposure to the insecticide carbofuran is capable of inducing oxidative stress in fish.

AB  - In recent years, a variety of low molecular weight antibiotics have been isolated from diverse animal species. These agents, which include peptides, lipids, and alkaloids, exhibit antibiotic activity against environmental microbes and are thought to play a role in innate immunity. We report here the discovery of a broad-spectrum steroidal antibiotic isolated from tissues of the dogfish shark Squalus acanthias. This water-soluble antibiotic, which we have named squalamine, exhibits potent bactericidal activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, squalamine is fungicidal and induces osmotic lysis of protozoa. The chemical structure of the antibiotic 3beta-N-1-{N-[3-(4-aminobutyl)]-1,3-diaminopropane}-7alpha,24zeta-dihydroxy-5alpha-cholestane 24-sulfate bas been determined by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy and NMR. Squalamine is a cationic steroid characterized by a condensation of an anionic bile salt intermediate with spermidine. The discovery of squalamine in the shark implicates a steroid as a potential host-defense agent in vertebrates and provides insights into the chemical design of a family of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

AB  - Pendimethalin, an herbicide active substance frequently used in terrestrial systems, has detected in European aquatic ecosystems. Reliable indicators still need to be found in order to properly assess the impact of pesticides in fish. After an in vivo chronic exposure to pendimethalin, the detoxification process and the antioxidant defense system were assessed in 120 adult rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Four nominal exposure conditions were tested: control (C), 500 ng L-1 (P500), 800 ng L-1 (P800) and the commercial formulation Prowl at 500 ng L-1 (Pw500). Fish samples were made after a 28 day exposure period (D28) and after a fifteen day recovery period in clean fresh water (D43). At D28, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was not activated in liver in spite of the pendimethalin uptake in fish. At D43, EROD activity in fish exposed to the commercial product was lower than in control fish, which may be explained by the high presence of herbicide in fish (613 +/- 163 ng g bile(-1)). Furthermore, antioxidant defense responses were set up by trout in gills and liver following chronic exposure to 800 ng L-1 of pendimethalin concentration. While the glutathione content (GSH) decreased in gills, it increased in liver associated with higher activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). These disturbances could lead to reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress in the vital organs in fish. After fifteen days in clean water, while the SOD activity was restored, the GSH content and GPx activity were still significantly disturbed in fish exposed to pendimethalin in comparison with control. These significant differences between treatments in antioxidant defenses parameters measured, attesting to the irreversibility of the effects. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Carboxin is one of the most widely used fungicides in agriculture but information about toxicity on fish is limited. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of exposure to carboxin on the Antioxidant Defense System of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The fish were exposed to carboxin (3.85 ppm) for 7 days. The antioxidant parameter (Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST)) was measured in fish liver samples. The results indicated that carboxin exposure significantly affected the activity of GST in rainbow trout liver (p < 0.05). Thus, it was assumed that carboxin caused oxidative stress in rainbow trout and GST enzyme played a role in protection against carboxin toxicity.

AB  - The progressive growth of aquaculture implicates a dependence on large water amounts, which are submitted to disinfection processes, namely ozonation. Considering the importance of genomic integrity, it is critical to improve the knowledge on ozone-related genotoxic hazard to organisms reared in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) applying ozonation. Therefore, genetic damage induced by ozone exposure in the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) was assessed, combining the comet and the erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) assays, reflecting different damage levels, i.e. DNA and chromosomal damage, respectively. Fish were subjected to a daily 6-h ozone (0.15 mg L-1) exposure, repeated for 3 consecutive days, simulating a short-term event of overozonation. To assess the temporal impact of the previous event, the progression of damage was evaluated 7 days later, following transference to ozone-free water or to 0.07 mg L-1 ozone, a routinely adopted level in RAS. Both endpoints pointed to the ozone genotoxic potential, displaying DNA oxidation as a possible mechanism of damage. Overall, the present findings pointed out the genotoxic hazard of ozone to fish, highlighting the importance of these types of studies and contributing to improve aquaculture practices, namely in RAS systems. These early genotoxic signals may be a prelude to negative repercussions on fish health, which may affect the aquaculture productivity. The present findings recommend precautions in relation to accidental or intentional overozonation in fish-farming, even when short-term events are considered. The strategies to mitigate the impact of ozonation in S. senegalensis may include a dietary extra supplementation of antioxidants (regularly, or punctually in cases of overozonation).

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most highly prevalent insecticides in freshwater ecosystems and has been widely detected in fishery and agricultural products worldwide. Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) is a well-known medicinal plant with many pharmacological properties. Hence, the present study was designed to explore the probable beneficial effect of M. oleifera on CPF-induced health disturbances in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Two hundred and seventy fish were allocated into six groups in triplicate. For 30 days, the first group was fed a basal diet; the second group was exposed to 1/10 of the LC50 of CPF (0.007 mg/L) and fed the basal diet; the third and fourth groups were fed basal diets supplemented with 7% M. oleifera seeds and 10% M. oleifera leaves, respectively; and the fifth and sixth groups were exposed to 1/10 of the LC50 of CPF and fed basal diets supplemented with 7% M. oleifera seeds and 10% M. oleifera leaves, respectively. CPF exposure significantly altered growth performance, haematologic profiles, immune defence mechanisms, liver functions, and oxidant/antioxidant status. Additionally, CPF exposure resulted in prominent genotoxic and lipid peroxidative impacts. Interestingly, dietary supplementation with 7% M. oleifera seeds or 10% M. oleifera leaves significantly counteracted the CPF-induced adverse impacts on O. niloticus growth performance and health. These outcomes show that dietary supplementation with M. oleifera seeds or leaves can safeguard the commercially valuable freshwater fish species O. niloticus against CPF-induced health disorders and may be a candidate feed additive for Nile tilapia in aquaculture.

AB  - Complement C1q domain containing protein (C1qDC) is a vital recognition molecule and has an important effect on immunity. The C1qDCs exhibit opsonic activity in fish, while the mechanisms of C1qDCs in activation complement still remain unclear. This study explored immunological characteristics of a C1qDC from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) (PoC1qDC). PoC1qDC consists of 296 amino acid residues, possessing a collagen domain and a C1q domain. According to our results, PoC1qDC was expressed in 9 diverse tissue samples and showed up-regulation after bacterial challenge. Recombinant PoC1qDC (rPoC1qDC) activated normal serum bactericidal and hemolytic activities by interaction with Japanese flounder IgM, but not enhanced the complement activity of C3-depeleted serum. rPoC1qDC was significantly bound to various bacterial species and agglutination activity against Edwardsiella piscicida and Streptococcus iniae. Furthermore, rPoC1qDC showed direct interaction with peripheral blood leucocytes while enhancing phagocytic and chemotactic activity. When PoC1qDC was overexpressed in Japanese flounder before E. piscicida infection, bacterial replication was significantly inhibited in fish tissues. Consistently, when PoC1qDC expression in Japanese flounder was knocked down, bacterial replication was significantly enhanced. The above findings first suggested the role of PoC1qDC in teleost in mediating complement activation by interaction with IgM, which can positively influence bacterial infection.

AB  - Lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT) is one of the most widely used types of insecticides, although hardly anything is known regarding its toxicity on fish.
   This study assessed the effects of exposure to LCT on the antioxidant defense system of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Fish were exposed to LCT (10 ppm) for 48 h. Antioxidant parameters, catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were measured in fish liver tissue. Our results indicated that LCT exposure significantly increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes in rainbow trout hepar (p<0.05). From these results, it was assumed that LCT caused oxidative stress in the rainbow trout, and CAT, SOD and GST enzymes played a role in protecting the fish against LCT toxicity.

AB  - Biological invasion pathways are strongly influenced by human behavior. This research aimed to build new understanding about public perceptions and expectations for possible management responses that might be used after detection of Asian carp in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Although the species are as yet unestablished, our research worked to inform communication that could be publicly responsive in the event of an invasion. Our objectives were to: 1) determine public risk perceptions associated with Asian carp; 2) determine public risk perceptions associated with different types of management responses to an Asian carp invasion; and 3) identify types of risk-related information and communication that would influence community support for different types of eradication or control approaches. Objectives were achieved by using a two-phase approach. Phase one utilized an online, voluntary, self-administered survey with 2788 responses received from a convenience sample of Laurentian Great Lakes Basin residents. Phase two included three "Thinkshops" of fishing and boating stakeholders in southern Michigan. Across all hypothetical Asian carp invasion scenarios, the application of rotenone to a large area was the most frequently selected management response. When impacts from Asian carp and their management were discussed, study participants supported framing risks in terms of environment and economy. Insights herein provide new evidence that can help narrow the gap between how invasion risks are perceived and responded to by natural resource managers to reduce social conflicts over, and potentially address, invasive species threats more rapidly.

AB  - Cysteamine bitartrate is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for nephropathic cystinosis also postulated to enhance glutathione biosynthesis. We hypothesized this antioxidant effect may reduce oxidative stress in primary mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) disease, improving cellular viability and organismal health. Here, we systematically evaluated the therapeutic potential of cysteamine bitartrate in RC disease models spanning three evolutionarily distinct species. These pre-clinical studies demonstrated the narrow therapeutic window of cysteamine bitartrate, with toxicity at millimolar levels directly correlating with marked induction of hydrogen peroxide production. Micromolar range cysteamine bitartrate treatment in Caenorhabditis elegans gas-1(fc21) RC complex I (NDUFS2(-/-)) disease invertebrate worms significantly improved mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative stress, with corresponding modest improvement in fecundity but not lifespan. At 10 to 100 mu m concentrations, cysteamine bitartrate improved multiple RC complex disease FBXL4 human fibroblast survival, and protected both complex I (rotenone) and complex IV (azide) Danio rerio vertebrate zebrafish disease models from brain death. Mechanistic profiling of cysteamine bitartrate effects showed it increases aspartate levels and flux, without increasing total glutathione levels. Transcriptional normalization of broadly dysregulated intermediary metabolic, glutathione, cell defense, DNA, and immune pathways was greater in RC disease human cells than in C. elegans, with similar rescue in both models of downregulated ribosomal and proteasomal pathway expression. Overall, these data suggest cysteamine bitartrate may hold therapeutic potential in RC disease, although not through obvious modulation of total glutathione levels. Careful consideration is required to determine safe and effective cysteamine bitartrate concentrations to further evaluate in clinical trials of human subjects with primary mitochondrial RC disease.

AB  - The Suquia River middle-lower basin (Cordoba, Argentina) is subjected to a strong anthropogenic impact because it receives pollutants from different sources. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the introduced fish species Gambusia affinis as a bioindicator of environmental pollution in the middle-lower basin of the Suquia River. The assessment was performed by measuring biomarkers at different levels of biological organization, at two sampling sites (before and after Cordoba city), and at dry and wet seasons. Water quality evaluation was made through a water-quality index (based on physico-chemical parameters), heavy-metals and pesticides concentrations in water. The water quality varied between sampling sites, showing the most degraded conditions downstream Cordoba city. The same pattern of variation was detected in the biomarkers studied, mainly in: gill and liver histopathological indexes, copulatory organ (gonopodium) morphology and vitellogenin expression in males and females. The present study characterized the environmental conditions in the middle-lower basin of the Suquia River and revealed the low freshwater quality at the most polluted site. Although G. affinis is an introduced species, it could be considered a good sentinel of water resource quality of invaded Neotropical basins. Our results demonstrated the importance of addressing the environmental quality monitoring through an integrated analysis of water quality parameters together with histological, morphological and molecular parameters. Thus, our study provides a good model for application in other basins of South America. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Physiological ecologists require techniques for controlled oxidative challenges in live animals to facilitate the study of oxidative stress.
   2. Techniques for manipulating oxidative stress include agents that increase generation of pro-oxidants, such as paraquat, diquat, radiation, heavy metals, dietary oxidized lipids, and tert-butyl-hydroperoxide, as well as genetic (RNAi) and chemical (buthionine sulfoximine) knock-downs that target specific antioxidants.
   3. We critically assess both currently used and potentially useful methods for inducing systemic oxidative challenge in animals. We provide a resource for biologists to select the most robust methods for oxidative challenge in their study system, to improve interpretation of results within the context of cellular mechanisms and to maximize effectiveness of experiments while minimizing unintended side effects.

AB  - In the first quantitative survey of intertidal fish from the South African west coast 62 intertidal rock pools were sampled at two sites, using the ichthyocide rotenone. A total of 2 022 fish representing 14 species belonging to only two families - the Clinidae (88-98% by number) and the Gobiesocidae (12-2%) - were caught. Clinus superciliosus, C. heterodon and the gobiesocid Chorisochismus dentex were the most abundant species in terms of both numbers and biomass. Vertical zonation of individual species on the shore indicated little separation of the habitat between species, although some species exhibited size-specific partitioning of the shore. Relationships between fish distribution and abundance and rock pool characteristics were elucidated by means of stepwise multiple regression, both at the whole community and individual species levels. The abundances of individual species were best predicted by pool size, although some species also showed an association with weed cover. For the community as a whole, the number of species present, the total number of fish and the total biomass in any pool were all dependent on pool size, height above LWS and amount of available cover. Relative to other South African sites the west coast has a low diversity of intertidal fish, combined with a high degree of dominance and a low level of habitat separation.

AB  - Dichlorvos (2,2-dichlorovinyl-dimethylphosphate), an organophosphorus pesticide used for indoor insect and livestock parasite control, is among the most common commercially available pesticides, However, there are significant concerns over its toxicity, especially due to its relative stability in water, soil, and air. Zebrafish, an important developmental model, has been used for studying the effects of toxic compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure to dichlorvos at early life stages (1 h postfertilization - 7 days postfertilization) in the zebrafish and its toxicological effects during the development, through morphological (7 days postfertilization), locomotor and social behavior analysis (7, 14, 30, 70, and 120 days postfertilization). Dichlorvos (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) exposure reduced the body length and heartbeat rate at 7 days postfertilization (dpf), as well as the surface area of the eyes (5 and 10 mg/L). The avoidance behavior test showed a significant decrease in escape responses at 7 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 14 (5 and 10 mg/L) dpf zebrafish. The evaluation of larval exploratory behavior showed a reduction in distance traveled, mean speed (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and time mobile (10 mg/L) between control and dichlorvos groups. In addition, the analysis performed on adult animals showed that the changes in distance traveled and mean speed remained reduced in 30 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 70 dpf (5 and 10 mg/L), recovering values similar to the control at 120 dpf. The social behavior of zebrafish was not altered by exposure to dichlorvos in the early stages of development. Thus, the exposure to organophosphorus compounds at early stages of development induces an increased susceptibility to behavioral and neuronal changes that could be associated with several neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Clothianidin, a neonicotinoid insecticide that binds to arthropod nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, is widely used to protect plants against a wide variety of agricultural pests. Little is known about how this insecticide affects non-target invertebrate species in aquatic environments. In this study, we explored the effects of aqueous exposures of clothianidin on locomotion, chemosensory-based responses, and agonistic encounters of rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus). Clothianidin exposures at a concentration of 1.0 mu g/L (i.e., 1.0 ppb) did not alter initiations and retreats, but did increase the amount of time the crayfish interacted per interaction. In a subsequent food cue experiment with crayfish exposed to clothianidin concentrations of 0.4 mu g/L and 1.0 mu g/L, the test organisms demonstrated chemosensory dysfunction, but no decrease in locomotory movement. As chemosensation is essential for recognizing previous rivals in crayfish, the loss of this sense likely resulted in the exposed crayfish being unable to detect cues used to recognize a previous competitor. An inability to recognize a previous competitor (and who won or lost the previous interaction) could result in crayfish spending more time fighting and less time on foraging and reproduction. This study demonstrates that exposures of crayfish to clothianidin at concentrations found in the environment affects the behavioural ecology of these aquatic invertebrates.

AB  - Mass mortalities among marine mammal populations in recent years have raised questions about a possible contributory role of contaminants accumulated through the marine food chain. While viruses were shown to be the primary cause of the outbreaks, an immunotoxic action by organochlorine chemicals in affected animals could not be ruled out. We carried out a 2 1/2-year immunotoxicological experiment in which two groups of 11 harbour seals each were fed herring from either the relatively contaminated Baltic Sea or the relatively uncontaminated Atlantic Ocean. Seals in the Baltic Sea group accumulated 3-4 times higher levels of Ah-receptor-mediated 2,3,7,8-TCDD Toxic Equivalents in blubber than did their Atlantic counterparts following 2 years on the respective diets. Blood was sampled a total of 17 times during the course of the experiment for immunological evaluation, during which time the natural cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from seals fed Baltic Sea herring declined to a level approximately 25% lower than that observed in seals fed Atlantic herring (P < 0.01). Natural killer (NK) cell activity has not been previously described for a marine mammal species. We characterized the natural cytotoxic activity of harbour seal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and found this to be interleukin-2 (IL-2) responsive, sensitive to antibody anti-asialo GM1, and it was higher against a virus-infected target cell, like NK cells described for other mammals. As NK cells are leukocytes which play an important role in the first line of defence against viruses, the observed impairment of NK cell activity in the seals feeding on the Baltic Sea herring suggests that exposure to contaminants may have an adverse effect on the defence against virus infections in seals inhabiting polluted waters in Europe. This may therefore have affected the severity of the infections, the survival rates and the spread of infections during recent epizootics.

AB  - Specific molecularly imprinted membranes (MIMs) for pyrethroid insecticides were developed and characterized for the first time in this study by cold plasma-induced grafting polymerization using methacrylic acid as a functional monomer and cypermethrin (CYP) as a template. The nonimprinted membranes (NIMs) were also synthesized using the same procedure without the template. Meanwhile, AFM, XPS, ATR-FTIR, contact angle, and permselectivity experiments were conducted to elucidate the imprinting and recognition properties of MIMs. Results demonstrated that MIMs exhibited excellent imprinting effect and high permselectivity. A molecularly imprinted-membrane-assisted solvent extraction (MI-MASE) method based on the MIMs was established. The operating conditions were optimized for group-selective extraction of the five pyrethroid insecticides. Compared with NIMs, higher extraction recoveries (83.8% to 100.6%) of the five pyrethroid insecticides by gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) were obtained using MIMs at three spiked levels in fish samples; the RSD values were lower than 8.3%. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) defined as the concentrations at which the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is 3:1 and 10:1, respectively, were in the range of 0.26 to 0.42 ?g/kg and 0.77 to 1.27 mu g/kg, respectively. No matrix effect of the developed MI-MASE was observed by gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS). These results demonstrated a highly selective, efficient, and environment-friendly MI-MASE technique for preconcentration and purification of pyrethroid insecticides from seafood, followed by GC-ECD and GC/MS/MS. The excellent applicability and potential of MI-MASE for routine monitoring of pyrethroid pesticides in food samples has also been confirmed.

AB  - Infrared spectroscopy is an important technique for measuring airborne chemicals, for pollution monitoring and to warn of toxic compound releases. Infrared spectroscopy provides both detection and identification of airborne components. Computer-assisted classification tools, including pattern recognition and artificial neural network techniques, have been applied to a collection of infrared spectra of organophosphorus compounds, and these have successfully discriminated commercial pesticide compounds from military nerve agents, precursors, and hydrolysis products. Infrared spectra for previous tests came from a commercial infrared library, with permission, from military laboratories, and from defense contractors. In order to further test such classification tools, additional infrared spectra from the NIST gas-phase infrared library were added to the data set. These additional spectra probed the tendency of the trained classifiers to misidentify unrelated spectra into the trained classes.
   Infrared spectra used in this effort were gathered from a variety of sources. Different instrument operators collected them at a number of locations, in a variety of spectral data collection designs, and they were delivered in a variety of digital formats. The spectra were treated mathematically to remove artifacts from their collection. Preprocessing techniques used included Fisher weighting and principal component analysis. Classifications were made using the k-nearest neighbor classifier, feed forward neural networks, trained with a variety of techniques, and radial basis function networks. The results from these classification techniques will be reported and compared.

AB  - St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, is the largest island in the Bering Sea, located 60 km from Siberia. The island is home to approximately 1600 St. Lawrence Island Yupik residents who live a subsistence way of life. Two formerly used defense sites (FUDS) exist on the island, one of which, Northeast Cape, has been the subject of a $123 million cleanup effort. Environmental monitoring demonstrates localized soil and watershed contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), organochlorine (OC) pesticides, mercury, and arsenic. This study examined whether the Northeast Cape FUDS is a source of exposure to OC pesticides. In total, 71 serum samples were collected during site remediation from volunteers who represented three geographic regions of the island. In addition, ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) and Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) were collected from Northeast Cape after remediation to assess continuing presence of OC pesticides. Chlordane compounds, DDT compounds, mirex, and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were the most prevalent and present at the highest concentrations in both fish tissues and human serum samples. After controlling for age and gender, activities near the Northeast Cape FUDS were associated with an increase in serum HCB as compared to residents of the farthest village from the site. Positive but nonsignificant relationships for sum-chlordane and sum-DDT were also found. Organochlorine concentrations in fish samples did not show clear geographic trends, but appear elevated compared to other sites in Alaska. Taken together, data suggest that contamination of the local environment at the Northeast Cape FUDS may increase exposure to select persistent OC pesticides.

AB  - Genotoxicity is considered as one of the endpoints in assessing toxic effect of pollution. In the present study genotoxic effects of pesticides in the Perna viridis have been evaluated by the induction of micronuclei (MN). The aim of the present study was to assess the MN frequency in the haemolymph of green mussel (Perna viridis) after exposure to different concentrations of organophosphate pesticides (chlorpyrifos, malathion), synthetic pyrethroid pesticide (cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin) and herbicide (buctril). Haemocytes of bivalve play an important role in immune defense and detoxification of contaminants. The bivalves were exposed to different concentrations of test pesticides in a static system. The MN frequencies of all the pesticide treated mussel groups increased significantly (p< 0.05) until the end of the exposure period as compare to control. The highest MN frequencies were recorded after cypermethrin exposure on day 12 (7, 8.5 and 11% for 0.5 ppm, 1 ppm and 1.5 ppm concentrations respectively) in haemolymph. However the lowest MN frequencies were recorded after buctril exposure (3.5, 3.5 and 5% for 0.5 ppm, 1 ppm and 1.5 ppm concentrations, respectively) in haemolymph. The use of haemocytes of green mussel (Perna viridis) in MN assay proved to be a sensitive tool for the assessment of genetic damage.

AB  - The halophilic bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) represents a substantial health problem for several fish species in aquaculture. Bacteria that reside free and inside phagocytes cause acute and chronic forms of photobacteriosis. Infections of juveniles rapidly kill up to 90-100% fish. Factors underlying failure of the immune protection against bacteria remain largely unknown. The reported study used a transcriptomic approach to address this issue. juvenile sea breams (0.5 g) were challenged by immersion in salt water containing 2.89 x 10(8) CFU of a virulent Phdp and the head kidney was sampled after 24- and 48-h. Analyses were performed using the second version of a 44 k oligonucleotide DNA microarray that represents 19,734 sea bream unique transcripts and covers diverse immune pathways. Expression changes of selected immune genes were validated with qPCR. Results suggested rapid recognition of the pathogen, as testified by up-regulation of lectins and antibacterial proteins (bactericidal permeability-increasing protein lectins, lysozyme, intracellular and extracellular proteases), chemokines and chemokine receptors. Increased expression of proteins involved in iron and heme metabolism also could be a response against bacteria that are dependent on iron. However, negative regulators of immune/inflammatory response were preponderant among the up-regulated genes. A remarkable finding was the increased expression of IL-10 in concert with up-regulation of arginase I and II and proteins of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway that diverts the arginine flux from the production of reactive nitrogen species. Such expression changes are characteristic for alternatively activated macrophages that do not develop acute inflammatory responses. Immune suppression can be induced by the host to reduce tissue damages or by the pathogen to evade host response. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Trophic ecology of macrobenthic communities in estuaries of the northern Gulf of Mexico was used to infer community function, determine effects of contaminants on macrobenthos, and provide insight into community responses following disturbance. The taxa that numerically dominated the region included few large, deep-burrowing suspension feeders that typify estuaries elsewhere. This pattern is indicative of disturbance, and results in dominance by trophic groups that live near the sediment-water interface (early benthic-community succession). Trophic structure was significantly related to several sediment contaminants (especially metals, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, DDT), and three environmental gradients (salinity, depth, and sediment silt-clay content). Generally trophic diversity increased and proportion of subsurface-deposit feeders (SSDF) decreased with salinity, meaning that a more even distribution of trophic structure was found at high-salinity stations.
   The trophic shift toward dominance by shallow, subsurface-deposit feeders in contaminated habitats may have dire implications for fisheries. Several important commercial and recreational fisheries of the region depend on fish that feed primarily at the sediment surface. Higher proportion of subsurface-deposit feeders, coupled with low macrobenthic density in contaminated sediments, may imply that limited energy is transferred to higher trophic levels.

AB  - Aphanizomenon flos-aquae is a cyanobacterium that is frequently encountered in eutrophic waters worldwide. It is source of neurotoxins known as aphantoxins or paralytic shellfish poisons (PSPs), which present a major threat to the environment and human health. The molecular mechanism of PSP action is known, however the in vivo effects of this neurotoxin on oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant defense responses in zebrafish brain remain to be understood. Aphantoxins purified from a natural isolate of A. flos-aquae DC-1 were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. The major components of the toxins were gonyautoxins 1 and 5 (GTX1 and GTX5, 34.04% and 21.28%, respectively) and neosaxitoxin (neoSTX, 12.77%). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were injected intraperitoneally with 7.73 mu g/kg (low dose) and 11.13 mu g/kg (high dose) of A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins. Oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defense responses in the zebrafish brain were investigated at various timepoints at 1-24 h post-exposure. Aphantoxin exposure was associated with significantly increased (>1-2 tidies) reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in zebrafish brain compared with the controls at 1-12 h postexposure, suggestive of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In contrast, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in the zebrafish brain exposed to high or low doses of aphantoxins decreased by 44.88% and 41.33%, respectively, after 1-12 h compared with the controls, suggesting that GSH participated in detoxification to ROS and MDA. Further analysis showed a significant increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) compared with the controls, suggesting elimination of oxidative stress by the antioxidant response in zebrafish brain. All these changes were dose and time dependent. These results suggested that aphantoxins or PSPs increased ROS and MDA and decreased GSH in zebrafish brain, and these changes induced oxidative stress. The increased activity of SOD, CAT and GPx demonstrated that these antioxidant enzymes could play important roles in eliminating excess ROS and MDA. These results also suggest that MDA, ROS, GSH and these three antioxidant enzymes in the brain of zebrafish may act as bioindicators for investigating A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins or PSPs and algal blooms in nature.

AB  - Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have received significant concern, since they ubiquitously exist in the environment and are able to induce adverse health effects on human and wildlife. Increasing evidence shows that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), members of the steroid receptor subfamily, are potential targets for EDCs. GR and MR mediate the actions of glucocorticoids and miner-alocorticoids, respectively, which are two main classes of corticosteroids involved in many physiological processes. The effects of EDCs on the homeostasis of these two classes of corticosteroids have also gained more attention recently. This review summarized the effects of environmental GR/MR ligands on receptor activity, and disruption of corticosteroid homeostasis. More than 130 chemicals classified into 7 main categories were reviewed, including metals, metalloids, pesticides, bisphenol analogues, flame retardants, other industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The mechanisms by which EDCs interfere with GR/MR activity are primarily involved in ligand-receptor binding, nuclear translocation of the receptor complex, DNA-receptor binding, and changes in the expression of endogenous GR/MR genes. Besides directly interfering with receptors, enzyme-catalyzed synthesis and prereceptor regulation pathways of corticosteroids are also important targets for EDCs. The collected evidence suggests that corticosteroids and their receptors should be considered as potential targets for safety assessment of EDCs. The recognition of relevant xenobiotics and their underlying mechanisms of action is still a challenge in this emerging field of research.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) adversely affect reproduction in birds. Captive adult male and female American kestrels (Falco sparverius) were studied to investigate the potential behavioral and hormonal alterations during the courtship period resulting from clinical exposure to PCBs. American kestrels ingested 7 mg/kg/body weight/bird/day of a 1:1:1 mixture of Aroclors 1248, 1254, and 1260 through their diet of day-old cockerels. The dietary dosage of Aroclors resulted in environmentally relevant total PCB residues in the eggs, averaging 34.1 mug/g wet weight (geometric mean). There was no difference between treatment and control birds in the circulating levels of total androgens (p = 0.44) or in 17 beta -estradiol (p = 0.29), one week following pairing. Male kestrels exposed to dietary PCBs exhibited significantly more sexual behaviors (p = 0.034) and flight behaviors (p = 0.026) than the control males. Sexual behaviors of male kestrels included; nest-box inspections, solicitation of copulation, the offer of food to the female, and giving the female food. The flight behaviors of the male included; flying from one perch to another and aerial display. In addition, the frequency of male sexual behaviors were correlated (r = 0.605, p = 0.001) with total PCB residues in the eggs of their mates. A concurrent study found that these same PCB-exposed kestrels experienced a delay in clutch initiation as well as a greater number of completely infertile clutches.

AB  - The euryhaline fish, Oreochromis mossambicus was exposed to sub-lethal concentration (30 mu g/L) of profenofos (PF) for 28 days and allowed to recover for 7 days. Responses were evaluated through antioxidant enzyme activities in various tissues of fish. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities showed transient increases in gill, viscera and muscle, but decreased in brain. However, catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) were inhibited in gill and viscera. Reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were depleted in all the tissues and a significant induction in lipid peroxidation (LPO) was observed. Significant recovery in all the studied parameters was noticed at the end of recuperation period. The enhanced LPO in the present study suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative damage could be one of the main toxic effect of PF. The increased LPO and alterations in the antioxidant defense system can be used as biomarkers in the pesticide-contaminated aquatic streams. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Density dependent interactions between higher and lower trophic levels were studied in two consecutive whole lake experiments in a highly productive lake. In the first experiment, the zooplanktivorous fish species, roach (Rutilus rutilus) (primary carnivore), was reduced to 27% of its previous population size (53%) of biomass) by a selective rotenone treatment. In the second experiment, zander (Stizostedion lucioperca) (secondary carnivore), were stocked in the lake resulting in a reduction in the population size of roach to 51% of its previous population size (31% of biomass). In both experiments, seasonal average biomass of Daphnia cucullata) increased in the two years with the lowest roach biomasses. but no shift to larger zooplankton forms took place. In the years with increased Daphnia biomass, phytoplankton biomass and transparency showed an increased seasonal variation (measured as coefficient of variation). In contrast to manipulations in which planktivorous fish were totally removed, no effect on seasonal average phytoplankton biomass was observed. Due to the high reproductive capacity of roach, the system returned to previous conditions within a year or two after the perturbations. Under unperturbed conditions, the lake showed few indications of instability as suggested by the paradox of enrichment hypothesis. This lack of instability can. among other things, be related to high zooplanktivore predation pressure present in highly productive lakes preventing overexploitation of primary producers by grazers. In addition, the omnivorous feeding characteristics of roach (feeding on both zooplankton and algae/detritus) and interactions between the open water and the detritus nutrient pool are likely to increase the stability of the system. The two perturbation experiments plus a previous natural experiment (winter fish kill), which all were pulsed perturbations, provide no evidence for the presence of alternative stable states in highly productive lakes. Possibly, a sustained perturbation over several years may shift highly productive lakes from a dominance of phytoplankton production to a dominance of macrophyte production leading to an alternative state.

AB  - Changes in the gene transcription of stress response genes in resident fish can be powerful biomarkers for the identification of sublethal impacts of environmental stressors on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we tested the effects of two reference toxicants, copper (Cu) and the pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate [(S)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylbutyrate], on lethal (mortality) and sublethal endpoints (growth, swimming behavior, transcription levels of stress response genes) in juvenile (81-90-day-old) striped bass (Morone saxatilis). We established cellular stress response markers for proteotoxicity (HSP70, HSP90), phase I detoxification mechanism (CYP1A1), metal-binding (metallothionein), as well as immune-function and pathogen-defense (TGF-beta, Mx-protein, nRAMP). Quantitative real-time TaqMan (R) PCR was used to examine tissue-specific changes in the transcriptome of liver, spleen, white muscle, anterior kidney and gills after 7-day Cu exposures and 24-h esfenvalerate exposures. On the transcriptome level, exposure to Cu showed strongest effects on the transcription of metallothionein in spleen tissue, causing a 4-fold increase of mRNA at 42 ppb total Cu and a 10-fold increase at 160 ppb Cu. Exposure to Cu also caused significant tissue-specific changes in gene transcription for immune-system related genes. Esfenvalerate exposure had tissue-specific effects on the transcription of HSP70, HSP90 and CYP1A1. The most significant effects were detected in liver tissue after exposure to 0.64 mu g/L esfenvalerate.
   Our results show that the stress response at the transcriptome level is a more sensitive indicator for Cu and esfenvalerate exposures at low concentrations than swimming behavior, growth or mortality. The accuracy of studies on quantitative changes in the transcriptome can benefit from an initial evaluation or the inclusion of several different tissues and the use of multiple housekeeping genes.

AB  - As an abundant source of antioxidants and diet flavor enhancers, the plant essential oils can have positive effects on fish growth, and resistance against environmental stressors. In this study, garden thyme (Thymus vulgaris) essential oil (TEO) was used in the diet of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, to evaluate its protective effect against Malathion pesticide exposure. Tested fish (19.99 +/- 0.01 g) were divided into six groups (three replicates), namely: T1: control diet; T2: control diet + 0.025 mg L-1 malathion; T3: control diet + 0.075 mg L-1 malathion; T4: control diet + 1% TEO; T5: control diet + 0.025 mg L-1 malathion + 1% TEO and T6: control diet + 0.075 mg L-1 malathion + 1% TEO. After 21 days, T4 fish had the highest final body weight (FW), weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), and the lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) among experimental treatments (P<0.05). The blood parameters including the red blood cells (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and hemoglobin (Hb) values were the highest in T4 treatment, displaying a significant difference with T1 treatment (P<0.05). Fish in the T4 groups had the highest total protein (TP) and albumin (ALB), while fish of T3 showed the lowest levels of these parameters (P<0.05) and also had the highest level of triglycerides (TRG), cholesterol (CHOL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and urea (Ur). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzymes recorded the lowest levels in T4 treatment, which showed a significant difference with T1 group. The catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed the highest activities in T4 treatment, while the lowest SOD and the highest malondialdehyde (MDA) levels occurred in T3 group (P<0.05). Total immunoglobulin (total Ig) level, alternative complement (ACH(50)) and lysozyme in the serum and skin mucus of T4 treatment of rainbow trout showed the highest activities with a significant difference from groups (P<0.05). From the results of the present study, it can be concluded that 1% of T. vulgaris as a supplement to the diet of rainbow trout can stimulate and improve the immune system of the fish. TEO can have a protective effect against unfavorable effects of malathion and improves the growth of the fish.

AB  - Tattoo belongs to the group of carbamate fungicides and contains Mancozeb (ethylene(bis)dithiocarbamate) as its main constituent. The toxicity of Mancozeb to living organisms, particularly fish, is not resolved. This work investigated the effects of 96 h of exposure to 3, 5, or 10 mg L-1 of Tattoo (corresponding to 0.9, 1.5, or 3 mg L-1 of Mancozeb) on the levels of oxidative stress markers and the antioxidant enzyme system of brain, liver, and kidney of goldfish, Carassius auratus). In liver, Tattoo exposure resulted in increased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 70%-79%, catalase by 23%-52% and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) by 49%. The content of protein carbonyls (CP) in liver was also enhanced by 92%-125% indicating extensive damage to proteins. Similar increases in CP levels (by 98%-111%) accompanied by reduced glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (by 13%-15%) was observed in kidney of fish exposed to Tattoo; however, SOD activity increased by 37% in this tissue after treatment with 10 mg L-1 Tattoo. In brain, a rise in lipid peroxide level (by 29%) took place after exposure to 10 mg L-1 Tattoo and was accompanied by elevation of high-molecular mass thiols (by 14%). Tattoo exposure also resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in glutathione reductase activity (by 26%-37%) in brain. The data collectively show that exposure of goldfish to 3-10 mg L-1 of the carbamate fungicide Tattoo resulted in the development of mild oxidative stress and activation of antioxidant defense systems in goldfish tissues.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the oxidative stress potential of low-level organophosphate fenthion exposure with the modulatory effect of buthionine sulfoximine in the liver of Cyprinus carpio L. The fish were exposed to 20% of 96-hour LC50 of fenthion for 24 and 96 hours. Total and oxidized glutathione, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, protein levels, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase-specific enzyme activities were measured spectrophotometrically. There was a 15-day depuration period to evaluate the changes in the studied parameters. Fenthion caused a time-dependent depletion of the total and reduced glutathione levels. The oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio and catalase specific enzyme activity were reduced while the glutathione-S-transferase activity was elevated. Intraperitonal buthionine sulfoximine application disclosed the inhibitory effect of fenthion on superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, whereas glutathione-S-transferase activity was increased. There was no change in lipid peroxidation levels during the experiments. No amelioration was observed in the affected parameters except the glutathione-S-transferase activity in the 15-day depuration period. In conclusion, glutathione-S-transferase and catalase enzyme activities and total and reduced glutathione levels were better estimators to monitor the effects of fenthion in low concentration in the liver of C. carpio. The depuration period was not adequate to recover the antioxidant capacity.

AB  - Zebrafish offer many advantages that complement classic mammalian models for the study of normal development as well as for the teratogenic effects of exposure to hazardous compounds. The clear chorion and embryo of the zebrafish allow for continuous visualization of the anatomical changes associated with development, which, along with short maturation times and the capability of complex behavior, makes this model particularly useful for measuring changes to the developing nervous system. Moreover, the rich array of developmental, behavioral, and molecular benefits offered by the zebrafish have contributed to an increasing demand for the use of zebrafish in behavioral teratology. Essential for this endeavor has been the development of a battery of tests to evaluate a spectrum of behavior in zebrafish. Measures of sensorimotor plasticity, emotional function, cognition and social interaction have been used to characterize the persisting adverse effects of developmental exposure to a variety of chemicals including therapeutic drugs, drugs of abuse and environmental toxicants. In this review, we present and discuss such tests and data from a range of developmental neurobehavioral toxicology studies using zebrafish as a model. Zebrafish provide a key intermediate model between high throughput in vitro screens and the classic mammalian models as they have the accessibility of in vitro models and the complex functional capabilities of mammalian models.

AB  - Many natural and synthetic compounds present in the environment exert a number of adverse effects on the exposed organisms, leading to endocrine disruption, for which they were termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). A decrease in reproduction success is one of the most well-documented signs of endocrine disruption in fish. Estrogens are steroid hormones involved in the control of important reproduction-related processes, including sexual differentiation, maturation and a variety of others. Careful spatial and temporal balance of estrogens in the body is crucial for proper functioning. At the final step of estrogen biosynthesis, cytochrome P450 aromatase, encoded by the cyp19 gene, converts androgens into estrogens. Modulation of aromatase CYP19 expression and function can dramatically alter the rate of estrogen production, disturbing the local and systemic levels of estrogens. In the present review, the current progress in CYP19 characterization in teleost fish is summarized and the potential of several classes of EDCs to interfere with CYP19 expression and activity is discussed. Two cyp19 genes are present in most teleosts, cyp19a and cyp19b, primarily expressed in the ovary and brain, respectively. Both aromatase CYP19 isoforms are involved in the sexual differentiation and regulation of the reproductive cycle and male reproductive behavior in diverse teleost species. Alteration of aromatase CYP19 expression and/or activity, be it upregulation or downregulation, may lead to diverse disturbances of the above mentioned processes. Prediction of multiple transcriptional regulatory elements in the promoters of teleost cyp19 genes suggests the possibility for several EDC classes to affect cyp19 expression on the transcriptional level. These sites include cAMP responsive elements, a steroidogenic factor 1/adrenal 4 binding protein site, an estrogen-responsive element (ERE), half-EREs, dioxin-responsive elements, and elements related to diverse other nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, retinoid X receptor, retinoic acid receptor). Certain compounds including phytoestrogens, xenoestrogens, fungicides and organotins may modulate aromatase CYP19 activity on the post-transcriptional level. As is shown in this review, diverse EDCs may affect the expression and/or activity of aromatase cyp19 genes through a variety of mechanisms, many of which need further characterization in order to improve the prediction of risks posed by a contaminated environment to teleost fish population.

AB  - In Escherichia coli, the SosRS regulon is required for resistance to redox-cycling agents which elevate cytosolic superoxide levels, as well as for resistance to nitric oxide-dependent macrophage killing. In Salmonella typhimurium, SoxS is also required for enhanced expression of Mn-superoxide dismutase and resistance to paraquat, but not for resistance to nitric oxide donor compounds in vitro, resistance to macrophage killing, or virulence in mice. Differences in other antioxidant defense systems or compensation by homologous regulons may account for species-specific differences in the role of SoxS.

AB  - Wildlife from ecosystems contaminated with endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) display a variety of reproductive alterations including cryptorchidism in the Florida panther, small baculum in young male otters, small penises in alligators, sex reversal in fish, and altered social behavior in birds. It has been proposed that EDCs also may have contributed to increases in testicular cancer and hypospadias and the reported decline in human sperm counts. Combined in vivo and in vitro studies are necessary to fully characterize EDC induced alterations of reproduction. We have identified several pesticides (vinclozolin, procymidone, p,p'-DDE) which bind rat and human androgen receptors, block androgen-induced gene expression in vitro and in vivo, delay puberty, reduce sex accessory gland size and alter sex differentiation in the male rat. Some of the phthalates, which are estrogenic in vitro but not in vivo, cause malformations in male rats that appear to result from antagonism of androgens in utero. In contrast, xenoestrogens affect male offspring but they are not malformed or infertile. Prenatal administration of an Ah receptor agonist (2,3,7,8-TCDD or PCB 169) produces a different spectrum of effects including reduced ejaculated sperm numbers in male rats.

AB  - Imidacloprid (IMI) is used in integrated farming like the rice-crayfish co-culture system to prevent water weevil. However, the toxic effect of IMI on the freshwater crayfish Procambarus clarkii is unknown. In the current study, the effects of IMI on the locomotion, antioxidative status, digestion and intestinal microbiota of P. clarkii were investigated. The results showed that IMI caused locomotion impairment with reduced crawl velocity, and attenuated their dark preference, aggressiveness and reversal ability. Inhibited AChE in muscle and hepatopancreas indicates the neurotoxicity of IMI which may directly lead their locomotion dysfunction. The increase of antioxidative enzymes activity and MDA level were found after 25 mu g/L and 250 mu g/L exposure. Significant upregulation of several antioxidative and immune-related genes, including CZ-SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, AFL, proPO, HSP27 and HSP70 confirmed that oxidative stress was induced in all treatments when exposed to IMI. In addition, there was significant increase of LDH, indicating the different energy allocation during the exposure. Meanwhile, results from DNA damage analysis showed elevated OTM value and 8-OHdG level in hepatopancretic cells. On the other hand, decreases of alpha-amylase, lipase and increase of trypsin in hepatopancreas was observed at 25 and 250 mu g/L. In addition, significant changes of composition of intestinal microbiota at both phylum and genus levels were observed according to the 16S rRNA sequencing results. Increase of pathogenic genera and decrease of beneficial bacterial communities revealed the disequilibrium of intestinal flora of crayfish. In summary, results in the present study suggest that IMI at environmentally realistic concentration could induce AChE inhibition and oxidative stress, conjointly leading the locomotion impairment in crayfish. IMI also affected the digestive functions by enzymes inhibition and gut microbiota dysbiosis.

AB  - The comparative toxicity of a variety of oxidative stressors was studied in the epithelioma papulosum cyprini line from carp using the neutral red cytoxicity assay. LC50's decreased in the order t-butylhydroperoxide > hydrogen peroxide > diquat > paraquat. The cytoxicity of hydrogen peroxide was significantly reduced when the cells were grown in L-15 medium rather than MEM and this could be attributed to elevated cellular glutathione and metallothionein levels and higher activities of GSH-dependent detoxification systems. The protective effect of metallothionein in radical scavenging was demonstrated by decreased toxicity of the redoxcycling toxicants, diquat and menadione after metallothionein levels had been pre-induced by Cd-exposure. This study demonstrates the relationship between toxic effects of oxidative stressors and expression of detoxification systems in fish. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - White croaker (Genyonemus lineatus family: Sciaenidae) are a schooling, benthic foraging fish historically associated with soft sediment and wastewater outfalls in southern California. While they are often used as an indicator species due to their high organochlorine contaminant loads, little is known of their movements in relation to contaminated habitats. A Vemco Positioning System acoustic telemetry array was used to collect fine-scale movement data and characterize the site fidelity, area use, and dispersal of 83 white croaker on the Palos Verdes Shelf Superfund Site, California over 27 months. White croaker generally demonstrated low residency and recurrence to the Palos Verdes Shelf, and were observed to be largely nomadic. However, individual behavior was highly variable. Although the entire monitored shelf was visited by tagged white croaker, habitats in 0-200 m proximity to wastewater outfalls and between 25 and 35 m depth were used most frequently. Approximately half of white croaker migrated into Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbors; areas where they may be targeted by subsistence fishers. A model framework for incorporating fish movement data into contaminant exposure estimates was developed to better understanding organochlorine contaminant exposure for planning future remediation and monitoring.

AB  - Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are susceptible to anthropogenic mortality factors, including toxic compounds in the environment such as anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) and sources of man-made energy. The physical and behavioral effects of some toxins may predispose eagles to certain causes of death (COD). To investigate the influence of ARs on mortality of Golden Eagles at wind turbine farms, we randomly tested liver samples from 31 eagles found dead on wind farms and submitted to the National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory from 2013-20. The comparison group was composed of 31 Golden Eagles sampled during the same time frame with a COD of power line electrocution as a proxy for a relatively lower effort and altitude activity. Associations between COD, AR exposure, sex, and life stage were assessed. In each group, 12 birds (35%) were found to have been exposed to brodifacoum or bromadiolone prior to death. Logistic regression showed no significant association between COD and sex (P=0.194) or life stage (P=0.895). Across both mortality types, life stage was not a significant predictor of AR exposure (P=0.725), but males were more likely to have been exposed to ARs (P=0.032). These findings suggest that there is no difference in the influence of anticoagulant exposure on higher and lower altitude activity in Golden Eagles.

AB  - Background: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are widespread in the environment, human food and breast milk. Seafood is known to contain nutrients beneficial for the normal development and function of the brain, but also contaminants such as PCBs which are neurotoxic. Exposure to non-coplanar PCBs during brain development can disrupt spontaneous behaviour in mice and lead to hyperactive behaviour. Humans are chronically exposed to the highest relative levels of organochlorines in early childhood during brain development, though usually at doses which do not give clinical symptoms of toxicity. This study aimed to elucidate the developmental and behavioural effects of 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB153) in mice, mimicking human exposure during gestation and lactation.
   Methods: Environmentally relevant doses of PCB153 were added to the experimental diets. Feed concentrations were approximately 0.5, 6.5, and 1500 mu g PCB153/kg feed, representing a realistic and a worst case scenario of frequent consumption of contaminated fish. The study also investigated the effects of maternal nutrition, i.e. a standard rodent diet versus a high inclusion of salmon. Mice pups were examined for physical-and reflex development, sensorimotor function and spontaneous behaviour from five days after birth until weaning. A selection of pups were followed until 16 weeks of age and tested for open field behaviour and the acoustic startle response (ASR) with prepulse inhibition (PPI). Blood thyroid hormones and liver enzymes, blood lipids and PCB153 content in fat were examined at 16 weeks. Statistical analyses modelled the three way interactions of diet, PCB exposure and litter size on behaviour, using generalized linear models (GLM) and linear mixed effect models (LME). The litter was used as a random variable. Non-parametric tests were used for pair wise comparisons of biochemical analyses.
   Results: Litter size consistently influenced pup development and behaviour. Few lasting PCB153 related changes were observed, but results indicated effects on synchronization of physical development. Perinatal PCB153 exposure appeared to reduce habituation and cause aggression in males, though not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: Litter size and maternal diet influenced physical development and function more than PCB153 in perinatally exposed mouse pups and supports the developmental importance of maternal care and the social environment.

AB  - BACKGROUD Pesticides are widely used to control insect infestation and weeds in agriculture. However, concerns about the pesticide residues in agricultural products have been raised in recent years because of public interest in health and food quality and safety. Thus, rapid, convenient, and accurate analytical methods for the detection and quantification of pesticides are urgently required. RESULTS A nanohybrid system composed of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and tetrakis(N-methyl-4-pyridiniumyl) porphyrin (TMPyP) was used as an optical probe for the detection and quantification of five pesticides (Paraquat, Dipterex, Dursban, methyl thiophanate and Cartap). The method is based on the aggregation effect of pesticides on the carboxyl group modified by AuNPs. Subsequently, with the help of particle swarm optimization-optimized sample weighted least squares-support vector machine (PSO-OSWLS-SVM), all the pesticides could be successfully quantified. In addition, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was applied and the five pesticides were satisfactorily recognized based on data array obtained from the ultraviolet visible (UV-visible) spectra of AuNP-TMPyP complex. Furthermore, the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the five pesticides could be also achieved in the complex real samples, in which all the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 0.3 parts per thousand and all the linear absolute correlation coefficients were more than 0.9990. Furthermore, recognition rate of the training set and the prediction set based on multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), or second-order derivative (2nd derivative) UV-visible spectra in PLS-DA model could reach 100%. CONCLUSION This method was successfully applied for the rapid and accurate determination of multicomponent pesticide residues in real food samples. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Currently diverse biocidal agents can be used for distinct applications, such as personal hygiene, disinfection, antiparasitic activity, and antifouling effects. Zinc pyrithione is an organometallic biocide, with bactericidal, algicidal and fungicidal activities. It has been recently incorporated in antifouling formulas, such as paints, which prevent the establishment of a biofilm on surfaces exposed to the aquatic environment. It has also been used in cosmetics, such as anti-dandruff shampoos and soaps. Previously reported data has shown the presence of this substance in the aquatic compartment, a factor contributing to the potential exertion of toxic effects, and there is also evidence that photodegradation products of zinc pyrithione were involved in neurotoxic effects, namely by inhibiting cholinesterases in fish species. Additional evidence points to the involvement of zinc pyrithione in alterations of metal homeostasis and oxidative stress, in both aquatic organisms and human cell models. The present work assesses the potential ecotoxicity elicited by zinc pyrithione in the freshwater fish Gambusia holbrooki after an acute (96 h) exposure. The oxidative stress was assessed by the quantification of the activities of specific enzymes from the antioxidant defense system, such as catalase, and glutathione-S-transferases; and the extent of peroxidative damage was quantified by measuring the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels. Neurotoxicity was assessed through measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity; and a standardized method for the description and assessment of histological changes in liver and gills of was also used. Zinc pyrithione caused non-specific and reversible tissue alterations, both in liver and gills of exposed organisms. However, histopathological indices were not significantly different from the control group. In terms of oxidative stress biomarkers, none of the tested biomarkers indicated the occurrence of pro-oxidative effects, suggesting that the oxidative pathway is not the major toxicological outcome of exposure to zinc pyrithione.

AB  - Food safety is the prime area of concern that builds trust. With the prevailing advancements, it has become facile to ensure safety in almost all aspects. Technology has grown from tedious lab techniques to modern chromatographic techniques and immunoassays, progressed with more precise and rapid sensing through the advent of Biosensors. Biosensors provide an automated technology by presenting superfast, nondestructive and cost-effective detection in food analysis. SPR biosensor is an optical biosensor known for its versatility and has wider applications in food testing and analysis. It has an optical system for excitation and interrogation of surface plasmons, and a biomolecular recognition element to detect and seize the target analyte present in a sample. The optical signal detects the binding analyte, on the recognition element, which results in a change in refractive index at the surface and modifies the surface plasmons' propagation constant. SPR aids in label-free detection of various components such as adulterants, antibiotics, biomolecules, genetically modified foods, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, microorganisms and microbial toxins in food and assures safety. The distinct advancements of SPR in food analysis have been found and discussed. The review also provides knowledge on the advantages and the key challenges encountered by SPR.

AB  - The present study was designed to determine the modulatory effects of arginine and citrulline dietary supplementation on the immune condition and inflammatory response of European seabass, Dicentrarchus labrax. Four diets were manufactured: a control diet (CTRL) was formulated to meet the indispensable amino acids profile established for seabass. Based on this formulation, three other diets were supplemented with L-arginine at two different levels (0.5% and 1%, ARG1 and ARG2, respectively) and L-citrulline at 0.5% (CIT). Fish were fed these diets for 2 or 4 weeks under controlled conditions. At the end of 4 weeks, fish from all dietary treatments were intraperitoneally-injected with Photobacterium damselae piscicida and sampled after 4, 24 our 48 h. Immune status was characterized by a lymphocyte time-dependent decrease regardless of dietary treatment, whereas peroxidase values dropped in time in fish fed ARG1 and ARG2 and was lower at 4 weeks in fish fed ARG1 than in fish fed CTRL. Up-regulation of several genes was more evident in ARG1-and CIT-fed fish, though pro-inflammatory cytokines were down-regulated by CIT dietary treatment. Following immune stimulation, seabass fed ARG1 showed a decrease in neutrophils and monocytes circulating numbers. On the other hand, expression of 17 selected immune and inflammatory responses genes was barely affected by dietary treatments. Based on the analyzed parameters, results suggest an active role of dietary arginine/citrulline supplementation in modulating immune defences that seem to translate into a suppressed immune repertoire, mostly at the cell response level. The observed changes due to citrulline dietary supplementation were in part similar to those caused by arginine, suggesting that citrulline might have been used by macrophages as an arginine precursor and then engaged in similar immune-impairment leading mechanisms.

AB  - Fenpropathrin is one of the widely used pyrethroid pesticides in agriculture and is frequently detected in the environment, groundwater, and food. While fenpropathrin was found to have neurotoxic effects in mammals, it remains unclear whether it has similar effects on fish. Here, we used adult zebrafish to investigate the impacts of fenpropathrin on fish social behaviors and neural activity. Exposure of adult zebrafish to 500 ppb of fenpropathrin for 72 h increased anxiety levels but decreased physical fitness, as measured by a novel tank diving test and swimming tunnel test. Fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to spend more time in the conspecific zone of the tank, possibly seeking greater comfort from their companions. Although learning, memory, and aggressive behavior did not change, fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to have shorter fighting durations. The immunocytochemical results showed the tyrosine hydroxylase antibody-labeled dopaminergic neurons in the teleost posterior tuberculum decreased in the zebrafish brain. According to a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of the brain, exposure to fenpropathrin resulted in a decrease in the messenger (m)RNA expression of monoamine oxidase (mao), an enzyme that facilitates the deamination of dopamine. In contrast, the mRNA expression of the sncga gene, which may trigger Parkinson's disease, was found to have increased. There were no changes observed in expressions of genes related to antioxidants and apoptosis between the control and fenpropathrin-exposed groups. We provide evidence to demonstrate the defect of the neurotoxicity of fenpropathrin toward dopaminergic neurons in adult zebrafish.

AB  - The indiscriminate use of pesticides is a worldwide concern due to the environment contamination since it can cause deleterious effects to non-target organisms including the fishes. The effects of abamectin, a pesticide from the avermectin family, were evaluated in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) after exposure to a commercial formula commonly used in Brazil. The animals were submitted to acute (96 h) and to a short-term chronic exposure (15 days) of distinct concentrations of abamectin. LC50 was determined and a histological study followed by an immunohistochemistry analysis for P-gp and HSP70 identification were performed on livers of the animals submitted to the acute and chronic treatment, respectively. Moreover, behavior patterns were observed daily in both trials. A LC50 value of 105.68 mu g/L was determined. The histological analysis revealed a morphological alteration of the hepatocytes, glycogen accumulation, degeneration, and disorganization of the cytoplasm, and a pyknotic, irregular, and laterally located nuclei. The immunohistochemistry for HSP70 and P-gp showed strong staining in the hepatocytes of the control groups and progressive decrease as the concentration of abamectin increased. Changes were observed in body posture, movement around the aquarium, opercular activity, body color and search for food in the groups treated with abamectin. The results presented suggest that abamectin can affect the behavioral pattern of the animals, promote morphological changes, and decrease the expression of HSP70 and P-gp in zebrafish liver.

AB  - We reconstruct historical trends in both fish and fish-eating bird populations at the Salton Sea, California since the Sea's formation in 1905. The fish community has undergone dramatic shifts in composition, from freshwater species present in the initial wash-in to stocked marine species to dominance by an unintentionally introduced cichlid. Historical catch records, creel censuses, and gill-netting studies suggest that total fish biomass in the lake increased dramatically throughout the 1970s, crashed in the late 1980s, recovered in the mid-1990s, and crashed again in the early 2000s. We speculate that crashes in fish populations are primarily due to three physiological stressors-rising salinity, cold winter temperatures, and high sulfide levels and anoxia associated with mixing events. The trends in fish biomass are mirrored in population trends of both breeding and wintering fish-eating birds, as indexed by a number of independent bird surveys. In contrast, most non-piscivorous birds at the Salton Sea show no indication of these temporal dynamics. We discuss possible explanations for the observed trends in fish-eating bird populations, including decline in organochlorine insecticide use and fluctuations in prey abundance at the Salton Sea. Finally, we speculate on the future prospects of both fish and fish-eating birds at the Salton Sea given the environmental challenges the Sea currently faces.

AB  - Oxytetracycline (OTC) is employed in fish farms to contest or prevent bacterial infections. We simulated an OTC treatment at therapeutic level (75 mg kg(-1)) and at higher doses (150, 300 mg kg(-1)) for 10 days. A withdrawal period of 10 days was considered for treated carp, carrying out the same chemical and biochemical analyses (total glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase and malondialdehyde). The aim was to obtain data related to the carryover in muscle and on variations in the antioxidant indicators in liver and kidney. The OTC residual levels in muscle showed a dose-response relationship. After 10 days of treatment at the recommended dose (75 mg kg(-1)), the mean value in muscle was 295 mu g kg(-1). After 10 withdrawal days, residues in all treated groups were not entirely eliminated by fish. Residues of recommended 75 mg kg(-1) OTC dose were lower than the maximum permitted by EEC regulation: 100 mu g kg(-1). Disturbance in the antioxidant systems in liver and kidney was recorded in (150, 300 mg kg(-1)) carp, as well as during the withdrawal period. A lowered superoxide dismutase activity and higher levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione were evaluated in liver, while in kidney only higher malondialdehyde and glutathione S-transferase concentrations were recorded for 300 mg kg(-1) dose. The therapeutic OTC dose exerted lower effects, and only in liver, enhancement of GPx and GR activities was recorded. After the withdrawal period, altered antioxidant responses in tissues were restored for all three OTC doses.

AB  - Background: The widespread use of chemical insecticides, resistance in vectors and environmental problems, all have led to an increased interest in the use of biological agents in malaria control programs. The most important functional elements are the native fish. The aim of this study was to identify the native species of lavivorous fish in Rudan County, southern Iran, to introduce an effective species and to propose its' implementation in the national malaria control program.
   Methods: This ecologically descriptive study was conducted during 2011-2012 using random sampling from different fish habitats of Rudan County. The shoals of fish were caught using fishing net. Fish samples were then identified in the Ichthyology lab, Department of Fisheries and the Environment, Hormozgan University.
   Results: Three species of larvivorous fish were identified as follows: Gambusia holbrooki, Aphaniusdispar dispar and Aphanius sp. The latter species has the most distribution in the study area and needs more morphological and molecular studies for identification at the species level.
   Conclusion: Two species of native fish, i.e., A. dispar and A. sp. with larvivorous potential live in the area. Further studies on their predatory property are recommended in order to apply this local potential against malaria vectors in the area.

AB  - The evolution of dominance has been subject to intensive debate since Fisher first argued that modifiers would be selected for if they made wild-type alleles more dominant over mutant alleles. An alternative explanation, put forward by Wright, is that the commonly observed dominance of wildtype alleles is simply a physiological consequence of metabolic pathways. Wright's explanation has gained support over the years, largely ending the debate over the general recessivity of deleterious mutations. Nevertheless there is reason to believe that dominance relationships have been moulded by natural selection to some extent. First, the metabolic pathways are themselves products of evolutionary processes that may have led them to be more stable to perturbations, including mutations. Secondly, theoretical models and empirical experiments suggest that substantial selection for dominance modifiers exists during the spread of adaptive alleles or when a polymorphism is maintained either by overdominant selection or by migration-selection balance.

AB  - Pesticides are distributed to different degrees in surface water and sediment, thus, risks of toxicity and adverse impacts to physiology of resident species could be determined by their microhabitat (sub-habitat) associations, either water column or sediment. River Owan receives. pesticide input from diffuse sources from adjacent farmlands. Surface water, sediment and fish samples [(Pelagic: Tilapia zilli (n = 92) and benthic: Neochanna diversus (n = 59), Clarias gariepinus (n = 68) were collected within the catchment area across seasons for 18-months (August 2016-January 2018) and measured for pesticide levels. Testicular and Ovarian tissue samples across the three species were also examined for pathological alterations. Individual pesticide concentrations in surface water and sediment exceeded international allowable limits, while concentration of pesticide residues in tissues of benthic species was higher compared to pelagic fish. Histopathological assessment revealed a higher incidence of ovarian disruption including atretic follicles, intersex and disorganization of ovarian structure in benthic (bottom-dwelling) fish (C. gariepinus and N. diversus) compared to pelagic (water-column) fish (T. zilli). Males benthic fish species also recorded more severe anomalies, compared to pelagic fish. The damages and anomalies observed in ovarian and testicular tissue indicate chronic responses to pollutant exposure, and implicates the elevation of pesticide concentrations in surface water and sediment above permissible limits. The higher incidence of anomalies recorded for benthic species compared to pelagic species, indicates greater risks of reproductive disruption and could be associated with the microhabitat preferences (water-column or sediment).

AB  - The dimer of lysozyme was administered to carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) in an attempt to reduce the suppression of response in fish exposed to the cypermethrin. Experimental studies were carried out on cells isolated from blood and pronephros of carp. In the in vivo studies fish were intoxicated with cypermethrin (synthetic pesticide) at a dose of LD5. After 24 It fish were injected intraperitoneally with a modulator-the dimer of lysozyme (KLP-602) at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg of body weight. In the study we determined the metabolic activity of phagocyte cells and the proliferative ability of lymphocytes stimulated by ConA and LPS. The results indicate that this modulator is useful for stimulation of cellular and humoral immunity after experimentally induced suppression by selected pesticide. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this study, fish Rhamdia quelen, were exposed to different concentrations of herbicide clomazone: 0.0 (control), 0.45 and 0.91 mg L(-1). After exposure for 8 days to herbicide, fish were transferred to clean water for a recovery period (8 days). Oxidative stress indicators such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels and protein carbonyl content, as well as antioxidant defenses, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), ascorbic acid and non-protein thiols levels were studied, using the liver, brain and muscle tissues. Herbicide exposure increased TBARS in muscle and in liver at higher concentration. In liver protein carbonylation increased and catalase activity did not change in fish exposed to herbicide. SOD enhanced in liver at concentration of 0.91 mg L(-1). GST, ascorbic acid and non-protein thiols levels increase at both concentrations. At the end of the recovery period the most of the parameters recovered whereas GST and ascorbic acid remain elevated. The present study demonstrates the occurrence of disorders in antioxidant parameters and importance in the assessment of the potential risk of herbicides as clomazone on fish species.

AB  - The toxic effects associated to pesticides have been for long a concern in terms of environmental and human safety. The recognition of the limitations of numerous, if not all, pesticides in terms of species-specificity, toxicity level, persistency in the environment, influencing its runoff and transport ability, among other characteristics, have been the subject of numerous studies over the years. These have especially focused on the deleterious impacts of such substances in non-target organisms, including potential effects in humans, considering pesticide uptake through the ingestion of contaminated foodstuff. Aquatic ecosystems may be considered the most vulnerable to pesticide contamination, has most toxicants may eventually end up in these systems, if not directly, via indirect inputs. Aquatic communities are, thus, susceptible both to on-point acute contaminations and to exposure to mixtures of different contaminants for longer periods. Impacts of numerous pesticides in non-target aquatic species have been reported and investigated, contributing to the definition of regulations and legislation to prevent harmful effects to the communities. However, in order to assess effectively the effect of different pesticides in organisms, the definition of suitable biomarkers is crucial. As one of the most identifiable effect of pesticides is cell damage induced by oxidative stress, most studies have resorted to the analysis of antioxidant enzymes to assess the impacts of contamination in the organism. Nonetheless, with methodological advances, other molecules have been identified as potentially useful to be used as biomarkers, as fatty acids. These ubiquitous macromolecules in living organisms are major constituents of biological membranes and tissues. Evidence of the impact of xenobiotics on lipid metabolism and composition, as well as the sensitivity of fatty acids profiles to alterations in the homeostasis of organisms, have been arising, supporting the suitability of these macromolecules as biomarkers of toxicants exposure. However, most studies using fatty acids as biomarkers have dwelled mostly on marine ecosystems, disregarding other aquatic systems, as freshwater systems. Given the importance of these systems as providers of numerous services and goods and their role in ecological integrity and support, the present literature review aims to compile and critically review the studies conducted until the present time regarding the use of fatty acids as biomarkers of pesticide exposure assessment in freshwater communities, as well as highlight limitations identified and propose future research.

AB  - Nineteen authors have filed a communication to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights against Germany and the Russian Federation to enforce rehabilitation of their legal predecessors, who were victims of denazification (Russian: D"D mu D1/2D degrees N dagger DN"(DDD)-D-0 degrees N dagger DN) measures in Post-War Germany. They reprimand that they and the persons concerned are discriminated by the current German legislation against all other groups of comparably politically persecuted persons on the territory of the former Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany (Russian: CoD(2)eN,cD(0)aN oD(0)D(0)yDaN dagger DoD1/2D1/2aN D center dot oD1/2a D"epD1/4aD1/2DD), being excluded from the scope of the existing rehabilitation acts, which have come into force after the German Reunification. Whilst any other persecutees can be rehabilitated according to the existing rehabilitation acts (Criminal Rehabilitation Act and Administrative Rehabilitation Act), and whilst victims of denazification measures in the former Western Occupations Zones had been enabled to enforce their rehabilitation in the terms of German acts in the years between 1951 until 1955 after the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany, those persons who were victims of denazification measures in the former Soviet Occupation Zone are excluded from any rehabilitation. This exclusion is justified by the German legislator and the Federal Constitutional Court with the argument that otherwise the former USSR would not have agreed to the German Reunification.

AB  - Over the years, indiscriminate usage of pesticides has resulted in situations which are not conducive for a good environment. In aquatic toxicology, fishes have been developed as established models for studying toxic responses of xenobiotics including pesticides. Pendimethalin (PD), an herbicide, is widely present in the aquatic environment, but little is known regarding its potential neurotoxicity in fish. The present study was conducted on Channa punctata Bloch exposed to sub-lethal doses of PD (0.5 and 0.8 ppb) for 96 h. The exposure resulted in alterations in epinephrine levels in the fish brain. Epinephrine levels decreased significantly in a dose dependent manner with increase in the PD exposure. A marked decrease in the activity of acetylcholinesterase along with reduction in Na+-K+-ATPase and monoamine oxidase activity was also observed. In comparison with the corresponding controls, the sub-lethal doses of PD also caused significant changes in the oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxidation and carbonyl derivatives of protein oxidative destruction levels) and antioxidant defenses (reduced glutathione levels, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase activity) in brain tissue. Our results reflect that a detailed investigation is warranted regarding the toxicity potential of PD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parallel phenotypic evolution, the independent evolution of the same trait in closely related lineages, is interesting because it tells us about the contribution of natural selection to phenotypic evolution. Haldane and others have proposed that parallel evolution also results from a second process, the similarly biased production of genetic variation in close relatives, an idea that has received few tests. We suggest that influence of shared genetic biases should be detectable by the disproportionate use of the same genes in independent instances of parallel phenotypic evolution. We show how progress in testing this prediction can be made through simple tests of parallel inheritance of genetic differences: similar additive, dominance, and epistasis components in analysis of line means and similar effective numbers of loci. We demonstrate parallel inheritance in two traits, lateral plate number and body shape, in two lineages of threespine stickleback that have adapted independently to freshwater streams on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean. Notably, reduction of plate number in freshwater involves a substitution at the same major locus in both lineages. Our results represent only a first step in the study of the genetics of parallel phenotypic evolution in sticklebacks. Nevertheless, we have shown how such studies can be employed to test the genetic hypothesis of parallel evolution and how study of parallel evolution might yield insights into the roles of both selection and genetic constraint in phenotypic evolution.

AB  - Azoxystrobin, a strobilurin widely used to control rice diseases, has raised concerns about possible adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. At present, very little is known about the effects of azoxystrobin on courtship and aggressive behavior and the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, after exposing adult male and female zebrafish to worst-case scenario concentrations of azoxystrobin (0, 2 mu g/L, 20 mu g/L, and 200 mu g/L) for 42 d, we observed a decrease in courtship behavior and an increase in aggressive behavior in both male and female zebrafish. In addition, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the behavioral effects of azoxystrobin, we quantified the changes in the concentrations of kisspeptin, 5-HT, GnIH, and their corresponding receptor mRNA expression in the brain. The results showed that 200 mu g/L azoxystrobin decreased the concentrations of kisspeptin and increased the concentration of GnIH in both male and female zebrafish brain. In addition, azoxystrobin also significantly reduced 5-HT concentration in female zebrafish brain. Further investigation revealed that altered courtship and aggressive behavior were associated with the expression levels of genes (kiss1, kiss2, gnrh3, gnrhr3, 5ht1a, and 5ht2a) involved in kisspeptin-GnIH signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study suggested that azoxystrobin may impair courtship and aggressive behavior in zebrafish by interfering with the kisspeptin-GnIH signaling pathway, which may have more profound effects on natural zebrafish populations.

AB  - As an important organophosphate flame retardant, tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP) is ubiquitous in the environment leading to inevitable human exposure. However, there is a paucity of information regarding its acute/chronic effects on obesity, lipid homeostasis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, especially regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms in humans. Herein, we investigated the effects of TCPP exposure (5-25 mg/L) on lipid homeostasis in larval and adult zebrafish (Dania rerio). TCPP exposure caused remarkable lipid-metabolism dysfunction, which was reflected in obesity and excessive lipid accumulation in zebrafish liver. Mechanistically, TCPP induced the over-expression of adipogenesis genes and suppressed the expression of fatty-acid beta-oxidation genes. Consequently, excess lipid synthesis and deficient expenditure triggered oxidative damage and an inflammation response by disrupting the antioxidant system and over-expressing proinflammatory cytokine. Based on high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we found that TCPP exposure led to enrichment of several pathways involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation, as well as several genes related to pathways of cancer. Notably, increasing expressions of Ki-67 and 53BP1 proteins, which are reliable biomarkers for recognition and risk prediction of cellular proliferation in cancer cells, were observed in liver tissues of adult zebrafish. These results imply that chronic TCPP exposure triggers a potential risk of hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC) progression. Collectively, these findings offer new insights into our mechanistic understanding for the health effects of organophosphorus flame retardants on humans.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF), an organophosphate widely applied in agriculture and aquaculture, induces oxidative stress due to free-radical generation and changes in the antioxidant defense system. The present study investigated the short-term effect of CPF exposure on the oxidative and antioxidant systems and their recovery responses in metabolically active tissues (gills, hepatopancreas [HP], and leg muscle) of freshwater crab Barytelphusa guerini. Crabs were exposed to a sublethal concentration of CPF (0.07 mg L-1) for a total of 8 days (at intervals of 1, 2, 4, and 8 days) in clean water. The following oxidative stress markers were measured: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butylcholinesterase (BChE), and ATPase; antioxidants i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione reductase (GR), lipid peroxidation (LPO), conjugating enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and lipid content. CPF exposure led to a significant decrease in the activity of oxidative stress markers as follows: AChE (84 %), BChE (46 %), and gills Na+/K+ ATPase (62 %). At the end of the recovery period, enzyme levels were recovered except in leg muscle. Total lipids and SOD decreased; CAT and LPO levels increased; and GPx, GR, and GST showed tissue-specific activities. Maximum recovery was observed in GPx followed by GR in HP tissue of crab. Nevertheless, these responses apparently grant successful adaptation for survival in a pesticide-extreme environment.

AB  - Aquaponics has the potential to produce sustainable, high-quality food through integration of hydroponics and aquaculture, but its commercialization is stalled by bottlenecks in pest and disease management. We reviewed integrated pest and disease management steps and techniques in hydroponics to qualify as suitable techniques for different aquaponic designs. Non-chemical prophylactic measures are highly proficient for pest and disease prevention in all designs. Still, the use of chemical control methods remains highly complicated for all systems. We simulated 10-20% runoff concentrations of 9 pesticides in the common UVI design and compared them with NOEC, LC50 of fish. Endosulfan seems most toxic with runoff AI (20.7 mu g L-1) exceeding LC50 (10.2 mu g L-1) and NOEC (0.05 mu g L-1). At 20% runoff, most chemical pesticides pose risks in aquaponic systems. Natural pesticides were also discussed as potential alternatives with low acute toxicity to fish, but little is known about their effects on water and bacteria. While insecticides and herbicides are replaceable by well-established commercial biocontrol measures, fungicides and nematicides would still be relevant in aquaponics due to low efficiency of alternatives (e.g. natural enemies, entomopathogenic fungus). Monitoring and cultural control are the first approaches to contain pest population below the action threshold. Biological controls, in general, are adaptable to a larger extent. Further studies are required on how to utilize indigenous microbial community in aquaponics (dominated by Proteobacteria; effective at similar to 10(3)-10(9) CFU mL(-1)) as a frontline defence.

AB  - Background: FireMaster (R) 550 (FM 550) is the second most commonly used flame retardant (FR) product in consumer goods and has been detected in household dust samples. However, neurobehavioral effects associated with exposure have not been characterized in detail. We investigated the behavioral effects of FM 550 in zebrafish to facilitate the integration of the cellular and molecular effects of FM 550 with its behavioral consequences. The effects of developmental FM 550 exposure on zebrafish larvae swimming shortly after the end of exposure as well as the persisting effects of this exposure on adolescent behavior were studied. In addition, the acute effects of FM 550 on behavior with exposure during adolescence in zebrafish were studied.
   Methods: Developmental exposure to 0, 0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion spanned 0-5 days post fertilization, with larval testing on day 6 and adolescent testing on days 40-45. Acute adolescent (45 dpf) exposure was to 0, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion, for 24 h, with testing 2 h or 1 week later. The vehicle condition was colony tank water with.0004% (developmental) or .0012% (adolescent) DMSO. Zebrafish behavior was characterized across several domains including learning, social affiliation, sensorimotor function, predator escape, and novel environment exploration.
   Results: Persisting effects of developmental FM 550 exposure included a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in social behavior among all dose groups. Acute FM 550 exposure during adolescence caused hypoactivity and reduced social behavior (p's < 0.05) when the fish were tested 2 h after exposure. These effects were attenuated at the 1 week post exposure testing point
   Discussion: Taken together, these data indicate that FM 550 may cause persisting neurobehavioral alterations to social behavior in the absence of perturbations along other behavioral domains and that developmental exposure is more costly to the organism than acute adolescent exposure.

AB  - In this study, we cloned the Pseudomonas aeruginosa zwf gene, encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD(+)- or NADP(+)-dependent conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate. The predicted zwf gene product is 490 residues, which could form a tetramer with a molecular mass of similar to 220 kDa. G6PDH activity add zwf transcription were maximal in early logarithmic phase when inducing substrates such as glycerol, glucose, or gluconate were abundant. In contrast, both G6PDH activity and zwf transcription plummeted dramatically when bacteria approached stationary phase, when inducing substrate was limiting, or when the organisms were grown in a citrate-, succinate-, or acetate-containing basal salts medium. G6PDH was purified to homogeneity, and its molecular mass,vas estimated to be similar to 220 kDa by size exclusion chromatography. Estimated K-m values of purified G6PDH acting on glucose-6-phosphate, NADP(+), and NAD(+) were 530, 57, and 333 mu M, respectively The specific activities with NAD(+) and NADP(+) were calculated to be 176 and 69 mu mol/min/mg. An isogenic zwf mutant was unable to grow on minimal medium supplemented with mannitol. The mutant also demonstrated increased sensitivity to the redox-active superoxide-generating agent methyl viologen (paraquat). Since one by-product of G6PDH activity is NADPH, the latter data suggest that this cofactor is essential for the activity of enzymes critical in defense against paraquat toxicity.

AB  - In the present study the possible modulation of nonspecific defence mechanisms and specific immune responses after suppression induced by oxytetracycline, oxolinic acid, and lindane - an organochlorine pesticide, were analysed in carp. Modulation was attempted using a natural immunostimulant, dimerized lysozyme (KLP-602, Nika Health Products, USA). Five groups of fish were given intraperitoneal injections of selected doses of the drugs on days 7, 6 and 4 before immunization with Yersinia ruckeri vaccine. At each injection, group I was also given 10 mg kg(-1) oxytetracycline, group II 10 mg kg(-1) oxolinic acid, group III 10 mg kg(-1) lindane, group IV was only immunized, and group V was injected with PBS. The immunostimulant was added in food before and after immunization. The study showed the immunotoxic effects of oxytetracycline, oxolinic acid and lindane; dimerized lysozyme corrected the defence mechanisms suppressed by these drugs and chemicals. The immunostimulatory effects of dimerized lysozyme were better when added before rather than after fish immunization.

AB  - Pendimethalin is a herbicide active substance commonly used in terrestrial agricultural systems and is thus detected at high concentrations in the surface water of several European countries. Previous studies reported several histopathological changes, enzymatic antioxidant modulation and immunity disturbance in fish exposed to this pesticide. The objective of this work was to investigate the direct effects of long-term exposure to environmental concentrations of pendimethalin over a period of 18 months in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) genitors. To do so, an experimental system consisting of eight similar 400 L tanks with a flow-through of fresh river water was used to perform daily chemical contamination. Fish were exposed to 850 ng/L for one hour and the pendimethalin concentration was then gradually diluted during the day to maintain optimal conditions for the fish throughout the experiment and to achieve a mean theoretical exposure level of around 100 ng L-1 per day. Every November, males and females were stripped to collect eggs and sperm and two new first generations of offspring were obtained. Kinetic sampling revealed differences in immune system parameters and antioxidative defences in the contaminated trout compared to the controls, due to pesticide exposure combined with seasonal changes related to gamete maturation. Moreover, reproductive capacity was significantly affected by exposure to the herbicide; a time lag of more than five weeks was observed for egg maturation in contaminated females and high bioconcentrations of pendimethalin were measured in eggs and sperm. Chemical transfer from genitors to offspring via gametes may affect embryo development and negatively impact the early stages of development.

AB  - Florianopolis, a city located in the Santa Catarina State in southern Brazil, is the national leading producer of bivalve mollusks. The quality of bivalve mollusks is closely related to the sanitary conditions of surrounding waters where they are cultivated. Presently, cultivation areas receive large amounts of effluents derived mainly from treated and non-treated domestic, rural, and urban sewage. This contributes to the contamination of mollusks with trace metals, pesticides, other organic compounds, and human pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoan. The aim of this study was to perform a thorough diagnosis of the shellfish growing areas in Florianopolis, on the coast of Santa Catarina. The contamination levels of seawater, sediments, and oysters were evaluated for their microbiological, biochemical, and chemical parameters at five sea sites in Florianopolis, namely three regular oyster cultivation areas (Sites 1, 2, and oyster supplier), a polluted site (Site 3), and a heavily polluted site (Site 4). Samples were evaluated at day zero and after 14 days. Seawater and sediment samples were collected just once, at the end of the experiment. Antioxidant defenses, which may occur in contaminated environments in response to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by organisms, were analyzed in oysters, as well as organic compounds (in oysters and sediment samples) and microbiological contamination (in oysters and seawater samples). The results showed the presence of the following contaminants: fecal coliforms in seawater samples (four sites), human adenovirus (all sites), human noroviruses GI and GII (two sites), Hepatitis A viruses (one site), JC Polyomavirus in an oyster sample from the oyster supplier, Giardia duodenalis cysts, and Cryptosporidium sp oocysts (one site). Among organochlorine pesticides, only DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane) were detected in some sediment and oysters samples in very low levels; site 4 had the highest concentrations of total aliphatic hydrocarbons. PAHs, and linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) found either in oysters or in sediment samples. The major concentration of fecal sterol coprostanol was found at site 4, followed by site 3. After 14 days of allocation in the four selected sites, there was a significant difference in the enzymes analyzed at the monitored spots. The detection of different contaminants in oysters, seawater, and sediment samples in the present study shows the impact untreated or inadequately treated effluents have on coastal areas. These results highlight the need for public investment in adequate wastewater treatment and adequate treatment of oysters, ensuring safe areas for shellfish production as well as healthier bivalve mollusks for consumption.

AB  - Goldfish (Carassius auratus) bred in clean water were transferred into different stations in Taihu Lake for active biomonitoring exposures. The biotransformation enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), the antioxidant defense enzymes catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione content (GSH), and lipoperoxidation (TBARS) and metallothionein (MT) in liver were determined as biomarkers during the field exposure period. At the same time, the contents of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and heavy metals in the surface sediments of biomonitoring sites were measured. The total concentrations of PAHs ranged 378.6-1047.8 mu g kg(-1) dry weight, PCBs ranged 0.76-3.27 mu g kg(-1), OCPs ranged 1.12-3.08 mu g kg(-1), and heavy metal Zn ranged 31.82-85.04 mg kg(-1), Cu ranged 13.04-91.02 mg kg(-1), Ni ranged 4.96-28.66 mg kg(-1), and Pb ranged 9.33-22.44 mg kg(-1). The results indicate that persistent organic pollutants exist mainly in Meiliang Bay, while heavy metals are present mainly in Gong Bay. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) was calculated by combining multiple biomarkers to a single value and used to evaluate the toxically induced stress level of populations in different areas. The results demonstrate that Tuoshan and Mashan in Meiliang Bay as well as Dagongshan in Gong Bay showed higher IBR values compared to the other sites. IBR values were in good agreement with OCP concentrations.

AB  - In recent times, usage of pesticide, herbicides and synthetic fertilizers in farming lands has made the environment worse. The pesticide residues and toxic byproducts from agricultural lands were found to contaminate the aquatic ecosystem. The misuse of synthetic pesticide not only affects the environment, but also affects the health status of aquatic organisms. The organophosphate pesticide pollutants are emerging contaminants, which threatens the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. Monocrotophos (MCP) is an organophosphate insecticide, utilized on crops including rice, maize, sugarcane, cotton, soybeans, groundnuts and vegetables. MCP is hydrophilic in nature and their solubilizing properties reduce the soil sorption which leads to groundwater contamination. The half-life period of MCP is 17-96 and the half-life period of technical grade MCP is 2500 days if held stable at 38 degrees C in a container. MCP causes mild to severe confusion, anxiety, hyper-salivation, convulsion and respiratory distress in mammals as well as aquatic animals. The MCP induced toxicity including survival rate, behavioural changes, reproductive toxicity and genotoxicity in different aquatic species have been discussed in this review. Furthermore, the ultimate aim of this review is to highlight the international regulations, future perspectives and challenges involved in using the MCP.

AB  - Few studies in developmental toxicology have focused on whether early life contaminant exposure affects future susceptibility. Investigations in frogs suggested that early life exposure to a pesticide resulted in higher tolerance to a subsequent challenge. This led to the hypothesis that early-life stage exposures can alter phenotypically plastic traits during development, resulting in induced tolerance. Here, we used Gulf killifish (Fundulus grand's) to test the role of detoxification pathway priming in this inducible tolerance. In frogs, the induced tolerance is present five days after the end of the pre-exposure, but absent after a month. We show that a pre-exposure early in life with carbaryl, induces the activity of cytochrome P450 lA (CYP1A) and increases the ability of pre-exposed groups to metabolize carbaryl, likely because of activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. Embryos pre-exposed to carbaryl had a 350-500% increase in CYP1A activity, threefold greater capacity to metabolize carbaryl and were more tolerant to a lethal challenge five days after the end of pre-exposure. However, ten days later the differences in CYP1A activity, metabolic capacity and tolerance between pre-exposed and control groups were no longer present. Thus, we conclude that the increase in toleranCe observed in pre exposed fish embryos was due to the activation of the AHR and other metabolic pathways, resulting in a prolonged increase in biotransformation capacity. This allowed individuals to more efficiently deal with subsequent chemical challenges for a short period after the initial pre-exposure. However, this induced tolerance was only short-lived due to the recycling of biotransformation enzymes in the cells as part of general cellular protein maintenance. These findings suggest that induced tolerance was likely due to induction of defense mechanisms during the duration of response to the original stressor, rather than a more permanent change in their ability to respond to future challenges.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses an extensive armament of genes involved in oxidative stress defense, including katB-ankB, ahpB, and ahpC-ahpF. Transcription of these genes was regulated in response to H2O2, paraquat, or organic peroxides. Expression of katB-lacZ and the observed KatB catalase levels in P. aeruginosa PAO1 were induced up to 250-fold after exposure to oxidative stress-generating compounds. Also, ahpB-lacZ and ahpC-lacZ expression was 90- and 3-fold higher, respectively, upon exposure to paraquat. The dose- and time-response curves revealed that 1 mu M paraquat was sufficient for half-maximal activation of each reporter fusion within 5 min of exposure. Expression of these genes was not observed in a Delta oxyR mutant, indicating that OxyR was essential for this response. The transcriptional start sites of katB-ankB, ahpB, and ahpC-ahpF were mapped, putative OxyR-binding sites were identified upstream of the -35 promoter elements, and direct binding of purified OxyR protein to these target promoters was demonstrated. The oxyR mutant was hypersusceptible to oxidative stress-generating agents, including H2O2 and paraquat, in spite of total KatA catalase activity being comparable to that of the wild type. The oxyR phenotype was fully complemented by a plasmid containing the oxyR gene, while any of the katB, ahpB, or ahpCF genes alone resulted in only marginal complementation. Increased katB-lacZ expression and higher KatB catalase levels were detected in a Delta ahpCF background compared to wild-type bacteria, suggesting a compensatory function for KatB in the absence of AhpCF. In P. aeruginosa, oxyR is located upstream of recG, encoding a putative DNA repair enzyme. oxyR-lacZ and recG-lacZ reporter activities and oxyR-recG mRNA analysis showed that oxyR and recG are organized in an operon and expressed constitutively with regard to oxidative stress from a single promoter upstream of oxyR. Mutants affected in recG but not oxyR were dramatically impaired in DNA damage repair as measured by sensitivity to UV irradiation. In conclusion, we present evidence that the oxyR-recG locus is essential for oxidative stress defense and for DNA repair.

AB  - In this work, allicin was evaluated as an immunostimulant and antioxidant agent preventing Nile tilapia; Oreochromis niloticus against carbofuran toxicity. Fish (60 +/- 8 g) were allocated to five groups; the first group (control), the second group was fed 1 g/kg allicin-supplemented diets without carbofuran intoxication, the third group exposed to 1/10 LC50 carbofuran (0.246 mg/L). While the fourth, and fifth groups were fed allicin supplemented diet at concentration of 0.5 and 1 g/kg diet, respectively, and exposed to carbofuran at the same concentration similar to the one of the third group. After 30 days, fish exposed to carbofuran showed high ALT, AST, ALP, cholesterol, glucose, cortisol, uric acid, and creatinine levels. However, serum AChE, total proteins, immunoglobulins, and lysozyme activity were markedly (P <= 0.05) reduced in carbofuran exposed tilapia fish. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA) level was significantly increased in liver, and kidneys tissues of carbofuran exposed fish. Whereas, catalase (CAT) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were decreased (P <= 0.05) significantly in both liver, and kidneys tissues after exposure to carbofuran. Interestingly, tilapia fish treated with carbofuran (0.246 mg/L) and fed (0.5 and 1 g/kg diet) allicin in both the 4th & 5th groups, respectively, decreased serum biochemical parameters; and hepatorenal (MDA) levels, as well as increased AChE, immunological profile, and oxidative stress biomarkers. The results suggested that co administration of allicin at the high dose is more capable of improving the biochemical, and immunological parameters, and tissue antioxidant responses of carbofuran treated fish.

AB  - The pesticides originally designed to kill target organisms are dangerous for many other wild species. Since they are applied directly to the environment, they can easily reach the water basins and the topsoil. A dataset of 125 aromatic pesticides with well-expressed aquatic toxicity towards trout was subjected to quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) analysis aimed to establish the relationship between their molecular structure and biological activity. A literature data for LC(50) concentration killing 50% of fish was used. In addition to the standard 2D-QSAR analysis, a comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) analysis considering the electrostatic and steric properties of the molecules was also performed. The CoMFA analysis helped the recognition of the steric interactions as playing an important role for aquatic toxicity. In addition, the transport properties and the stability of the compounds studied were also identified as important for their biological activity.

AB  - Diflubenzuron (DFB) is a larvicide widely used to control Aedes aegypti populations as an alternative to organophosphates (OPs), with a specific mechanism of action for insects by inhibiting their chitin synthesis. However, DFB is used extensively in urban and rural environments, having the aquatic environment as the major receptor. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the toxicity of DFB-based formulation and compare it with the toxicity of the OP temephos (TMP)-based formulation, a larvicide still used to control A. aegypti, on freshwater fishes Oreochromis niloticus and Hyphessobrycon eques. Organisms were submitted to acute (48h) and prolonged (7days) exposures, in the presence and absence of organic sediment, seeking interactions between chemical and sediment. Histopathological analyses were performed on O. niloticus gills and liver. According to 48-h median lethal concentration (LC50), DFB- and TMP-based formulations were classified as harmful and toxic to fish, respectively, following the Globally Harmonized System of Classification (GHS). After prolonged exposure to sublethal concentrations, DFB-based formulation decreased H. eques body weight at concentrations 272-fold lower than its LC50. Ultrastructural responses of O. niloticus indicated edemas and aneurisms on gills, and hepatocyte hypertrophy and vascular congestion of the liver. TMP-based formulation also induced pyknotic nuclei, which may lead to irreversible necrosis. The addition of organic sediment did not alter the larvicide toxicity, suggesting that larvicides remained available to the organisms. Altogether, these results suggest that as an insect-specific pesticide, DFB still induces mortality and tissue damage in fishes; thus, both larvicides pose risks to fishes.

AB  - Regulation of the katB catalase gene in the anaerobic bacterium Bacteroides fragilis was studied, Northern blot hybridization analyses revealed that katB was transcribed as an approximately 1.6-kb monocistronic mRNA. The levels of katB mRNA increased >15-fold when anaerobic, mid-logarithmic-phase cultures were exposed to O-2, O-2 with paraquat, or hydrogen peroxide. Under anaerobic conditions, the low levels of katB mRNA increased in a growth-dependent manner; reaching maximum expression at late logarithmic or early stationary phase, followed by a decrease in stationary phase, Under anaerobic conditions, the expression of katB mRNA was strongly repressed by glucose and to a lesser extent by xylose, However, glucose repression was completely abolished upon exposure to oxygen, The nonfermentable carbon sources fumarate, succinate, acetate, and pyruvate did not significantly affect expression, Phosphate, nitrogen, and hemin limitation did not affect the expression df katB mRNA, suggesting that the nutritional control of katB expression is restricted to carbon and energy sources and not other forms of nutrient limitation. Primer extension analysis revealed that during both oxidative stress and carbon or energy limitation, katB Utilized the same promoter region but transcription initiation occurred at two different nucleotides separated by 3 or 4 bases, Interestingly, a 6-bp inverted repeat sequence present in the katB regulatory region was also observed upstream of the B. fragilis superoxide dismutase gene sod. It is possible that this is a recognition site for a DNA binding protein involved in the regulation of oxidative stress genes in this organism.

AB  - One of the main reasons for the set-back in the urban malaria control programme is the peculiar biobehaviour of the principal urban malaria vector Anopheles stephensi. Certain relevant facts such as incrimination as the vector of malaria, sibling or biological species, resting habitat, manlanding behaviour, seasonal prevalence, blood meal analysis, longevity, parity status, daily survival and mortality rates of adults, breeding habitats and vertical distribution of larvae of An. stephensi have been discussed. Determination of density of the vector using various parameters and their relation to malaria endemicity in an urban situation have been reviewed. An. stephensi has become resistant to DDT, HCH, malathion and propoxur in many places in India. Hence for control source reduction, use of predators such as fish and biolarvicides such as Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis H14 and B. sphaericus, personal protection, i.e., use of appropriate clothing, bed nets, indigenous repellents, etc., information, education and communication (IEC) are to be stressed.

AB  - p-tert-Butylcalix[4]arene 1 reacts with bromoethyl acetate and LiAlH4 to form the p-tert-butyl-tetrakis(2-hydroxyethoxy)calix[4]arene 8 bearing four ethyl-spacers at the lower rim of the calixarene. Reaction of 8 with Et2NSiMe3 leads to the tetrakis-substituted derivative 9. Treatment of 9 with PF2Cl gives the stable tetrakis-fluorophosphite 10 , while the reaction with 2-chloro-1,3,5-trimethyl-1,3,5-triaza-2 sigma(3)lambda(3)-phosphorin-4,6-dione furnishes the tetrakis-substituted molecule 11. When 11 was allowed to react with SO2Cl2 , formation of the tetrakis(2-chloro)ethyl substituted calix[4]arene 13 was observed. All examined calixarene derivatives are exclusively obtained in the cone conformer. Reaction of 11 with dichloro(cyclooctadiene) platinum(II) leads to the symmetrically four-times bridged dimmer 15 , which exhibits a trans orientation of the atoms surrounding the platinum(II) atom and involves all eight phosphorus atoms in the bridges. When 10 was treated with (COD)PtCl2 , the cis intermolecular complex 16 was obtained.

AB  - Recent research has shown that hatchery coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) are vulnerable to the olfactory neurotoxicity caused by copper from urban runoff, pesticide use, and mining activities. To explore the broader application of this data to salmonids living in the wild, we exposed naturally-reared steelhead (O. mykiss) to copper (5 and 20 mu g/L; 3 h) and measured losses in olfactory function via electro-olfactogram (EOG) recordings. Copper exposure disrupted the olfactory responsiveness of steelhead to an amino acid (L-serine) in a dose-dependent manner that was equivalent to previously published data for hatchery coho. Our findings support extrapolation of copper toxicity data across species and from fish raised in hatcheries to fish in the wild. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Industrial and consumer products, such as pesticides, lubricants, and cosmetics, can contain perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). Although many short-chain PFCs have been linked to physiological and behavioral changes in fish, there are limited data on longer-chain PFCs. The objective of this study was to determine the potential impact of perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTeDA) exposure on zebrafish (Danio rerio) during early developmental stages. We measured several endpoints including gene expression, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and locomotor activity in zebrafish. Survival, timing of hatching, and deformity frequency were unaffected by PFTeDA at the concentrations tested (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mu M) over a 7-day exposure period. The expression levels of mitochondrial-related genes (cox1 and mt-nd3) and oxidative stress-related genes (cat, hsp70, and hsp90a) were increased in larval fish with exposure to 10 mu M PFTeDA; however, there was no change in oxidative respiration of embryos (i.e., basal respiration and oligomycin-induced ATP-linked respiration). Reactive oxygen species were reduced in larvae treated with 10 mu M PFTeDA, coinciding with the increased transcription of antioxidant defense genes. Both the visual motor response test and light-dark preference test were conducted on 7 dpf larvae and yielded no significant findings. This study improves current knowledge regarding toxicity mechanisms for longer-chain PFCs such as PFTeDA.

AB  - This study assessed the chronic effects of terbuthylazine-2-hydroxy (T2H), one of the main terbuthylazine deg-radation products, on early life stages of marbled crayfish (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis) by means of mortality, growth rate, early ontogeny, oxidative stress, antioxidant defence and histopathology. The crayfish were exposed to four concentrations of the tested substance as follows: 0.751 mu g/I (environmental concentration), 75, 375 and 750 mu g/I for 62 days. Concentrations over 75 mu g/I caused lower weight compared to the control group. T2H at 750 mu g caused delay in ontogenetic development. Levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and total su-peroxide dismutase activity were significantly (p < 0.01) lower in groups exposed to 375 and 750 mu g/I T2H. Cra-yfish in these treatments also showed alteration of tubular system including disintegration of tubular epithelium with complete loss of structure in some places of hepatopancreas and wall thinning up to disintegration of bran-chial filaments with focal infiltrations of hemocytes. In conclusion, chronic terbuthylazine-2-hydroxy exposure in concentrations up 75 mu g/1 (100 times higher than environmental concentration) affected growth, ontogenetic de-velopment, antioxidant system, caused oxidative stress and pathological changes in hepatopancreas of early life stages of marbled crayfish.

AB  - Chemical exposure during the early life stages of development may have long lasting effects on organisms that are rarely studied. The present work intended to evaluate the effect of embryonic exposure to the pesticide carbaryl on adult fish behavior. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed, for 4 days, to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) plus a control and then kept in standard cultivation conditions until adulthood. A battery of behavioral tests was then performed to assess anxiety-like behavior (locomotor activity, thigmotaxis and novel tank diving test), social behavior, and feeding. Developmental exposure of zebrafish to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl produced important behavioral alterations in the adulthood. Main effects included decreased locomotion/hypoactivity (increase in slow movements and decrease of medium and rapid movements), especially in the light periods. Moreover, spatial pattern also changed: while during dark periods control fish increased activity in the outer zone of the tank, this was not observed in exposed fish. Overall, this demonstrated the importance of life stage exposure, clearly demonstrating long lasting effects of a (chemical) stress event at embryonic stages. This data supports the need of considering this scenario in environmental risk evaluations. Further work should focus on the mechanistic effects of developmental disruption responsible for the effects observed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were widely used as flame retardants until the early 2000s, mainly in home furnishings and electronics. The persistence of PBDEs in the environment leads to continued ubiquitous exposure to low levels, with infants and children experiencing higher exposures than adults. Accumulating evidence suggest that low-level exposures during early life stages can affect brain development and lead to long-term behavioral impairments. We investigated the effects of zebrafish exposure to low doses of the two prominent PBDEs; 2,2',4,4',5,-Pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) and 2,2',4,4',-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), during embryo-development on short- and long-term behavioral endpoints. We included the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) due to its well documented neurotoxicity across species from zebrafish to humans.
   Methods: Zebrafish embryos were exposed to the following individual treatments; 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control); 0.3 mu M CPF; 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mu M BDE-47; 0.003, 0.03, 0.3,1, 3,10, 20 mu M BDE-99 from 5 until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). Low exposure levels were determined as those not causing immediate overt toxicity, and behavior assays were conducted in the low-level range. At 144 hpf the larvae were tested for locomotor activity. At approximately 6 months of age adult zebrafish were tested in a behavioral battery including assays for anxiety-related behavior, sensorimotor response and habituation, social interaction, and predator avoidance.
   Results: In the short-term, larval locomotor activity was reduced in larvae treated with 0.3 mu M CPF and 0.1 mu M BDE-47. BDE-99 treatment caused non-monotonic dose effects, with 0.3 mu M causing hyperactivity and 1 mu M or higher causing hypoactivity. In the long-term, adult anxiety-related behavior was reduced in all treatments as measured in both the novel tank dive test and tap test.
   Discussion: We show that exposure of zebrafish embryos to low concentrations of the brominated flame retardants BDE-47 and BDE-99, and the organophosphate pesticide CPF, caused both short- and long-term behavioral impairments. Interestingly, we also found that at very low exposure concentrations, where there were no visible effects on larval activity, adult behavior was still strongly affected. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biological function of the cholinesterase (ChE) enzymes has been studied since the beginning of the twentieth century. Acetylcholinesterase plays a key role in the modulation of neuromuscular impulse transmission in vertebrates, while in invertebrates pseudo cholinesterases are preeminently represented. During the last 40 years, awareness of the role of ChEs role in regulating non neuromuscular cell-to-cell interactions has been increasing such as the ones occurring during gamete interaction and embryonic development. Moreover, ChE activities are responsible for other relevant biological events, including regulation of the balance between cell proliferation and cell death, as well as the modulation of cell adhesion and cell migration. Understanding the mechanisms of the regulation of these events can help us foresee the possible impact of neurotoxic substances on the environmental and human health.

AB  - Immune cell recruitment is critical step in the inflammatory response and associated diseases. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood in invertebrates. Mesenchyme cells of the starfish larvae, which allowed Metchnikoff to complete his landmark experiments, are important model for analysis of immune cell migration. The present study investigated the role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-an evolutionarily conserved cytokine that is functionally similar to chemokines-in the larvae of the starfish Patiria (Asterina) pectinifera, which were found to possess two orthologs, ApMIF1 and ApMIF2. ApMIF1 and ApMIF2 clustered with mammalian MIF and its homolog D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT), respectively, in the phylogenetic analysis. In contrast to the functional similarity between mammalian MIF and DDT, ApMIF1 knockdown resulted in the excessive recruitment of mesenchyme cells in vivo, whereas ApMIF2 deficiency inhibited the recruitment of these cells to foreign bodies. Mesenchyme cells migrated along a gradient of recombinant ApMIF2 in vitro, whereas recombinant ApMIF1 completely blocked ApMIF2-induced directed migration. Moreover, the expression patterns of ApMIF1 and ApMIF2 messenger RNA in bacteria-challenged mesenchyme cells were consistent with in vivo observations of cell behaviors. These results indicate that ApMIF1 and ApMIF2 act as chemotactic inhibitory and stimulatory factors, respectively, and coordinately regulate mesenchyme cell recruitment during the immune response in starfish larvae. This is the first report describing opposing functions for MIF- and DDT-like molecules. Our findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying immune regulation in invertebrates.

AB  - This paper synthesizes the trophic dynamics of a Canadian arctic marine ecosystem in so far as it is known, using new data on primary production, zooplankton, the bivalve Mya truncata, and arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), as well as literature values for marine mammals and seabirds. The 98 000 km2 region has a high rate of primary production relative to other parts of arctic Canada. About 60 g C.m-2  are fixed annually, of which approximately 90% is contributed by phytoplankton, 10% by ice algae, and 1% by kelp. Phytoplankton production is twofold higher along the south coast of Cornwallis Island than elsewhere in Barrow Strait. Four copepod species, of which Pseudocalanus acuspes is the most important energetically, graze about one-third of the phytoplankton production. Bivalves maintain high biomass but low energy flow, acting as sedimenting agents. Arctic cod is a major component, with 125 000 tonnes being consumed by marine mammals and 23 000 tonnes by seabirds annually. Our hydroacoustic estimate for mean arctic cod density, 0.0022 fish.m-2, is probably too low, partly because we have been unable to quantify dense aggregations of schooling fish. The ecological efficiency of ringed seal is near maximum, with 5% of ringed seal ingestion going to bears and man as seal flesh. The data on total kill and prey consumption in whales and birds is incomplete because they migrate out of the Lancaster Sound region in winter. The food chain is very long, with bears occupying the fifth trophic level; this is reflected by high biomagnification factors for persistent lipophilic pollutants such as PCBs. There are major data gaps for some zooplankton and most of the benthos. as well as for winter populations and energetics. This trophic analysis is therefore incomplete and efficiencies for entire trophic levels cannot be calculated.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. The most toxic PCBs are the non-ortho-substituted ("dioxin-like") congeners that act through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. In humans, perinatal exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is associated with neurodevelopmental toxicity in children. Yet, the full potential for later-life neurobehavioral effects that result from early-life low level exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of developmental exposure to low levels of dioxin-like PCBs on early- and later-life behavioral phenotypes using zebrafish as a model system. We exposed zebrafish embryos to either vehicle (DMSO) or low concentrations of PCB126 (0.3, 0.6, 1.2 nM) for 20 h (4-24 h post fertilization), and then reared them to adulthood in clean water. Locomotor activity was tested at two larval stages (7 and 14 days post fertilization). Adult fish were tested for anxiety-related behavior using the novel tank and shoaling assays. Adult behavioral assays were repeated several times on the same group of fish and effects on intra- and inter-trial habituation were determined. While there was no effect of PCB126 on larval locomotor activity in response to changes in light conditions, developmental exposure to PCB126 resulted in impaired short- and long-term habituation to a novel environment in adult zebrafish. Cyp1a induction was measured as an indicator for AHR activation. Despite high induction at early stages, cyp1a expression was not induced in the brains of developmentally exposed adult fish that showed altered behavior, suggesting that AHR was not activated at this stage. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the zebrafish model in detecting subtle and delayed behavioral effects resulting from developmental exposure to an environmental contaminant.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the apoptosis-related cytotoxic effects and molecular mechanisms of individual isomers of profenofos (PFF) on primary hippocampal neurons at 1.0 to 20mg L-1. The cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) efflux indicated that (-)PFF exposure was associated with more toxic effects than (+)PFF above the concentration of 5mg L-1 (P < 0.5). Flow cytometric results showed that the percentages of apoptotic cells incubated with 20mg L-1 (-)PFF, (+)PFF and rac-PFF for 24h reached 23.4%, 9.2% and 14.2% (P < 0.01), respectively. Hippocampal neurons incubated with (-)PFF, (+)PFF and rac-PFF exhibited a dose-dependent accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and a dose-dependent inhibition of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, implying that the defense system of the tests induces oxidative damage. A statistically significant difference was observed between the two enantiomers at 5mg L-1 and above. Moreover, the results showed that (-)PFF exposure caused a significant loss in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP), an upregulation of Ca2+ and Bax protein expression, a downregulation of Bcl-2 protein expression, and the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in a dose-dependent manner; (+)PFF and rac-PFF exhibited these effects to a lesser degree. All results suggest that PFF induced apoptosis in rat hippocampal neurons via the mitochondria-mediated pathway, and oxidative stress is one of the factors of PFF-induced apoptosis. In addition, (-)PFF appears to play an important role in oxidative stress and apoptosis, indicating that enantioselectivity should be considered when assessing ecotoxicological effects and health risks of chiral pesticides.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of copper-based pesticides (at concentrations of copper of 20, 30, 40 and 70 mu g/l) on one-year-old common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) during 28 days of exposure. Abnormal behaviour was observed in fish exposed to 70 mu g/l from Day 14. Histological alterations were noticed only in liver in the groups exposed to 40 and 70 mu g/l. Significant changes (P < 0.05) in almost all haematological indices were found, especially in the group exposed to the highest concentration of copper (70 mu g/l). Biochemical analysis revealed various significant (P < 0.05) differences among the tested groups. Significant differences in copper tissue concentration (P < 0.05) among groups were found in liver, gills and kidney. Among antioxidative enzymes, significant changes were revealed mainly in catalase and glutathione-S-transferase activity (P < 0.05). In gills, metallothionein content increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the group exposed to the highest copper concentration (70 mu g/l) compared with the other tested groups, including the control. A significant (P < 0.05) change in total glutathione content was recorded in liver and gills, although the reduced/oxidised ratio was not affected. Oxidative damage to lipids increased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing copper concentration in liver and kidney. The results demonstrate the deleterious influence of copper on common carp even at low, environmentally relevant concentrations.

AB  - The effects of Nexide (a.i. gamma-cyhalothrin 60 g L-1) on cumulative mortality, growth indices, and ontogenetic development of embryos and larvae of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) were studied. Levels of oxidative stress parameters glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and lipid peroxidation were determined. Eggs of newly fertilised common carp were exposed to Nexide at concentrations 5, 25, 50, 100, and 250 mu g L-1 (0.3, 1.5, 3, 6, and 15 mu g L-1 gamma- cyhalothrin). All organisms exposed to concentrations higher than 50 mu g L-1 died soon after hatching; at 25 mu g L-1, 95% mortality was recorded. Larvae exposed to 5 mu g L-1 showed significantly lower growth and retarded ontogenetic development compared to control. Histological examination of the livers of larvae from the exposed group revealed dystrophic changes. The value of detoxification enzyme GST of organisms from the exposed group was significantly higher compared to the control and the value of defensive enzyme GPx was significantly lower compared to the control. The results of our investigation confirmed that contamination of aquatic environment by pesticides containing cyhalothrin may impair growth and development of early life stages of carp and cause disbalance of defensive enzymes.

AB  - Several non-specific immune responses of turbot (Scophthalmns maximus L.) were enhanced after the administration of beta-glucans and/or O-antigen of Vibrio damsela. Bactericidal activity of turbot leucocytes varied depending on the bacterial virulence. Whilst no differences in bactericidal activity were observed among treated and untreated fish when a virulent strain of V. damsela was used, leucocytes from glucan plus O-antigen-treated turbot efficiently destroyed an avirulent V. damsela strain. Respiratory burst activity was also increased seven days post-injection in leucocytes from glucan plus O-antigen-treated fish. Lysozyme activity was significantly higher in serum from fish injected with any combination elf immunomodulators (glucan, O-antigen, glucan plus O-antigen) compared with controls.

AB  - Trichlorfon (TCF) is an organophosphate compound used extensively as an anti-parasitic in aquaculture. In this study, we investigated the effects of TCF on the antioxidant defense system, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and stress responses in various tissues of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). C.carpio L. were exposed to different concentrations of TCF (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4 mg L-1) at 25 and 15 degrees C for two weeks (measurements were taken after week 1 and 2). TCF exposure induced significant alterations in antioxidant responses in the gills and the liver. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) increased considerably after TCF exposure, depending on water temperature, whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) levels decreased notably after one and two weeks. Remarkable antioxidant responses were observed in the gills, suggesting the gills were more sensitive to oxidative stress than the liver based on CAT, GST, and GSH levels. Notable increases in MDA levels were observed in the gills and the liver. AChE activity was significantly inhibited in the brain and muscles even at the lowest TCF concentration of 0.5 mg L-1, indicating neurotoxicity following TCF exposure. As a stress indicator, plasma cortisol was significantly elevated following exposure to TCF depending on water temperature, thereby enhancing stress. These results suggest that TCF exposure can induce considerable alterations in antioxidant responses, neurotoxicity, and stress reaction depending on water temperature. The assayed enzymes are potential biomarkers of organophosphate contamination.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between contaminant body burden and the oxidative stress status of the gills and livers of two wild fish species in the Furnas Hydroelectric Power Station (HPS) reservoir (Minas Gerais, Brazil). Gills and livers presented similar pathways of metals and organochlorine bioaccumulation. During June, organochlorines were associated with lipid peroxidation (LPO), indicating oxidative stress due to the inhibition of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. In the most polluted areas, metal concentrations in the liver were associated with metallothionein. During December, contaminants in the gills and liver were associated with catalase activity and LPO. Aldrin/dieldrin was the contaminant most associated with oxidative damage in the livers of both species. This integrated approach shed light on the relationship between adverse biological effects and bioaccumulation of contaminants inputted by intensive agricultural practices and proved to be a suitable tool for assessing the environmental quality of man-made reservoirs.

AB  - Reproductive behaviour of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) from an anadromous stock was Studied in a large stream water aquarium. Four adult males and two ovulated females were placed in the aquarium together with eight mature male parr. Four of the parr were exposed during the previous 4 days to two concentrations (0.1 or 1.0 mu g l(-1)) of the pyrethroid pesticide cypermethrin (a disrupter of olfactory receptor function) and four of the parr to the solvent ethanol. The behaviour of all fish was followed for 24 h and then blood and milt was collected. Exposure to the higher concentration of cypermethrin disturbed the reproductive behaviour of the parr. They displayed fewer courting events, spent less time near the nesting females and had lower volumes of strippable milt. They also had significantly lower amounts of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) in the blood plasma than the control roup. The higher cypermethrin group also had significantly lower levels of all these variables than the 9 lower cypermethrin group, apart from strippable milt that showed no significant differences between two groups. No significant differences in non-reproductive behaviours were observed between any of the groups. In the control fish, there were significant positive Correlations between (a) the number of courting events and the amount of time spent near the female, (b) blood plasma levels of 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta-P) and time spent near the female and (c) plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P and the number of courting events. Further, in control fish, higher plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P were observed in part-interacting with a female compared to those with no female contacts. A priming experiment confirmed a previous study that cypermethrin damages olfactory reception. Parr exposed to cypermethrin had significantly lower blood plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P and 11-KT than control males after exposure to ovarian fluid and urine (known to contain reproductive priming pheromones). When ethanol-exposed males were exposed to ovarian fluid and urine they had significantly higher plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P compared to those exposed to water only. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Effects of the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin (LCH) were investigated in matrinxa Brycon amazonicus, a non-target freshwater teleost. The fish were submitted to a single-pulse exposure (10% of LC50; 96h, 0.65gL(-1)), followed by 7days of recovery in clean water. Hematologic parameters indicated impairments in oxygen transport, which were not recovered. Plasma [Na+], [Cl-], and protein were diminished, and only [Na+] remained low after recovery. Gill Na+/K(+)ATPase activity was increased and recovered to basal values. Brain acetylcholinesterase activity was not responsive to LCH. Liver ascorbic acid concentration was not altered, and reduced glutathione levels remained augmented even after recovery. LCH inhibited hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, while glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activities were steady. After recovery, SOD remained low, and GPx was augmented. Liver depicted lipid peroxidation, which was not observed after recovery. Hepatic morphology was affected by LCH and was not completely recovered. These responses, combined with the persistence of changes even after recovery span, clearly show the feasibility of these biomarkers in evaluating LCH toxic potential to non-target organisms, highlighting the importance of pyrethroids' responsible use.

A variety of pesticides have direct effects on retinoic acid (RA) signaling and as RA signaling has important roles in neurodevelopment, such compounds may cause developmental neurotoxicity through an overlapping adverse outcome pathway. It is hypothesized that a pesticide's embryonic effects on retinoid function may correspond with neurobehavioral disruption later in development. In the current studies, we determined the effects of RA-acting pesticides on neurobehavioral development in zebrafish. Buprofezin and imazalil caused generalized hypoactivity in the larval motility test, whereas chlorothalonil and endosulfan I led to selective hypoactivity and hyperactivity, respectively. With buprofezin, chlorothalonil, and imazalil, hypoactivity and/or novel anxiety-like behaviors persisted in adulthood and buprofezin additionally decreased social attraction responses in adulthood. Endosulfan I did not produce significant adult behavioral effects. Using qPCR analyses of adult brain tissue, we observed treatment-induced alterations in RA synthesis or catabolic genes, indicating persistent changes in RA homeostasis. These changes were compound-specific, with respect to expression directionality, and potential patterns of homeostatic disruption. Results suggest the likely persistence of disruptions in RA signaling well into adulthood and may represent compensatory mechanisms following early life stage exposures. This study demonstrates that early developmental exposure to environmental toxicants that interfere with RA signaling causes short as well as long-term behavioral disruption in a well-established zebrafish behavioral model and expand upon the meaning of the RA adverse outcome pathway, indicating that observed effects likely correspond with the nature of underlying homeostatic effects.

AB  - In teleost fish, radial glial cells (RGCs) are progenitor cells for neurons and the major cell type synthesizing neuroestrogens. We hypothesized that chemical exposure impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics of RGCs, which then may lead to downstream consequences for neuroestrogen production. Here we provide proof of concept that mitochondria of RGCs can be perturbed by fungicides. We isolated RGCs from a mixed sex population of goldfish (Carassius auratus) and measured metabolic capacity of primary cells to a model mitotoxin fluazinam, a broad-spectrum fungicide that inhibits mitochondria electron transport chain (or ETC) Complex I. Using immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR, we demonstrate that the goldfish primary cell cultures are highly enriched for glia after multiple passages. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that glia treated with >25 mu M fluazinam for 24 and 48-h showed reduced viability. As such, metabolic assays were conducted with non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.25-12.5 mu M). Fluazinam did not affect oxygen consumption rates of RGCs at 24 h, but after 48 h, oligomycin induced ATP-linked respiration was decreased by both 6.25 and 12.5 mu M fluazinam. Moreover, concentrations as low as 0.25 mu M disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential of RGCs, reflecting strong uncoupling effects of the fungicide on mitochondria. Here we provide proof of concept that mitochondrial bioenergetics of teleostean RGCs can be responsive to agrochemicals. Additional studies are required to address low-dose exposures in vivo and to determine if metabolic disruption impairs neuroendocrine functions of RGCs. We propose this mechanism constitutes a novel aspect of neuroendocrine disruption, significant because dysregulation of neuron-glia communication is expected to contribute to neuroendocrine disruption.

AB  - Natural and anthropogenic disturbances cause profound alterations in organisms, inducing physiological adjustments to avoid, reduce, or remedy the impact of disturbances. In vertebrates, the stress response is regulated via neuroendocrine pathways, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis that regulates the secretion of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids have cascading effects on multiple physiological pathways, affecting the metabolic rate, reactive oxygen species production, or immune system. Determining the extent to which natural and anthropogenic environmental factors induce stress responses in vertebrates is of great importance in ecology and conservation biology. Here we study the physiological stress response in spadefoot toad tadpoles (Pelobates cultripes) against three levels of a series of natural and anthropogenic stressors common to many aquatic systems: salinity (0, 6, and 9 ppt), herbicide (0, 1, and 2 mg/L acid equivalent of glyphosate), water acidity (pH 4.5, 7.0, and 9.5), predators (absent, native, and invasive), and temperature (217, 257, and 29 degrees C). The physiological stress response was assessed examining corticosterone levels, standard metabolic rate, activity of antioxidant enzymes, oxidative cellular damage in lipids, and immunological status. We found that common stressors substantially altered the physiological state of tadpoles. In particular, salinity and herbicides cause dramatic physiological changes in tadpoles. Moreover, tadpoles reduced corticosterone levels in the presence of natural predators but did not do so against invasive predators, indicating a lack of innate recognition. Corticosterone and the antioxidant enzyme glutathione reductase were the most sensitive parameters to stress in this study. Anthropogenic perturbations of aquatic systems pose serious threats to larval amphibians even at nonlethal concentrations, judging from the marked physiological stress responses generated, and reveal the importance of incorporating physiological information onto conservation, ecological, and evolutionary studies.

AB  - This research compared the results of laboratory and mesocosm studies to determine the effectiveness of using behavioral measures of sublethal exposure to define environmental concentration ranges that are protective of free-ranging populations of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) exposed to the organophophate insecticide fonofos. Thirty-day laboratory chronic studies were conducted to determine the relative sensitivity of standard (e.g. survival and growth) and non-standard behavioral (e.g. swimming capacity, feeding efficiency, and aggression) endpoints in predicting concentrations of fonofos protective of bluegill growth and survival. The lowest observable effect concentration (LOECs) for the standard measures of survival and growth was 5.6 mu g/L. Two behavioral endpoints were of similar sensitivity to the standard measures: swimming capacity, LOEC of 5.6 mu g/L; and prey strike frequency, LOEC of 5.6 mu g/L. However, aggressive interactions were ten-fold more sensitive than swimming or feeding behavior with a LOEC occurring at 0.6 mu g/L. Lab results were compared to an aquatic mesocosm study which exposed adult and juvenile bluegill to a 9.41 mu g/L concentration of fonofos. The dissipation half-life of fonofos was 5 days in 0.1 hectare aquatic mesocosms. Significant mortality among caged bluegill occurred within 4 days of exposure at 9.41 mu g/L. However, the 9.41 mu g/L concentration of fonofos had no statistically significant effects on survival, growth, reproduction, or total biomass of free-ranging populations of bluegill. We conclude from these studies that laboratory data can accurately estimate concentrations that are Lethal in the field and that the use of behavioral endpoints can provide ecologically relevant, yet conservative estimates of concentrations that are protective of field populations.

AB  - Beta-cypermethrin (beta-CYP) is a widely used pyrethroid pesticide, the extensive application of which may potentially cause damage to non-target organisms. To investigate the effect of beta-CYP on the antioxidant system of aquatic animals, adult zebrafish were exposed to environmentally relevant dosages (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mu g/L) of beta-CYP. The activities of four antioxidant enzymes in zebrafish liver and brain tissue were tested after 7, 15 and 30days of exposure. Our results showed that exposure of beta-CYP could induce different levels of increase in hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities at 7 and 15days post exposure (dpe), but caused apparent inhibition of hepatic SOD, GR and GPx activities at 30dpe. Unlike in liver tissue, SOD and CAT activities in zebrafish brain did not show any apparent response to beta-CYP during the whole treatment period. In addition, increased brain GPx activities were observed at 7 and 30dpe.

AB  - Concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PCBs and PBDEs were measured in 56 egg samples collected from waterbirds of different species (Great Egret, Little Egret, Night Heron and Chinese Pond Heron) from different regions of Hong Kong (Ho Sheung Heung, Mai Po Village and Mai Po Lung Village) during 2000 and 2006. Dominance of 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF indicates a signature associated with commercial usage of PCBs. Although no significant variations were observed within- and between-site in the levels of PCDD/Fs, coplanar PCBs and PBDEs, the concentrations of coplanar PCBs were much higher than PCDD/Fs. Similarity in composition profiles of PCDD/F and coplanar PCBs from different egretries is possibly associated with non-point sources of these contaminants to Hong Kong. Predominant accumulation of BDE-47, BDE-99 and BDE-100 suggested the penta-BDE technical mixtures usage in Hong Kong and its vicinity. Toxic equivalency and Monte Carlo simulation technique showed potential risks on waterbirds due to their exposure to PCDD/Fs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is known that pesticides such as abamectin (ABA) present cytotoxic effects on target organisms; however, the effects from ABA on non-target organisms such as amphibians are poorly understood. The aim of the current study is to investigate whether the exposure of Lithobates catesbeianus tadpoles to different abamectin concentrations [12.5, 25, and 50% of the median lethal concentration (LC50)] leads to behavioral and morphological changes and/or generates possible cytotoxic effects. The aggregation test showed that tadpoles exposed to the highest ABA concentrations did not respond to the stimulus from non-familial and unrelated co-specific species. On the other hand, there was no difference in the total number of crossings in the central line of the herein adopted apparatus between groups; it suggests that ABA did not affect animal locomotion in the aforementioned test, although changes in the normal swimming pattern of tadpoles exposed to the pesticide were recorded in the swimming activity test. In addition, the herein exposed animals did not respond to the predatory stimulus in the antipredator response test; this result suggests defensive response deficit caused by the pesticide. With respect to their oral morphology, tadpoles exposed to ABA presented the lowest scores for mandibular pigmentation and structures, as well as for dentition condition. Finally, it was possible seeing that the exposure to ABA, even at the lowest concentration (12.5% of the LC50), resulted in nuclear changes in the erythrocytes of the animals; these changes became evident in the increased number of micronuclei and in other nuclear abnormalities. Thus, besides confirming the cytotoxic potential of ABA in amphibians, the current study corroborates the hypothesis that the exposure to the herein investigated pesticide leads to behavioral and morphological changes in tadpoles, fact that may negatively reflect on the survival, as well as on natural populations of these individuals.

AB  - The Ligands 4,6-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)pyrimidine (bpzpm) and 4,6-bis(4-methylpyrazol-1-yl)pyrimidine (Me-bpzpm) were synthesized and their reactions with some palladium derivatives explored. Mononuclear or dinuclear neutral or cationic complexes were obtained by reaction of the ligands with 1 or 2 equiv of Pd(C6XF4)(2)(cod) (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene; X = F, H) or the palladium fragment [Pd(eta(3)-2-Me-C3H4)(S)(2)](+) (S = acetone). The reaction of the dinuclear derivatives with 1 equiv of the respective free ligand immediately led to the regeneration of the mononuclear complexes. Except in the case of the synthesis of [{Pd(C6HF4)(2)}{Pd(C6F5)(2)}(bpzpm)], where two similar metallic groups are present, all attempts to obtain dinuclear asymmetric complexes with two different palladium fragments failed. Instead, the dinuclear symmetric complexes were formed. This result could be considered as an example of molecular recognition with the ligand acting as a ditopic receptor. This behavior is comparable to chemical symbiosis but in this case applied to the ligand rather than to the metal center as occurs normally. The polyfluorophenyl rings are situated on average in a perpendicular orientation with respect to the coordination plane. Their restricted rotation results in several atropoisomers for the complexes with m-C6HF4. Different cross-reaction experiments were carried out, and these showed the mobility of the metallic fragments, with the more difficult process being that involving the more strongly bonded polyfluorophenyl palladium groups. By means of H-1 NMR variable temperature studies, the interconversion of the two isomers of [{Pd(eta(3)-C4H7)}(2)-(bpzpm)]Tf-2 (Tf = CF3SO3) was analyzed. In the case of [{Pd(eta(3)-C4H7)}(bpzpm)]Tf the existence of two processes, an intramolecular apparent allyl rotation and an intermolecular exchange of the allylpalladium fragments, has been demonstrated. Different Delta G(c)(=) values at the coalescence temperatures have also been determined. An X-ray single-crystal analysis was carried out on [{Pd(eta(3)-C4H7)}(2)(bpzpm)]Tf-2, which crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group I2/m, with a = 9.368(2), b = 16.191(3), c = 20.228(6) Angstrom, beta = 101.26(3), and Z = 4. Compound [{Pd(C6HF4)(2)}(bpzpm)] crystallized in the triclinic system, space group P (1) over bar, with a = 8.845(6), b = 12.6609(9), c = 12.826(3) Angstrom, alpha = 8.45(2), beta = 74.36(3), gamma = 89.32(2), and Z = 2.

AB  - Immunostimulants are valuable for the control of fish diseases and may be useful in fish culture. The immunostimulatory effects of glucan, chitin, lactoferrin and levamisole for fish and shrimp have been reported. Nutritional factors such as Vitamins B and C, growth hormone and prolactin have also been reported to be immunostimulators. These immunostimulants mainly facilitate the function of phagocytic cells and increase their bactericidal activities. Several immunostimulants also stimulate the natural killer cells, complement, lysozyme and antibody responses of fish. The activation of these immunological functions is associated with increased protection against infectious disease. Resistance to bacterial pathogens such as Vibrio anguillarum, V. salmonicida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia rukeri and Streptococcus spp. and to parasitic infections such as white spot disease can be increased by administration of immunostimulants, but not to intracellular pathogens such as Renibacterium salmoninarum and Pasteurella piscicida. The most effective method of administration of immunostimulants to fish is by injection. Oral and immersion methods have also been reported, but the efficacy of these methods decreases with long-term administration. Overdoses of several immunostimulants induce immunosuppression in fish. The side effects of immunostimulants have not been well-studied. Growth-promoting activity has been noted in fish or shrimp treated with glucan or lactoferrin. Immunostimulants can overcome immune suppression by sex hormones. Thus, the influence of immunostimulants in mature fish should be studied. In conclusion, immunostimulants can reduce the losses caused by disease in aquaculture; however, they may not be effective against all diseases. For the effective use of immunostimulants, the timing, dosages, method of administration and the physiological condition of fish need to be taken into consideration. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The effects of toxicant exposure on individuals captured in standard environmental risk assessments (ERA) do not necessarily translate proportionally into effects at the population-level. Population models can incorporate population resilience, physiological susceptibility, and likelihood of exposure, and can therefore be employed to extrapolate from individual- to population-level effects in ERA. Here, we present the development of an individual-based model (IBM) for the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and its application in assessing population-level effects of disrupted male breeding behaviour after exposure to the anti-androgenic pesticide, fenitrothion. The stickleback is abundant in marine, brackish, and freshwater systems throughout Europe and their complex breeding strategy makes wild populations potentially vulnerable to the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Modelled population dynamics matched those of a UK field population and the IBM is therefore considered to be representative of a natural population. Literature derived dose-response relationships of fenitrothion-induced disruption of male breeding behaviours were applied in the IBM to assess population-level impacts. The modelled population was exposed to fenitrothion under both continuous (worst-case) and intermittent (realistic) exposure patterns and population recovery was assessed. The results suggest that disruption of male breeding behaviours at the individual-level cause impacts on population abundance under both fenitrothion exposure regimes; however, density-dependent processes can compensate for some of these effects, particularly for an intermittent exposure scenario. Our findings further demonstrate the importance of understanding life-history traits, including reproductive strategies and behaviours, and their density-dependence, when assessing the potential population-level risks of EDCs.

AB  - Background & objectives: In the present study, an attempt was made to find reasons of ineffectiveness of indoor residual spray to interrupt malaria transmission by investigating the behaviour of two variants of Anopheles stepnesi, viz, type form and mysorensis in rural areas of Rajasthan, India.
   Methods: Both low malarious (DDT spray from 1958 to 1976) and high malarious (DDT spray from 1958 to April 2006) villages were selected for the study in Arid zone district Jodhpur, Rajasthan during March-April 2006. Resting behaviour of the species during all its movement rhythms covering 24 h period related to: (i) swarming/mating; (ii) pre- and post-biting rest; (iii) after feed resting between hoping movements; (iv) night and day time resting and; (v) diel activity movements in response to temperature changes, were carried out.
   Results: The results showed that household objects like cupboards, furnitures, hanging clothes, goods stacked on loft, stored clothes, cobwebs and floor were the dominant resting sites both in sprayed and unsprayed villages. About 95 and 97% of An. stephensi preferred to rest on household objects of unsprayed and sprayed villages respectively. There was no significant difference in resting behaviour of the species in both groups of villages (p >0.05). The pre-biting resting time was recorded as 5 to 15 min whereas post-biting resting time lasted for 15 to 25 min. After biting outdoor (in courtyard open to sky) species starts entering the rooms at around 2330 hrs. It was observed that during III quarter (0100 to 0400 hrs) maximum species entered into the room were 56% in unsprayed and 62% in sprayed villages. Statistically there was no significant difference in the entry of mosquitoes (p >0.05) in both the groups of villages.
   Conclusion: Before DDT era, An. stephensi was found resting at all heights of the walls inside the human dwellings. Present study revealed that An. stephensi is trying to avoid sprayable surfaces and tend to rest on unsprayable surfaces during all its movement rhythms starting from swarming, pre-/post-biting and during hopping movements in the courtyard and thereafter household objects inside the room as final day time resting. It was concluded that changed behaviour of resting of An. stephensi on unsprayable objects in sprayed rooms largely accounted for failure of malaria control. Control of An. stephensi, thus requires an integrated vector control strategy based upon interesectoral, environmental, larviciding with chemical/biolarvicide and use of larvivorous fish wherever feasible. Such a control strategy offers cost-effective and sustainable option than indoor residual spray.

AB  - Methionine presents a pivotal role in the regulation of many cellular events with crucial impact on the immune system, such as in processes involved in the control of inflammation and polyaminas synthesis. Accordingly, the present study aimed to assess the modulatory effects of dietary methionine on the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) immune status, inflammatory response and disease resistance to Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp). For this purpose, fish were randomly distributed in three independent groups (three replicates per group) and each was fed the corresponding diet: a control diet (CTRL) formulated to meet the established amino acid requirements for the species; a diet supplemented with methionine at 0.5% of feed weight relative to the CTRL diet (8.2% of methionine concentration above CTRL); and one supplemented with methionine at 1% of feed weight to the CTRL diet (11.8% of methionine concentration above CTRL). To evaluate the immune status of fish fed with each of the diets before being submitted to bacterial infection fish were sampled from each group at 2 and 4 weeks after the beginning of feeding. Non-sampled fish were injected intraperitoneally with Phdp (5 x 10(3) cfu/fish) at 4 weeks after initiation of feeding and the inflammatory response (at 4, 24, and 48 h post-infection) and survival (lasting 21 days post-infection) evaluated. Fish hematological profile, peripheral cell dynamics, plasma humoral immune parameters, leucocyte migration to the inflammatory focus and head-kidney gene expression were evaluated. Results show that methionine dietary supplementation improves seabass cellular immune status without evidence of activation of pro-inflammatory mechanisms. Additionally, the observed enhanced immune status provided by methionine supplementation translated into an improved immune response to infection, as higher cellular differentiation/proliferation and recruitment to the inflammatory focus, improved plasma humoral immune parameters and modulation of key immune-related genes was observed. Lastly, after a bacterial challenge, higher survival was observed in fish fed supplemented diets, ultimately corroborating the positive effect of methionine administration for 4 weeks in the cellular immune status.

AB  - Our objectives were to measure concentrations of seven trace elements and 14 organochlorine compounds in sediment and biota of the shoalgrass (Halodule wrightii) community of the lower Laguna Madre of south Texas and to determine whether chemicals associated with agriculture (e.g. mercury, arsenic, selenium, organochlorine pesticides) were highest near agricultural drainages. Arsenic, mercury, selenium, lead, cadmium, and organochlorines were generally at background concentrations throughout the lower Laguna Madre. Nickel and chromium concentrations were exceptionally high in shrimp and pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides), which is difficult to explain because of no known anthropogenic sources for these trace elements. For sediment and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), mercury was highest near agricultural drainages. Also, DDE was more frequently detected in blue crabs near agricultural drainages than farther away. In contrast, selenium concentrations did not differ among collecting sites and arsenic concentrations were lowest in shoalgrass, blue crabs, and brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus) near agricultural drainages.

AB  - In the Sacramento Valley (California, USA), rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields are an economically important crop and productive habitats for the mosquito species Culex tarsalis and Anopheles freeborni. Since 2010, approximately 150 km(2) of conventional and 16 km(2) of organic rice have been grown in Sacramento and Yolo Counties. These fields are often within mosquito flight-range of both rural towns and urban centers. Culex tarsalis are highly competent vectors of West Nile virus, and An. freeborni are aggressive, mammalophagic, nuisance biters. The Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District provides mosquito control for the two counties in its jurisdiction. The principles of Integrated Pest Management are used to control mosquitoes in rice growing areas, relying upon a range of surveillance and control interventions. Larvae are controlled by limiting habitats that enable development of immature mosquitoes while balancing agricultural and wildlife needs, applying larvicides, and the use of Gambusia affinis (mosquitofish). Adult mosquitoes are controlled by ultra-low volume pesticide applications. The program was assessed for larval and adult mosquito control efficacy and areas of programmatic improvement identified. Because rice fields are productive habitats for mosquitoes, complete elimination of the habitat is not a feasible goal, thus efforts are aimed at interrupting disease transmission and reducing the number of mosquitoes that traverse into populated areas.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of synthetic, lipophilic organochlorines that were banned due to their impacts on human and wildlife health and environmental persistence. Although banned, the continued release from pre-banned products allows them to persist at toxic levels in the environment. This is especially the case in lipid rich food webs of the Arctic, where PCBs accumulate due to both long-range atmospheric transport and locally contaminated sites such as formerly used defense (FUD) sites. At the request of the leadership of the Qawalangin Tribe of Unalaska Island in the Aleutian Archipelago, we analyzed PCB concentrations in samples of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and subsistence foods (i.e., salmonid species and blue mussels [Mytilus edulis]) collected at both FUD and non-FUD sites. PCBs were extracted from samples using a QuEChERS method. The mean PCB concentrations across all mussel samples was 6.1 ppb; mussels from FUD sites had nearly double the PCB concentrations (7.6 ppb) compared to non-military sites (3.9 ppb), and at two FUD sites the PCB concentrations exceeded safe consumption guidelines. The mean total PCB concentration for fish was 2.8 ppb; fish PCB concentrations were higher at FUD sites (3.2 ppb) compared to non-military sites (1.2 ppb). These results support the need to remediate the FUD sites of "Building 551/T Dock to Airport" and "Delta Western". More generally, these results provide further evidence of the continued problem of PCB contamination at FUD sites in the Arctic, many of which are co-located with indigenous communities.

AB  - A diverse range of chemicals are used in agriculture to increase food production on a large scale, and among them is the use of pesticides such as chlorothalonil, a broad-spectrum fungicide used in the control of foliar fungal diseases. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of chlorothalonil on biochemical biomarkers of oxidative stress in tissues of the fish Danio rerio. To achieve this, animals were exposed for 4 and 7 days, to nominal concentrations of chlorothalonil at 0 mu g/L (DMSO, 0.001%), 0.1 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L, and after the exposure period, the tissues (gills and liver) were removed for biochemical analysis. Antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and enzyme activities, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), were evaluated in both tissues. In addition, the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were also analysed. A significant increase in ROS concentration, ACAP levels, GST and GCL activities and a significant reduction of LPO levels in gills exposed to the highest concentration were observed after 4 days. However, there was a significant reduction of ACAP and CAT activity, as well as a significant increase of GST activity and LPO levels in gills exposed to the lower concentration after 7 days. The liver was less affected, presenting a significant reduction in CAT activity and LPO levels after 4 days. However, a significant increase in SOD activity and LPO levels occurred after 7 days. These results indicate that chlorothalonil, after 4 days, caused activation of the antioxidant defence system in gills of animals exposed to the highest concentration. However, after 7 days, the lowest concentration of this compound caused oxidative stress in this same organ. Also, the results show that gills were more affected than the liver, probably because gills can be involved in chlorothalonil metabolisation. Therefore, it is possible that the liver could be exposed to lower chlorothalonil concentrations or less toxic metabolites due to the metabolism taking place in the gills.

AB  - In aquaculture, regular "inspection" and "applying pesticides" are essential to improving production efficiency and fish disease treatment, but the current aquaculture system does not effectively support these strategies. Therefore, this paper proposes a farming action recognition network (FARnet), which can accurately locate the farmers in the video and detect the actions of "applying pesticides" and "inspection." The dataset was captured and produced by multi-angle cameras, which were consulted with relevant experts. In this network, Coordinate Attention (CA) was used to improve the Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks-tiny (ELAN-tiny) and Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) structures in the YOLOv7-tiny network. The precise implementation methods are as follows: (1) The convolution in ELAN-tiny was replaced with the CA module, and a shortcut was added. (2) A CA module was added to the final layer of the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module. (3) The improved Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks-Coordinate Attention (ELAN-CA) and Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Coordinate Attention (SPP-CA) were used to extract action features and perform feature correction by ADD (Feature fusion by feature map summation) in the backbone. The results demonstrated that the FARnet achieved significantly better detection results than the YOLOv7-tiny network, where mAP@.5 improved by 0.1% from 99.4% to 99.5%, and the mAP@.5:.95 improved by 6.6% from 78.2% to 84.8%. Therefore, the FARnet can effectively detect and identify the "inspection" and "applying pesticides" actions of farmers and provide useful input information for the intelligent management system.

AB  - Artificial reefs are increasingly being promoted as a means to mitigate impacts from human activities in coastal urban areas. Coastal defense structures such as breakwaters are becoming recognized as large-scale artificial reefs that support abundant and diverse marine communities and play important roles in coastal ecology and management. However, there is limited understanding of how substrate materials used to construct artificial reefs or breakwaters can influence the development of habitat-forming benthic organisms. To assess the influence of substrata on coral recruitment and overall benthic community development, we deployed standard-size tiles of materials used in the construction of break-waters and artificial reefs (concrete, gabbro, granite, and sandstone), along with terra-cotta for comparative purposes, at two breakwaters (DDD, PRT) and two natural reef sites (NR1, NR2) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, for one year. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with post-hoc Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to examine differences in coral recruitment among sites and materials. Coral recruitment was highest at the DDD (4.9 +/- 0.5 recruits 100 cm(-2)), while recruitment was low and did not differ among other sites (PRT: 0.1 +/- 0.04, NR1: 0.3 +/- 0.1, NR2: 0.1 +/- 0.03 recruits 100 cm(-2)). There were significant differences in coral recruitment among materials at DDD, where gabbro had higher recruit densities than concrete and sandstone; sandstone also contained less coral recruits than terra-cotta. Variability associated with low coral recruit densities precluded significant differences among materials at other sites. Overall benthic community structure differed more as a result of differences among sites than among substrate materials. Higher community dissimilarity was observed among sites than among material in SIMPER analysis, and significant differences were only observed among sites in ANOSIM. Univariate comparison of the benthos correlated with community differences in NMS ordination also showed significant differences among sites but not material. Overall, these results indicate that site-specific differences in recruitment patterns are more important in determining early benthic community structure and coral recruitment than are differences among substrate material. However, where coral recruitment is high, these results suggest that gabbro should be used preferentially over concrete or sandstone where it is feasible, but that granite may be a suitable alternative where it is the dominant stone. Coral recruitment on terra-cotta was comparable to all materials but sandstone, supporting its continued use in recruitment studies. These results also indicate that using stone amenable to coral recruitment is unlikely to influence the wider benthic community. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Aleutian Archipelago is an isolated arc of over 300 volcanic islands stretching 1,600?km across the interface of the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean. Although remote, some Aleutian Islands were heavily impacted by military activities from World War II until recently and were exposed to anthropogenic contaminants, including mercury (Hg). Mercury is also delivered to these islands via global atmospheric transport, prevailing ocean currents, and biotransport by migratory species. Mercury contamination of freshwater ecosystems is poorly understood in this region. Total Hg (THg) concentrations were measured in threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) collected from eight lakes at Adak Island, an island in the center of the archipelago with a long military history. Mean THg concentrations for fish whole-body homogenates for all lakes ranged from 0.314 to 0.560?mg/kg dry weight. Stickleback collected from seabird-associated lakes had significantly higher concentrations of THg compared to non-seabird lakes, including all military lakes. The d13C stable isotope ratios of stickleback collected from seabird lakes suggest an input of marine-derived nutrients and/or marine-derived Hg. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012; 31: 26472652.

AB  - The multi-xenobiotics resistance (MXR) mechanisms are the first line of defense against toxic substances in aquatic organisms and present great importance in the adaptation related to contaminated environments. Methyl parathion (MP) is a widely used organophosphate pesticide, which has been associated to various toxic effects in organisms. In the present work, we studied the main genes related to efflux transporters in zebrafish liver (ZFL) cells exposed to MP with and without an inhibitor of ABC transporters (verapamil). The results concerning transporters activity showed that the MXR mechanism is activated to detoxify from methyl parathion. The toxic effects of MP on ZFL cells were increased in the presence of the efflux transporter inhibitor, once cell viability was significantly decreased in co-exposure experiments. The combined exposure to MP and the inhibitor caused an increase in gene expression of P-gp1 (Abcbl) and MRP4 (Abcc4), suggesting that these transporters isoforms are associated with MP efflux. In general, the expression of genes related to the antioxidant defense system (ADS) was significantly increased in ZFL cells co-exposed to MP and verapamil. These data provide useful insights for better understanding of MP detoxification mechanism in fish hepatocytes. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Manufacturing and handling of explosives for defence and civilian operations cause widespread environmental contamination. In this study, treatment of wastewater from a HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine) production facility was evaluated by advanced oxidation processes, viz. photolysis (UV), photo-peroxidation (UV/H2O2) and photo-Fenton oxidation (UV/Fenton's reagent). The wastewater sample was highly acidic and was contaminated with HMX, RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5- trinitro-1,3,5-triazine) and nitrated with heavy loads of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrate. During treatment, degradation rate of HMX and RDX and reduction in COD and nitrate levels were monitored. Maximum removal of RDX (99%) and HMX (98%) was achieved under both photo-peroxidation and photo-Fenton oxidation processes in an hour of UV irradiation. Reduction in COD (57.3%) and nitrate content (61.9%) was maximum with photo-Fenton's treatment system, using Fenton's reagent (H2O2/FeSO4) in 1:3 ratio. The photo-oxidation process followed pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. Though the process was efficient in removing high explosives, it was moderate in removing COD and nitrate contents in wastewater.

AB  - The olfactory system, composed of the olfactory organs and the olfactory bulb, allows organisms to interact with their environment and through the detection of odor signals. Olfaction mediates behaviors pivotal for survival, such as feeding, mating, social behavior, and danger assessment. The olfactory organs are directly exposed to the milieu, and thus are particularly vulnerable to damage by environmental pollutants and toxicants, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and surfactants, among others. Given the widespread occurrence of olfactory toxicants, there is a pressing need to understand the effects of these harmful compounds on olfactory function. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a valuable model for studying human physiology, disease, and toxicity. Additionally, the anatomical components of the zebrafish olfactory system are similar to those of other vertebrates, and they present a remarkable degree of regeneration and neuroplasticity, making it an ideal model for the study of regeneration, reorganization and repair mechanisms following olfactory toxicant exposure. In this review, we focus on (1) the anatomical, morphological, and functional organization of the olfactory system of zebrafish; (2) the adverse effects of olfactory toxicants and injury to the olfactory organ; and (3) remodeling and repair neuroplasticity mechanisms following injury and degeneration by olfactory toxicant exposure.

AB  - Environmental concentrations of pharmaceutical residues are often low; nevertheless, they are designed to have biological effects at low doses. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of salicylic acid on the growth and development of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) early life stages with respect to antioxidant defence enzymes. An embryo-larval toxicity test lasting 34 days was performed according to OECD guidelines 210 (Fish, Early-life Stage Toxicity Test). The tested concentrations were 0.004, 0.04, 0.4, 4 and 20 mg/l of salicylic acid.
   Hatching, early ontogeny, and both morphometric and condition characteristics were significantly influenced by subchronic exposure to salicylic acid. Also, changes in antioxidant enzyme activity and an increase in lipid peroxidation were observed. The LOEC value was found to be 0.004 mg/l salicylic acid.
   The results of our study confirm the suggestion that subchronic exposure to salicylic acid at environmental concentrations can have significant effects on aquatic vertebrates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organophosphate (OP) and carbamate pesticides are anticholinesterasic agents also able to alter antioxidant defenses in different organisms. Amphibian larvae are naturally exposed to these pesticides in their aquatic environments located within agricultural areas. We studied the effect of the carbamate carbaryl (CB) and the OP azinphos methyl (AM), compounds extensively used in Northern Patagonian agricultural areas, on reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and the activities of esterases and antioxidant enzymes of the toad Rhinella arenarum larvae. Larvae were exposed 48 h to AM 3 and 6 mg/L or CB 10 and 20 mg/L Cholinesterase and carboxylesterases were strongly inhibited by CB and AM. In insecticide-exposed larvae, carboxylesterases may serve as alternative targets protecting cholinesterase from inhibition. GSH-S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly increased by CB and AM. Superoxide dismutase activity increased in tadpoles exposed to 6 mg/L AM. Conversely, catalase (CAT) was significantly inhibited by both pesticides. GSH levels, GSH reductase and GSH peroxidase activities were not significantly affected by pesticide exposure. GST increase constitutes an important adaptive response to CB and AM exposure, as this enzyme has been related to pesticide tolerance in amphibian larvae. Besides, the ability to sustain GSH levels in spite of CAT inhibition indicates quite a good antioxidant response. In R. arenarum larvae, CAT and GST activities together with esterases could be used as biomarkers of CB and AM exposure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Amino acids regulate key metabolic pathways important to immune responses and their nutritional supply may increase synthesis of immune-related proteins. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation of tryptophan and methionine on European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) cellular and humoral status. The immunomodulatory effects of tryptophan and methionine during an inflammatory insult was also evaluated after intraperitoneal injection with inactivated Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp).
   A practical isonitrogenous (45% crude protein) and isolipidic (16% crude fat) diets was formulated to include fish meal and a blend of plant feedstuffs as protein sources and fish oil as the main lipid source (CRL diet). Two other diets were formulated similar to the control but including L-tryptophan or L-methionine at x2 the requirement level (diets TRP and MET, respectively). European seabass weighing 275 g were fed the experimental diets for a period of 15 days before being sampled (trial 1). Then, fish were subjected to a peritoneal inflammation by intraperitoneally injecting UV killed Phdp (106 colony forming units ml(-1)) and sampled following 4 and 24 h post-injection (trial 2). Fish injected with a saline solution served as control. The haematological profile, peripheral cell dynamics and several plasma immune parameters were determined in trials 1 and 2, whereas cell migration to the inflammatory focus was also determined in trial 2.
   MET positively affected European seabass immune status by improving the peripheral leucocyte response, complement activity and bactericidal capacity, a stronger cellular recruitment to the inflammatory focus, and higher plasma peroxidase and bactericidal activities. TRP also seemed to improve immunostimulation, as there was a trend to augment both cell-mediated immunity and humoral capacity. However, TRP failed to improve an inflammatory response, verified by a decrease in blood phagocyte numbers and lack of immune cells recruitment. In summary, it is confirmed that MET has a pronounced influence on the innate immune response to inflammation, which is more evident than TRP, and raises its potential to incorporate in functional feeds to be used in prophylactic strategies against predictable unfavourable events.

AB  - In an effort to establish biomonitoring programmes for routine and emergency monitoring of littoral marine habitats, organismal responses are examined in two ways: firstly, in controlled, laboratory studies, where the response may be accurately characterized; secondly, in field-collected specimens, with the hope of obtaining evidence regarding disturbances such as the ones caused by anthropogenic pollution. In many cases, there is a gap between the two types of studies, and different species and experimental and/or analytical procedures are used. In a series of recent studies, we have examined responses of field-collected molluscs, and interpreted our findings with respect to pollution. Here, we report a complementary study, in which molluscs collected from reference and polluted sites were exposed to cadmium or DDT under controlled laboratory conditions. Using fluorescent probes and microfluorometry, we examined the effect of these pollutants on paracellular permeability, lysosomal stability and metabolic status of mitochondria. Our findings indicate that molluscs from polluted sites are less affected, showing significantly smaller alterations in all examined parameters. These findings are in line with previous results showing higher levels of activity of cellular defence mechanisms in molluscs collected from polluted sites. Taken together, the results may be used to establish a reliable biomonitoring system. The sensitivity of the suggested methodology is also expected to qualify such a system for early warning.

AB  - The marine environment acts as a sink for diverse anthropogenic pollutants, although the environmental contamination may be non-uniformly distributed. In recent decades, the aquaculture sector has experienced a steady growth postulating as a good alternative for seafood production. However, a social debate exits about the differential level of pollutants in wild and farmed species. This study was designed to evaluate the level of pollutants in a sentinel species: Bogue (Boops boops) associated and non-associated to fish-farm cages. A total of 82 chemical substances were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, including persistent (polychlotobiphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCP5)), semi-persistent (bromodiphenyl ethers (BDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), and emerging pollutants (such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and UV-filters). In general, aquaculture-associated bogues showed lower levels of semi-persistent and emerging pollutants than wild-caught fish, especially when sums were considered. Thus, sum of BDEs was significantly lower in the aquaculture group (p = 0.01). A similar trend was also observed for benzo(a)anthracene, the UV-filter 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate and some OPFRs. In the case of persistent pollutants, the sum of dioxin-like PCBs and sum of DDTs were lower in the group of wild-caught bogues (p = 0.034 and p = 0.003, respectively) than in aquaculture-associated bogues, as previously described for some aquaculture species. Fish feed appear as an important factor in the uptake of such substances suggesting a diet intervention to reduce their levels in the aquaculture products. Another interesting result is that for almost all chemical substances analyzed, bogues captured near sewage outfalls showed the highest levels of pollutants, pointing out the need of stringent measures for wastewater treatment units discharging in coastal areas. On the light of these results, further research in specific farmed and wild fish species in relation to their dietary value and pollutant's levels seems to be mandatory.

AB  - Arguably, bacteriocins deployed in warfare among related bacteria are among the most diverse proteinacous compounds with respect to structure and mode of action. Identification of the first prokaryotic member of the so-called MMBLs (monocot mannose-binding lectins) or GNA (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin) lectin family and discovery of its genus-specific killer activity in the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas has added yet another kind of toxin to this group of allelopathic molecules. This novel feature is reminiscent of the protective function, on the basis of antifungal, insecticidal, nematicidal or antiviral activity, assigned to or proposed for several of the eukaryotic MMBL proteins that are ubiquitously distributed among monocot plants, but also occur in some other plants, fish, sponges, amoebae and fungi. Direct bactericidal activity can also be effected by a C-type lectin, but this is a mammalian protein that limits mucosal colonization by Gram-positive bacteria. The presence of two divergent MMBL domains in the novel bacteriocins raises questions about task distribution between modules and the possible role of carbohydrate binding in the specificity of target strain recognition and killing. Notably, bacteriocin activity was also demonstrated for a hybrid MMBL protein with an accessory protease-like domain. This association with one or more additional modules, often with predicted peptide-hydrolysing or -binding activity, suggests that additional bacteriotoxic proteins may be found among the diverse chimaeric MMBL proteins encoded in prokaryotic genomes. A phylogenetic survey of the bacterial MMBL modules reveals a mosaic pattern of strongly diverged sequences, mainly occurring in soil-dwelling and rhizosphere bacteria, which may reflect a trans-kingdom acquisition of the ancestral genes.

AB  - In bacteria, the defense system deployed to counter oxidative stress is orchestrated by three transcriptional factors, SoxS, SoxR, and OxyR. Although the regulon that these factors control is known in many bacteria, similar data are not available for Klebsiella pneumoniae. To address this data gap, oxidative stress was artificially induced in K. pneumoniae MGH78578 using paraquat and the corresponding oxidative stress regulon recorded using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). The soxS gene was significantly induced during oxidative stress, and a knockout mutant was constructed to explore its functionality. The wild type and mutant were grown in the presence of paraquat and subjected to RNA-seq to elucidate the soxS regulon in K. pneumoniae MGH78578. Genes that are commonly regulated both in the oxidative stress and soxS regulons were identified and denoted as the oxidative SoxS regulon; these included a group of genes specifically regulated by SoxS. Efflux pump-encoding genes and global regulators were identified as part of this regulon. Consequently, the isogenic soxS mutant was found to exhibit a reduction in the minimum bactericidal concentration against tetracycline compared to that of the wild type. Impaired efflux activity, allowing tetracycline to be accumulated in the cytoplasm to bactericidal levels, was further evaluated using a tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP1) accumulation assay. The soxS mutant was also susceptible to tetracycline in vivo in a zebrafish embryo model. We conclude that the soxS gene could be considered a genetic target against which an inhibitor could be developed and used in combinatorial therapy to combat infections associated with multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae.
   IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial resistance is a global health challenge. Few new antibiotics have been developed for use over the years, and preserving the efficacy of existing compounds is an important step to protect public health. This paper describes a study that examines the effects of exogenously induced oxidative stress on K. pneumoniae and uncovers a target that could be useful to harness as a strategy to mitigate resistance.

AB  - In the Upper Valley of Rio Negro and Rio Neuquen in Argentina, agriculture represents the second most important economic activity. Azinphos-methyl has been found in water from this region throughout the year at a maximum concentration of 22.48 mu g L-1 during the application period. Toxicological studies on local non-target species have been performed mostly on vertebrates, while mollusks, which could be more sensitive, have not been studied so far. This work aims to characterize cholinesterase (ChE) and carboxilesterase (CE) activities of Chilina gibbosa, a freshwater gastropod native to southern Argentina and Chile. These enzymes, together with neurotoxicity signals, are evaluated herein after as sensitive biomarkers of exposure to azinphos-methyl at environmentally relevant concentrations. Effects of azinphos-methyl on antioxidant defenses: glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) are also studied in order to complete a set of biomarkers with different sensitivity and specificity, to propose C. gibbosa as a sentinel species. The highest specific activity was obtained with acetylthiocholine as substrate, followed by propionylthiocholine (83% in comparison to acetylthiocholine) and butyrylthiocholine (19%). The lowest K-m and the highest efficiency for ChE were obtained with acetylthiocholine. Regarding CEs activities, a higher efficiency was obtained with p-nitrophenyl butyrate than with p-nitrophenyl acetate. Eserine produced significant inhibition of ChE activity (81% with 0.001 mM and 98% with 1 mM) while iso-OMPA did not produce any significant effect on ChE. Our results show that C. gibbosa ChE is very sensitive to azinphos-methyl (CI50 0.02 mu g L-1) while CEs are inhibited at higher concentrations (CI50 1000 mu g L-1). CEs have been reported to be more sensitive to OPs than ChEs in most of the aquatic invertebrates protecting the organisms from neurotoxic effects. In contrast, C gibbosa, has ChE which are much more sensitive to azinphos-methyl than CEs and shows marked signs of neurotoxicity. Regarding antioxidant defenses, GSH levels were significantly increased by 0.02 and 20 mu g L-1 azinphos-methyl (80 and 103%, respectively), CAT activity was increased 85% only at 0.02 mu g L-1 and SOD and GST did not show any significant response. Since ChE activity, neurotoxicity signs, GSH and CAT are sensitive biomarkers of acute exposure to azinphos-methyl at environmental concentrations C. gibbosa could be included as sentinel species in monitoring programs of pesticide hazard in regions of Argentina and Chile.

AB  - Herbicide use to control aquatic vegetation in southern reservoirs can elicit a wide range of responses and concerns from the fishing community, lake property owners, and the general public. Debates regarding the need to control aquatic plants, how Much vegetation to control and where, and the herbicides chosen can be divisive. This paper will focus on the use patterns and technical features of aquatic herbicides and factors that Should be considered when implementing a herbicide program for aquatic plant management in reservoirs. Both the angling community and general public often have misconceptions regarding herbicide use patterns, plant selectivity and nontarget impacts, and management objectives. There are currently 10 herbicide active ingredients registered for aquatic use. Glyphosate and imazapyr are used strictly for emergent aquatic plant control while copper, endothall, and fluridone are used almost exclusively for submersed plant control. The herbicides diquat, carfentrazone, penoxsulam, triclopyr, and 2,4-D are used for both emergent and submersed plant control. Many of the registered herbicides have been used since the 1950s and 1960s for aquatic plant management. Each compound has unique properties that impact the recommended use rates and use patterns, label restrictions, and plant selectivity. There are also several new herbicides that are Currently being evaluated for aquatic plants. While herbicides are used in a wide variety of aquatic systems, reservoirs often present unique challenges due to high-flow events and vegetation growing in narrow strips along the shoreline or in open flats. Rapid dilution or dispersion of the herbicide from the target area remains a significant technical challenge in reservoirs. The introduction of invasive plants Such as hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata and Eurasian watermilfoil Myriophyllum spicatum has increased the complexity of management decisions. These fast-growing submersed species can be viewed as both beneficial and detrimental to various reservoir systems. While some see these plants as invasive species that require management, others see them as providing valuable habitat in systems with limited native vegetation. Despite both social and environmental challenges, aquatic herbicides continue to provide reliable, relatively rapid results and site-specific aquatic plant management at a wide variety of scales.

AB  - Trichlorfon [TCF] is an organophosphate compound used to eliminate or control a variety of parasites in farmed fish. The physiological and biochemical responses of juvenile Nile tilapia were studied after 96 hours of exposure to TCF. The experiment was conducted randomly with two treatments: control and TCF (0.5 mg L-1). No mortality or changes in hematological profile were recorded for the fish. On the other hand, we found that TCF exposure caused behavioral, metabolic and hormonal changes that modified the response patterns of the immune and enzymatic defense system in muscle and liver tissues. Increased plasma cortisol and glucose combined with the reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle and liver tissue after 96-h of TCF exposure indicates chemical stress. In response to this harmful situation, we observed changes in the immune system that lead to an increased number of leukocytes, thrombocytes, monocytes, lysozyme and leukocyte respiratory burst activity. Furthermore, we associate the increased activity of glutathione-S-transferase in liver tissue as a strategy fish use to combat the effects of TCF. Thus, we conclude that TCF affects the physiologic parameters of Nile tilapia, which can generate irreversible situations of recovery of the clinical condition. Such fact highlights the need to search for new compounds that could replace TCF, that have no or few adverse effects on fish species.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the prevalence and severity of Molar Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) and its relationship with dental caries in public school children in Manaus/AM. Material and Methods: Overall, 2,062 primary school children aged 6-10 years were examined to obtain MIH, DMFT, dmft and DDE indexes. The participation of five schools in each district of the city of Manaus was randomly determined, totaling 40 schools, and in each of them, two classes of each grade of elementary school in two shifts were selected, totaling 10 classes. Clinical examinations were conducted by two previously calibrated examiners in school environment under natural lighting. Data collected were submitted to descriptive statistical analysis by Chi-square, Fisher's Exact and Mann-Whitney tests at 5% significance level. Results: The prevalence of MIH in Manaus was 9.12% and no significant association with gender and age of schoolchildren was found. The mandibular arch was the most affected, with greater number of teeth being affected on the left side. The most frequently affected teeth were the mandibular permanent first molars, followed by maxillary counterparts and maxillary/mandibular central incisors. The most frequent diagnosis was mild MIH. The DMFT of children with MIH was 1.58 and dmft was 2.47, higher than those of the unaffected group. A correlation was found between DDE and MIH. Conclusion: Early diagnosis of MIH is imperative, since children affected show high risk for the development of dental caries.

AB  - Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758), is a highly invasive species that has had profound effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Many Carp management methods have been applied including physical removal, pesticide treatments of whole lakes, and water drawdowns. Herein, we tested key elements of a potential "bait and switch" approach in which corn could be used to induce feeding aggregations of Carp and then switched for corn pellets with a pesticide Antimycin-A (ANT-A) to selectively target the Carp. First, laboratory experiments were used to determine if addition of lethal concentrations of ANT-A to corn pellets deterred Carp from eating corn-based food pellets. Second, a pond experiment tested if a corn-based bait containing ANT-A functioned as a species-specific Carp management tool in a semi-natural emironment with three common native fishes: White Sucker (Catostomus commersonii Lacepede. 1803), Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens, MitchilL 1814), and Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque, 1819). The use of baited sites by Carp and native species was monitored using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Mortality of each species and presence of corn in their digestive tracts was also monitored. Our laboratory experiment showed that presence of ANT-A did not deter Carp from consuming the pellets. The pond experiment showed that only Caip perished in significant numbers once toxic bait was applied. Further, only Carp increased their use of baited sites once baiting began. and only Carp had corn in their digestive tracts. Overall, our results indicate that corn might function as a species-specific Carp attractant in systems of North American Midwest and that corn-based bait can be used to effectively conceal a lethal dose of ANT-A. Further research is necessary to refine this potential management tool, specifically investigating the behavioral and social dynamics of Carp aggregating at sites baited with corn to enhance the temporal and spatial specificity of pesticide application.

AB  - Methods for the regulatory assessment of the bioaccumulation potential of organic chemicals are founded on empirical measurements and mechanistic models of dietary absorption and biomagnification. This study includes a review of the current state of knowledge regarding mechanisms and models of intestinal absorption and biomagnification of organic chemicals in organisms of aquatic and terrestrial food chains and also includes a discussion of the implications of these models for assessing the bioaccumulation potential of organic chemicals. Four mechanistic models, including biomass conversion, digestion or gastrointestinal magnification, micelle-mediated diffusion, and fat-flush diffusion, are evaluated. The models contain many similarities and represent an evolution in understanding of chemical bioaccumulation processes. An important difference between the biomagnification models is whether intestinal absorption of an ingested contaminant occurs solely via passive molecular diffusion through serial resistances or via facilitated diffusion that incorporates an additional advective transport mechanism in parallel (i.e., molecular ferrying within gastrointestinal micelles). This difference has an effect on the selection of physicochemical properties that best anticipate the bioaccumulative potential of commercial chemicals in aquatic and terrestrial food chains. Current regulatory initiatives utilizing K-OW threshold criteria to assess chemical bioaccumulation potential are shown to be unable to identify certain bioaccumulative substances in air-breathing animals. We urge further research on dietary absorption and biomagnification of organic chemicals to develop better models for assessing the bioaccumulative nature of organic chemicals.

AB  - Surface mine lakes are common in parts of the Midwest, but little is known about the communities that inhabit them or the factors shaping them. Our objectives were to: (1) characterize littoral zone macroinvertebrate communities in surface mine lakes; (2) identify factors that influence macroinvertebrate diversity and community structure; and (3) examine the utility of some commonly used bioassessment metrics to assess habitat quality based on macroinvertebrates. Fourteen lakes on a 1133 ha parcel in southern Illinois were sampled in spring 2003 using a dip net that was swept over two (small lakes) or three (large lakes) littoral zone transects. Three hundred macroinvertebrates were randomly removed from each sample and identified. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to examine relationships between several physicochemical and biological variables and macroinvertebrates. Oligochaetes were typically the most abundant taxon, followed by Hyalella, Chironomidae, Physella and Caenis. Seventy percent of the macroinvertebrates collected from the lakes were predators, while collector-gatherers and scrapers constituted 20% and 9%, respectively. Macroinvertebrate richness was positively related to sunfish abundance and macrophyte cover (R-2 = 0.91, P = 0.001). Simpson diversity was positively related to lake area, percent rock and gravel substrates and simazine concentration and negatively related to bank slope and transparency (R-2 = 0.92, P = 0.0003). Richness and diversity metrics, % Oligochaeta, % Chironomidae, % insect taxa and % dominance varied across lakes, while a Hilsenhoff index and the EPT index appeared less useful for biological assessments in these habitats. Results indicate that macroinvertebrate communities in these lakes are typical of littoral habitats in other lentic systems and that macroinvertebrate diversity might be enhanced during creation and management of these systems by manipulating coarse mineral substrates and vegetation.

AB  - Tadpoles detect chemical signals released from predators and conspecifics, as well as those present in the environment, and adjust their behavioral responses. This study evaluated the swimming activity of Dorbigny's Toad (Rhinella dorbignyi (Dumeril and Bibron, 1841)) tadpoles exposed to chemical signals, including cues from a predator fish, the marbled swamp eel (Synbranchus marmoratus Bloch, 1795), and an injured conspecific; sublethal concentration of insecticide cypermethrin; and their combination. Swimming behavior (total distance moved, mean speed, global activity, number of contacts between tadpoles) was evaluated in an individual (1) and groups of different size (3, 5, 7, and 10 tadpoles) using a video-tracking software tool. Predator exposure modified behavioral parameters, reducing encounters with predators and, therefore, mortality. Total distance moved and mean speed increased in trials involving 1 tadpole and 3 interacting tadpoles exposed to injured conspecifics, whereas global activity increased in all group sizes, showing that gregarious tadpoles may be affected by alarm cues and their behavior may be disrupted. The insecticide treatments (alone and combined) increased parameters in all group sizes, causing hyperactivity due to its neurotoxic effect. The different responses observed after exposure to alarm cues and environmental signals in the different group sizes modified the normal behavior and the ecological dynamics of gregarious tadpoles.

AB  - Edwardsiella piscicida is an intracellular pathogenic bacterium accounting for significant losses in farmed fish. Currently, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying E. piscicida-host cross-talk remain obscure. In this study, we revealed that E. piscicida could increase microtubule-associated protein L chain 3 (LC3) puncta in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) monocytes/macrophages and a carp cell line, Epithelioma papulosum cyprini. The autophagic response was confirmed by detecting the colocalization of E. piscicida with LC3-positive autophagosomes and LysoTracker-probed lysosomes in the cells. Moreover, we unveiled the autophagic machinery targeting E. piscicida by which the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptor 1 (NOD1) functioned as an intracellular sensor to interact and recruit autophagy-related gene (ATG) 16L1 to the bacteria. Meanwhile, E. piscicida decreased the mRNA and protein levels of NOD1 and ATG16L1 in an estrogen-related receptora-dependent manner, suggesting a possible mechanism for this bacterium escaping autophagy. Subsequently, we examined the effects of various E. piscicida virulence factors on NOD1 expression and found that two of them, EVPC and ESCB, could reduce NOD1 protein expression via ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, an intrinsic regulator IFN-gamma was found to enhance the colocalization of E. piscicida with NOD1 or autophagosomes, suggesting its involvement in the interaction between autophagy and E. piscicida. Along this line, a short-time treatment of IFN-gamma caused intracellular E. piscicida clearance through an autophagy-dependent mechanism. Collectively, our works demonstrated NOD1-mediated autophagy-E. piscicida dialogues and uncovered the molecular mechanism involving autophagy against intracellular bacteria in fish.

AB  - Nitroreductase (NTR) is an overexpressed enzyme in hypoxic tumor microenvironment that can be a specific recognition site for tumor diagnosis in clinical trials. Therefore, the development of probs for NTR activity with precision and instantaneity is significant. In this work, a NTR probe (ZJ) was constructed on the structure of pyrimidine derivatives with 4-animobenzyl carbamate groups. ZJ exhibited a responsive "turn-on" two-photon excited fluorescence by NTR recognition in cells and in vivo. The 4-nitrobenzyl carbamate groups in ZJ could be reduced by NTR to 4-animobenzyl carbamate groups in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Attributed to its self-immolation property, 4-animobenzyl carbamate would release to generate primary amine on pyrimidine, accompanied by fluorescence signal recovery of ZJ. Such responsive fluorescence turn-on process accomplished as fast as within 20 mins. The favorable stability and specificity of ZJ on NTR activity sensing was further illustrated according to the negligible interference by biological factors and the distinguishing on different NTR types. ZJ successfully visualized the distribution of over-expressed NTR in hypoxic cancer cells and in zebrafish using two-photon fluorescence microscopy, which demonstrated the potential application in studying the relationship between tumor hypoxic microenvironment and cancer.

AB  - 1.  Oxidative stress, potentially, is experienced by all aerobic life when antioxidant defenses are overcome by prooxidant forces, and is the basis of many physiological aberrations.
   2.  Environmental contaminants may enhance oxidative stress in aquatic organisms, e.g. highly elevated rates of idiopathic lesions and neoplasia among fish inhabiting polluted environments is increasingly related to oxidative stress associated with environmental pollution.
   3.  Metabolism of redox cycling xenobiotics in aquatic organisms is very similar to that of mammals suggesting similarities in the health consequences of exposure to such compounds.
   4.  The expression of specific lesions known to arise specifically from oxidative stress, e.g. lipid peroxidation, oxidized bases in DNA and accumulation of lipofuscin pigments are present in many aquatic animals exposed to contaminants.
   5.  Aquatic organisms contain the major antioxidant enzymes SOD, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, albeit there are marked quantitative differences among the various species reported.

AB  - Dichlorvos (2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate, DDVP) is an organophosphorus (OP) insecticide and acaricide extensively used to treat external parasitic infections of farmed fish. In previous studies we have demonstrated the importance of the glutathione (GSH) metabolism in the resistance of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) to thiocarbamate herbicides. The present work studied the effects of the antioxidant and glutathione pro-drug N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) on the survival of a natural population of A. anguilla exposed to a lethal concentration of dichlorvos, focusing on the glutathione metabolism and the enzyme activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and caspase-3 as biomarkers of neurotoxicity and induction of apoptosis, respectively. Fish pre-treated with NAC (I mmol kg(-1), i.p.) and exposed to 1.5 mg l(-1) (the 96-h LC85) of dichlorvos for 96 It in a static-renewal system achieved an increase of the GSH content, GSH/GSSG ratio, hepatic glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutamate:cysteine ligase (GCL), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (gammaGT) activities, which ameliorated the glutathione loss and oxidation, and enzyme inactivation, caused by the OP pesticide. Although NAC-treated fish presented a higher survival and were two-fold less likely to die within the study period of 96 h, Cox proportional hazard models showed that hepatic GSH/GSSG ratio was the best explanatory variable related to survival. Hence, tolerance to a lethal concentration of dichlorvos can be explained by the individual capacity to maintain and improve the hepatic glutathione redox status. Impairment of the,GSH/GSSG ratio can lead to excessive oxidative stress and inhibition of caspase-3-like activity, inducing cell death by necrosis, and, ultimately, resulting in the death of the organism. We therefore propose a reconsideration of the individual effective dose or individual tolerance concept postulated by Gaddum 50 years ago for the log-normal dose-response relationship. In addition, as NAC increased the tolerance to dichlorvos, it could be a potential antidote for OP poisoning, complementary to current treatments. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fish have many non-specific and specific, humoral and cellular mechanisms to resist bacterial diseases. Non-specific humoral factors include growth inhibiting substances, e.g. transferrin and antiproteases; lysins, e.g. lysozyme, C-reactive protein (CRP), bactericidal peptides and most importantly, complement which has lytic, proinflammatory, chemotactic and opsonic activities thus making a link with non-specific phagocyte responses. These are primarily executed by neutrophils and macrophages. The phagocytes contain many hydrolytic enzymes and when stimulated by bacteria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the hydroxyl radical, via generation of superoxide anions and nitric oxide. ROS are highly bactericidal. In addition, the neutrophils possess large quantities of myeloperoxidase (MPO) which generates bactericidal hypohalite ions from halide ions and H2O2. Macrophages can receive MPO from neutrophils and this may enhance their bactericidal activity. Antibody constitutes a specific humoral defence by inhibiting bacterial adherence or invasion of non-phagocytic host cells and neutralising bacterial toxins. Antibody can act as an opsonin and by activating complement by the classical pathway may lyse the bacterial cell, activate inflammation, phagocyte influx and further enhance phagocytosis. Macrophage bactericidal activity can be markedly increased by cytokines released by T lymphocytes on contact with their specific antigen. Pathogenic bacteria have evolved many ways of subverting these defence mechanisms of fish. These include the in vivo production of high affinity iron uptake systems (e.g. siderophores and their surface receptors, in Aeromonas salmonicida, Vibrio anguillarum). Some bacteria e.g. V. anguillarum strains of serotype 01, while being resistant to the alternative pathway of complement activation in normal serum, are killed in immune serum. In other bacteria, surface layers, capsules and elongated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 0-antigens protect against classical complement-mediated killing (e.g. A. salmonicida, Photobacterium piscicida, V. anguillarum serotype 02 respectively). While some important pathogens (e.g. P. piscicide)are readily killed by macrophages, others (A. salmonicida) possess specialised superoxide dismutase and catalase to resist ROS and are toxic themselves to macrophages. Renibacterium salmoninarum uses antibody, complement and other serum components to activate the respiratory burst of macrophages on immediate contact thus exhausting this macrophage bactericidal mechanism before the bacterium is phagocytosed. Subsequently, R, salmoninarum is taken up by the macrophage where it multiplies as an intracellular pathogen. However, these two highly adapted pathogens, A. salmonicida and R. salmoninarum are both killed by activated macrophages indicating that the whole concerted efforts of specific and non-specific, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are required for immunity against these two important pathogens.

AB  - Pyriproxyfen is one of the most used larvicides and insecticides; it acts as an analog of juvenile insect hormone (a growth regulator). It is highly toxic during all stages of mosquito development, suppresses metamorphosis, and interferes in insect reproduction and proliferation. Pyriproxyfen and its main metabolite have been shown to affect brain development in rodents. This compound is employed mainly to eliminate outbreaks of the genusAedes, even in potable water. Despite the increasing number of toxicological studies about larvicides and insecticides-with an indication of continuous use-there have been few studies about the effects of pyriproxyfen in non-target species such as fish. This study evaluated the effects of pyriproxyfen on behavioral, cognitive, and endocrine parameters in zebrafish. We exposed adult zebrafish to different pyriproxyfen (Pestanal(R)) concentrations (0.125, 0.675, and 1.75 mg/l) for 96 h. We analyzed behavioral parameters, memory, cortisol levels, and gene expression of glucocorticoid receptor (gr) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (crf) after pyriproxyfen exposure. This exposure did not alter locomotion (distance or mean speed), anxiety-like behavior (latency to enter to the top zone of the tank or time in the top zone of the tank), and social or aggressive behavior. However, there was impaired inhibitory avoidance memory at all tested pyriproxyfen concentrations. Cortisol levels were reduced in exposed groups when compared to control or vehicle. However,grandcrfgene expression in pyriproxyfen-treated animals were unaltered when compared to control or vehicle groups. Taken together, these findings indicate that pyriproxyfen may induce cognitive impairment and altered cortisol levels in zebrafish, a non-target species.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess selected potentially toxic elements and persistent organic pollutants concentrations in the Shahid Rajaei Dam reservoir as well as their accumulation in barbel and Leuciscus cephalus fish species. The concentration of arsenic, mercury, nickel, chromium and cadmium in all water samples is less than WHO drinking water standard. Chromium shows a higher concentration than WHO standard in both fish species, while nickel and mercury content in barbel fish is higher than WHO standard. The result of principle component analyses indicates an increased elemental concentration due to application of phosphorus fertilizers in the agricultural lands, especially paddy field, ending up to the Tajan River and Shahid Rajaei Dam reservoir. Ni, Co, Mn, Pb and Cr display a quasi-independent behavior within the groups (PC1, PC2 and PC3) reflecting contribution of both geogenic and anthropogenic sources. The concentrations of persistent organic pollutants in all water samples, except M-5 sample, are less than WHO and EPA drinking water standards, while persistent organic pollutants (detected in both fish species) indicate higher contents than those of EPA standard values. Based on carcinogenic health risk value, maximum allowable fish consumption for arsenic is two meals per month. The result of noncarcinogenic health risk of mercury indicates one and three meals consumption per month for barbel and L. cephalus fishes, respectively. The calculation of maximum allowable fish consumption based on carcinogenic health for dieldrin, aHCH, heptachlor epoxide, aDDT and aPCBs reveals monthly meals limitation of both fish species grown in Shahid Rajaei Dam.

AB  - The widespread use of emerging contaminants (ECs) may be compounding the problem of antibiotic resistance. Various non-antibiotic pollutants have been shown to alter bacterial responses to antibiotics and increase horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. ECs include components of medicines, foods, disinfectants, personal care products and agrichemicals. ECs concentrate in some environments such as in wastewater, where the pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms mix. We investigated the effects on antibiotic resistance and gene transfer of nine ECs and one commercial product formulation (Roundup). We used the bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and the antibiotics ampicillin and gentamicin as indicators of the effects of antibiotic-EC co-exposures. We measured intra-(Escherichia coli) and interspecies (E. coli x S. enterica) conjugation frequencies during exposure to ECs. Interestingly, the observed effect could change at different antibiotic concentrations. Exposures to increasing concentrations of ECs was associated with increased conjugative transmission within species, but rarely increased interspecies transmission. We report the first test ever of clotrimazole on AMR and horizontal gene transfer and a newly described effect of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), often used as a solvent for organic compounds.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Cyprodinil, one of the main pyrimidinamine fungicides, has been used to control fungal diseases in plants and vegetables worldwide. Previous studies have investigated the influences of cyprodinil on the developmental and reproductive toxicity of fish. However, it remains unknown whether it affects fish behaviors and the underlying mechanisms. In our current study, zebrafish, an ideal model animal for behavioral studies, were exposed to cyprodinil from fertilization to 240 days postfertilization at 0.1 mu g/L (environmentally relevant concentration) and 1, 10 mu g/L. Firstly, we observed that aggressive behavior of zebrafish was significantly enhanced after exposure to 0.1-10 mu g/L cyprodinil and antipredator behavior was decreased after exposure. Cyprodinil exposure altered the adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels, which regulate cortisol homeostasis and were significantly reduced in all exposure groups (0.1-10 mu g/L). In addition, most of the key genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal gland axis, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone and melanocortin 2 receptor, were downregulated significantly in all exposure groups, which was consistent with the hormone levels. In addition, in the hypothalamus, the number of apoptotic cells increased in a dose-dependent manner in the cyprodinil exposure groups. Moreover, these changes were potentially responsible for the increased aggression of zebrafish during the mirror-like aggressive test and for the reduced antipredator behavior during the predator avoidance test. Overall, the data provided herein further our understanding of cyprodinil toxicity and can be used to assess the ecological effects of cyprodinil on the induction of abnormal behaviors at the environmental level.

AB  - Dicamba (DIC) is one of the most applied auxin herbicides worldwide. Sublethal effects in the South American native fish Jenynsia lineata exposed to DIC concentrations close to environmental concentrations (0.03-30 mu g/L) during 48 h were analysed thorough the evaluation of catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 levels for detecting potential oxidative stress. In gills MDA increased showing oxidative damage probably because of an inefficient antioxidant defense. This response evidenced the important role of gills as an organ of direct contact with waterborne contaminants. In addition, other changes in the biomarkers of oxidative stress were observed such as the inhibition of SOD activities in brain and the inhibition of GST in liver. These results show that short-term exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations of DIC could induce sublethal effects in native fish.

AB  - Two nonionic POEA surfactants (CAS No. 61791-26-2), TA15 and TH30, were tested to establish their acute pathological effects and lethal concentrations (LC50) in Piaractus brachypomus. Both compounds are nonionic surfactants produced by the alkoxylation of ethylene oxide with tallow amine, and they are used in variety of industries such as textiles, paints, metal working, agriculture, and polish manufacture. Fish were exposed to six concentrations of TA15 (0.2-4.0 mg/L) or TH30 (8-140 mg/L) for 96 h. The LC50 for TA15 was 2.08 mg/L and for TH30 47.32 mg/L. The main clinical signs observed in fish exposed to 4 mg/L of TA15 and 32 to 140 mg/L of TH30, were lethargy, loss of shoaling behavior, respiratory distress, changes in swimming pattern, such as, loss of balance and abnormal buoyancy, prolapse of the lower lip and superior location in the water column. The highest concentrations of these compounds induced nervous signs and collapse. The relevant macroscopic lesions were skin and fins erosions with necrotic lysis of the caudal peduncle. In addition, hemorrhages in mouth, branchial arches, and petechial hemorrhages in skin were observed. An increased fluid in the celomic cavity and meningeal hemorrhages were also evident. Organs as gills, liver, brain, and anterior kidney presented severe lesions at the highest concentrations of each compound. For the first time, it is reported lesions in interrenal tissues and choroidal bodies, as well as severe telencephalic lesions associated with the POEA toxicity. These last lesions were more severe in fish exposed to TA15 than to TH30, although the pattern of injuries was similar with both substances. According to the Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemical (GHS) by the United Nations, we reported that TA15 is classified as Acute Category 2 and TH30 is Acute Category 3 for white cachama. Due to the low LC50 and the highly toxic effects of both POEA compounds for neotropical fish, a revision of the regulation of the use of herbicide mixtures by Colombian legislation is necessary.

AB  - In aquaculture, more than one pathogen usually be isolated from the sick fish, creating an urgent need for developing combined vaccines to control fish disease caused by multiple pathogens simultaneously. In our previous work, two live attenuated vaccines against Vibrio anguillarum and Edwardsienn piscicida were vaccinated in turbot, exhibiting an efficient protection. However, some immunological processes such as antigenic competition, antigenic cross-reaction and antigen induced suppression during combined vaccination are unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the combined live vaccines and explored the immunological processes after vaccination. We found that the combined two live attenuated vaccines for V. anguillarum and E. piscicida induced a stronger immune response without existing antigen competition. Instead, a synergistic effect was observed not only for triggering innate immune response but for stimulation of adaptive immunity. Our study suggested that the two combined live vaccines against V. anguillarum and E. piscicida could be used simultaneously in the future.

AB  - The paper deals with the deleterious changes at ultrastructural level of the epithelial cells of gills of Cyprinus carpio communis Linn. upon exposure to 1/10(th) of LC50 of monocrotophos which is considered to be insignificant concentration from toxicological point of view. The gills of the fish are the primary corridor for molecular exchange between the internal milieu of a fish and its environment. Gills perform numerous functions such as oxygen uptake and CO excretion, osmoregulation, acid-basic balance, excretion of nitrogenous compounds and taste. Hazardous chemicals present in water may alter the morphology of the epithelial cells of gills of the fish, which may affect the process of diffusion of gases and ultimately the overall health of the fish. To prove this fact Cyprinus carpio communis Linn. was kept in water for 30 days having low concentration of 0.038 ppm (1\10(th) of LC50) of monocrotophos and an attempt was made to study the different types of degenerations produced in the epithelial cells of gills as compared to the normal epithelial cells of gills of this culturable fish using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) technique. The ultrastructural changes due to the toxic exposure at finerscale were thinning of microridges, upliftment of epithelial cells, development of hyperplasia, decrease in the density of mucous cells which are considered to be the first line of defence and total dystrophy of epithelial tissue. Thus, it is opined that a low concentration of monocrotophos has the potential to bring different type of degenerations at finer scale hence affecting the fish's health drastically and altering the fitness of the fish in water even having insignificant amount of this toxicant in the ambient water.

AB  - Amblydromalus limonicus (Garman & McGregor) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) is a commercially available predator of key pests in protected crops, particularly of thrips and whiteflies. Basic information on the developmental and reproductive performance of the predator as a function of food is largely lacking. In the present study, development, reproduction and growth rates were determined for A. limonicus on four economically important pests: Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), broad mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) (Acari: Tarsonemidae) and two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). The life history traits of females fed on these different target prey were compared with those of females offered Carpoglyphus lactis L. (Acari: Carpoglyphidae), which is the standard food source for mass-producing this predator. Additionally, three commercially available non-prey food sources with potential for use in the mass production or as supplementary food to sustain populations of the predator in the field were tested: the commercial pollen product Nutrimite (consisting of pollen of narrow-leaved cattail, Typha angustifolia L.), frozen eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and frozen eggs of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann (Diptera: Tephritidae). Survival rates of immature A. limonicus were high (>94% survival) on all tested foods except on T. vaporariorum and T. urticae (76.0% and 17.1%, respectively). The fastest development was obtained when mites were fed on T. angustifolia, whereas the longest developmental times were obtained on T. urticae and T. vaporariorum. When females were offered P. latus, no reproduction was observed, despite a high prey consumption in both the juvenile and adult stages. The reproductive performance of A. limonicus fed on T. vaporariorum was significantly lower than that on F. occidentalis. Furthermore, no second generation could be obtained on a diet solely consisting of T. vaporariorum. Population growth rates were highest when A. limonicus was fed on Nutrimite, E. kuehniella or C lactis, and exceeded those on a diet consisting of their natural prey, F. occidentalis. The phytoseiid showed cannibalistic behavior when maintained on E. kuehniella and C. capitata eggs and T. angustifolia pollen, with females consuming their own eggs. The rate of cannibalism was dependent on the food source offered, but always resulted in reduced population growth rates. This cannibalistic behavior should be taken into account when selecting food sources for mass rearing of A. limonicus or supporting its populations in the field. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Fish are often used as models for studies investigating the ability of xenobiotics to induce oxidative stress, though age or developmental stage of the individuals studied has been given little attention. Oxidative stress in other organisms is associated with aging as well as with periods of rapid growth, which occurs in young brown trout. We measured protein carbonyls, 20S proteosome activity and glutathione (GSH) levels in farmed Salmo trutta in four different age groups from 5 months to 3 years. We found an increase in protein carbonyls and a decrease in 20S proteosome activity in both brain and liver tissues of the fish with increasing size and age. Total GSH levels in liver tissue declined as fish aged and the GSSG:GSH ratio increased. Five month and 1 year old trout were treated with paraquat (PQ) to induce oxidative stress. Five month old fish showed no changes in the measured parameters while 1 year old fish had both an increase in protein carbonylation in liver tissue and a decrease in 20S proteosome activity in brain tissue. These results indicate that oxidative stress biomarkers are affected by age or rapid growth in brown trout, and that individuals of different ages respond differently to oxidative stress induced by PQ.

AB  - Abamectin (ABA) toxicity in fish, amphibian and mammals was already proven, but its effect on birds is almost unknown. Thus, the aim of our study is to assess the impact of exposure to water with ABA for 40 days at predicted environmentally relevant concentrations on the behavior of female Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica). The three following experimental groups (n= 10 each) were set: "control", quails exposed to drinking water, without ABA, "EC1x" and "EC1000x" (0.31 mg a. i./L and 310.0 a. i./L, respectively; via commercial formulation Kraft (R) 36EC). The open field test showed anxiolytic response in birds exposed to ABA. These birds did not show locomotor changes or aggressive behavior in the aggressiveness test. Quails exposed to the pesticide did not react to the introduction of an object in the experimental box during the object recognition test, and it suggested perception deficit due to ABA. Moreover, these birds did not recognize the cat (Felix catus) and the vocalization of a hawk (Rupornis magnirostris) as potential predatory threats. These responses also suggest antipredatory behavior deficit due to the pesticide. Thus, our study is pioneer in showing that water with ABA, at tested concentrations, influences the behavior of C. coturnix japonica, as well as in highlighting the potential impacts of this pesticide on this group of birds.

AB  - Three main groups of persistent organic pollutants (POPs); namely organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) were quantified in water and sediment samples, as well as in various invasive and non-invasive samples from waterbirds in the Buyuk Menderes River (BMR). Liver and muscle tissues, blood, and preen gland oil samples of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) and Euroasian coot (Fulica atra) were collected both from the origin (Isikli Lake) and the estuary (Soke) of the river, blood and preen gland oil samples of grey heron (Ardea cinerea) and pelican (Pelecanus crispus) were collected from the estuary only. In addition, non-hatched eggs from several above species and Mediterranean gull (Larus melanocephalus), in either station were collected. In all samples, POP contamination was measured and the potential usefulness of those invasive and non-invasive sampling for biomonitoring was evaluated. Activities of antioxidant enzymes were measured as potential indicators of POP exposure and of changes in the cellular defence. Venous blood proved to be a promising biomonitor for the concentrations in liver and muscle, especially for PCBs. Activities of antioxidant enzymes were correlated with the liver concentrations of several OCP congeners. The measured egg DDE concentrations were below the established threshold concentrations for the risk of hatch and reproductive success. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the role of the clinical pharmacist in the rational use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in a general surgery department. All enrolled patients had attended the general surgery department of a tertiary hospital. This single-center prospective study compared differences in the overall rate of rational PPI use, proportion of unindicated PPI use, utilization rate, average defined daily dose (DDD), drug costs, PPI costs, and cost-effectiveness of clinical pharmacist intervention between the intervention (538 cases) and control (536 cases) groups. In the intervention group, Pareto and fishbone diagram analyses were combined with the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle; Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used for analyzing all data. The overall rate of rational PPI use was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (p < 0.01). The proportion of unindicated PPI use, utilization rate, average DDD, drug costs, and PPI costs were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (p < 0.05). Cost-effectiveness analysis for the overall rate of rational PPI use indicated a positive impact of intervention, with economic benefits in the intervention group. Clinical pharmacist intervention for rational use of PPIs in general surgery departments could significantly increase the overall rate of rational PPI use; it could also reduce the proportion of unindicated PPI use, utilization rates, average DDDs, drug costs, and PPIs costs. Pharmacist intervention also offers economic benefits by improving the overall rate of rational PPI use.

TI  - Uptake and effects of the cypermethrin-containing sea lice treatment Excis® in the marine mussel, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
LA  - English
AB  - Wild and farmed mussels, Mytilus edulis, coexist with salmon farms in Scottish sea lochs. A synthetic pyrethroid, cypermethrin, is licensed for use on fish farms to control sea lice infestations as a formulation called Excis((R)). In this study, uptake of cypermethrin from Exci((R)) exposure is investigated through the use of gas chromatography with mass-spectrometry. The effects of Excis((R)) on mussels are also examined by measuring the neutral red retention time of lysosomes, aerial survival and shell closure. The isomeric ratios of cis:trans cypermethrin measured in mussels are around 80:20; a marked increase from 40:60 to which the mussels were exposed. This is most likely due to preferential metabolism of trans-isomers, as the same response is seen in vertebrates. There is a pronounced behavioural effect of shell closure, where mussels exposed to 1000 mug/l cypermethrin shut their shells within an hour of exposure. Arguments are presented for this effect being either a voluntary response on recognition of cypermethrin, or an effect arising from an involuntary action of cypermethrin on the adductor muscle. Even at 1000 mug/l cypermethrin, neutral red retention time and aerial survival are not affected. The data suggest that the responses of mussels shown here are unlikely to occur in the field, even at the concentrations of cypermethrin used in fish cages, for the treatment of sea lice.

AB  - Objectives The goal of this article is to review a body of research around water contamination conducted in the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation between 1995 and 2016, place these findings in a biocultural context, and consider implications for a human biology of water. Methods This review draws on research projects conducted in partnership with the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation living along the St. Lawrence River as well as published research by others on water contamination at Akwesasne. Quantitative and qualitative methods including toxicological and epidemiological methods, surveys, and ethnographic studies are included. Results Pollution of a river with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) contaminated local fish, a major, traditional, food source. Following health advisories to avoid consuming local fish, consumption and PCB levels decreased. PCB levels were negatively associated with health outcomes. In adolescents, higher PCB levels were associated with advanced sexual maturation in females, reduced testosterone in males and reduced thyroxine levels in young adults. Avoiding fish consumption altered traditional dietary patterns and social interactions, generational transmission of knowledge, and relations between generations, all of which impacted cultural forms and may have added to the perceived injustices in this Native American community. Items substituted for fish may have contributed to increasing rates of obesity as well. Conclusions Water pollution has immediate direct health consequences as well as cultural impacts related to changed food consumption and altered patterns of social interaction.

AB  - Model organisms are often used in biological, medical and environmental research. Among insects, Drosophila melanogaster, Galleria mellonella, Apis mellifera, Bombyx mori, Periplaneta americana, and Locusta migratoria are often used. However, new model organisms still appear. In recent years, an increasing number of insect species has been suggested as model organisms in life sciences research due to their worldwide distribution and environmental significance, the possibility of extrapolating research studies to vertebrates and the relatively low cost of rearing. Beetles are the largest insect order, with their representative - Tribolium castaneum -being the first species with a completely sequenced genome, and seem to be emerging as new potential candidates for model organisms in various studies. Apart from T. castaneum, additional species representing various Coleoptera families, such as Nicrophorus vespilloides, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Coccinella septempunctata, Poecilus cupreus, Tenebrio molitor and many others, have been used. They are increasingly often included in two major research aspects: biomedical and environmental studies. Biomedical studies focus mainly on unraveling mechanisms of basic life processes, such as feeding, neurotransmission or activity of the immune system, as well as on elucidating the mechanism of different diseases (neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, metabolic, or immunological) using beetles as models. Furthermore, pharmacological bioassays for testing novel biologically active substances in beetles have also been developed. It should be emphasized that beetles are a source of compounds with potential antimicrobial and anticancer activity. Environmental-based studies focus mainly on the development and testing of new potential pesticides of both chemical and natural origin. Additionally, beetles are used as food or for their valuable supplements. Different beetle families are also used as bioindicators. Another important research area using beetles as models is behavioral ecology studies, for instance, parental care. In this paper, we review the current knowledge regarding beetles as model organisms and their practical application in various fields of life science.

AB  - Imazapyr (IMY) and imazapic (IMI) are imidazolinone herbicides which have been associated in a commercial formulation (Kifix (R)). To date, there are no studies on the toxicity of an IMY + IMI herbicide in fish. This work aimed to assess the acute toxicity (24 and 96 h) of IMY + IMI (0, 0.488 and 4.88 a) towards Rhamdia quelen through hematological, biochemical, immunological, ionoregulatory and enzymatic indexes. Red blood cell count was lower at 4.88 than at 0.488 pg/L (24 and 96 h); mean corpuscular volume was lower than control at both concentrations (24 h) and at 0.488 mu g/L (96 h); lymphocytes declined at 4.88 mu g/L comparing to control (96 h); and monocytes increased at 4.88 a (96 h) in comparison with the respective control and with 4.88 mu g/L at 24 h. Aspartate aminotransferase was higher at 0.488 mu g/L (96 h) than the respective control and the respective concentration at 24 h; uric acid reduced at 4.88 a comparing with 0.488 mu g/L (96 h); and cortisol was lower at 4.88 a compared to 0.488 mu g/L and control (96 h). Herbicide exposure lowered plasma bactericidal activity at both concentrations (24 h) and at 0.488 a (96 h); and plasma complement activity declined at 4.88 mu g/L comparing with 0.488 mu g/L and control (96 h), and was lower at all concentrations at 96 h than at 24 h. Plasma K+ levels were higher at 4.88 than in the remaining groups (24 and 96 h); and Na+ levels decreased at 4.88 a compared to control (96 h). Na+/K-ATPase and 11-ATPase activities in gills were lower at 4.88 a comparing with control (24 h) and with the respective concentration at 96 h; and AChE activity in brain was higher at 0.488 and 4.88 mu g/L than control (24 h) and the respective concentrations at 96 h, while in muscle it was higher at 0.488 and 4.88 a than control (96 h) and the respective concentrations at 24 h. The present findings demonstrate that, despite IMY + IMI targets the animal-absent AHAS enzyme, such formulation displayed an acute toxic effect upon R. quelen homeostasis by impacting on vital functions such as immune defense, metabolism, ionoregulation and neurotransmission.

AB  - The Suquia River basin (Cordoba, Argentina) is under a strong negative impact due to multiple sources of anthropic pollution. The main goal of our study was to evaluate if variations in the water quality of Suquia river basin affect the reproductive biology of Cnesterodon decemmaculatus and determine if the responses provided by the species can be considered as biomarkers of river quality. This assessment was performed through the measurement of morphological, histological and somatic parameters in adult males collected at four sampling sites during the beginning and the end of the breeding season. The water quality evaluation carried out through the estimation of a water quality index (WQI) and pesticides concentrations in water, revealed a pollution gradient along the studied basin. The same variation pattern was registered for the somatic index. In addition, the analysis of the morphology of the male copulatory organ (gonopodium) showed that individuals collected at Cordoba city had the lowest Gonopodium-Somatic Index (Gonop-SI) value, while those sampled at the most polluted site showed abnormalities in the small structures of the gonopodium. On the other hand, few histological alterations were found in the liver whereas no alterations were found in gonads along the river. The results obtained allowed us to characterize the environmental conditions of the studied basin and demonstrated the water quality deterioration along the Suquia River. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The antibiotic treatment of cartilaginous fish, including Siberian sturgeon, is relatively poorly understood. The lack of research into simultaneous use of antibiotic and immunomodulation in the Acipenseridae has created the need for effective methods of prevention and treatment of the diseases affecting these species, especially in relation to intensive rearing and breeding with adapted technologies. The Siberian sturgeons administered oxytetracycline intraperitoneally @ 100 mg/kg BW and 24 hours post-injection the fish were immersed in lysozyme dimer @ 100 mu g/l water for 30 minutes. The impact of oxytetracycline used together with or separately from lysozyme dimer on the morphology of head kidney in Siberian sturgeon was determined. The results of microscopic evaluation of this organ revealed the formation of morphological lesions resulting from the administration of the antibiotic: hyperaemia and regressive lesions in the epithelium of renal tubules - parenchymatous and vacuolar degeneration, necrosis and hyaline casts in the lumen of renal tubules. The domination of hematopoietic cells over lymphocytes, necrosis of hematopoietic cells, proliferation of lymphoid cells, presence of melano-macrophages and less-frequent macrophages were observed. It was shown that the immersion of Siberian sturgeons in lysozyme dimer had an immunomodulatory effect and decreased the severity of morphological lesions in the head kidney induced by the administration of oxytetracycline.

AB  - A two-dimensional thin-layer chromatographic analysis of [C-14]-labelled metabolites in Escherichia coli was employed to follow metabolic shifts in response to superoxide stress. Steady-state challenge with paraquat at concentrations inducing SoxRS-controlled genes resulted in several alterations in metabolite pools, including a striking increase in valine concentration. Elevated valine levels, together with increased glutathione and alkylperoxidase, are proposed to constitute an intracellular protection mechanism against reactive oxygen species. As shown by this example of metabolome analysis, novel cellular responses to environmental challenge can be revealed by following the total complement of metabolites in a cell.

AB  - Increases in food production and the ever-present threat of food contamination from microbiological and chemical sources have led the food industry and regulators to pursue rapid, inexpensive methods of analysis to safeguard the health and safety of the consumer. Although sophisticated techniques such as chromatography and spectrometry provide more accurate and conclusive results, screening tests allow a much higher throughput of samples at a lower cost and with less operator training, so larger numbers of samples can be analysed. Biosensors combine a biological recognition element (enzyme, antibody, receptor) with a transducer to produce a measurable signal proportional to the extent of interaction between the recognition element and the analyte. The different uses of the biosensing instrumentation available today are extremely varied, with food analysis as an emerging and growing application. The advantages offered by biosensors over other screening methods such as radioimmunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, fluorescence immunoassay and luminescence immunoassay, with respect to food analysis, include automation, improved reproducibility, speed of analysis and real-time analysis. This article will provide a brief footing in history before reviewing the latest developments in biosensor applications for analysis of food contaminants (January 2007 to December 2010), focusing on the detection of pathogens, toxins, pesticides and veterinary drug residues by biosensors, with emphasis on articles showing data in food matrices. The main areas of development common to these groups of contaminants include multiplexing, the ability to simultaneously analyse a sample for more than one contaminant and portability. Biosensors currently have an important role in food safety; further advances in the technology, reagents and sample handling will surely reinforce this position.

AB  - Two 3-hydroxyflavone derivatives as one- and two-photon fluorescent chemosensors for cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy) were synthesized. The recognition properties and mechanism of the chemosensors for Cys and Hcy were investigated systematically. The experiment results indicate that 3-hydroxyflavone compound 1 (6-bromo-2-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-chromen-4-one) after the addition of nickel ions exhibits good recognition properties for Cys and Hcy with fluorescence enhancement and 65 nm absorption peak blue shift based on nickel displacement reaction mechanism. The detection limits (DL) with fluorescence as detected signal are 4.06 x 10(-3) mu M (Cys, linear range of 10-80 mu M) and 5.8 x 10(-3) mu M (Hcy, linear range of 10-100 mu M), respectively. But acrylate substituted 3-hydroxyflavone compound 2 (4-oxo-2-(4-diethylamino-phenyl)-4Hchromen-3-yl acrylate) can specially identify Cys with fluorescence turn-on (DL = 1.87 x 10(-3) mu M, linear range of 4-22 mu M) based on Cys leading to acrylate hydrolysis mechanism and succedent excited-state intramolecular proton transfer process of 3-hydroxyflavone compound. Then Cys and Hcy biological thiols can be recognized at one time by these two 3-hydroxyflavone derivatives. The bioimaging experiment indicates that both the compounds can be successfully applied to the detection of Cys/Hcy in living cells and compound 2 also can be applied to bioimaging Cys in zebrafish by one- and two-photon fluorescence mode. Then these two compounds have a potential in the application of biological sample analysis.

AB  - The present study was aimed to assess the reno-protective impact of aqueous extract of root of Withania somnifera (WSR) commonly known as Ashwagandha against organochlorine induced renal toxicity in fish Clarias batrachus (Linn.). Fishes were exposed to 4ppb concentration of commercial brand Endocel, an organochlorine pesticide for one week and two week to prepare the toxic model. These toxic groups of fishes were further treated with aqueous root extract of Withania somnifera (WSR)@100 mg /kg body wt for four weeks. After schedule exposure, blood serum was extracted and analyzed for total protein (TP) content. Renal tissues were processed for light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Endocel lowered TP at almost every exposure level. At LM level WSR extract treatment showed restoration of normal luminal characteristics of PCT & DCT and renal corpuscles but it failed to minimize abortive glomerulus, necrotic renal tubules with hypertrophied area, haemorrhagical clots & chronic venous congestion. At TEM level, WSR extract showed maximum retrieval in the cytoarchitecture of cuboidal epithelial cells of renal tubules and renal corpuscles. Concomitant treatment of endocel and WSR showed a very little sign of anomalies in renal tissues. A non-significant change was marked in control group when treated only with WSR extract. The serum level of TP showed a significant decline in organochlorine treated fish when compared with control. They showed a significant recovery after WSR treatment for four weeks. Concomitant treatment of endocel and WSR to the experimental group showed non-significant (at P<0.05) changes in TP. The WSR treatment alone to control group didn't show any significant correction in lowered TP. A perfect correlation between biochemical and histopathological finding signifies the excellent restorative power of WSR extract against organochlorine induced renal toxicity in fish.

AB  - Acetofenate (AF) is a widely used insecticide in China and other regions of southeastern Asia. A previous study showed that AF caused adverse developmental effects in zebrafish. Macrophages, which play a key role in inflammation, host defense, and reactions against a spectrum of autologous and foreign invaders, are crucial for innate immunity. However, cytotoxicity and apoptosis of macrophages caused by organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have so far received little attention. In this study, we used AF as a model chemical to investigate the cytotoxic effects of OCPs on mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Results from cell viability and apoptosis assays showed that AF induced apparent apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, AF induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage and resulted in the alteration of a series of signaling molecules including up-regulation of p53 and cytochrome c protein levels, decline of the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio, and activation of the caspases cascade through caspase-9 and caspase-3. These results, for the first time, revealed that the increase of endogenous ROS and DNA damage comediating OCP-induced apoptosis in macrophages may be by the mitochondria and p53 signal pathway. Our results suggested that macrophages are involved in AF-induced adverse immune effects. Considering the ubiquitous environmental presence of OCPs, this study provided new information on the potential long-term physiological and immunological effects due to chronic exposures to OCPs.

AB  - Twenty-two samples of sand-dwelling fishes were collected from sublittoral sandy substrata off the Cape Peninsula, South Africa using a novel quantitative technique in which the ichthyocide, rotenone, was introduced beneath 6.25 m2 plastic sheets weighted around the perimeter with chain. A total of 94 fish of eight species and four families were recorded. Of these, four species of the family Clinidae made up 92% of the material. Fish densities varied from 0.10-2.96 fish m-2 (0.17-1.14 g m-2). Distribution patterns amongst the Clinidae were explained by sediment particle size, with all of the newly discovered species, Cancelloxus longior, inhabiting fine sand (median grain size 0.25-0.50 mm), and all Xenopoclinus leprosus, C. elongatus and Pavoclinus smalei occurring in gravel (> 1 mm). Xenopoclinus kochi was found in all sediment types, but was most abundant in coarse substrata. Diets of all four species were similar, consisting chiefly of amphipods and isopods. However, small differences in prey preference were evident. All four species reached sexual maturity at 25-30 mm standard length, were viviparous, exhibited superembryonation and gave 'birth' to live young of approximately 14 mm. Breeding seasonality occurred in all species except P. smalei.

AB  - Side-by-side comparisons were made in an operational-sized, replicated experiment, installed in 1980-81 on four areas in the Coast Ranges of Oregon, to determine the effects of six methods of site preparation on the subsequent survival and growth of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France) and associated vegetation. A decade later, tree survival, total height, and stem caliper were significantly greater after site preparation by broadcast burning, slashing and burning, spraying Tordon 101 and burning, or aerial spraying of glyphosate than for manually spot-clearing vegetation at planting time, or no site preparation, and the differences were still increasing. Protecting seedlings from animals, primarily mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa), with plastic mesh tubing resulted in 13 percent higher survival; and protected trees averaged 6 percent taller, 9 percent larger in stem diameter, and 49 percent more in volume than unprotected trees at 10 years. Protection improved seedling performance in every site-preparation treatment.
   Site preparation by burning reduced total cover the most, from 50 to 5 percent or less. Vegetation recovery in all treatments was rapid; original levels were exceeded by midsummer 1981, the first posttreatment growing season. Total cover on spot-cleared areas almost equaled that on unprepared areas by 1982 but not until 1985 or later on burned or sprayed areas. Herbaceous vegetation was a much higher proportion of total cover for 5 years after burning or spraying than after spot-clearing or no site preparation, but eventually all areas were dominated by woody vegetation. Removal of the overstory by logging fostered diversity among dominant plant species and initiated successional trends in all areas. Site preparation caused large differences in the frequency of occurrence and surface area dominated by individual species but only minor increases in the total number of species. Dynamics of individual species or groups are shown by the frequency, cover, and average height of their dominance in each treatment over time.
   Site preparation by burning or spraying and protection from foraging animals were required to obtain more than minimum tree stocking and growth, even in moist coastal conditions. The study results are most specific to the salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis Pursh) brush type but certainly have wider applicability throughout the Coast Ranges and beyond wherever a heavy cover of competing vegetation develops rapidly and populations of foraging mammals are high.

AB  - Dr Lovro Dojmi worked in Herzegovina between the two world wars and was a great supporter of Dr Andrija Stampar's ideas about social medicine. During his stay in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, he was the head of the People's Healthcare Centre (1931-1943) and taught practical hygiene at the local grammar school. Dr Dojmi was born on the island of Vis, Croatia in 1899. He graduated from the Faculty of Medicine in Padova in 1924. In 1925, he started general practice in Dubrovnik. A year later he became assistant at the Surgery Hospital in Sarajevo and in 1928 a staff member of the Sarajevo Institute of Hygiene. He coordinated the health team fighting a syphillis outbreak in Tuzla in 1929. He was later the head of the Public Healthcare Centre in Livno, Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 25 January 1931 Dr Dojmi came to Mostar to work as a schoolchildren physician
   This article presents the work of Dr Dojmi in health education through his publications, organizing lectures, teaching health professionals how to prevent tuberculosis and syphilis and how to introduce healthy diet and hygiene to the households. In a park near the heathcare centre where he worked he was breeding Gambusia affinis, a particular fish species which he brought from Italy. These fish are known to eat mosquito larvae and thus help to fight malaria. This was the time before insecticides and antibiotics, and malaria was rather common in Herzegovina.
   The idea of this article is to give a better insight into Dr Dojmi's work, relying mostly on his unpublished monograph My Health Teaching Experience that was given to the author of this article as a present.

AB  - Until 2012, the genus Edwardsiella was composed by three species Edwardsiella tarda, Edwardsiella hoshinae and Edwardsiella ictaluri. In 2013, Edwardsiella piscicida, compiling fish pathogenic strains previously identified as E. tarda was described, and more recently a new species isolated from diseased eel was reported, namely Edwardsiella anguillarum.
   The incorporation of these species into the genus makes necessary a revision of the taxonomic position of the isolates previously identified as E. tarda. Using AFLP technique, MLSA studies and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization, 46 of 49 E. tarda isolates were re-assigned as E. piscicida and 2 as E. anguillarum, whereas it was confirmed previous classification of the Edwardsiella types and reference strains used. The study of the taxonomic resolution of the genes 16S rRNA, adk, atpD, dnal ginA, hsp60, tuf as well as the possible combinations among housekeeping genes, showed that the gene dnaJ was the more resolutive. In conclusion, the use of molecular techniques is necessary to accurately identify Edwardsiella isolates, especially when differentiating new species from E. tarda. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Pyrethroid insecticides are broadly used. They have low toxicity for warm-blooded living creatures, but high toxicity for both insects and fish. Therefore, it is important to reduce the environmental impact of pyrethroids. Pyrethroic acids are chiral compounds. An effective way to decrease pollution is to use enantio-pure insecticide products instead of their racemic mixtures. Enantiomer-pure products require enantiomer selective synthesis and analysis. The chiral selective analysis of pyrethroic acids (an intermediate of pyrethroids) is also important in terms of process control and from the point of view of their degradation metabolism in the environment. This study used various enantiomeric selective chromatographic methods for the separation of different pyrethroic acids, including gas chromatography, supercritical fluid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. Systematic experiments were conducted to find the optimum conditions for their chiral separation. The employed enantio-selective agents were cyclodextrin derivatives with different ring sizes and substitution patterns. The beta-cyclodextrin proved to be excellent for the chiral separation of these acids. The different chiral recognition mechanisms were established using different ring-sized cyclodextrins. The results of these systematic studies demonstrated the correlations of the chiral selectivity features of selectors and the structures of analytes.

AB  - Inflammasomes are important innate immune components in mammals. However, the bacterial factors modulating inflammasome activation in fish, and the mechanisms by which they alter fish immune defences, remain to be investigated. In this work, a mutant of the fish pathogen Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida), called 0909I, was shown to overexpress haemolysin, which could induce a robust pyroptotic-like cell death dependent on caspase-5-like activity during infection in fish nonphagocyte cells. E. piscicida haemolysin was found to mainly associate with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which were internalised into the fish cells via a dynamin-dependent endocytosis and induced pyroptotic-like cell death. Importantly, bacterial immersion infection of both larvae and adult zebrafish suggested that dysregulated expression of haemolysin alerts the innate immune system and induces intestinal inflammation to restrict bacterial colonisation in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest a critical role of zebrafish innate immunity in monitoring invaded pathogens via detecting the bacterial haemolysin-associated OMVs and initiating pyroptotic-like cell death. These new additions to the understanding of haemolysin-mediated pathogenesis in vivo provide evidence for the existence of noncanonical inflammasome signalling in lower vertebrates.

AB  - Impact of alphamethrin (synthetic pyrethroid) on profiles of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), catalase (CAT), DNA, RNA and protein in liver, brain, gill and skeletal muscle of the freshwater food fish Channa punctatus were investigated. Exposure of sublethal concentration of alphamethrin (0.018 ppm for 14 days) increased the activity of LDH in liver (1.8 fold), brain (1.4 fold), gill(1.6 fold), and skeletal muscle(2.2 fold) of the fish. However, it significantly decreased the activity of CAT in the tissues of liver (54%), skeletal muscle (52%), gill (51%) and brain (49%) of the fish. Similarly, DNA (skeletal muscle (36%), liver (30%), brain (28%) and gill (25%)) RNA (liver (42%), brain (32%), gill (35%) and skeletal muscle (45%)) and protein content (45%), brain (42%), gill (36%), and skeletal muscle (27%)) declined in different tissues of the fish exposed to alphamethrin. Maximum increase in the level of LDH was in skeletal muscle (2.2 fold) and minimum in brain(1.4 fold). Maximum reduction in CAT profile was in liver (54%), and minimum in brain (49%). Declines in DNA was maximum in skeletal muscle (36%) and minimum in gill (25%) whereas RNA and protein content were maximum in liver (42% and 45% respectively) and minimum in skeletal muscle (45% and 27% respectively). Alphamethrin was toxic to the freshwater fish due to its inducing effect on anaerobic enzyme (LDH) and inhibitory effect on antioxidant enzyme (CAT), DNA, RNA and protein. This reflected alphamethrin associated increase in anaerobiosis and decrease in oxidative defense and impairment in protein synthesizing capacity of C. punctatus. Further, induction in LDH and reduction in CAT and protein profile may be used as biomarker of alphamethrin toxicity in fish.

AB  - Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were detected in 88 maternal adipose tissue samples collected during year 2004 to 2006, in Singapore. Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were the most dominant followed by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Multivariate data analyses (MVA) including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares regression (PLSR), and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were applied to elucidate the relationship between concentrations of POPS in adipose tissues and donors' characteristics. Food consumption played the most significant role in accounting for levels of POPs in adipose tissue. Fish and poultry consumption was the route of PCBs and PBDEs in mothers in Singapore, while beta-HCH came mainly from vegetables. An age-dependent accumulation of POPS was found for beta-HCH and PCB congeners, and lactation and gestation functioned as a decontamination processes for PCBs in adipose tissue. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) may change the profile of POPs in adipose tissue, probably due to an alteration in lipid metabolism. POPs investigated here may not be the cause of antenatal complication in pregnant women, and baby gender was not related to the pattern of contaminants in maternal adipose tissue.

AB  - Whereas the electronic communication between metals in dimetallic organometallic compounds is often assessed through cyclic voltammetric measurements, we have found that the variations in the Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) can also be an alternative and effective way of determining this type of interaction. The TEP values of several (CO)(3)Ni-NHC-X systems with five different ditopic NHC ligand systems [triazolyldiylidene (A), bis(imidazolylidene) (B), benzobis(imidazolylidene) (C), cyclopenta[f,g] acenaphthy-lenebis(imidazolylidene) (D) and bis(imidazolidinylidene) (F)] were determined by means of DFT calculations. Based on these values, the electron-withdrawing character of the X metal fragments employed in this study was found to increase in the order IrCp(CO) -> RhCl(COD) -> Ni(CO)(3) -> Cr(CO)(5) -> RhCl(CO)(2). We found that the degree of electronic interaction through the ditopic NHC ligands is the strongest in A, followed by B and F, while being weak in B and C. The TEP values and the quantitative analysis of the upper molecular orbitals of A and F and their (CO)(3)Ni-NHC-Ni(CO)3 complexes strongly suggest that the principal electronic interaction between the metal centres of the M-NHC-M' complexes is of sigma-type, via the delocalized HOMO and HOMO - 1 orbitals of the NHC ligands.

AB  - The flavonoid metal-insecticide magnesium-hesperidin complex (MgHP) has recently been considered as a novel insecticide to replace some persistent pesticides. However, it is important to evaluate its action on non-target species, mainly those living in an aquatic environment, as these ecosystems are the final receptors of most chemicals. Reactive oxygen species, antioxidant and oxidative stress biomarkers, genotoxicity as well as cell cycle was evaluated in the liver cell line from zebrafish (Danio rerio; ZF-L) exposed to 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ng mL(-1) MgHP. MgHP affected cell stability by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both exposure times (24 and 96 h) at high concentrations. Catalase (CAT) activity decreased after 24 h exposure, and glutathione and metallothionein values increased, avoiding the lipid peroxidation. Genotoxicity increased as MgHP concentration increased, after 24 h exposure, exhibiting nuclear abnormalities; it was recovered after 96 h exposure, evidencing possible stimulation of DNA repair mechanisms. The alteration in the cell cycle (increasing in the Sub-G1 phase and decreasing in the S-phase) was associated with chromosomal instability. In conclusion, the responses of ROS and the antioxidant defense system depended on MgHP concentration and time exposure, while DNA exhibited some instability after 24 h exposure, which was recovered after 96 h.

AB  - Background: Moderate to severe dysregulation in retinoid signaling during early development is associated with a constellation of physical malformations and/or neural tube defects, including spina bifida. It is thought that more subtle dysregulation of this system, which might be achievable via dietary (i.e. hypervitaminosis A) or pharmacological (i.e. valproic acid) exposure in humans, will manifest on behavioral domains including sociability, without overt physical abnormalities.
   Methods: During early life, zebrafish were exposed to low doses of two chemicals that disrupt retinoid signaling. From 0 to 5 dpf, larvae were reared in aqueous solutions containing retinoic acid (0, 0.02, 0.2 or 2 nM) or valproic acid (0, 0.5, 5.0 or 50 mu M). One cohort of zebrafish was assessed using a locomotor activity screen at 6-dpf; another was reared to adulthood and assessed using a neurobehavioral test battery (startle habituation, novel tank exploration, shoaling, and predator escape/avoidance).
   Results: There was no significant increase in the incidence of physical malformation among exposed fish compared to controls. Both retinoic acid and valproic acid exposures during development disrupted larval activity with persisting behavioral alterations later in life, primarily manifesting as decreased social affiliation.
   Conclusions: Social behavior and some aspects of motor function were altered in exposed fish; the importance of examining emotional or psychological consequences of early life exposure to retinoid acting chemicals is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pyrethroid-based insecticides are largely used for mosquito control. These compounds have household and agricultural applications with different formulations. Two important compounds used as household insecticides are prallethrin and transfluthrin, both from the pyrethroid chemical group. With the mode of action centered on sodium channels, pyrethroids keep the ionic sodium channels open for a long time causing the death of the insect by nervous hyperexcitability. Given the increased use of household insecticides by humans and the incidence of disease outbreaks with unknown etiology such as autism spectrum disease, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease we investigate some physiological inputs of these compounds on zebrafish. In this study, we evaluated the social interaction, shoaling formation, and anxiety-like behavior of zebrafish exposed chronically to trans- fluthrin-and prallthrin-based insecticides (T-BI and P-BI). In addition, we quantified the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in different brain regions. We observed that both compounds caused anxiolytic behavior and reduced shoaling formation and social interaction. Their behavioral biomarkers indicated a harmful ecological effect on the specie as well as a possible impact of these compounds on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZP). In addition, the AChE activity would change its activity in different brain regions modulating the anxiety-like behavior and social behavior in zebrafish. We conclude that P-BI and T-BI make us alert about the relationship of these compounds with nervous diseases related to cholinergic signaling.

AB  - In this study, we report the antioxidant and antitoxic potential of chemically synthesized 4-oxo-2-phenyl-4Hchromene-7,8-diyl bis((1-amino-2-hydroxypropyl)carbamate) (DHF-BAHPC) compound using in vitro and in vivo assays. The DHF-BAHPC was synthesized by linking 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (DHF) with two molecules of Fmocthreonine and characterized by Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and Mass spectrometry (MS). In vitro, antioxidant assay results revealed that DHF-BAHPC has a dose-dependent radical scavenging potential towards DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and H2O2 radicals with an IC50 range of 15.45, 66.27, 25.71, 4.375 mu g/mL, respectively. Furthermore DHF-BAHPC treatment significantly altered cadmium (Cd) intoxicated zebrafish embryos by rescuing the developmental changes associated with severe histological and reduced the level of defensive antioxidant activities (SOD, CAT, GPx and GST). The overall results of the present study represented that DHF-BAHPC may be used as a potential drug in redox-based therapeutics.

AB  - Antisocial behavior persists as a preeminent public policy issue in the United States. A more critical assessment of both the policies and the programs designed to address this problem is necessary, and new risk factors far antisocial behavior need to be investigated. Sufficient evidence exists to hypothesize that exposure to neurotoxins may be a risk factor for antisocial behavior. Neurotoxins such as lead have been demonstrated to affect the cognitive development of children, and impaired cognition is accepted as a risk factor for antisocial behavior. Little consideration has been given, however, to the possible link between neurotoxins and human behavior. This paper presents a biologically and socially plausible justification for this association, reviews the supporting evidence, and emphasizes the need for additional investigation of the phenomenon, Elucidation of this risk factor may lead to new strategies for preventing or mitigating antisocial behaviors among youth and adults.

AB  - The available arable land is unable to fulfill the food production need of rapidly the exponentially growing human population in the world. Pesticides are one of those different measures taken to meet this demand. As a plant growth regulator to block gibberellin, paclobutrazol (PBZ) is used excessively throughout the world to promote early fruit setting, and to increase seed setting which might be harmful because PBZ is a very stable compound; therefore, it can bioaccumulate into the food chain of an ecosystem. In the present study, we discovered unexpected effects of PBZ on zebrafish larvae and adult behaviors by challenging them with low dose exposure. Zebrafish larvae aged 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed for 24 h at 10 mu g/L (0.01 ppm) and 100 mu g/L (0.1 ppm) of PBZ, respectively, and adults were incubated at 100 mu g/L (0.1 ppm) and 1000 mu g/L (1 ppm) concentrations of PBZ, respectively, for fourteen days. After incubation, the locomotor activity, burst, and rotation movement for the larvae; and multiple behavioral tests such as novel tank exploration, mirror biting, shoaling, predator avoidance, and social interaction for adult zebrafish were evaluated. Brain tissues of the adult fish were dissected and subjected to biochemical analyses of the antioxidant response, oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and neurotransmitter levels. Zebrafish larvae exposed to PBZ exhibited locomotion hyperactivity with a high burst movement and swimming pattern. In adult zebrafish, PBZ resulted in anxiolytic exploratory behavior, while no significant results were found in social interaction, shoal making, and predator avoidance behaviors. Interestingly, high dose PBZ exposure significantly compromised the innate aggressive behavior of the adult fish. Biochemical assays for oxidative stress, antioxidant response, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed significant reductions in their relative contents. In conclusion, for the first time, our behavior assays revealed that chronic PBZ exposure induced behavioral alterations in both larvae and the adult zebrafish. Because PBZ is a widely-used plant growth regulator, we suggest that it is necessary to conduct more thorough tests for its biosafety and bioaccumulation.

AB  - There is growing evidence that long-term exposure to prometryn (a widely used herbicide) can induce toxicity in bony fish and shrimp. Our previous study demonstrated its 96 h acute toxicity on the crab Eriocheir sinensis. However, studies on whether longer exposure to prometryn with a lower dose induces toxicity in E. sinensis are scarce. Therefore, we conducted a 20 d exposure experiment to investigate its effects on the hepatopancreas and intestine of E. sinensi. Prometryn reduce the activities of antioxidant enzymes, increase the level of lipid peroxidation and cause oxidative stress. Moreover, long-term exposure resulted in immune and detoxification fatigue, while short-term exposure to prometryn could upregulate the expression of genes related to immunity, inflammation and detoxification. Prometryn altered the morphological structure of the hepatopancreas (swollen lumen) and intestine (shorter intestinal villi, thinner muscle layer and thicker peritrophic membrane). In addition, prometryn changed the species composition of the intestinal flora. In particular, Bacteroidota and Proteobacteria showed a dose-dependent decrease accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in Firmicutes at the phylum level. At the genus level, all exposure groups significantly increased the abundance of Zoogloea and a Firmicutes bacterium ZOR0006, but decreased Shewanella abundance. Interestingly, Pearson correlation analysis indicated a potential association between differential flora and hepatopancreatic disorder. Phenotypic abundance analysis indicated that changes in the gut flora decreased the intestinal organ's resistance to stress and increased the potential for opportunistic infection. In summary, our research provides new insights into the prevention and defense strategies in response to external adverse environments and contributes to the sustainable development of E. sinensis culture.

AB  - Currently, mosquito vector control is facing a number of key challenges, including the rapid development of resistance to synthetic pesticides and the recent spread of aggressive arbovirus outbreaks. The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is currently considered an environmental friendly alternative to the employ of pyrethroids, carbamates and microbial agents (e.g. Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis), since AgNPs are easy to produce, effective and stable in the aquatic environment. However, their biophysical features showed wide variations according to the botanical agent using for the green synthesis, outlining the importance of screening local floral resources used as reducing and stabilizing agents. In this study, we focused on the biophysical properties and the mosquitocidal action of Quisqualis indica-fabricated AgNPs. AgNPs were characterized using spectroscopic (UV, FTIR, XRD) and microscopic (AFM, SEM, TEM and EDX) techniques. AFM, SEM and TEM confirmed the synthesis of poly-dispersed AgNPs with spherical shape and size ranging from 1 to 30 nm. XRD shed light on the crystalline structure of these AgNPs. The acute toxicity of Quisqualis indica extract and AgNPs was evaluated against malaria, arbovirus, and filariasis vectors, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, as well as on three important non-target aquatic organisms. The Q. indica leaf extract showed moderate larvicidal effectiveness on Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 220.42), Ae. aegypti (LC50 = 203.63) and An. stephensi (LC50 = 185.98). Q indica-fabricated AgNPs showed high toxicity against Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 14.63), Ae. aegypti (LC50 = 13.55) and An. stephensi (LC50 = 1252), respectively. Notably, Q indica-synthesized AgNPs were moderately toxic to non-target aquatic mosquito predators Anisops bouvieri (LC50 = 653.05 mu g/mL), Diplonychus indicus (LC50 = 860.94 mu g/mL) and Gambusia affinis (LC50 = 2183.16 mu g/mL), if compared to the targeted mosquitoes. Overall, the proposed one-pot biogenic fabrication of AgNPs using Q. indica is a low-cost and eco-friendly tool in the fight against Zika virus, malaria and filariasis vectors, with little impact against non-target aquatic mosquito predators.

AB  - Precise recognition of the weed by computer vision, furthermore raising the weeding efficiency, reducing the use of herbicide, and decreasing the pollution to the environment is one of the key technologies in the field of precision agriculture. To determine the optimal threshold in image automatic segmentation and solve one-dimensional histogram without obvious peak and valley distribution, image segmentation method based on fisher criterion and improved adaptive genetic algorithm is proposed. This method can preserve the multifamily of population and the astringency of the algorithm, and can overcome the problems of poor astringency and premature occurrence. The result shows that the proposed approach has better immunity to Salt and Pepper Noise and greatly shortens the time of image segmentation.

AB  - The teratogenicity of the pesticide nereistoxin (NTX) and its derivative thiocyclam (THI) towards aquatic life was dramatically constrained by a synthetic nanoreceptor, cucurbit[7]uril, through selective encapsulation of the pesticides (KCB[7]-NTX of 3.24(+/- 0.31)x10(6) M-1 and KCB[7]-THI of 7.46(+/- 0.10)x10(5) M-1), as evidenced by the rate of hatchability, morphology development, and tyrosinase activity of zebrafish larvae incubated with the pesticides (3-300 mu m) in the absence and in the presence of 300 mu m cucurbit[7]uril, demonstrating the significant potential of the nanoreceptor in managing ecological pollution of these pesticides.

AB  - Occupational dermatoses contribute to a significant portion of work-related diseases, especially in Asia, where a major portion of the workforce is in the unorganized sector. This review article is focussed on the frequency and pattern of occupational skin diseases reported across Asian countries and type of allergens implicated in different occupations. The literature was searched systematically using key words 'occupational dermatoses,' 'occupational skin disease' and name of each Asian country. Ninty five full-text articles were considered relevant and evaluated. Some of the dermatoses seen in industrial workers in Asian countries are similar to those in Western countries, including dermatoses due to chromate in construction and electroplating workers, epoxy resin, and chromate in painters, wood dust in workers in the furniture industry, azo dyes in textile workers and formaldehyde and chromates in those working in the leather and dyeing industries, dermatoses in domestic workers, chefs and health-care workers. Dermatoses in workers engaged in agriculture, beedi (tiny cigars) manufacture, agarbatti (incense sticks) production, fish processing, carpet weaving, sanitation and those working in coffee plantations and coal mines appear to be unique to Asian countries. Recognition of clinical patterns and geographic variations in occupational skin diseases will provide an impetus to further strengthen future research in these areas, as well as improving their management.

AB  - An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is proposed, based on the fish communities and populations in streams of the Hondo River basin, Mexico-Belize. Freshwater environments in this area are threatened by exotic fishes, eutrophication, and pesticide pollution, among other problems. This IBI should allow to identify the most vulnerable sites and eventually guide rehabilitation efforts. Data on composition, structure, and function of fish communities were evaluated. Twenty-three sites in the Mexican part of the basin were explored; a stratified sample of 13 sites was used to design the IBI, and the rest were used to test and refine the index. Thirty-four candidate indicator metrics were scanned for their correlation with an index of water and habitat quality (IWHQ), as well as for the possible influence of stream width and altitude or distance to the Hondo River mainstem. Twelve variables were selected to constitute the IBI: relative abundances of Astyanax aeneus, 'Cichlasoma' urophthalmus, Poecilia mexicana, Poecilia sp. (a new species, probably endemic to the upper Hondo River basin), Xiphophorus hellerii, and X. maculatus; relative abundances of bentholimnetic, herbivore, and sensitive species; percentage of native and tolerant species; and Pielou's evenness index. Most of the sites have a low-medium quality and integrity, showing impact due to partial channelization or to suboptimal water quality, reflected in scarcity or absence of sensitive species, frequent excess of tolerant species, occasional presence of exotics, dominance of herbivores (perhaps due to proliferation of filamentous algae), or dominance of the opportunistic species P. mexicana. The streams with better water and habitat quality are those farthest away from the river mainstem, probably because of lower human population and economical production.

AB  - Antidepressants are used by a substantial number of women in their childbearing years. Treatment may continue during pregnancy, since untreated depression poses a risk to the mother and child. However, many antidepressants readily pass through the placental barrier to reach the fetus or may be ingested by the newborn via breastmilk. Little is known about the effects of antidepressants on brain development and subsequent behavior in young children. In the current study, we used zebrafish as a model system to examine the neurodevelopmental effects of three commonly prescribed antidepressants, sertraline, duloxetine and bupropion. Zebrafish were exposed to these antidepressants during development and were examined for changes in larval avoidance behavior, activity, social behaviors, and anxiety-related behaviors. The results show that antidepressants commonly affect larval swim speeds and resting, and differentially affect other behaviors depending upon the exposure period. Using cluster analysis profiling, we compared the obtained results to previous reports on behavioral defects induced by organophosphate pesticides. We found that the behavioral profiles induced by antidepressants and pesticides overlap, indicating a common mechanism of action. We conclude that developmental antidepressant exposures lead to specific behavioral changes in zebrafish larvae. At present, it is not known if antidepressants have similar effects in human development.

AB  - According to the displacement method, herein we reported a water soluble copper complex [Cu(MaT-cyclen)(2)] as a fluorescent probe for the detection of H2S. For this, 1((1-(10-methylanthracen-9-yl)methyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (MaT-cyclen) was synthesized first To improve its solubility in aqueous media, sodium acetate group was introduced into 8-hydroxy-2-quinoline successfully. MaT-cyclen was chelated with Cu(II) to form [Cu(MaT-cyclen)2] complex, which displayed high sensitivity and selectivity for H2S over the other possible competitive substances on the basis of forming CuS. Meanwhile, [Cu(MaT-cyclen)(2)] displayed rapid response (< 1 min), well reversibility, lowest detection limit (205 nM), and high sensitivity for recognizing H2S in aqueous solution. Furthermore, its potential utility for biological applications was confirmed by fluorescence imaging of H2S in live cells as well as in zebra fish. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A highly selective and sensitive molecularly imprinted electrochemiluminescence (MIECL) sensor was developed based on the multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-enhanced molecularly imprinted quantum dots (MIP-QDs) for the rapid determination of cyfluthrin (CYF). The MIP-QDs fabricated by surface grafting technique exhibited excellent selective recognition to CYF, resulting in a specific decrease of ECL signal at the MWCNT/MIP-QD modified electrode. Under optimal conditions, the MIECL signal was proportional to the logarithm of the CYF concentration in the range of 0.2 mu g/L to 1.0 x 10(3) mu g/L with a determination coefficient of 0.9983. The detection limit of CYF was 0.05 mu g/L, and good recoveries ranging from 86.0% to 98.6% were obtained in practical samples. The proposed MIECL sensor provides a novel, rapid, high sensitivity detection strategy for successfully analyzing CYF in fish and seawater samples.

AB  - CONCERN AND AWARENESS IS GROWING about the health effects of exposures to environmental contaminants, including those found in food. Most primary care physicians lack knowledge and training in the clinical recognition and management of the health effects of environmental exposures. We have found that the use of a simple history-taking tool - the (CHOPD2)-O-2 mnemonic (Community, Home, Hobbies, Occupation, Personal habits, Diet and Drugs) - can help physicians identify patients at risk of such health effects. We present an illustrative case of a mother who is concerned about eating fish and wild game because her 7-year-old son has been found to have learning difficulties and she is planning another pregnancy. Potential exposures to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury are considered. The neurodevelopmental effects of POPs on the fetus are reviewed. We provide advice to limit a patient's exposure to these contaminants and discuss the relevance of these exposures to the learning difficulties of the 7-year-old child and to the planning of future pregnancies.

AB  - An important objective in weed management is the discrimination between grasses (monocots) and broad-leaved weeds (dicots), because these two weed groups can be appropriately controlled by specific herbicides. In fact, efficiency is higher if selective treatment is performed for each type of infestation instead of using a broadcast herbicide on the whole surface. This work proposes a strategy where weeds are characterised by a set of shape descriptors (the seven Hu moments and six geometric shape descriptors). Weeds appear in outdoor field images which display real situations obtained from a RGB camera. Thus, images present a mixture of both weed species under varying conditions of lighting. In the presented approach, four decision-making methods were adapted to use the best shape descriptors as attributes and a choice was taken. This proposal establishes a novel methodology with a high success rate in weed species discrimination.

AB  - Paclobutrazol (PBZ), a trazole-containing fungicide, is widely used on food crops. Frequent usage of PBZ may contaminate water, but its toxicity to aquatic organisms is understudied. Although the chronic effects of PBZ exposure on reproductive, antioxidant defense, and liver metabolism systems in rockfish have been reported, the toxic effects of PBZ on aquatic embryos are unknown. Here, we report that PBZ disrupts the development of heart and craniofacial cartilage in zebrafish embryos, and decreases their survival and hatching rates. PBZ affects the normal process of cardiac looping, which may lead to a slower heart beat accompanied by pericardia edema and apoptotic myocytes. PBZ also decreases the population of migratory neural crest cells, which give rise to craniofacial cartilage. Our results reveal high embryonic toxicity of PBZ on aquatic organisms, and thus hold significance for the impact of fungicides on public health and ecology.

AB  - DIRS-1 is a retroelement from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Until recently only two related retrotransposons had been described: PAT from the nematode Panagrellus redivivus and Prt1 from the zygomycete fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus. Analyses of the reverse transcriptase sequences encoded by these three elements suggested that they were closely related to each other and more distantly related to the Ty3/gypsy Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retroelements. They have several unusual structural features that distinguish them from typical LTR elements. For instance, they each encode a tyrosine recombinase (YR), but not a DDE-type integrase or an aspartic protease. Although the DIRS-1-related elements are bordered by terminal repeats these differ from typical LTRs in a number of ways. In DIRS-1, for example, the terminal repeats are inverted (complementary), non-identical in sequence, and the outer edges of the terminal sequences are repeated (adjacent to each other) in the internal region. PAT has so-called "split" direct repeats in which the unrelated terminal sequences appear as direct repeats adjacent to each other in the internal region. The only repetition displayed by Prt1 is the presence of short inverted terminal repeats, but the sequenced copy of this element is believed to be a truncated version of an element with a structure resembling DIRS-1. The unusual structure of the terminal repeats of the DIRS1-like elements appears to be related to their replication via free circular intermediates. Site-specific recombination is believed to integrate the circle without creating duplications of the target sites. In recognition of these important distinctions it is proposed that the retrotransposons that encode tyrosine recombinases be called the tyrosine recombinase (or YR) retrotransposons. Recently a large number of additional YR retrotransposons have been described, including elements from fungi (zygomycetes and basidiomycetes), plants (green algae) and a wide range of animals including nematodes, insects, sea urchins, fish and amphibia, while remnants of elements related to DIRS-1 occur in the human genome. The complete set of YR retrotransposons can be divided into two major groups, the DIRS elements and the Ngaro elements, the two groups forming distinct clades on phylogenetic trees based on alignments of RT/RH and recombinase sequences, and also having some structural distinctions. A third group of transposable elements, which we call Cryptons, also carry tyrosine recombinases. These elements do not encode a reverse transcriptase and so are believed to be DNA transposons not retrotransposons. They have been detected in several pathogenic fungi, including the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans, and the ascomycetes Coccidioides posadasii and Histoplasma capsulatum. Sequence comparisons suggest that the Crypton YRs are related to those of the YR retrotransposons. We suggest that the YR retrotransposons arose from the combination of a Crypton-like YR DNA transposon and the RT/RH encoding sequence of a retrotransposon. Copyright (c) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Carbendazim (CBZ) is a widely used, systemic, broad-spectrum benzimidazole fungicide. It is used worldwide against fungal diseases on a wide range of agricultural products and in domestic gardens. The activities of brain oxidative stress biomarkers and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in juvenile African Catfish Clarias gariepinus exposed to CBZ were investigated. Juveniles were exposed to sublethal concentrations of 0.22, 0.43, and 0.64 mg/L CBZ, which corresponded to 5, 10, and 15% of the 96-h LC50 (the concentration that was lethal to 50% of the test organisms over the first 96 h) of CBZ fungicide for 21 d. Individuals were allowed an extra 7-d recovery period. The brain tissues were sampled and analyzed on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 (including the 7-d recovery period). The results indicated significant concentration-dependent inhibition of the brain AChE activities in all exposed groups. The lipid peroxidation was significantly elevated while the antioxidant enzymes and protein values were significantly inhibited by CBZ exposure. However, the values of catalase on days 7, 14, and 21 were significantly higher than day 1 values. Overall, CBZ altered brain oxidative stress parameters and led to the inhibition of AChE. This fungicide should be used with utmost caution to protect and safeguard fish, ensuring that fish production and survival in the environment remain unaffected.

AB  - Toxaphene, a mixture of chlorinated bornanes and camphenes with a high proportion of enantiomers, can be used as an indicator for the investigation of environmental conditions which lead to the compositional pattern of toxaphene in environmental samples. Due to its persistence and long range transport, toxaphene is distributed throughout the world. The changes in composition after biotic or abiotic transformation are visible in the gas chromatograms of different environmental samples. These are important clues to translocation and degradation pathways. The results of enantioselective residue analysis and of degradation experiments with single toxaphene components suggest the dominance of photolysis over other abiotic or biotic processes in air, water, and fish.

AB  - The proliferation of non-native fishes in Florida is a serious problem, and new . species continue to be introduced to the state. Fishes in the Family Cichlidae have been especially successful colonizers of south Florida freshwater habitats. Herein we report a multi-agency effort to eradicate two non-native cichlid fishes in Miami, Florida (Bay Snook Petenia splertdida and Blue Mbuna Labeotropheus fuelleborni). These fishes were removed before they were observed in the extensive, interconnected canal system through which they may have been able to expand throughout south Florida and access protected areas such as Everglades National Park. The study site, Pinecrest Gardens, is important because it contains remnant coastal cypress-strand habitat in an increasingly urbanized landscape that historically provided refuge to native amphithomous fishes and invertebrates. The project took considerable time (3.5 yews), and we detail in this report how it evolved from a focus on isolating the non-native fishes and reducing their population sizes to an eradication. Gardens' staff hydrologically isolated their ponds from nearby waterbodies by plugging a culvert with a solid gate. That provided the interagency team with more time to remove the potential threats. Compromises were made between fish management strategies and the Gardens' priorities. Hurricane impacts helped shift priorities to more aggressive fish-management strategies. Cooperation among several federal and state agencies, as well as the Gardens. was key to the project's success. We hope this effort may serve as a model for removing non-native species before they spread into ecosystems where eradication is not practical.

AB  - Lateralization, i.e. the preferential use of one side of the body, may convey fitness benefits for organisms within rapidly-changing environments, by optimizing separate and parallel processing of different information between the two brain hemispheres. In coral reef-fishes, the movement of larvae from planktonic to reef environments (recruitment) represents a major life-history transition. This transition requires larvae to rapidly identify and respond to sensory cues to select a suitable habitat that facilitates survival and growth. This 'recruitment' is critical for population persistence and resilience. In aquarium experiments, larval Acanthurus triostegus preferentially used their right-eye to investigate a variety of visual stimuli. Despite this, when held in in situ cages with predators, those larvae that previously favored their left-eye exhibited higher survival. These results support the "brain's righthemisphere" theory, which predicts that the right-eye (i.e. left-hemisphere) is used to categorize stimuli while the left-eye (i.e. right-hemisphere) is used to inspect novel items and initiate rapid behavioral-responses. While these experiments confirm that being highly lateralized is ecologically advantageous, exposure to chlorpyrifos, a pesticide often inadvertently added to coral-reef waters, impaired visual-lateralization. This suggests that chemical pollutants could impair the brain function of larval fishes during a critical life-history transition, potentially impacting recruitment success.

AB  - This study sought to analyze the effects of the herbicide quinclorac on body condition indices; plasma levels of corticosterone, glucose, and uric acid; activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione S-transferase (GST); and levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the liver and caudal muscle of American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) tadpoles. After a 7-day acclimation period, animals were exposed to four concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mu g/L) of herbicide for a further 7 days. Then, blood samples were obtained, animals were euthanized, and the liver and caudal muscle resected. Levels of corticosterone and uric acid were reduced in tadpoles exposed to the highest concentration of herbicide, and this reduction was preceded by an increase in glucose levels. In the liver tissue, LPO was increased after exposure to 0.1 mu g/ L quinclorac, followed by a return to baseline values in the remaining concentrations; this response was accompanied by an increase in SOD and GST and reduction of tissue protein levels. At the highest concentration, a reduction in activity of all enzymes was observed, with protein returning to control-like levels. In muscle, SOD and GST levels declined with exposures up to 0.1 mu g/ L and 0.4 mu g/L, respectively, whereas LPO decreased in animals exposed to 0.1 mu g/L. These results suggest participation of nonenzymatic antioxidant defenses, as demonstrated by the reduction in uric acid levels. Exposure to the range of quinclorac concentrations used in this study slowed body mass and length gain, reduced corticosterone levels, and modulated antioxidant defenses.

AB  - Large brown seaweeds dominate coastal hard substrata throughout many of the world's oceans. In coastal North Carolina, USA, this dominance by brown seaweeds is facilitated by omnivorous fishes, which feed both on red and green algae and on herbivorous amphipods that graze brown algae. When fish are removed in the field, brown seaweeds are replaced by red seaweeds, and herbivorous amphipods are more abundant. Using an array of large (similar to 4000 L) outdoor mesocosms, we tested three mechanistic hypotheses for this pattern: fish feeding facilitates brown algal dominance (1) by removing red and green algal competitors, (2) by removing amphipods and reducing their feeding on brown seaweeds, or (3) through an interaction of these mechanisms. Our experiments revealed strong impacts of both fish and amphipods, and a key role for the interaction, in structuring this community. When both fish and amphipods were removed (the latter with dilute insecticide), space was rapidly dominated and held for 17 weeks by fast-growing, primarily filamentous green algae. In contrast, when either fish, amphipods, or both were present, green algae were cropped to a sparse turf, and space was more rapidly dominated by larger macroalgae. The impacts of amphipods and fish on late-successional macroalgal assemblages were comparable in magnitude, but different in sign: red seaweeds prevailed in the amphipod-dominated treatment, whereas browns dominated in the presence of fish. Laboratory feeding assays and amphipod densities in the tanks suggested that the significant effects of amphipods were attributable largely, if not exclusively, to the single amphipod species Ampithoe longimana, which fed heavily on brown macroalgae. Our experimental removal of red and green algae failed to enhance cover of brown algae significantly; however, the latter reached substantially lower cover in the grazer-removal treatment, where green algae were very abundant, than in the fish-only treatment, where green algae were sparse. Thus, our results support the third hypothesis: fish-mediated dominance of brown algae involves both suppression of grazing amphipods and removal of algal competitors. Although collective impacts of fish and amphipods on this benthic community were generally comparable in magnitude, impacts normalized to each grazer's aggregate biomass were consistently higher for amphipods than for fish, sometimes by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Thus, the impacts of grazing amphipods (specifically A. longimana) on the benthic community were both strong and disproportionate to their biomass. These experimental results imply that grazing amphipods, which are ubiquitous in marine vegetation but poorly understood ecologically, may play important roles in the organization of benthic communities, particularly where predation pressure is low.

AB  - Pyrethroids prallethrin (P-BI) and transfluthrin (T-BI) are among the most commonly used molecules with insecticide action. These molecules comprise different formulations of insecticides largely used in household, agricultural, and animal production fields. However, the increased use of these molecules has led to concerns regarding their safety in animals and humans. Oxidative stress (OS) is believed to be easily established by xenobiotic contacts, such as pyrethroids. We aimed to evaluate and understand the impact of two household insecticides and two doses applied to different tissues of the antioxidant system of zebrafish (Danio rerio). We observed that the effect on the antioxidant system differed between tissues. The muscle was the most affected tissue in the body, the antioxidant enzymes were activated, and a mechanism of non-enzymatic antioxidants was activated; however, it could still cause cellular damage. The observed effect on muscle may be related to the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. In addition, in the brain, these compounds can inactivate the first line of enzymatic antioxidant defense, which is compensated for by the second line, avoiding cellular damage. Ultimately, the gill tissue did not appear to suffer lipid damage, but heme group formation was largely affected by the compounds.

TI  - MERCURY CONTAMINATION OF FISH IN THE OJIBWAY DIET .1. WALLEYE FILLETS AND SKIN-ON VERSUS SKIN-OFF SAMPLING
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION

CP  - 3rd International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant
AB  - During the past two years, walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) have been collected and prepared into skin-off fillets and submitted for total mercury analysis. The survey included 105 fish from 18 lakes in 10 counties in northern Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan. Fourteen lakes yielded walleye fillets with greater than 0.5 ppm mercury, and six lakes yielded samples in excess of 1.0 ppm mercury. Fourteen fish were collected in the spring and prepared as fillets ground up as either skin-on or skin-off samples. The difference in Hg was significant (T-14 = -3.26, p = 0.006) with skin-on fillets, resulting in an approximately 10% decrease in mercury concentrations. Results of this study suggest that by leaving the skin on the sample, mercury concentrations will be reported 10% lower than if the skin is removed Obviously, consumption advisories based on skin-off samples could provide more protection for Ojibwa people eating the spring harvest of walleye. In the fall, the difference in Hg samples between skin-on versus skin-off, was less and not statistically significant However, removal of the skin would be expected to underestimate lipophilic organochlorine burdens and may not be appropriate for fish species where PCBs, DDT, and chlordanes are the major concern. Fall data for 67 fish from 26 lakes in 9 counties are also reported.

AB  - In this work, an enzyme-responsive nanovehicle for improving captan (CAP) contact fungicide bioactivity and translocation in plant tissues was synthesized (CAP-MSNs-beta-glucan) by attaching beta-glucan to the outer surface of mesoporous silica nanoparticles. CAP-MSNs-beta-glucan properties were tested by FTIR, zeta-potential, DLS, XRD, TGA, FE-SEM, and HR-TEM. Cargo protection ability of CAP-MSNs-beta-glucan from photolysis and hydrolysis was examined in comparison to CAP commercial formulation (CAP-CF). CAP-MSNs-beta-glucan distribution in plant tissues, bioactivity against Fusarium graminearum, and biotoxicity toward zebrafish (Danio rerio) were tested and compared with that of CAP-CF. CAP-MSNs-beta-glucan results showed good loading efficacy reaching 18.39% and enzymatic-release dependency up to 83.8% of the total cargo after 20 days of beta-glucan unsealing. CAP-MSNs-beta-glucan showed significant release protection under pH changes. MSNs-beta-glucan showed excellent CAP protection from UV. CAP-MSNs-beta-glucan showed better distribution in corn tissues and 1.28 more inhibiting potency to Fusarium graminearum than CAP-CF. CAP-MSNs-beta-glucan showed 1.88 times lower toxicity than CAP-CF to zebrafish after 96 h of treatment. We recommend using such formulations to overcome shortcomings of contact fungicides and achieve better and sustainable farming.

AB  - The present study aims to assess the effects of 2,4-D herbicide on biotransformation and oxidative stress status of zebrafish larvae. Animals were exposed to a range of sublethal concentrations (0.02-0.8 mg/L) and biomarkers at transcriptomic level and biochemical level were assessed. Chemical analysis with showed that the bioaccumulation of 2,4-D in 96 hpf zebrafish larvae were increased in a concentrationdependent manner. This herbicide induced significant effects at both gene expression and enzymatic activities levels after at 96 hpf. Results of mRNA expression showed a differential transcription regulation with all target genes depending on the tested concentrations. The mRNA level of gsr and cyp1a were up regulated at the highest dose of herbicide (0.8 mg/L). The gene expression of gstp1 showed an up regulation at lower dose (0.02 mg/L) and a down regulation at the highest dose (0.8 mg/L) of 2,4-D. A significant induction of EROD activity and inhibition of GST activity were noted in groups exposed to 0.8 mg/L of 2,4-D. Considering the antioxidant defenses, the activity of CAT was increased in larvae exposed to 0.8 mg/L of herbicide and GPx activity was induced at lower doses of 2,4-D (0.02 and 0.051 mg/L). Moreover, peroxidative damage, assessed as MDA content, was markedly increased in larvae exposed to high 2,4-D concentration. Overall, the present study data indicate that bioaccumulation of 2,4-D in 96 hpf zebrafish larvae and alterations in detoxification and oxidative stress related parameters, likely associated with ROS production, which may endanger the embryo-larval stages development of fish.

AB  - Contaminant bioaccumulation dynamics was examined in young-of-the-year (YOY) bluefish subpopulations (Pomatomus saltatrix) in the New York Bight ecosystem, and the results were used to assess (i) effects of habitat quality in terms of levels of PCBs and pesticides on bluefish condition and (ii) fidelity of YOY bluefish to different subestuaries that served as the nurseries subsequent to recruitment during their first summer. Total PCBs and p,p'=-DDE body burdens increased with fish length, but concentrations generally increased only poorly to moderately, which suggested steady-state contaminant uptake commensurate with aggressive feeding and dilution related to rapid growth characteristic of YOY bluefish within a subestuary. High condition factors paired with elevated contamination levels in bluefish from the Lower Hudson River, as compared with bluefish from Newark Bay with poor condition factors paired with elevated contamination levels, suggested that PCBs and pesticides alone may not determine condition in these fish. We found dissimilar patterns of prominent PCB congeners in bluefish from adjacent subestuaries (e.g., Newark Bay and Lower Hudson River) suggesting separate contaminant sources. Total PCB normalized fingerprints of PCB congeners permitted statistical discrimination among YOY bluefish specimens from various estuaries with a potential to differentiate subpopulations on scales to less than 20 km. This unexpected fidelity to nursery estuaries may have implications for the management strategies.

AB  - Fish consumption is the principal source of intake of organochlorinated compounds in humans. Compared with other types of foods of animal origin, fish contain the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, all of which are classified as highly toxic organochlorine compounds. Currently, lakes and fish farms in northern Italy are not regularly monitored for PCBs and dioxins in areas contaminated by industrial sources, partially because of the high costs of traditional analytical methods that limit the number of samples to be analyzed. The DR-CALUX cell bioassay is based on the uptake of the cellular aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. The aim of this study was to assess the levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCB contamination in Lake Maggiore and Lake Como, two lakes in northwestern Italy, and in nearby areas. The levels were quantified using the cell bioassay DR-CALUX and reference controls in two wild fish species, perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus), and in a farmed species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Tissue samples collected from the fanned rainbow trout were also submitted to immunohistochemical analysis of CYP1A expression as a marker for environmental pollutant-induced liver damage. The levels of dioxins, furans, and dioxin-like PCBs were all below the maximum levels and action limits set by European Union Regulation, suggesting no risk for human health associated with the consumption of the fish species caught or farmed in these areas.

AB  - Our studies focused on assessing the effectiveness of the heterogeneous photocatalysis method (TiO2/UV) and examining the feasibility of photocatalysis coupling with hydrogen peroxide in the treatment of oily industrial wastewater. Our oily water sample was taken from the de-oiling Haoud Berkaoui station entering, which is located 770km in southern of Algiers); the AOPs investigated are TiO2/UV (photocatalysis) and TiO2/UV/Fe2+/H2O2 (photocatalysis-Fenton's reagent). This method is used as an alternative or in addition to the conventional treatment techniques (coagulation-flocculation-decantation and filtration...etc). In this work, first we copulated between the two photocatalytic methods (TiO2/UV) and the Fenton's reagent (H2O2/Fe+2) and then we studied the effect of various experimental factors on the treatment process: pH, initial concentration for each of the TiO2, H2O2, Fe2+, and oil pollutants and finally temperature. The study showed a marked improvement in efficiency on the treated water quality in terms of color, turbidity, and COD under optimized conditions (oil concentration, quantity of catalysts, temperature, Fenton's reagent concentration, and the pH of the solution).

AB  - The olfactory system of salmonids is sensitive to the adverse effects of metals such as copper and cadmium. In the current study, we analyzed olfactory-mediated alarm responses, epithelial injury and recovery, and a suite of olfactory molecular biomarkers encoding genes critical in maintaining olfactory function in juvenile coho salmon receiving acute exposures to cadmium (Cd). The molecular biomarkers analyzed included four G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) representing the two major classes of odorant receptors (salmon olfactory receptor sorb and vomeronasal receptors svra, svrb, and gpr27), as well as markers of neurite outgrowth (nrn1) and antioxidant responses to metals, including heme oxygenase 1 (hmox1), and peroxiredoxin 1 (prdx1). Coho received acute (8-168 h) exposures to 3.7 ppb and 347 ppb Cd, and a subset of fish was analyzed following a 16-day depuration. Coho exposed to 347 ppb Cd over 48 h exhibited a reduction in freeze responses, and an extensive loss of olfaction accompanied by histological injury to the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory injury in coho exposed to 347 ppb Cd was accompanied at the gene level by significant decreases in expression of the olfactory GPCRs and increased expression of hmoxl. Persistent behavioral deficits, histological injury and altered expression of a subset of olfactory biomarkers were still evident in Cd-exposed coho following a 16-day depuration in clean water. Exposure to 3.7 ppb Cd also resulted in reduced freeze responses and histological changes to the olfactory epithelium within 48 h of Cd exposure, although the extent of olfactory injury was less severe than observed for fish in the high dose Cd group. Furthermore adverse behavioral effects were present in some coho receiving the low dose of Cd following a 16-day depuration. In summary, acute exposures to environmental levels of Cd can cause olfactory injury in coho salmon that may persist following depuration. Mechanism-based biomarkers of oxidative stress and olfactory structures can augment the evaluation of olfactory injury manifested at the physiological level. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Non-biodegradable, bioaccumulative, and highly toxic, mercury(II) poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and human health. Extensive data indicates that even extremely low levels of Hg(II) can cause significant harm to human health. In this paper, the thiocarbonate specific recognition site was used for the detection of Hg(II), which was successfully synthesized by the hydroxyl group of 1,3,5-Triazine with phenyl chlorothiocarbonate. The probe exhibited advantages of high sensitivity (0.253 mu M), good selectivity, large Stokes shift (100 nm), and good biocompatibility. The probe TzAr-Nap-Hg successfully fluorescently imaged Hg(II) in cells, zebrafish and tobacco, making it possible to detect the content of Hg(II) in agricultural and sideline products.

AB  - The serine protease Htra (DegP), which is indispensable for cell survival at elevated temperatures, is a peripheral membrane protein, localized on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane in Escherichia coli, and the biochemical and genetic evidence indicates that the physiological role of HtrA is to degrade denatured proteins formed in the cellular envelope during heat shock. The aim of this study was to find out if the HtrA protease contributes to protection of the cell against oxidative stress. We compared the influence of various oxidizing agents on htrA mutant cells with their effects on wild-type bacteria, and found that the htr A mutation did not increase sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide or paraquat but made the cell extremely sensitive to ferrous [Fe(II)] ions, which are known to enhance oxidation of proteins. Treatment with ferrous ions caused a larger increase in the level of protein carbonyl groups in the membrane fraction of the cell than in the periplasm and cytoplasm. Iron-induced oxidation of membrane proteins was enhanced in the htrA mutant relative to wild-type cells. Inhibition of the growth of the htrA mutant by iron could be alleviated more efficiently by a nitroxide antioxidant that localizes in the membranes (A-TEMPO) than by a derivative (40H-TEM-PO) that acts mainly in the soluble fraction of the cell. Inhibition of the growth of the htrA mutant was more pronounced following treatment with cumene hydroperoxide, which partitions into membranes, than with t-butyl hydroperoxide, which forms radical mainly in the cytosol. Both ferrous ions and cumene hydroperoxide, but not hydrogen peroxide, paraquat or t-butyl hydroperoxide, induced synthesis of HtrA. Our results show that HtrA plays a role in defense against oxidative shock and support the hypothesis that HtrA participates in the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins localized in the cell envelope, especially those associated with the membranes.

AB  - Edwardsiella piscicida is an important pathogenic bacterium that causes hemorrhagic septicemia in fish. This bacterium could activate NLRC4 and NLRP3 inflammasomes via type III secretion system (T3SS), and inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome via type VI secretion system (T6SS) effector during infection in macrophages. However, the roles of other virulence factors in regulating inflammasome activation during E. piscicida infection remain poorly understood. In this study, we focused on clarification the role of ETAE_RS10155, a thioredoxin-like protein (Trxlp), during bacterial infection in macrophages. We found that mutation of this gene barely influences the bacteria growth and infection capability. Interestingly, the inflammasome activation was reduced in Delta trxlp-infected macrophages, compared with wild-type E. piscicida did. Moreover, Trxlp mainly promotes the NLRC4, but not NLRP3 inflammasome activation during E. piscicida infection. Finally, Trxlp-mediated NLRC4 inflammasome activation is crucial for host surveillance in vivo. Taken together, our results clarify the complex and contextual role of bacterial virulence effector in modulating inflanunasome activation, and offer new insights into the warfare between the fish bacterial weapons and host innate immunological surveillance.

AB  - There is a growing recognition of the challenges associated with ensuring good nutrition for all without compromising the environment. This is particularly true for aquaculture, given the reliance on marine extraction for key feed ingredients, yet at the same time it delivers key nutrients such as omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. This review will consider progress in transitioning away from oceanic-derived fish oils as feed ingredients, focusing on the emerging transgenic plant sources of these fatty acids. Specific consideration is given to the "validation" phase of this process, in which oils from GM plants are used as substitutes for bona fide fish oils in aqua -feed diets. Equally, consideration is given to the demonstration of "real-world" potential by GM field trials. Collectively, the status of these new plant-based sources of omega-3 fish oils confirm the arrival of a new wave of plant biotech products, 25 years after the introduction of herbicide-tolerant input traits and demonstrate the power of GM agriculture to contribute to food security and operating within planetary boundaries.

AB  - Novel haptens were designed and synthesized to prepare antibodies against free histamine, but none resulted in producing suitable antibodies for developing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, an antiserum was obtained having high specificity and affinity to p-nitrobenzoylated histamine (NPHA), which can be easily formed from reaction between histamine and p-nitrobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PNBA-OSu) under mild conditions. Based on rabbit polyclonal antibodies, a competitive indirect ELISA (ciELISA) for histamine determination in foods was developed. After ciELISA and derivatization optimization, the assay showed good sensitivity, with limits of detection of 1.8 mg/kg, 93.6 mu g/L, and 93.6 mu g/kg in fish, red wine, and yoghurt, respectively, with negligible cross-reactivity with related biogenic amines and amino acids. Average recovery of histamine in fortified food samples ranged from 80.9% to 110.1% with coefficients of variation below 16.3%. Good correlation between the ciELISA and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was obtained for spiked food samples.

AB  - The electrochemical detection of methyl parathion in fish was performed by preconcentrating the pesticide on magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer and further readout on magneto-actuated electrode by square wave voltammetry. The magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer was synthesized by a magnetic core-shell strategy, using methacrylic acid as a functional monomer, and selected by theoretical calculation using the density functional theory (DFT). The characterization of this material was performed by SEM, TEM and XRD. Moreover, the binding capacity and selectivity towards methyl parathion was studied and compared with the corresponding magnetic non-imprinted polymer. The magneto-actuated electrochemical sensor showed outstanding analytical performance for the detection of methyl parathion in fish, with a limit of detection of as low as 1.22 x 10(-6) mg L-1 and recovery values ranging from 89.4% to 94.7%. The magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer successfully preconcentrated the analyte from the complex samples and paves the way to incorporate this material in other platforms for the detection of this pesticide in the field of environmental control and food safety.

AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are vectors of important parasites and pathogens causing death, poverty and social disability worldwide, with special reference to tropical and subtropical countries. The overuse of synthetic insecticides to control mosquito vectors lead to resistance, adverse environmental effects and high operational costs. Therefore, the development of eco-friendly control tools is an important public health challenge. In this study, the mosquito larvicidal activity of Pinus kesiya leaf essential oil (EO) was evaluated against the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and the lymphatic filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The chemical composition of the EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. GC-MS revealed that the P. kesiya EO contained 18 compounds. Major constituents were alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, myrcene and germacrene D. In acute toxicity assays, the EO showed significant toxicity against early third-stage larvae of An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, with LC50 values of 52, 57, and 62 mu g/ml, respectively. Notably, the EO was safer towards several aquatic non-target organisms Anisops bouvieri, Diplonychus indicus and Gambusia affinis, with LC50 values ranging from 4135 to 8390 mu g/ml. Overall, this research adds basic knowledge to develop newer and safer natural larvicides from Pinaceae plants against malaria, dengue and filariasis mosquito vectors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Novel multi-walled carbon nanotube modified dummy-template molecularly imprinted microspheres (MWCNTs@DMMIPs) were successfully synthesized as adsorbents for six kinds of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). MWCNTs@DMMIPs were prepared by a surface molecular imprinting technique. Core-shell Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles were employed as magnetic support. 3,4-Dichlorobenzene acetic acid was used as a dummy template instead of PCBs, methacrylic acid was used as functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate was used as the cross-linker. The resulting absorbent was characterized by various methods. The adsorbent was employed for extracting PCBs and exhibited good selectivity and high adsorption efficiency. Furthermore, it was reusable and capable of magnetic separation. Adsorption kinetics fit well with a pseudo-second-order kinetic equation and also exhibited a three-stage intra-particle diffusion model. The Freundlich model was used to describe the adsorption isotherms. The materials were successfully applied to the magnetic dispersive solid-phase extraction of six kinds of PCBs followed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry determination in fish samples, the limit of detection of six kinds of PCBs were 0.0028-0.0068 mu g/L and spiked recoveries ranged between 73.41 and 114.21%. The prepared adsorbent was expected to be a new material for the removal and recovery of PCBs from contaminated foods.

AB  - Chemical and biological contaminants are of primary concern in ensuring seafood safety. Rapid detection of such contaminants is needed to keep us safe from being affected. For over three decades, immunoassay (IA) tech-nology has been used for the detection of contaminants in seafood products. However, limitations inherent to antibody generation against small molecular targets that cannot elicit an immune response, along with the instability of antibodies under ambient conditions greatly limit their wider application for developing robust detection and monitoring tools, particularly for non-biomedical applications. As an alternative, aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) have emerged as a powerful yet robust analytical tool for the detection of a wide range of analytes. Due to the high specificity of aptamers in recognising targets ranging from small molecules to large proteins and even whole cells, these have been suggested to be viable molecular recognition elements (MREs) in the development of new diagnostic and biosensing tools for detecting a wide range of contaminants including heavy metals, antibiotics, pesticides, pathogens and biotoxins. In this review, we discuss the recent progress made in the field of aptasensors for detection of contaminants in seafood products with a view of effectively managing their potential human health hazards. A critical outlook is also provided to facilitate translation of aptasensors from academic laboratories to the mainstream seafood industry and consumer applications.

AB  - The EcoToxChip project includes RNA-sequencing data from experiments involving model (Japanese quail, fathead minnow, African clawed frog) and ecological (double-crested cormorant, rainbow trout, northern leopard frog) species at multiple life stages (whole embryo and adult) exposed to eight chemicals of environmental concern known to perturb a wide range of biological systems (ethinyl estradiol, hexabromocyclododecane, lead, selenomethionine, 17 beta trenbolone, chlorpyrifos, fluoxetine, and benzo[a]pyrene). The objectives of this short communication were to (1) present and make available this RNA-sequencing database (i.e., 724 samples from 49 experiments) under the FAIR principles (FAIR data are data which meet principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability), while also summarizing key meta-data attributes and (2) use ExpressAnalyst (including the Seq2Fun algorithm and EcoOmicsDB) to perform a comparative transcriptomics analysis of this database focusing on baseline and differential transcriptomic changes across species-life stage-chemical combinations. The database is available in NCBI GEO under accession number GSE239776. Across all species, the number of raw reads per sample ranged between 13 and 58 million, with 30% to 79% of clean reads mapped to the "vertebrate" subgroup database in EcoOmicsDB. Principal component analyses of the reads illustrated separation across the three taxonomic groups as well as some between tissue types. The most common differentially expressed gene was CYP1A1 followed by CTSE, FAM20CL, MYC, ST1S3, RIPK4, VTG1, and VIT2. The most common enriched pathways were metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of cofactors and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and chemical carcinogenesis, drug metabolism, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. The RNA-sequencing database in the present study may be used by the research community for multiple purposes, including, for example, cross-species investigations, in-depth analyses of a particular test compound, and transcriptomic meta-analyses.

TI  - CCQM-K146 low-polarity analyte in high fat food: benzo[a]pyrene in olive oil
T2  - METROLOGIA
LA  - English
AB  - The demonstration of competency and equivalence for the assessment of levels of contaminants and nutrients in primary foodstuffs is a priority within the 10-year strategy for the CCQM Organic Analysis WG series of Track A core comparisons. The area of low polarity analytes in high fat foods had not been covered by the OAWG for many years since the key comparison CCQM-K21 p,p'-DDT in fish oil occurring in 2000.
   Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is one of the markers for the occurrence of PAHs in foods, for which maximum residue limits are enforced in many countries. Edible oil and fats are the main source of human PAH intake. BaP may form in edible oils by pyrolytic processes, such as incomplete combustion of organic substances. Worldwide regulatory limits of BaP in edible fats and oils are from 2.0 mu g/kg to 10 mu g/kg. Comparable and traceable measurement results for BaP in oil are important worldwide. Thus BaP in edible oil was the model system selected to align within the OAWG strategy.
   16 NMIs and DIs participated in CCQM-K146. Different methods such as liquid-liquid extraction, GPC and SPE were applied in the sample pre-treatment and HPLC-FLD, HPLCMS/MS, and GC-MS or GC-MS/MS were applied for detection by the participants. Most participants either used their own CRMs, other NMI's CRMs or pure materials assessed in house to guarantee traceability to SI for the calibrants. One lab was excluded from the KCRV evaluation, as they did not meet the CIPM metrological traceability requirements for their calibrant. Regarding the data evaluation, five labs withdrew their results from the statistical evaluation of the KCRV for technical reasons. In line with the OAWG guidance document for KCRV estimator selection, the Hierarchical Bayes option was selected for the KCRV value, which was determined as 2.74 mu g/kg with a standard uncertainty of 0.03 mu g/kg. The remaining ten institutes that were included in the calculation of the consensus KCRV all agreed within their standard uncertainties.
   In general, the majority of CCQM-K146 participants performed very well. Therefore, this Track A Key Comparison directly illustrates the capabilities in determining mass fraction of organic compounds, with molecular mass of 100 g/mol to 500 g/mol, having low polarity pKow < -2, in mass fraction range from 0.1 mu g/kg to 1000 mu g/kg in a high fat, low protein, low carbohydrate food matrix.

AB  - Previous studies with olfactory-disturbing pesticides resulted after exposure in disturbed behavior and physiology in fish. In the present experiment, reproductive behavior and milt volumes of precocious brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) male parr were studied in a large stream aquarium after exposure to the olfactory-disturbing fungicide 15 mu g l(-1) IPBC (iodocarb; 3-iodo-2-propynyl butyl carbamate) for 96 h. The statistical analyses did not reveal any significant differences for time attending females between controls and IPBC-exposed males. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in milt volumes. However, when taking all fish into consideration, there were significant differences in milt volumes between parr that had been attending females and those had not been attending females. Controls that had attended females had significantly higher milt volumes than controls or IPBC-exposed males that had not attended females. Taking all control and IPBC parr into consideration, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between time attended females and volume of milt and gonadosomatic index (GSI), respectively. In summary, 15 mu g l(-1) IPBC did not have any significant effects on mature male parr reproductive behavior and milt volumes.

AB  - The use of an integrative molecular approach can actively improve the evaluation of environmental health status and impact of chemicals, providing the knowledge to develop sentinel tools that can be integrated in risk assessment studies, since gene and protein expressions represent the first response barriers to anthropogenic stress.
   This work aimed to determine the mechanisms of toxic action of a widely applied fungicide formulation (chlorothalonil), following a time series approach and using a soil model arthropod, Folsomia candida. To link effects at different levels of biological organization, data were collected on reproduction, gene expression and protein levels, in a time series during exposure to a natural soil.
   Results showed a mechanistic mode of action for chlorothalonil, affecting pathways of detoxification and excretion, immune response, cellular respiration, protein metabolism and oxidative stress defense, causing irregular cell signaling (JNK and NOD 'A pathways), DNA damage and abnormal cell proliferation, leading to impairment in developmental features such as molting cycle and reproduction. The omics datasets presented highly significant positive correlations between the gene expression levels at a certain time-point and the corresponding protein products 2-3 days later. The integrated omics in this study has provided useful insights into pesticide mechanisms of toxicity, evidencing the relevance of such analyses in toxicological studies, and highlighting the importance of considering a time-series when integrating these datasets.

AB  - In this study, a comprehensive investigation was performed to understand the overall occurrence, relative distribution, and bioaccumulation of seven different groups of POPs, comprising 27 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 76 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 23 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), three hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), and 13 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) as legacy POPs, and 41 polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) and 24 short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) as emerging POPs, by monitoring crucian carp, sediment, and river water in the freshwater system. Among the targeted POPs, SCCPs were predominant in sediment and crucian carp (more than 95%), while a dominance of PFASs was observed in river water (92%). Principal component analysis revealed four different groups/patterns of POPs in all media: one for PBDEs, PCBs, and OCPs, another for HBCDs and PFASs, and the two others for PCNs and SCCPs. Also, sexually dimorphic growth-dependent accumulation of legacy POPs was observed in crucian carp such that POPs concentration increased with increasing fish size and males recorded significantly higher levels of POPs compared to females.

AB  - Coastal elasmobranchs are vulnerable to chemicals mostly due to their k-strategic life history characteristics and high trophic positions. Embryos might be particularly exposed through the maternal offloading of contaminants, possibly leading to disruptions during critical developmental phases. Yet, knowledge on biochemical outcomes of prenatal exposure in elasmobranchs is notably limited. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to contaminants in embryos of the critically endangered Brazilian guitarfish, Pseudobatos horkelii. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pharmaceuticals and per-sonal care products, and metals were determined in embryos. Additionally, glutathione S-transferase activity (GST), glutathione (GSH), and metallothionein levels (MT) were analyzed. Finally, lipid peroxidation levels (LPO) and protein carbonyl groups (PCO) were assessed. Embryonic exposure depended on yolk consumption, which was conspicuous in earlier development. We observed a dilution effect of contaminants levels, potentially related to biotransformation of these compounds throughout the embryonic development. Nevertheless, GST was not correlated to contaminant concentrations. The multivariate relationship between antioxidant components (GSH and GST) and LPO and PCO was negative, suggesting the lack of efficient defense of these biomarkers in early development, leading to oxidative damage. In this context, our results indicate that prenatal exposure to contaminants might impact the redox status in embryos of P. horkelii, leading to oxidative damage. Furthermore, metal concentrations influenced MT levels, suggesting this as a potential detoxification pathway in this species.

AB  - Galectin-8 and galectin-9 belong to tandem repeat-type galectins, and in the present study, these two genes were cloned in mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi. The open reading frame (ORF) of the mandarin fish galectin-8 and galectin-9 contains 942, and 1008 bp, encoding 313 and 335 amino acids, respectively. As a conserved feature, an N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), and a C-terminal CRD were observed in each of the two galectins in mandarin fish. In healthy fish, galectin-8 and -9 were constitutively expressed in all organs/tissues examined, and their expression can be induced following the stimulation of LPS and poly(I:C). It is obvious that galectin-8 had a higher increase at mRNA level following the stimulation of poly(I:C). It is further demonstrated that mandarin fish galectin-8 inhibited the growth of Flavobacterium columnare and Streptococcus agalactiae, and in addition to the two species of bacteria, galectin-9 inhibited also the growth of Edwardsiella piscicida, which provides the basis for further understanding their antibacterial role in immune response of mandarin fish.

AB  - The initial host response to fungal pathogen invasion is critical to infection establishment and outcome. However, the diversity of leukocyte-pathogen interactions is only recently being appreciated. We describe a new form of interleukocyte conidial exchange called "shuttling." In Talaromyces marneffei and Aspergillus fumigatus zebrafish in vivo infections, live imaging demonstrated conidia initially phagocytosed by neutrophils were transferred to macrophages. Shuttling is unidirectional, not a chance event, and involves alterations of phagocyte mobility, intercellular tethering, and phagosome transfer. Shuttling kinetics were fungal-species-specific, implicating a fungal determinant. beta-glucan serves as a fungal-derived signal sufficient for shuttling. Murine phagocytes also shuttled in vitro. The impact of shuttling for microbiological outcomes of in vivo infections is difficult to specifically assess experimentally, but for these two pathogens, shuttling augments initial conidial redistribution away from fungicidal neutrophils into the favorable macrophage intracellular niche. Shuttling is a frequent host-pathogen interaction contributing to fungal infection establishment patterns.

AB  - Nisin is an antimicrobial peptide with bacterial, fungicidal, virucidal properties, attacking bacteria and destroying the cell membranes. Thanks to its stability to hard conditions, it is a candidate for the use as molecular recognition elements in biosensing platform. In this work, the use of nisin as a biological molecule for the development of a sensitive biosensor for bacteria detection is reported: nisin molecules were immobilised on gold electrodes and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy was to investigate the electrochemical responses after the exposure of the biosensor to different bacteria. The biosensor was able to detect all bacterium tested with different impedimetric responses; the singular impedimetric behaviours recorded after the exposure to pathogenic and non - pathogenic Salmonella strains, highlighted the possibility of the proposed biosensor to detect selectively Salmonella cells with a low limit of detection of 1.5* 10(1) CFU/mL. Finally, the developed biosensor was used to detect Salmonella in milk.

AB  - Chlorinated fatty acids represent a recently discovered group of potentially hazardous organochlorine pollutants in the environment. The ability of human cells to incorporate and metabolise this type of fatty acids has never been investigated. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate if two human cell lines, INT 407 and SH-SY5Y, incorporate and metabolise extracellular dichlorostearic acid. Cells were incubated with 9,10-dichlorostearic acid for 24 hr, and the amounts of chlorinated fatty acids in cells and culture medium analysed every two days for up to 6 or 10 days. Lipids were separated by solid phase extraction, transesterified to fatty acid methyl esters, and analysed by gas chromatography in combination with a halogen specific detector (GC/XSD). Dichlorostearic acid, dichloropalmitic acid and dichloromyristic acid were found in phospholipids and in neutral lipids of the INT 407 cells. Both cell lines secreted considerable amounts of dichloromyristic acid into the culture medium. Cellular or secreted metabolites shorter than dichloromyristic acid were not Found. Taken together, the results suggest that human cells may(I) incorporate chlorinated fatty acids into membrane lipids and storage lipids, (2) metabolise cellular dichlorostearic acid to dichloropalmitic acid and dichloromyristic acid by beta -oxidation; but that further metabolism is hindered, possibly because of the chlorine atoms, and (3) remove formed dichloromyristic acid by secretion. The removal of cellular dichloromyristic acid might represent an important cellular defence mechanism and deserves further investigations.

AB  - There is a trend toward the increased incidence and prevalence of Edwardsiella piscicida septicemia in US catfish aquaculture, particularly in channel female, Ictalurus punctatus, x blue male, I. furcatus, hybrid catfish. From 2013 to 2017, a total of 3242 disease case submissions were made to the Aquatic Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (ARDL) at the Thad Cochran National Warmwater Aquaculture Center in Stoneville, MS. Of these, 1400 (43.2%) were hybrids. E. piscicida was suspected in 138 (4.3%) of cases, the majority of which (89.1%) were from hybrid catfish. A molecular survey of these isolates confirmed the majority (92.0%) to be E. piscicida. Furthermore, cases of E. piscicida from hybrids submitted to the ARDL and the Aquatic Diagnostic Laboratory of the Mississippi State University College of Veterinary Medicine in Starkville, MS, were documented for gross lesions and histological analysis. Grossly, E. piscicida presents with small dermal ulcerations, a raised fluid-filled cranial midline lesion that is frequently ulcerated, hemorrhage in the gills, exophthalmia, and abdominal distension. Internally, lesions include splenomegaly, straw-colored ascites, renomegaly, and occasionally hemorrhagic intestines. Histopathological examination is in agreement with gross observations, and infected fish repeatedly demonstrate a mononuclear meningoencephalitis, hemorrhagic branchitis, splenitis, ulcerative dermatitis, granulomatous interstitial nephritis, and hepatitis coupled with a hemorrhagic enteritis.

AB  - Several environmental pollutants enhance the intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species, and can lead to the damage of macromolecules and a decrease in oxidant defences levels in fish. The effects of the herbicide oxyfluorfen on the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase were evaluated in freshwater fish Oreochromis niloticus. These were determined in tilapia liver exposed to sublethal concentrations (0.3 and 0.6 mg/L at 7, 14, and 21 days of exposure. This study also analyzed the effects of oxyfluorfen on the total fatty acid profile. The results showed that CAT activity was higher in tilapia exposed to oxyfluorfen at the sampling days, except at the highest concentration after 21 days. Similarly, the enhancing effect of the herbicide was observed on the GR activity. However, its effect was moderate at the highest dose. On the contrary, fish treated with oxyfluorfen at both doses displayed a decrease in the SOD activity. After 7 days of treatment at both concentrations tilapia showed a significant increase in GST levels, although the enzymatic activity decreased at 14 and 21 days of exposition when compared with the control. The major saturated fatty acids measured in tilapia liver were the palmitic acid (C16:0;17.9%) and stearic acid (C18:0; 8.7%). The exposure to oxyfluorfen caused a significant increase of the oleic acid (C18:1), whereas the amount of nervonic acid (C24:1) increased at all sampling data. The results of the present study should be taken in account when using tilapia as an environmental indicator species in studies of xenobiotic biotransformation and biomarker response, as well as in monitoring programmes.

AB  - The potential effects of pesticides and their metabolites on the endocrine system are of major concern to wildlife and human health. In this context, the azole pesticides have earned special attention due to their cytochrome P450 aromatase inhibition potential. Cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19) catalyses the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into oestrone and oestradiol, respectively. Thus, aromatase modulates the oestrogenic balance essential not only for females, but also for male physiology, including gonadal function. Its inhibition affects reproductive organs, fertility and sexual behaviour in humans and wildlife species. Several studies have shown that azole pesticides are able to inhibit human and fish aromatases but the information on birds is lacking. Consequently, it appeared to be of interest to estimate the aromatase inhibition of azoles in three different avian species, namely Gallus gallus, Coturnix coturnix japonica and Taeniopygia guttata. In the absence of the crystal structure of the aromatase enzyme in these bird species, homology models for the individual avian species were constructed using the crystal structure of human aromatase (hAr) (pdb: 3EQM) that showed high sequence similarity for G. gallus (82.0%), T. guttata (81.9%) and C. japonica (81.2%). A homology model with Oncorhynchus mykiss (81.9%) was also designed for comparison purpose. The homology-modelled aromatase for each avian and fish species and crystal structure of human aromatase were selected for docking 46 structurally diverse azoles and related compounds. We showed that the docking behaviour of the chemicals on the different aromatases was broadly the same. We also demonstrated that there was an acceptable level of correlation between the binding score values and the available aromatase inhibition data. This means that the homology models derived on bird and fish species can be used to approximate the potential inhibitory effects of azoles on their aromatase.

AB  - To screen the tens of thousands of chemicals for which no toxicity data currently exists, it is necessary to move from in vivo rodent models to alternative models, such as zebrafish. Here, we used dechorionated Tropical 5D wild-type zebrafish embryos to screen a 91-compound library provided by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) for developmental toxicity. This library contained 86 unique chemicals that included negative controls, flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), drugs, industrial chemicals, and pesticides. Fish were exposed to 5 concentrations of each chemical or an equal amount of vehicle (0.5% DMSO) in embryo medium from 6h post-fertilization (hpf) to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). Fish were examined daily for mortality and teratogenic effects and photomotor behavior was assessed at 4 and 5 dpf. Of the 5 negative control compounds in the library, none caused mortality/teratogenesis, but two altered behavior. Chemicals provided in duplicate produced similar outcomes. Overall, 13 compounds caused mortality/teratology but not behavioral abnormalities, 24 only affected behavior, and 18 altered both endpoints, with behavior affected at concentrations that did not cause mortality/teratology (55/86 hits). Of the compounds that affected behavior, 52% caused behavioral abnormalities at either 4 or 5 dpf. Compounds within the same functional group caused different behavioral abnormalities, while similar behavioral patterns were caused by compounds from different groups. Our data suggest that behavior is a sensitive endpoint for developmental toxicity screening that integrates multiple modes of toxic action and is influenced by the age of the larval fish at the time of testing.

AB  - Zebrafish Mate7 belongs to solute carrier protein superfamily and specifically to subfamily of multidrug and toxin extruders. It is co-orthologous to mammalian Mates, and is ubiquitously expressed in zebrafish tissues with the highest expression in kidney. It has been shown to interact with both endogenous (steroid hormones) and xenobiotic compounds (pharmaceuticals), implying a role in efflux of toxic compounds. The objective of our study was to analyse interaction of environmental contaminants with zebrafish Mate7 using a newly developed high throughput screening (HTS) Mate7 assay. A full-length zebrafish mate7 sequence was obtained from zebrafish cDNA originating from male kidney, and a stable expression of Mate7 in genetically engineered HEK293 Flp-In cells was achieved. Stable Mate7 transfectants were then used for development and optimization of a new HTS cellular uptake protocol, with DAPI and ASP + as model fluorescent substrates. The developed assay was used for identifying zebrafish Mate 7 interactors and discerning the type of interaction. A series of 89 diverse environmental contaminants, including industrial chemicals, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, was tested and highly effective Mate7 interactors were identified in all of the aforementioned groups. Some of the inhibitors identified could be of environmental concern because they may potentially impair Mate7 efflux function, lowering the fish defence capacity against environmental contaminants, or interfering with transport of yet unidentified physiological substrates. In addition, we found significant differences between zebrafish Mate7 and mammalian Mates' substrate preferences, a finding that should be taken into consideration when using zebrafish as a model organism in toxicokinetic studies.

AB  - As an organophosphate ester (OPE), triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) has been frequently detected in aquatic environments, and its environmental risk has been widely studied. The gills and intestines are the most important part of the mucosal immune barrier in fish as the first line of defense against the invasion of harmful substances. TPhP is more abundant in the gill and intestine of fish. However, knowledge of the toxic effects and potential mechanisms of TPhP on the intestine and gill is limited. Herein, the adverse effects of TPhP (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/ L) on the gills and intestines of zebrafish after 75 days of exposure were investigated from the perspectives of histology, oxidative stress and immune level. The histological results of exposed zebrafish showed that TPhP caused significant damage to gills and intestines. TPhP significantly increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and glutathione s-transferase (GST), inducing oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. Meanwhile, the immune function of the gills and intestines was significantly influenced by TPhP, as evidenced by the upregulation of the expression of interleukin-113 (IL-113) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), upregulation of the content of complement 3 (C3) and complement 4 (C4), and downregulation of the activity of lysozyme (LZM) and the content of immunoglobulin M (IgM). Oxidative stress and the immune response were more severe in the gills. These findings indicate that TPhP, a typical OPE, caused tissue damage in aquatic organisms by inducing oxidative stress and immune damage and has strong environmental toxicity.

AB  - Recent advances in communication and sensor technology have catalyzed progress in remote monitoring capabilities for water quality. As a result, the ability to characterize dynamic hydrologic properties at adequate temporal and spatial scales has greatly improved. These advances have led to improved statistical and mechanistic modeling in monitoring of water quality trends at local, watershed and regional scales for freshwater, estuarine and marine ecosystems. In addition, they have greatly enhanced rapid (e.g., real-time) detection of hydrologic variability, recognized as a critical need for early warning systems and rapid response to harmful algal bloom events. Here, we present some of the landmark developments and technological achievements that led to the advent of real-time remote monitors for hydrologic properties. We conclude that increased use and continuing advancements of real-time remote monitoring (RTRM) and sensing technologies will become a progressively more important tool for evaluating water quality. Recent engineering and deployment of RTRM technologies by federal and state regulatory agencies, industries, and academic laboratories is now permitting rapid detection of, and responses to, environmental threats imposed by increased nutrient loadings, development of hypoxic and anoxic areas, toxicants, and harmful algal bloom outbreaks leading to fish kill events and potential human health impacts.

AB  - Adverse health effects following prenatal exposures to methylmercury (MeHg) have been apparent from several prospective cohort studies conducted in a fish-eating population. A prospective study in a Faroese birth cohort documented subtle deficits of several functional domains at prenatal MeHg exposure levels previously thought to be safe. Recent additional studies also showed neurobehavioral deficits associated with exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with concomitant MeHg poisoning. In contrast, a prospective study in the Seychelles did not detect a similar association between MeHg exposure and neurodevelopmental deficits; children of the highest MeHg exposure group showed better scores in some developmental tests than those of the lower exposure groups for both prenatal and postnatal MeHg exposures. This paradoxical difference between both studies is summarized herein. The primary source of human exposure to MeHg is fish. Since a considerable number of pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides, are also present in fish, and since some organochemical substances including PCBs are also well documented to be neurotoxic to the developing brain from epidemiological studies, the combined effects of these pollutants should be considered in discussing the neurotoxicity of MeHg. In this article, therefore, major prospective cohort studies focusing on the exposures to PCBs were reviewed. (C) 2002 Tohoku University Medical Press.

AB  - Biosensors are devices that combine a biological recognition element with a transducer. The biological element has the property of recognizing and selectively interacting with the analyte. It can be used on the surface of the sensor micro-organisms, antibodies, nucleic acids, cells, organelles, proteins, enzymes, among others. The interaction results in the modification of one or more physical-chemical properties that are detected and measured by the transducer. The main objective is to produce an electronic signal proportional to the concentration of the analyte or analytes group that interact with the biological component. Applications of biosensors can be found in different areas of knowledge: livestock, food, agronomic and others. In the case of food quality analysis, biosensors are applied, particularly in the detection of chemical and biological contaminants, such as pesticides, antibiotics, and various micro-organisms. The advantages of biosensors over conventional techniques is not limited sensitivity and selectivity, but in the fact of usually dispenses a pre-treatment of the sample (practical), speed in analysis and minimum reagent costs, thus providing flexibility in obtaining the results and reduce of financial cost. Thus, this review aims to evaluate the application of biosensors in food samples and the progress of analytical methodology today.

KW  - MICROBIAL-PRODUCTION
AB  - 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a natural plant growth regulator, herbicide, insecticide, and photodynamic therapy drug, has various applications in agriculture and medicine. Currently, ALA mainly relies on chemical synthesis; however, this method is unsustainable and cannot meet the increasing demand because of its low yields. In this study, through phylogenetic analysis and the statistic of gene numbers downstream to hemA, we selected 4 candidate hemA genes with high potential for ALA production from genome sequences of 562 bacterial strains and found that hemA from Burkholderia caryophylli had the best effect on ALA production. Next, we found the match of HemA and homologous glutamyl-tRNA(Glu), and further properly overexpressing gltX and tRNA(Glu) increased glutamyl-tRNA(Glu) recognition by HemA. Moreover, through the rational combination of gene elements from B. caryophylli (hemA, tRNA(Glu)) and Salmonella typhimurium (gltX, hemL), optimizing the gene expression model, as well as E. coli hosts, the efficiency of ALA synthesis through the C5 pathway was significantly enhanced in engineered E. coli BurAt-SalSL1 (T7). Finally, we developed a whole-cell bioconversion system to produce ALA for the first time and 20.89 g ALA was obtained from 42.42 g glutamate with a conversion of 63.51% after six catalytic recycles. Overall, our study provides an alternative route for the green production of ALA.

AB  - Aim of this study was to investigate relationships between the red palm weevil (RPW) Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) and the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae (EPN); particularly, the work was focused on the immune response of the insect host in naive larvae and after infection with the EPN. Two main immunological processes have been addressed: the activity and modulation of host prophenoloxidase-phenoloxidase (proPO) system, involved in melanization of not-self and hemocytes recognition processes responsible for not-self encapsulation. Moreover, immune depressive and immune evasive strategies of the parasite have been investigated. Our results suggest that RPW possess an efficient immune system, however in the early phase of infection, S. carpocapsae induces a strong inhibition of the host proPO system. In addition, host cell-mediated mechanisms of encapsulation, are completely avoided by the parasite, the elusive strategies of S. carpocapsae seem to be related to the structure of its body-surface, since induced alterations of the parasite cuticle resulted in the loss of its mimetic properties. S. carpocapsae before the release of its symbiotic bacteria, depress and elude RPW immune defenses, with the aim to arrange a favorable environment for its bacteria responsible of the septicemic death of the insect target.

AB  - Edwardsiella piscicida is an important causative agent of hemorrhagic septicemia in fish and infects both cultured and wild fish species. Type VI secretion system (T6SS) was proved to play important roles in pathogenesis of E. piscicida. In this study, it was demonstrated that the expression of T6SS genes evpB and evpC was under control of the global regulator H-NS in E. piscicida and the transcriptional level of evpB and evpC was significantly down-regulated by H-NS. Compared to the wild type, the transcriptional levels of evpB and evpC were up-regulated in hns null mutant, while down-regulated in hns overexpression strain. The results of EMSA and DNase I footprinting revealed that H-NS protein directly bound to upstream region of evpC at multiple sites. A high-affinity motif with a 9-nucleotide sequence 5'-ATATAAAAT-3' was defined for H-NS preferential recognition based on the feature of the binding sites. These results indicated that H-NS acted cooperatively to form extended nucleoprotein filaments on target DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis of H-NS further showed that R86 played an essential role in T6SS gene binding. These findings highlighted the mechanisms underlying the complex regulation network of T6SS by H-NS in E. piscicida.

AB  - Albendazole (ABZ), a benzimidazole carbamate used for the treatment of several human helminthiases has high affinity for tubulin, which results in an inhibition of microtubule polymerization, blocking several vital processes in the parasites, such as motility and nutrient uptake. The ability of ABZ to act as mitotic spindle poison leads to a potential risk for aneuploidy induction in exposed human beings. ABZ, as well as albendazole sulphoxide (ABZSO), its main metabolite, induce micronuclei in human cells in a dose-dependent manner. Despite recognition that ABZ and ABZSO increase micronucleus frequency, their potential as inducers of non-disjunction in human cells, an event considered more frequent than chromosome loss, and one of the main mechanisms involved in aneuploidy induction, has not been evaluated. In the present work, we investigated the ability of ABZ and ABZSO to induce non-disjunction in cultured human lymphocytes. Non-disjunction was scored by chromosome-specific FISH using a classical or alpha satellite probe for chromosomes I and 7, respectively. Significant increase in non-disjunction events that involved either chromosome were observed in cells treated with ABZ or ABZSO. Both ABZ and ABZSO induced non-disjunction at lower concentrations than those at which MN were observed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Insecticide resistance survey is an in-situ biomonitoring method to assess potential impact of pesticides that exhibit direct economic consequences when leading to control failure of insect pest species. Nonetheless, the latter phenomenon is frequently neglected. Their spatial dependence and mapping are also seldom considered and when complexes of related pest species are involved, such as the rice stink bugs from the Neotropics, Oebalus poecilus, and O. ypsilongriseus, the scenario is even worst. Insecticide use is common against both species, particularly with the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, and despite suspicion of a shift in O. poecilus historical dominance and complaints of control failure, the role of this insecticide in this context was never tested. Thus, we screened populations from both species for thiamethoxam resistance within rice fields from central Brazil. The levels of thiamethoxam resistance and control failure likelihood were recorded and their spatial dependence was tested and geographically mapped. The thiamethoxam potency was similar between species, which also exhibited overlapping levels of resistance. Thus, this insecticide does not seem involved in eventual shifts in species dominance and the occurrence of O. ypsilongriseus is frequent. Thiamethoxam resistance was detected in both species, nearly half of the populations of O. poecilus and about a third of O. ypsilongriseus, but at low levels (< ten-fold). As a consequence, the risk of control failure with thiamethoxam was also low. Spatial dependence was significant for both species and phenomena (i.e., thiamethoxam resistance and control failure), prevailing in about the same area and likely reflecting the local pattern of insecticide use.

AB  - Jiyan-1 puffer, the F1 hybrid of Takifugu rubripes and Takifugu flavidus, displays obvious heterosis in the growth performance, flavor and stress tolerance. In the present study, comparative analysis for the transcriptomes of T. rubripes, T. flavidus and Jiyan-1 was performed aiming to reveal the possible mechanisms of heterosis in pufferfish. Whole transcriptomes were sequenced using the SOLiD4 platform, and a total of 44,305 transcripts corresponding to 18,164 genes were identified collectively. A total of 14,148 transcripts were differentially expressed. By comparing the gene expression patterns of the three samples, the coexistence of overdominance, dominance, underdominance and additivity was observed in the gene action modes of Jiyan-1. There were 2,237 transcripts in the intersection of the differentially expressed transcripts from Jiyan-1 versus T. rubripes and Jiyan-1 versus T. flavidus, among which 213 transcripts were also in the T. rubripes versus T. flavidus. The potential functions of the remaining 2,024 transcripts were mainly associated with metabolic process, nucleotide binding and catalytic activity. The enrichment results indicated metabolism was the most activated biological function in the heterosis. In addition, 35 KEGG pathways were retrieved as affiliated with more than three differentially expressed transcripts and 8,579 potentially novel transcript isoforms were identified for Jiyan-1. The present study revealed the coexistence of multiple gene actions in the hybrid puffer, indicated the importance of metabolism, ion binding function and kinase activity, as well as provided a list of candidate genes and pathways for heterosis. It could be helpful for the better understanding of the determination and regulation mechanisms of heterosis.

AB  - Organic pollutants in aquatic environment could have important implications on pollution stress on aquatic organisms and even on the risk of human exposure. Thus, revealing their occurrence in aquatic environment is essential for water quality monitoring and ecological risk purposes. In this study, a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography connected with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOF-MS) was applied, to enable non-target and target analysis of pollutants in the Yongding River Basin. Based on the isotopic patterns, accurate masses and standard substances, certain environmental contaminants were tentatively iden-tified which including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), phenols, amines, etc. The compounds with the highest concentration were naphthalene (109.0 ng/L), 2,3-benzofuran (51.5 ng/L) and 1,4-dichlorobenzene (35.9 ng/L) in Guishui River. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) dis-charges were a main source of pollutants in Yongding River Basin, as the types of compounds screened in the downstream river were relatively similar to those from WWTPs. According to the target analysis, a number of pollutants were selected due to the acute toxicity and cumulative discharge from WWTPs and downstream rivers. Three PAHs (naphthalene, Benzo(b)fluoranthene and pyrene) homologues showed moderate risk to fish and H. Azteca in Yongding River Basin, while the rest of the measured chemicals showed low ecological impact across the entire study area based on the risk assessment. The results are helpful for understanding the necessity of high-throughput screening analysis for assessing water quality of rivers and the discharge emissions of pollutants from WWTPs to the river environment.

AB  - Background: Characterizing the breeding site of Anopheles sinensis is of major importance for the transition from malaria control to elimination in China. However, little information is available especially regarding the characteristics and influencing factors of breeding sites of An. sinensis in Yongcheng City, a representative region of unstable malaria transmission in the Huang-Huai River region of central China. The aims of this study were to determine the breeding site characteristics of An. sinensis and related environmental and physicochemical parameters, to find out which breeding site characteristics could best explain the presence of An. sinensis larvae, and to determine whether the breeding habit of An. sinensis has changed or not.
   Methods: Random repeated cross sectional study was undertaken in six villages of the Yongcheng city characterized by different levels of the historical incidence of P. vivax malaria. The potential breeding sites of An. sinensis larvae in each village were examined twice per month both in the household courtyards and the village surroundings. The larval sampling was done by the standard dipping method. Some important breeding site characterizations were recorded and characterized. The anopheline mosquito larvae and emerged adults were identified to the species level morphologically and to sub-species by the ribosomal DNA PCR technique. Chi-square analysis and logistic regression analysis were applied to determine the importance of factors for explaining the presence or absence of An. sinensis larvae.
   Results: According to the ribosomal DNA PCR assay, all sampled anopheline mosquito larvae and emerged adults belonged to An. sinensis. Only 3 containers that were sampled from the household courtyards were found to contain An. sinensis larvae. There were no differences in the species composition of mosquito larvae among containers that contained water in the household courtyards (P > 0.05). An. sinensis larvae were shown to be present in a total of 60 breeding sites in the village surroundings, this included 8 (13.3%) river fringes, 26 (43.3%) ponds, 23 (38.3%) puddles, and 3 (5.0%) irrigation/drainage ditches. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the breeding site type, water depth, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen, and sulphate were found to be the key factors determining the presence of An. sinensis larvae. Approximately 94.9% of An. sinensis larvae inhabited relatively large and medium-sized water bodies, with depths between 0.5 m and 1.0 m (73.3%), COD lower than 2 mg/L (75%), ammonia nitrogen lower than 0.4 mg/L (86.7%), and sulphate lower than 150 mg/L (58.3%), respectively.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that the majority of An. sinensis larval breeding sites were relatively large and medium-sized water bodies with depths between 0.5 m and 1.0 m, and containing low levels of COD, ammonia nitrogen, and sulphate, respectively. For effective An. sinensis larval control, the type of breeding site, water depth, COD, ammonia nitrogen, and sulphate should be given higher priority over other factors in areas where it is the primary vector.

AB  - Triadimenol is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triadimenol in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 29 May 2006. The peer review was initiated on 30 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer Crop Science AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the attached list of endpoints.
   Since clarification is required with respect to certain impurities, the specification for the technical material as a whole should be regarded as provisional for the moment.
   The representative formulated products for the evaluation were "Bayfidan EC 250", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 250 g/L triadimenol and "Baytan FS 094" a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) containing 75 g/L triadimenol, 9 g/L fuberidazole and 10 g/L imazalil.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor triadimenol residues in food/feed of plant origin, soil, water and air.
   In mammals, triadimenol is harmful to rats via the oral route (R22 "Harmful if swallowed" proposed); it is not acutely toxic via the dermal and inhalation routes, nor is a skin or eye irritant; it is not a skin sensitiser. In repeated dose studies liver is the target, with enlargement of the liver and related clinical chemistry changes. The relevant short term toxicity NOAELs are 9 and 15 mg/kg bw/day, in rats and dogs, respectively, whereas the relevant long term toxicity and carcinogenicity NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day. Triadimenol does not have genotoxic and carcinogenic potential. The relevant parental and reproductive NOAEL in multigeneration studies is 6 mg/kg bw/day, and the relevant offspring NOAEL 9 mg/kg bw/day. Reduced pup survival in the multigeneration study during lactation period was noted. Furthermore, a decrease in fertility index was noted in all matings (all generations) in one study, possibly linked to the aromatase inhibition seen in an in vitro study. Therefore R64 "May cause harm to breastfed babies" and R62 "Possible risk of impaired fertility" were considered as appropriate (to be confirmed by EChA). As for developmental toxicity, in several rat developmental toxicity studies inconsistent effects which could be considered adverse were found (e.g. cervical and lumbar extra ribs). Placental weight was increased in the rats indicating that the substance might be an endocrine disruptor. A range of skeletal findings was seen at slight maternal toxic dose levels. R63? "Possible risk of harm to the unborn child" was proposed for consideration by EChA. Relevant maternal NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day and 25 mg/kg bw/day in rat and rabbit, respectively, and relevant developmental toxicity NOAEL is 15 mg/kg bw/day and 40 mg/kg bw/day (rat and rabbit). Based on similar neurotoxic potential of triadimenol and triadimefon2, data from the latter were used, showing a NOAEL of 2 mg/kg bw for acute exposure (reversible hyperactivity and increased motor and locomotor activity in rats, no neuropathological changes), and a subchronic NOAEL of 3.4 mg/kg bw/day. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.05 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.05 mg/kg bw (based on an overall NOAEL of 5 mg/kg bw/day, SF 100). The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure to the EC and the FS formulations is below the AOEL even without the use of PPE.
   The metabolism of triadimenol in plant was investigated following foliar applications on grapes, cereals and sugar beet and seed treatment on cereals. After foliar or seed treatments triadimenol was found to be the major compound in grapes, cereal grains and straw and sugar beet leaves and roots, accounting for 23 to 73% of the TRR. Hexose conjugate of the parent and the hydroxy metabolite M103 as free or conjugated were also detected in levels above 10%. Together these metabolites are present in amounts similar to or lower than the parent. Triazole Derivative Metabolites (TDMs) were also detected in cereal grains and straw following seed treatment and in cereals sown as rotational crops. Considering the significant proportion of the parent compound in the different plant parts investigated, the residue definition for monitoring was limited to triadimenol. For risk assessment, it was proposed to include in the residue definition the parent triadimenol, the metabolite M10 and their conjugates. Taking into account the proportions of the parent and of the metabolites, a conversion factor of 2 was proposed for the risk assessment for cereals only.
   Concerning the TDMs, the meeting of experts was of the opinion not to include these metabolites in the triadimenol residue definitions since TDMs are not specific to triadimenol and there is currently no EU approach on how to consider these common triazole metabolites in the risk assessment. A separate residue definition has to be set and a separate risk assessment has to be performed for TDMs taking into account all the active substances of the triazole chemical class. This issue should be reconsidered when a general approach on triazole compounds and their triazole derivative metabolites is defined.
   Supervised residue trials on grapes and cereals have been submitted. Residues were analysed for triadimenol only and no information was provided on the possible residue levels of the hydroxy metabolite M10 or the TDMs. Sufficient data were provided to propose a Maximum Residue Level (MRL) on wine and table grapes. On cereals, a provisional MRL was proposed for barley and oat only, awaiting additional residue data on barley in southern EU and in northern and southern EU for wheat. Triadimenol was stable under standard hydrolytic conditions and processing studies on grape showed a limited transfer of residues to wine. The submitted rotational crop studies, not performed in compliance with the requested standards, indicated that residues of the parent compound and its triazole derivative metabolites may be expected to be above the limit of quantification (LOQ). The experts' meeting was of the opinion that a new field study on rotational crops conforming to the current guidelines is required, where crops should be analysed for triadimenol and TDMs residues. Moreover, the residue situation in rotational crops should be reconsidered with regard to a global approach on TDMs.
   Metabolism studies in goats and hens were carried out with the active substance triadimefon. Nevertheless and given that the major metabolic pathway of triadimefon in animals consists as a first step in producing triadimenol, these studies were considered as fully acceptable for the understanding of the triadimenol metabolism in animals The metabolism of triadimenol in livestock is extensive and proceeds mainly via oxidation of the tertiary butyl group to the hydroxy metabolite M10 and the carboxy metabolite M024, both being subjected to conjugation with sulphate or glucuronic acid respectively. In hens, an additional pathway consisting of desmethylation was identified. The meeting of experts concluded that triadimenol could not be a valid marker for animal products since it was observed in significant levels in ruminant liver and in poultry fat and eggs only. Therefore, the animal residue definition for risk assessment was proposed as triadimenol plus metabolite M10 and M02 and their conjugates and metabolite M28(5). For monitoring the residue definition was proposed as triadimenol plus metabolite M10 and their conjugates and metabolite M28. Considering the limited transfer observed in the animal feeding studies and the low potential exposure to triadimenol residues through the consumption of treated food items (cereals), the meeting was of the opinion that there is no need to set MRLs for products of animal origin at this stage.
   As for plants, the possible inclusion of the TDMs in the animal residue definition has been discussed. It was concluded that no significant TDMs residues resulting from the direct intake of triadimefon/triadimenol are expected in products of animal origin. Nevertheless the animal dietary burden should also take into account the additional exposure arising from TDMs residues present in feeding commodities from both, primary and rotational crops (especially in cereal straw and cereal grains). As for plants, this issue will need to be reconsidered at a later stage when a global EU approach on TDMs is defined.
   The consumer risk assessment has been performed through the residues of triadimenol only and according to the residue definition proposed for plants. The contribution of the TDMs residues in primary crops, rotational crops and products of animal origin resulting from the use of triadimenol has not been evaluated and not been taken into account in the consumer risk assessment awaiting the definition of a global EU approach concerning these metabolites which are common to all active substances of the triazole chemical class. Taking into account the above considerations, the chronic and acute consumer exposures performed using the EFSA model and the proposed MRLs for cereals and grape were found to be less than 3% of the ADI and 27% of the ARfD.
   In soil under aerobic conditions triadimenol exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the soil metabolite M046 (accounting for up to 8.2% of applied radioactivity (AR) in a lysimeter study) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of the triazole ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 3.8-41% AR after 100 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 4.5-22.3 % AR after 100 days. Triadimenol exhibits low to very high mobility in soil, M04 exhibits high to very high mobility in soil. It was concluded that it was unlikely that adsorption of triadimenol was pH dependent. The adsorption of M04 was not pH dependent.
   In dark laboratory natural sediment water systems triadimenol exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 3.7 % AR after 13 weeks. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were performed for triadimenol (up to FOCUS step 3 calculations) and for M04 (with appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations). These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by triadimenol and 1,2,4triazole above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all the FOCUS groundwater scenarios relevant to the intended uses applied for. The atmospheric half life estimated for triadimenol (2.5 hours) gives an indication that it has not the potential to be subject to long range transport to areas where it has not been used, via the atmosphere.
   Whereas the acute and short-term risk to birds from spray use in cereals indicated a low risk at Tier 1, the long-term assessment required further refinements. Use of field residue data, PD refinements and focal species in a refined assessment, indicated a low risk for large herbivorous birds. Further refinements were however required to identify a low risk to skylark feeding on insects. For vine use (spray application) the risk assessment indicated a low risk to birds, except for the long-term risk to insectivorous birds in South Europe. Refinements of PT with Chaffinch, Blue tit and Robin as focal species were derived from UK orchard studies. It was concluded in the meeting of experts that further data were required to support the use of UK orchard data to refine the long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds in South Europe. For seed treatment use a low acute risk was identified for birds. The short-term risk assessment required further refinements. The meeting of experts did not accept the PT refinements suggested for yellowhammer, wood pigeon and skylark as focal species, and further data to substantiate the refinements were required. The long-term risk to birds was considered to be negligible, due to lack of exposure in the breeding season. EFSA however, noted that the breeding season for birds may extend into the season for use of triadimenol as a seed treatment in South Europe.
   The acute risk assessment for small herbivorous and insectivorous mammals indicated a low risk for spray use in cereals. Low risk was also identified for small herbivorous mammals in the long-term assessment, after refinement of residue data. For spray use in vine the acute risk was considered as low for both North Europe and South Europe. The long-term risk assessment for both North Europe and South Europe required further refinements of interception, dissipation rate and TWA concentration in ground vegetation before a low risk was identified. For seed treatment uses, the acute risk to mammals was concluded to be low after refinement of PD. The long-term risk assessment, however, needed to be refined further. No exposure to contaminated drinking water was expected and the risk from secondary poisoning was considered to be low. The potential endocrine disrupting effects on birds may require further assessment.
   Triadimenol should be classified as R51/53 "Toxic to aquatic organisms, may cause long term adverse effects in the aquatic environment." and the risk assessment for aquatic organisms indicated a low risk for all uses, based on FOCUS PECsw estimations up to Step 3. The risk to aquatic organisms from triadimenol metabolites was found to be low, as was the potential for bioaccumulation of triadimenol and its metabolites. The potential for endocrine effects on fish was not assessed in the DAR, as no relevant studies were available. A fish early life study (ELS) and a fish screening assay (FSA) were carried out by the applicant during the peer-review process to address potential endocrine effects. However they were not eligible for submission in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007.
   The risk assessment for bees indicated a low risk for all uses. As triadimenol is systemic, the risk assessment for seed treatment use was based on the assumption that the concentration in the honey dew would correspond to the concentration in the plant.
   The risk to non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro and macro organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.
   No studies using the formulated products Baytan FS 094 for seed treatment were available. In consequence the risk to non-target organisms from the use of Baytan FS 094 could not be concluded since this product, besides triadimenol, also contains fuberidazole and imazalil.

AB  - Trimethyltin chloride (TMT) is an organotin-based contaminant present in the water environment that poses a great threat to aquatic organisms and humans. The liver is the detoxification organ of the body and TMT exposure accumulates in the liver. Tea polyphenol (TP) is a natural antioxidant extracted from tea leaves and has been widely used as a food and feed additive. To investigate the mechanism of toxicity caused by TMT exposure on grass carp hepatocytes (L8824 cells) and the mitigating effect of TP, we established a hepatocyte model of TMT toxicity and/or TP treatment. L8824 cells were treated with 0.5 mu M of TMT and/or 4 mu g/mL of TP for 24 h and assayed for relevant indices. The results showed that TMT exposure caused oxidative stress, resulting in increased intracellular ROS content, resulting in intracellular ROS accumulation and increased MDA content, and inhibiting the activities of T-AOC, SOD, CAT, and GSH. Meanwhile, TMT exposure activated the endoplasmic reticulum apoptotic signaling pathway, resulting in abnormal expression of GRP78, ATF-6, IRE1, PERK, Caspase3 and Caspase-12. In addition, TMT exposure also led to up-regulation of cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and decreased expression of IL-2, IFN-gamma, and antimicrobial peptides Hepcidin, beta-defensin, and LEAP2. However, the addition of TP could mitigate the above changes. In conclusion, TP can alleviate TMT exposure-mediated hepatotoxicity by inhibiting ROS/ER stress in L8824 cells. In addition, this trial enriches the cytotoxicity study of TMT and provides a new theoretical basis for the use of TP as a mitigating agent for TMT.

AB  - The MetaPath knowledge base was developed for the purpose of archiving, sharing and analyzing experimental data on metabolism, metabolic pathways and crucial supporting metadata. The MetaPath system grew out of the need to compile and organize the results of metabolism studies into a systematic database to facilitate data comparisons and evaluations. Specialized MetaPath data evaluation tools facilitate the review of pesticide metabolism data submitted for regulatory risk assessments as well as exchange of results of complex analyses used in regulation and research. Customized screen editors called Composers were developed to automate data entry into MetaPath while also streamlining the production of agency specific study summaries such as the Data Evaluation Records (DER) used by the US EPA Office of Pesticide Programs. Efforts are underway through an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) work group to extend the use of DER Composers as harmonized templates for rat metabolism, livestock residue, plant residue and environmental degradation studies.

AB  - This study shows that a diet including insect-resistant Bt176 maize, fed to 53 ewes and their progeny for 3 years, did not have adverse effects on their health or performance and that no horizontal gene transfer to ruminal microorganisms or animal tissues was detected. No differences were observed regarding performance, reproductive traits, haematological parameters, antioxidant defences, lymphocyte proliferative capacity, phagocytosis and intracellular killing of macrophages, and ruminal microbial population characteristics between control and genetically modified (GM) maize-fed animals. Immune response to Salmonella abortus ovis vaccination was more efficient in GM maize fed sheep. No modifications of histological features of tissues were found; however, cytochemical analyses of ruminal epithelium by Ki67 staining provided evidence of proliferative activation of basal cells in all GM maize-fed ewes. Preliminary electron microscopy analyses of the liver and pancreas revealed smaller cell nuclei containing increased amounts of heterochromatin and perichromatin granules in GM maize-fed lambs. Meat protein content and water loss by cooking were slightly affected by the dietary treatment. No transgenic DNA was detected in tissues, blood, and ruminal fluid or ruminal bacteria. Longitudinal studies should be included in evaluation of food safety whenever possible and sheep may be a useful animal model for toxicological assessment. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Piscibactin (Pcb) is a labile siderophore widespread among Vibrionaceae. Its production is a major virulence factor of some fish pathogens such as Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida and Vibrio anguillarum. Although FrpA was previously suggested as the putative outer membrane transporter (OMT) for ferri-piscibactin, its role in piscibactin uptake was never demonstrated. In this work, we generated mutants of V. anguillarum defective in FrpA and analyzed their ability to use piscibactin as iron source. The results showed that inactivation of frpA completely disables piscibactin utilization, and the original phenotype could be restored by gene complementation, confirming that FrpA is the OMT that mediates ferri-Pcb uptake. Additionally, the ability of several Pcb thiazole analogues, with different configurations at positions 9, 10, and 13, to be internalized through FrpA, was evaluated measuring their ability to promote growth under iron deficiency of several indicator strains. The results showed that while those analogues with a thiazole ring maintain almost the same activity as Pcb, the maintenance of the hydroxyl group present in natural piscibactin configuration at position C-13 is crucial for Fe3+ chelation and, in consequence, for the recognition of the ferri-siderophore by the cognate OMT. All these findings allowed us to propose a Pcb analogue as a good candidate to vectorize antimicrobial compounds, through the Trojan horse strategy, to develop novel compounds against bacterial fish diseases.

AB  - Apoptosis-inducing protein of 56 kDa (AIP56) is a major virulence factor of Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida, a gram-negative pathogen that infects warm water fish species worldwide and causes serious economic losses in aquacultures. AIP56 is a single-chain AB toxin composed by two domains connected by an unstructured linker peptide flanked by two cysteine residues that form a disulphide bond. The A domain comprises a zinc-metalloprotease moiety that cleaves the NF-kB p65, and the B domain is involved in binding and internalisation of the toxin into susceptible cells. Previous experiments suggested that disruption of AIP56 disulphide bond partially compromised toxicity, but conclusive evidences supporting the importance of that bond in intoxication were lacking. Here, we show that although the disulphide bond of AIP56 is dispensable for receptor recognition, endocytosis, and membrane interaction, it needs to be intact for efficient translocation of the toxin into the cytosol. We also show that the host cell thioredoxin reductase-thioredoxin system is involved in AIP56 intoxication by reducing the disulphide bond of the toxin at the cytosol. The present study contributes to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms operating during AIP56 intoxication and reveals common features shared with other AB toxins.

AB  - Photobacterium damselae is a well-recognized fish pathogen comprising two subspecies (damselae and piscicida) with significant clinical and epidemiological differences. We explored the suitability of MALDI-TOF MS for discriminating P. damselae subspecies in a panel of 45 isolates from diseased fish. MALDI Biotyper approach correctly identified all isolates at species level with average scores values of 2.271 although identification at subspecies level was not reliable. Visual inspection of the spectra using Flex Analysis revealed five specific peaks (m/z 4183 and 8367 for subsp. damselae and 4197, 8397 and 8856 for subsp. piscicida) that may allow their differentiation. A classification model (GA-5A) was constructed based on these peaks using a genetic algorithm (ClinProTools software). Cross-validation and recognition capability values of this model were 100%. Validation of this model was confirmed by blind identification of 21 isolates of both subspecies resulting in sensitivity and specificity values of 100%. This is the first study describing a classification algorithm for MALDI-TOF MS identification of both P. damselae subspecies. This approach proved to be an effective and reliable tool in discriminating within the P. damselae subspecies that might be easily integrated into the workflow of microbiological diagnosis laboratories.

Although P, piscicida zoospores lack the genetic capability to synthesize chloroplasts, they can obtain functional chloroplasts from algal prey (i.e. kleptoplastidy), as demonstrated here with a cryptophyte prey. Zoospores grown with Rhodomonas sp, Karsten CCMP757 (Cryptophyceae) grazed the cryptophyte population to minimal densities. After placing the cultures in near darkness where cryptophyte recovery was restricted and further prey ingestion did not occur, the time-course patterns in growth, prey chloroplast content.zoospore(-1), and prey nucleus content.zoospore(-1) were followed. Ingested chloroplasts were selectively retained in the dinoflagellate, as indicated by the decline and, ultimately, near absence of cryptophyte nuclei in plastid-containing zoospores. Chloroplasts retained inside P. piscicida cells for at least a week were photosynthetically active, as indicated by starch accumulation and microscope-autoradiographic measurements of bicarbonate uptake. Recognition that P. piscicida can function as a phototroph broadens our perspective of the physiological ecology of the dinoflagellate because it suggests that, at least during part of its life cycle, P. piscicida's growth and survival might be affected by photoregulation and nutritional control of photosynthesis.

AB  - The bioluminescence response of two genetically modified (lux-marked) bacteria to potentially toxic compounds (PTCs) in stomach contents was monitored using an in vitro assay. Cells of Escherichia coli HB 101 and Salmonella typhimurium both carrying the lux light producing gene on a plasmid (pUDC607) were added to stomach contents containing various concentrations of organic and inorganic compounds. There was some variability in the response of the two biosensors, but both were sensitive to the herbicides glyphosate, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T); pentachlorophenol (PCP), and inorganic poisons arsenic and mercury at a concentration range likely to be found in stomach contents samples submitted for toxicological analysis. This study demonstrates that biosensor bioassays could be a useful preliminary screening tool in forensic toxicology and that such a toxicological screening should include more than one test organism to maximise the number of PTC's detected. The probability of false positive results from samples containing compounds that may interfere with the assay such as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and caffeine in tea and coffee was also investigated. Of the substances tested only coffee has the potential to cause false positive results. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Algae emerge as leading actors for the development of new strategies to cope oxidative stress, thanks to their availability for genetic manipulation and simple cultivation. This study reports the design of novel mutant strains of the green photosynthetic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, as a model system, able to produce bioactive peptides with high antioxidant capacity by means of a custom-made expression system. The D1 protein of Photo system II is highly abundant in the chloroplast with a rapid steady-state turnover; the final step of D1 protein processing is thus exploited for the continuous release of antioxidant peptides into the organism. Three antioxidant peptides, isolated from different food sources, were successfully expressed in C. reinhardtii. We show that the in vitro antioxidant activity of algae extract is lower in transgenic lines, while the in vivo antioxidant activity is highly evident towards radical oxygen-generating substances than in the control strain. Moreover, the antioxidant mutant releasing the peptide designed from Hoki fish, showed a longer shelf-life and a better resistance to high light and heat stress than the control. These features can be exploited in the vision of the development of robust biocomponents for bioassay applications. In particular, we described the design of an optical bioassay for herbicides detection, showing the high potential of the proposed mutant strains as robust and sensitive biological recognition elements.

AB  - Important determinants of risk perceptions associated with foods are the extent to which the potential hazards are perceived to have technological or naturally occurring origins, together with the acute vs. chronic dimension in which the potential hazard is presented (acute or chronic). This study presents a case study analysis based on an extensive literature review examining how these hazard characteristics affect people's risk and benefit perceptions, and associated attitudes and behaviors. The cases include E. coli incidences (outbreaks linked to fresh spinach and fenugreek sprouts), contamination of fish by environmental pollutants, (organochlorine contaminants in farmed salmon), radioactive contamination of food following a nuclear accident (the Fukushima accident in Japan), and GM salmon destined for the human food chain. The analysis of the cases over the acute vs. chronic dimension suggests that longitudinal quantification of the relationship between risk perceptions and impacts is important for both acute and chronic food safety, but this has infrequently been applied to chronic hazards. Technologies applied to food production tend to potentially be associated with higher levels of risk perception, linked to perceptions that the risk is unnatural. However, for some risks (e.g. those involving biological irreversibility), moral or ethical concerns may be more important determinants of consumer responses than risk or benefit perceptions. (Lack of) trust has been highlighted in all of the cases suggesting transparent and honest risk-benefit communications following the occurrence of a food safety incident. Implications for optimizing associated risk communication strategies, additional research linking risk perception, and other quantitative measures, including comparisons in time and space, are suggested.

AB  - The present study is focused on the use of gamma radiation to reduce organic compounds in wastewater, first on a synthetic aqueous solution of fenitrothion (FNT), which is an organophosphorus pesticide, then on a real sample of wastewater. On the synthetic solution, the study was conducted with a concentration of 150ppm of fenitrothion submitted to gamma rays of 60Co to absorbed doses varying from 15 to 50kGy. The results showed that on the one hand, the pesticide concentration decreased with dose increasing and, on the other hand, irradiation acidifies the pH of solution, which passed from 5.17 to 3.21 at 50kGy.The High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis has shown that 90 % of the fenitrothion contained in the solution was degraded at the dose of 50kGy.Some by-products formed during irradiation were identified. The study on sewer water was conducted on real samples collected from a purification plant effluent that receives industrial and domestic sewer water. Samples were irradiated in 2 -12 kGy dose range. The results showed the decrease of the p11 of the effluent sample with the increase of the absorbed dose. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) of irradiated and non-irradiated samples was determined. The results showed that gamma radiation at the dose of 12kGy reduced by 46%the COD of the effluent. The degradation study was followed by HPLC and GC-MS and the results reveal the presence of trace of fenitrothion in the effluent control sample, this trace disappeared in the sample irradiated at 2kGy.

AB  - Among Plant Protection Products (PPP), a new emerging category of pesticides act by stimulating plant defense in order to improve plant resistance against microbial pathogens. Given that these compounds, the so-called Plant Defense Stimulators (PDS) act on innate immunity, we tested, using an in vitro approach on human mononuclear leucocytes (PBMC), the potential toxicity (XTT assay) and inflammatory effects (production of IL 1 beta) of 4 PPP belonging to different chemical families. We found that two products (LBG-01F34 (R) and Regalis (R)) did not induce any cytotoxicity or IL-1 beta production. The product BION-50 WG (R), that contains Acibenzolar-Smethyl (ASM) and silica particles did not present any cytotoxicity but induced a significant increase in the production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta. Finally, Vacciplant (R) that contains laminarin, was highly cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory. It induced a strong production of IL-1 beta when used at a concentration in the culture medium, as low as 0.02 mg/mL. We also tested the potential toxic effect of these 4 PPP on 4 days old zebra fish larvae. After 24 h of exposure, our results indicate that Vacciplant (R) induced zebra fish larvae mortality at concentration of 20 mu g/mL. LBG did not induced significant mortality at concentrations up to 1 mg/mL whereas Regalis was lethal for 0,3 mg/mL concentrations and BION-50 WG began to induce mortality at 2,5 mg/mL.
   Our results indicate possible effects of PDS on IL-1 beta production in human cells and fish survival, calling for more studies on the potential noxious side effects of these compounds.

AB  - The widespread use of cyproconazole (CPZ) enhances food security but may pose potential risks to non-target organisms. Therefore, we applied Multi-omics techniques to reveal the response of the intestinal barrier to CPZ exposure and explore whether the Bifidobacterium intervention experiment can repair the damage. First, we found that exposure to CPZ at environmentally relevant concentrations led to intestinal injury phenotype, significantly down-regulated intestinal protein gene expression, and up-regulated pro-inflammatory gene expression, further causing intestinal dysbacteriosis and metabolic disorders. In particular, by combining analysis of gut microbiota and metabolites, we noticed acetate, a key metabolite, which decreased sharply after exposure to high concentration of CPZ. Expectedly, after supplementing with Bifidobacterium (a core bacterium that produces acetate), we noticed that the acetate content was quickly restored. Further, we also verified that the increase in acetate content after Bifidobacterium supplementation at least partially promoted IL-22 secretion, which in turn stimulated the secretion of beta-defensins (zfbd-1, zfbd-2, zfbd-3), thereby repairing the intestinal damage. In conclusion, our work confirms the potential of Bifidobacterium to improve intestinal damage and metabolic dysbiosis caused by CPZ exposure. It provides directional recommendations for the application of probiotics to repair the toxicological risk of pesticide exposure.

AB  - Neburon is a phenylurea herbicide that is widely used worldwide, but its toxicity is poorly studied. In our previous study, we found that neburon has strong aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist activity, but whether it causes reproductive toxicity is not clear. In the present study, zebrafish were conducted as a model organism to evaluate whether environmental concentrations of neburon (0.1, 1 and 10 pg/L) induce reproductive disorder in males. After exposure to neburon for 150 days from embryo to adult, that the average spawning egg number in high concentration group was 106.40, which was significantly lower than 193.00 in control group. This result was mainly due to the abnormal male reproductive behavior caused by abnormal transcription of genes associated with reproductive behavior in the brain, such as secretogranin-2a. The proportions of spermatozoa in the medium and high concentration groups were 82.40% and 83.84%, respectively, which were significantly lower than 89.45% in control group. This result was mainly caused by hormonal disturbances and an increased proportion of apoptotic cells. The hormonal disruption was due to the significant changes in the transcription levels of key genes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis following neburon treatment. Neburon treatment also significantly activated the AhR signaling pathway, causing oxidative stress damage and eventually leading to a significant increase in apoptosis in the exposed group. Together, these data filled the currently more vacant profile of neburon toxicity and might provide information to assess the ecotoxicity of neburon on male reproduction at environmentally relevant concentrations.

AB  - In this study, the toxicity of methylparaben (MeP) an emerging contaminant, was analysed in the sexual species Anemia franciscana, due to its presence in coastal areas and marine saltworks in the Mediterranean region. The acute toxicity (24 h-LC50) of MeP in nauplii was tested and its chronic effect (9 days) evaluated by measuring survival and growth under two sublethal concentrations (0.0085 and 0.017 mg/L). Also, the effect on several key enzymes involved in: antioxidant defences (catalase (CAT) and gluthathion-S-transferase (GST)), neural activity (cholinesterase (ChE)) and xenobiotic biotransformation (carboxylesterase (CbE), was assessed after 48 h under sublethal exposure. The results of acute exposure indicate that MeP is harmful to A. franciscana (24 h-LC50 = 36.7 mg/L). MeP causes a decrease in CAT activity after 48 h exposure to both concentration tested, that points out at the oxidative stress effect of MeP in A. franciscana. However, no significant effect on ChE, CbE and GST activities was found.
   In addition, MeP does not affect survival and growth in chronic exposure at the sublethal concentrations tested. The results of this study indicate that MeP is not a threat for A. franciscana under the experimental conditions used. Additional studies should be done considering long-term exposure and reproduction studies to analyse the potential risk of MeP as emerging contaminant in marine and hypersaline environments.

AB  - Synthetic pyrethroids are the recent major class of broad spectrum, photostable, organic insecticides used in agricultural, domestic and veterinary applications and now account for more than 30% of global insecticide use. Cypermethrin is metabolized and eliminated significantly more slowly by fish than by mammals or birds, which may explain this compound's high toxicity in fish compared to other organisms. The present communication deals with histoanatomical alterations in the gonads of a local fresh water food fish, Channa punctatus exposed to 0.033 ppm (96 hr LC50 X 1/10) concentration of a synthetic pyrethroid, devicyprin (cypermethrin 25%) in aquatic medium of aged tap water for 15, 30 and 45 days respectively. In testis, exposure dependent histological damage has been observedin terms of vacuolization, condensation of spermatogonic cells, distortion of tubular epithelium, shrinkage of interstitial cells and general inflammatory responses, Longest exposure of 45 days has resulted in peculiar starry-sky appearance of the testicular tissue. Gross histoanatomy of ovarian tissue reveals epithelial lesions, inflammatory responses, stromal hemorrhage, increased interstitium and shrinkage of yolk vesicles towards periphery. These findings are quite suggestive of reproductive impairments leading to delayed gonadal maturity and adversely affecting processes of sperm production and ovulation and thus, the fish production.

AB  - The salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), an ectoparasitic copepod of salmonid fish, is a major threat to aquaculture in Norway, Ireland, Scotland and Canada. Due to rise in resistance against existing pesticides, development of novel drugs or vaccines is necessary. Posttranscriptional gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi), when established in a high throughput system is a potential method for evaluation of molecular targets for new medical compounds or vaccine antigens. Successful use of RNAi has been reported in several stages of salmon lice. However, when we employed a previously described protocol for planktonic stages, no reproducible down-regulation of target genes was gained. In the present study, we describe a robust method for RNAi, where nauplius larvae are soaked in seawater added double stranded RNA (dsRNA). In order to test for when dsRNA may be introduced, and for the efficacy and duration of RNAi, we performed a series of experiments on accurately age determined larvae, ranging from the hatching egg to the copepodid with a salmon louse coatomer and a putative prostaglandin E synthase gene. Presumptive knock-down was monitored by real time PCR. Significant gene silencing was obtained only when nauplius I larvae were exposed to dsRNA during the period in which they molted to nauplius II. A knock down effect could be detected 2 days after soaking, and it remained stable until the last measurement, on day 12. Soaking nauplius I larvae, knock-down was verified for six additional genes with a putative role in molting. For one chitinase, a loss-of-function phenotype with abnormal swimming was obtained. Hence, RNAi, induced in the nauplius, may facilitate studies of the molecular biology of the louse, such as the function of specific genes in developmental processes and physiology, host recognition, host-parasite interaction, and, in extension, the engineering of novel medicines.

AB  - Hepcidin, a cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptide, has a highly conserved gene structure in teleosts, and it plays an essential role in host immune response against various pathogenic bacteria. Nonetheless, few studies on the antibacterial mechanism of hepcidin in golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) have been reported. In this study, we synthesized a derived peptide, TroHepc2-22, from the mature peptide of T. ovatus hepcidin2. Our results showed that TroHepc2-22 has superior antibacterial abilities against both Gram-negative (Vibrio harveyi and Edwardsiella piscicida) and Grampositive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae) bacteria. Based on the results of a bacterial membrane depolarization assay and propidium iodide (PI) staining assay in vitro, TroHepc2-22 displayed antimicrobial activity by inducing the bacterial membrane depolarization and changing the bacterial membrane permeability. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) visualization illustrated that TroHepc2-22 brought about membrane rupturing and the leakage of the cytoplasm for the bacteria. In addition, TroHepc2-22 was verified to have hydrolytic activity on bacterial genomic DNA in view of the results of the gel retardation assay. In terms of the in vivo assay, the bacterial loads of V. harveyi in the tested immune tissues (liver, spleen, and head kidney) were significantly reduced in T. ovatus, revealing that TroHepc2-22 significantly enhanced the resistance against V. harveyi infection. Furthermore, the expressions of immune-related genes, including tumor necrosis factor-ff (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 1-beta (IL-beta b), IL-6, Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1), and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) were significantly increased, indicating that TroHepc2-22 might regulate inflammatory cytokines and activate immune-related signaling pathways. To summarize, TroHepc2-22 possesses appreciable antimicrobial activity and plays a vital role in resisting bacterial infection. The observation of our present study unveils the excellent application prospect of hepcidin as a substitute for antibiotics to resist pathogenic microorganisms in teleosts.

AB  - A two-photon fluorescent probe FNTR for nitroreductase was synthesized by using 9,9-dimethyl-2- acetyl-fluoren-7-methylamino (1) as a two-photon fluorophore and a p-nitrobenzyl carbamate group as a recognition domain for nitroreductase (NTR). The probe and the fluorophore were tested under one-and two-photon modes respectively. After reacting with nitroreductase, FNTR had a 130-fold fluorescence enhancement at 563 nm in 10 min and the maximal two-photon action cross-section value was detected as 66 GM at 750 nm. The probe showed a high sensitivity with a detection limit as low as 23.67 ng ml(-1), high selectivity, low cytotoxicity and good photostability. In the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), endogenous NTR was detected in living cells, tissues and zebrafish. Cobalt chloride was used to induce chemical hypoxia to produce NTR, which generated enhanced fluorescence in cells and tumor tissues. Finally, two-photon fluorescence imaging of NTR was achieved in zebrafish at a penetration depth of up to 200 mu m.

AB  - A novel series of 15-membered diazadioxa macrocyclic complexes [MLCl2] (M=Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II)) have been synthesized via the condensation reaction of salicylaldehyde and 1,2-dibromoethane with a 3-subtituted-4-amino-5-hydrazino-1,2,4-triazole in the presence of transition metal ions as templates in ethanol. The mode of bonding and overall geometry of the complexes have been inferred through IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, EPR, electronic spectral studies, conductivity, magnetic, thermal, and electrochemical studies. All the complexes are soluble in DMF and DMSO and are non-electrolytes. All these complexes have been screened for their antibacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and antifungal activities (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, and Cladosporium) by the minimum inhibitory concentration method. The DNA cleavage is studied by agarose gel electrophoresis. An octahedral geometry is proposed for all the complexes.

AB  - Cone snails comprise approximately 700 species of venomous molluscs which have evolved the ability to generate multiple toxins with varied and exquisite selectivity. a-Conotoxin is a powerful tool for defining the composition and function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors which play a crucial role in excitatory neurotransmission and are important targets for drugs and insecticides. An alpha 4/7 conotoxin, Lp1.1, originally identified by cDNA and genomic DNA cloning from Conus leopardus, was found devoid of the highly conserved Pro residue in the first intercysteine loop. To further study this toxin, alpha-Lp1.1 was chemically synthesized and refolded into its globular disulfide isomer. The synthetic Lp1.1 induced seizure and paralysis on freshwater goldfish and selectively reversibly inhibited ACh-evoked currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing rat alpha 3 beta 2 and alpha 6 alpha 3 beta 2 nAChRs. Comparing the distinct primary structure with other functionally related alpha-conotoxins could indicate structural features in Lp1.1 that may be associated with its unique receptor recognition profile.

AB  - Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an adapter protein that is activated when cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) are present. CDNs originate from the cytosolic DNA of both pathogens and hosts. STING activation promotes efficient immune responses against viral infections; however, its impact in bacterial infections is unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of Sting in bacterial infections by successfully creating a sting-deficient (sting((-/-)) with a 4-bp deletion) knockout zebrafish model using CRISPR/Cas9. The transcriptional modulation of genes downstream of cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase)-Sting pathway-related genes was analyzed in seven-day-old wild-type (WT) and sting((-/-)) embryos, as well as in four-day-old LPS-stimulated embryos. The expression of downstream genes was higher in sting(-/-) than in healthy WT fish. The late response was observed in sting((-/-)) larvae following LPS treatment, demonstrating the importance of Sting-induced immunity during bacterial infection by activating the cGAS-STING pathway. Furthermore, adult sting((-/-)) fish had a high mortality rate and significantly downregulated cGAS-STING pathway-related genes during Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida) infection. In addition, we assessed NF-kappa B pathway genes following E. piscicida infection. Our results show fluctuating patterns of interleukin-6 (il6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf alpha) expression, which is likely due to the influence of other NF-kappa B pathway-related immune genes. In summary, this study demonstrates the important role of Sting against bacterial infection.

AB  - Background Mosquitoes transmit many infectious diseases that affect human health. The fungus Beauveria bassiana is a biological pesticide that is pathogenic to mosquitoes but harmless to the environment.Results We found a microRNA (miRNA) that can modulate the antifungal immunity of Aedes aegypti by inhibiting its cognate serine protease. Fungal infection can induce the expression of modular serine protease (ModSP), and ModSP knockdown mosquitoes were more sensitive to B. bassiana infection. The novel miRNA-novel-53 is linked to antifungal immune response and was greatly diminished in infected mosquitoes. The miRNA-novel-53 could bind to the coding sequences of ModSP and impede its expression. Double fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that this inhibition occurred in the cytoplasm. The amount of miRNA-novel-53 increased after miRNA agomir injection. This resulted in a significant decrease in ModSP transcript and a significant increase in mortality after fungal infection. An opposite effect was produced after antagomir injection. The miRNA-novel-53 was also knocked out using CRISPR-Cas9, which increased mosquito resistance to the fungus B. bassiana. Moreover, mosquito novel-circ-930 can affect ModSP mRNA by interacting with miRNA-novel-53 during transfection with siRNA or overexpression plasmid.Conclusions Novel-circ-930 affects the expression level of ModSP by a novel-circ-930/miRNA-novel-53/ModSP mechanism to modulate antifungal immunity, revealing new information on innate immunity in insects.

AB  - Superoxide dismutases are enzymes that defend against oxidative stress through decomposition of superoxide radical. Escherichia coli contains two highly homologous superoxide dismutases, one containing manganese (MnSOD) and the other iron (FeSOD). Although E. coli Mn and FeSOD catalyze the dismutation of superoxide with comparable rate constants, it is not known if they are physiologically equivalent in their protection of cellular targets from oxyradical damage. To address this issue, isogenic strains of E. coli containing either Mn or FeSOD encoded on a plasmid and under the control of tac promoter were constructed. SOD specific activity in the Mn and FeSOD strains could be controlled by the concentration of isopropyl beta-thiogalactoside in the medium. The tolerance of these strains to oxidative stress was compared at equal Mn and FeSOD specific activities. Our results indicate that E. coli Mn and FeSOD are not functionally equivalent. The MnSOD is more effective than FeSOD in preventing damage to DNA, while the FeSOD appears to be more effective in protecting a cytoplasmic superoxide-sensitive enzyme. These data are the first demonstration that Mn and FeSOD are adapted to different antioxidant roles in E. coli.

AB  - The amination water (AW) effluent stream from the industrial production of the trifluraline herbicide was submitted to an oxidation-coagulation treatment with potassium ferrate, combined with advanced oxidation processes. The experimental results obtained by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the oxidation-coagulation-Fenton process, evaluating the variables pH (A), Fe(VI) concentration (B), and H2O2 concentration (C), demonstrated that the regression equation resulting from the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) experimental design, for the quadratic model, was eta(Abs) (%) = 36.9 - 21.58A + 8.37A(2) + 1.36B + 0.92B(2) + 1.08C + 1.52C(2) + 1.27AB - 1.34AC + 1.33BC. The maximum absorptiometric color reduction occurred at pH 3, with corresponding maximum amounts of iron and hydrogen peroxide. The absorptiometric color and COD reduction were 96% and 57%, respectively. For the oxidation-coagulation-photo-Fenton process, the analyzed variables were pH (A), Fe(VI) concentration (B), H202 concentration (C), and temperature (D). The regression equation resulting from the quadratic model was eta(Abs) (%) = 38.3 - 20.2A + 8.12A(2) - 0.27B + 3.73B(2) + 03C + 3.6C(2) + 1.67D + 3.1D(2) + 1.72AB + 0.51AC - 1.82AD + 0.74BC - 1.11BD + 0.03CD. The ANOVA response showed that the highest absorptiometric color reduction occurred at pH 3, with respective maximum amounts of iron and hydrogen peroxide at 60 degrees C. The maximum efficiencies achieved by the proposed treatment process for the trifluraline effluent stream were 95% and 85%, for absorptiometric color and COD reduction, respectively.

AB  - The increase of reproductive dysfunction cases, such as diminution of count and spermatic functionality, precocious puberty in children, the increase of breast, prostate and testicles cancer and of malformations associated with hormonal problems generates certain uneasiness. At the same time, the description of alterations in the reproductive function of an increasing number of wild species, by exposure to persistent chemical substances, like pesticides, detergents, dioxins and furans, has promoted an intense activity of research that has given these compounds a central role in the interference (disruption) of the hormonal homeostasis. These compounds, endocrine disruptors, are characterized in the laboratory taking into account their hormonal or anti-hormonal capacity, and whether they can alter the homeostasis of the endocrine reproductive system. Some recognized disruptors are phytoestrogens, organochloride pesticides, alkylphenol-polyethoxylates, chlorophenols, PCBs, phtalates, artificial estrogens (contraceptive), dioxins, furans and aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons, which are commonly used in our daily life. The recognition of their disruption capacity, implies a reframing of the regulation and control systems of approximately 50,000 new chemicals, many of wich with potential disruption capacity. This includes new toxicological tests and new research objectives, renewed evaluation methodology of chemical compounds and the re-evaluation of the existing one, using the risk estimation system as a principle. Thus, these priorities are considered: an international network, with a global data base; the validation of new biological tests for the detection of disruptor compounds, and the unification of criteria for the risk and associated damage characterization on the basis of epidemiological studies.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are typical pollutants and may be alkylated and oxygenated to form alkyl-PAHs and oxygenated-PAHs (oxy-PAHs), respectively. Takifugu obscurus is an important anadromous fish species and displays a high risk of being exposed to PAHs-contaminated areas. In the present study, the effects of acute exposure to 44.29 mu g L-1 9,10-phenanthrenequione (9,10-PQ), retene and phenanthrene (Phe) on T. obscurus liver histology, antioxidant enzymes and immune indices were compared. After exposure to these three compounds, histological sections showed damages of hepatocyte, and the activities of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase increased in plasma, indicating direct hepatic toxicity. Hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased, but superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities decreased in response to treatments with Phe, retene and 9,10-PQ. These results revealed peroxidative effects on T. obscurus hepatocytes. In addition, total immunoglobulin content and lysozyme activity in plasma increased in treatments with Phe, retene and 9,10-PQ, which might be resulted from the damaged liver cells and the subsequently hepatic inflammation. Besides, the changes were more severe in treatment with 9,10-PQ than those with Phe and retene, demonstrating higher toxicity of 9,10-PQ than the other two compounds. Overall, the present study posed a high environmental risk of PAH derivatives to aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - In this study data on successful propagation of zander (Sander lucioperca L.) from several spawning seasons are evaluated. Propagation was based on stripping of spawners after hormonal induction and rearing of fry in artificial ponds. Fish were injected with acetone-dried carp pituitary extract at a dose of 4.0 mg/kg homogenized in a fish physiological saline. When ovulation was detected, the eggs were stripped and weighed. Eggs were collected from each ovulated female and fertilized with milt from the male. Stickiness of zander eggs was removed before transferring them into Zuger jars. Data collected from four consecutive spawning seasons were analyzed statistically calculating individual and group-based pseudo-gonadosomatic index (PGSI) values. Reproduction capacity assays were grouped on the basis of three aspects: (1) examination of differences between years, (2) within a reproductive season, and (3) examination of the effects of females' size. During the four-year trial period eggs were gained from 121 hormonally treated females, 64.7% of the total 187. Based on the data of the investigated period the mean PGSI was 10.7%. At 95% significance level PGSI data of different years were considered to be similar. There were no significant differences between PGSI data collected from different periods of the reproductive season. Previous findings on the positive correlation between the amount of stripped eggs and body weight of females were confirmed (r(2)=0.103). Correlation was not justified between PGSI and body weight (r(2)=0.002). Advanced rearing of zander fry in a 2.0 hectare pond was carried out in six consecutive years. Before stocking the nutrient level of the pond was increased by organic manuring and the Copepods were eliminated by insecticides. To prevent cannibalism, four weeks after stocking the advanced fry of zander were harvested. On the basis of the results from six consecutive years, after rearing of advanced fry in a shallow, 2.0 hectare rearing pond for four weeks, the mean survival rate was 13.4 +/- 4.37% (mean +/- SD). By considering our results, breeders can calculate their hatchery's and pond's production in advance. These results will also be helpful in calculating the total weight of broodstock which must be held in order to produce a specific number of advanced fry.

AB  - This study was undertaken to clarify the physiological role of catalase in the maintenance of pro/antioxidant balance in goldfish tissues by inhibiting the enzyme in vivo with 3-amino 1,2,4-triazole. Intraperitoneal injection of aminotriazole (0.5 mg/g wet mass) caused a decrease in liver catalase activity by 83% after 24 h that was sustained after 168 h post-injection. In kidney catalase activity was reduced by similar to 50% and 70% at the two time points, respectively. Levels of protein carbonyls were unchanged in liver but rose by 2-fold in kidney after 168 h. Levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were elevated in both tissues after 24 h but were reversed by 168 It. Glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase activities increased in kidney after aminotriazole treatment whereas activities of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase in liver decreased after 24 h but rebounded by 168 h. Liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was reduced at both time points. Activities of these three enzymes in liver correlated inversely with the levels of lipid damage products (R-2=0.65-0.81) suggesting that they may have been oxidatively inactivated. Glutathione-S-transferase activity also correlated inversely with catalase (R(2=)0.86). Hence, the response to catalase depletion involves compensatory changes in the activities of enzymes of glutathione metabolism. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of toxic pesticides has become a world problem because they can contaminate streams and rivers, producing an adverse impact on non-target aquatic biota, including fishes. Cypermethrin is one of the most important insecticides to control ectoparasites in wide-scale. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of commercial formulations of cypermethrin, SHERPA O (0.0, 0.075, 0.15, and 0.3 mu g/L of cypermethrin) in fish Prochilodus lineatus for 96 h in semi-static condition, using biomarkers of genotoxicity: micronucleus frequency (MNF) in erythrocytes and biomarkers of oxidative damage: lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and antioxidant defenses, catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) in liver tissue. Our results showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) of CAT at pesticide concentrations of 0.150 and 0.300 mu g/L, but no significant difference was observed in TBARS or GSH in any exposed group (p > 0.05) in comparison to the control. A significant increase was observed in the MNF in the group exposed to 0.3 mu g/L of cypermethrin compared to negative control (p < 0.05). Finally, P. lineatus proved to be a sensitive species to the commercial formulations of cypermethrin and that CAT and MNF are effective indicators of these toxic effects.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the ameliorative properties of lycopene against the toxic effects of cypermethrin (CYP) by examining oxidative damage markers such as lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant defense system components in carp (Cyprinus carpio). The fish were divided into seven groups of 10 fish each and received the following treatments: group 1, no treatment; group 2, orally administered corn oil; group 3, oral lycopene (10 mg/kg body weight); group 4, exposure to 0.202 g/L CYP; group 5, exposure to 0.202 g/L CYP plus oral administration of 10 mg/kg lycopene; group 6, exposure to 0.404 g/L CYP; and group 7, exposure to 0.404 g/L CYP plus oral administration of 10 mg/kg lycopene. Treatment was continued for 28 days, and at the end of this period, blood and tissue (liver, kidney, and gill) samples were collected. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were determined in blood and tissues for measurement of oxidant-antioxidant status. MDA level, as an index of lipid peroxidation, increased in blood and tissues. Antioxidant enzyme activities in blood and tissues were modified in CYP groups compared with controls. Administration of lycopene ameliorated these parameters. The present results suggest that administration of lycopene might alleviate CYP-induced oxidative stress. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Oxidative stress by increased production of reactive oxygen species has been implicated in the toxicity of many pesticides. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a broad spectrum insecticide, composed of a mixture of organophosphate plus pyrethroids (fenitrothion 25%, lambda cyhalothrin 2.5% and piperonyl butoxide 6%), on antioxidant status and oxidative stress biomarkers in rat brain. Different insecticide concentrations (0, 0.1,1, 10, 100 and 1000 mM) were incubated with brain homogenate at 37 degrees C for time intervals (0, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min). Exposure to insecticide mixture resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), which might be associated with decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase activities and beside protein content in rat brain. However, a significant induction of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities was observed. The response was concentration and time dependent. Results showed that the used insecticides had the propensity to cause significant oxidative damage in rat brain, which is associated with marked perturbations in antioxidant defense system in addition to antioxidant enzymes can be used as potential biomarkers of toxicity associated with pesticides exposure.

AB  - Biologically active environmental pollutants have significant impact on ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. Microplastic (MP) and nanoplastic (NP) particles are pollutants that are present in the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at virtually every level of the food chain. Moreover, recently, airborne microplastic particles have been shown to reach and potentially damage respiratory systems. Microplastics and nanoplastics have been shown to cause increased oxidative stress, inflammation, altered metabolism leading to cellular damage, which ultimately affects tissue and organismal homeostasis in numerous animal species and human cells. However, the full impact of these plastic particles on living organisms is not completely understood. The ability of MPs/NPs to carry contaminants, toxic chemicals, pesticides, and bioactive compounds, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals, present an additional risk to animal and human health. This review will discusses the current knowledge on pathways by which microplastic and nanoplastic particles impact reproduction and reproductive behaviors from the level of the whole organism down to plastics-induced cellular defects, while also identifying gaps in current knowledge regarding mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we suggest that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides an advantageous high-throughput model system for determining the effect of plastic particles on animal reproduction, using reproductive behavioral end points and cellular readouts.

AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been the subject of intense scientific and regulatory scrutiny during recent years. Of the three commercial forms (Penta, Octa and Deca) of PBDEs that have been widely used as flame retardants in textiles, furniture upholstery, plastics, and electronics, only Deca-BDE remains on the general market in North America, while a recent ruling of the European Court spells an impending end to its use in Europe. We review here highlights of aquatic research documenting the rapid emergence of PBDEs as a high priority environmental concern in Canada. PBDEs are being introduced in large quantities to the aquatic environment through sewage discharge and atmospheric deposition. In certain environmental compartments, the single congener BDE-209, the main ingredient in the Deca-BDE formulation, has surpassed the legacy PCBs and DDT as the top contaminant by concentration. Limited biomagnification of BDE-209 in aquatic food webs reflects its high log K., and preferential partitioning into the particle phase. As a result, large environmental reservoirs of BDE-209 are being created in sediments, and these may present a long-term threat to biota: BDE-209 breaks down into more persistent, more bioaccumulative, more toxic, and more mobile PBDE congeners in the environment.

AB  - As a major neonicotinoid insecticide, thiacloprid (THCP) is frequently detected in aquatic environments worldwide due to its heavy use, posing potential threats to aquatic organisms. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to THCP (1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10,000 mu g/L) for 5 days and then recovered in THCP-free water for 20 days to investigate the effects of early-stage THCP exposure on the development, antioxidant defense, and neurotransmitter systems of zebrafish, and explore their recovery mechanism. The results show that THCP exposure induced developmental toxicity and oxidative stress in zebrafish. The hypoactivity, behavioral alterations (decreased avoidance and edge preference behaviors) and neurotoxicity were found throughout the exposure-recovery experiments. THCP exposure altered the expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- and serotonin (5-HT)-related genes accompanied by the decrease in GABA and 5-HT contents. However, after recovery, GABA content returned to the control level, but 5-HT did not, indicating that only the serotonergic system was persistently disrupted. Overall, our results suggest that the disruption of the serotonergic system and oxidative stress may aggravate neurotoxicity and that the former was the main reason for the depressive-like behavior. This study could help to unravel the mechanisms of the behavioral alterations induced by early-stage THCP exposure in zebrafish.

AB  - The application of potentially beneficial microorganisms to increase host defense is a new trend to increase health benefits. In this paper the first specific host probiotics for goats from a mixture isolated from healthy animals (Lactobacillus reuteri DDL 19, Lactobacillus alimentarius DDL 48, Enterococcus faecium DDE 39 and Bifidobacterium bifidum DDBA) was assayed. The effect of probiotic oral administration on goats weight, gut microbiota, as well as on the production of mutagen compounds and their indicator (putrescine), were evaluated. The probiotic supplement was able to modify microflora balance by reducing Enterobacteria like Salmonella/Shigella (1.09 and 121 log CFU/g feces, respectively) and increasing lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacteria (1.67 and 2.34 log CFU/g feces, respectively). The probiotics administration was correlated with a ten time diminution of fecal putrescine (cancer and bacterial disease marker) and a decrease of 60% mutagen fecal concentration, indicating the protective effect of the treatment. Additionally, a significant increase in ruminant weight was observed after probiotic administration. These results are encouraging towards the use of probiotic mixtures as functional food for goats.

AB  - The small subunit ribosomal RNA (srRNA) gene was amplified from Gyrodactylus salaris using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloned, and the complete gene sequence of 1966 bp determined. The V4 region of the srRNA gene was identified and amplified from single specimens of G. safaris, G. derjavini and G. truttae. Comparison of the V4 sequences from these three species revealed sequence differences from which restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were predicted and an oligonucleotide probe (GsV4) specific to G. salaris designed. Digestion of the amplified V4 region of the srRNA gene with Hae III and either Alw I, BstY I, Dde I or Mbo I provided a means of discriminating between G. salaris, G. derjavini and G. truttae. The GsV4 probe was used to detect the srRNA gene from G. salaris in Southern and dot blots of the amplified V4 region. The nucleotide sequences reported in this paper have been submitted to the EMBL Data Library under accession numbers Z26942 (G. salaris), Z35128 (G. derjavini) and Z35129 (G. truttae).

AB  - We assessed spatial patterns in 37 PCB congeners, eight pesticides, and the heavy metals mercury and cadmium in the flatfish Solea solea at four sites in the Gulf of Lions (NW Mediterranean). Overall contaminant concentrations generally exceeded those reported for S. solea elsewhere, but fell into the range of other Gulf fishes, testifying of a relatively high contaminant load of this area. Spatial patterns in all three contaminant classes were highly significant, but differed among classes. PCB congener and chlorination class profiles also differed among sites. The observed patterns would be consistent with (1) PCB point-sources in the Eastern Gulf (Marseille, Rhone River) versus dominance of atmospheric input in the West, (2) pesticide input by the Rhone and from agricultural fields in the West, and (3) mercury point-sources near Marseille. The unique, site-specific contaminant profiles prove to be a powerful tool to differentiate between S. solea populations from different sites. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chlordane-related compounds are ubiquitously detected in the environment and can transfer and accumulate to animals through food chain to cause adverse effects. In this study, the dynamic distribution and the enantiomeric profile of chlordane-related compounds in laying hens over time were investigated. The effect of these compounds on immune-associated cells in the intestinal tract and histopathology in some tissues were also evaluated after long-term exposure. The chlordane-related compounds preferentially accumulated in fat, followed by the intestines, ovum, and egg yolk during long-term exposure. The metabolites heptachlor epoxide and oxychlordane were mainly formed in the liver of hens by epoxidation or hydroxylation. The high accumulation ratios of transnonachlor and MC5 were found in ovum and egg yolk after long-term exposure, implying a greater risk to the hens' offspring. Chlordane-related compounds may cause abnormal lipometabolism and glycometabolism in liver of hens. Additionally, (-)-Cis-chlordane was dominant in all tissues of laying hens and its dominance increased over time. Conversely, (+)-isomer of metabolite oxychlordane was overwhelmingly dominant during the experiment. These findings about enantioselectivity, metabolic processes and toxicological effects are crucial in understanding the exposure risk of chlordane-related compounds.

AB  - This study aims to demonstrate that microcystin-LR (MC-LR) has toxic effects on the reproductive system of male Rana nigromaculata in vitro. R. nigromaculata were treated with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nmol/L of MC-LR for 6 h. Results show that exposure to I nmol/L to 100 nmol/L of MC-LR decreased sperm motility and number of sperm cells and increased the sperm abnormality rate, whose values were significantly different from those of the control (P < 0.01). Moreover, the same dosage of MC-LR increased reactive oxygen species production and malondialdehyde content. At the same time, antioxidant enzyme (catalase and glutathione S-transferase) activity and glutathione reduced content rapidly increased, whereas antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase activity significantly decreased. These results imply that the defense system of the testes quickly responds to oxidative stress. Ultrastructural observation shows distention of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus and changes in the mitochondrial matrix color, cristae number, and morphology. Moreover, using real-time PCR, increased relative expressions of P450 aromatase and SF-1 genes were observed. The results demonstrate for the first time that MC-LR could induce toxicity in the male reproductive system of R. nigromaculata. The findings in this research will provide more insights into the relationships between aquatic microcystins and amphibians. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen which causes systemic infections in human. In this study, C. albicans infection model was developed in zebrafish to understand the host-pathogen interactions for straightforward anticandidal drug screening. Methods To develop the infection, 1 x 10(6 )cells of C. albicans suspended in phosphate-buffered saline were deposited in zebrafish dorsal muscle by manually operated syringe. The infection progression was externally assessed by a scale of wound-healing events, based on visible changes of yeast deposited in the muscle tissues. Chemotherapy was carried out with known antifungal drugs (fluconazole, nystatin, and amphotericin B) and a potential antifungal agent, chitosan silver nanocomposites (CAgNC), after the infection as direct exposure in the water. Histopathological analysis was performed to identify the pathogen virulence and the host-pathogen interaction during the infection. Results The light microscopic observations and histopathological analysis revealed the yeast-hyphae transition at the site of infection (at 72 hpi) and progression of the infection in the host tissues. The larval survival rate under fluconazole (up to 80 mu g mL(-1)) and nystatin (up to 20 mu g mL(-1)) was > 90% and for CAgNC it was 40% at 36 h post-exposure (hpe). The infection progression was suppressed with the fungicidal treatments. Among inflammatory genes, il-1 beta has been highly upregulated (14.68-fold) at 24 h post infection (hpi). Both il-1 beta and tnf-alpha were moderately upregulated in infected fish gills at 72 hpi. Among the C. albicans antioxidant genes, cat1 and sod2 have been upregulated during the infection, and relative expression folds were increased from low to moderate levels with the time. Discussion We demonstrate the approach for the development of artificial infection model of zebrafish with C. albicans. By this mini vertebrate zebrafish model, researchers will be able to study novel anticandidal compounds in vivo with respect to the host, pathogen, and their interactions.

AB  - The breast milk has been recommended to carry out as a monitoring tool for effectiveness evaluation of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloro-ethane (DDT) and its metabolites (DDX), hexachlorbenzene (HCB) and isomers of hexachlocyklohexane (HCHs) have been monitored in the breast milk of nursing mothers in the Czech Republic since 1994 as a part of The Environmental Health Monitoring System. Knowledge about long-term POPs distribution and accumulation in the human body is crucial to understanding uptake, degradation and subsequent effects as well as to conduct risk assessments. The main aim of this study is to evaluate 15-years long-term trends of selected POPs in human milk in the Czech Republic and to elucidate the questionnaire information about the age, parity and social habits, to the final concentrations. This effectiveness evaluation of POPs restriction is quite precisely after 15-years monitoring campaigns.
   The human milk samples (4,753 samples) were analysed for a number of chlorinated organic chemicals including PCBs and selected chlorinated pesticides (OCPs, HCB, HCHs, DDX). The relative change of concentration per year for all chemicals was analysed. The remaining percentages of POPs in breast milk in comparison to 1994 are also expressed. Czech population half-lives of POPs in breast milk, derived from either linear or exponential models were computed.
   The long-term data indicates a continuation of a decreasing trend of POPs concentrations on breast milk. Our study did not confirm lactation and parity as an important outflux resulting in the decrease in concentrations in mothers, which is in the antagonism with most of the studies. The higher BMI was associated with higher amounts of HCB and lower amounts of higher chlorinated PCBs. The results confirm the effectiveness of restrictions of POPs usage in the Czech Republic. This ongoing long-term study is very useful tool for parametric effectiveness evaluation of Stockholm Convention.

AB  - This study demonstrated that a galactose-binding protein (GBP) produced by a ash pathogenic water mold, Aphanomyces piscicida, activates carp leukocytes. Leukocytes were separated from the head kidney and peripheral blood using Percoll density centrifugation. A flow cytometric analysis revealed that GBP binds with many cells and a variety of cell types including lymphocytes, granulocytes and thrombocytes. Intracellular calcium flux of the peripheral blood leukocytes induced by stimulation with GBP was confirmed by counting the fluo-3 loaded cells whose fluorescence increased after the stimulation using flow cytometry. The percentage of cells in which a calcium flux was induced peaked 1 min after the stimulation. Approximately 6% of the cells specifically responded I min after the stimulation. The proliferation response was determined by the level of BrdU uptake by the leukocytes after the stimulation. Cell proliferation was observed 2, 4 and 6 days after stimulation with GBP. The expression of cytokines IL-1beta and TGF-beta1 in the peripheral blood leukocytes, after the stimulation was evaluated by a semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Increased expression of IL-1beta was observed 4 h after stimulation with GBP. Variation of TGF-beta1 expression under the same conditions was not observed. The kinetics of intracellular calcium flux and the level of IL-1beta expression induced by GBP stimulation were different front those induced by phytohemagglutinin stimulation. These results confirmed that GBP is a pathogenic microbial component that can induce cell activation. GBP seems to induce the inflammatory response observed in the Aphanomyces infection.

AB  - Edwardsiella piscicida causes edwardsiellosis in a variety of fish species and leads to tremendous economic losses in the global aquaculture industries. Thus, effective and safe prevention and control of this bacterium are urgently needed to combat the related infections. Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) effectively prevent infectious diseases. However, most of the existing E. piscicida LAVs are based on the deletion of genes encoding the translocon components of the type III secretion system (T3SS), the core virulence system, which is the most prominent protective bacterial antigen with the strongest immunogenicity. In this study, we systematically deleted all of the 9 established T3SS effectors in E. piscicida (aka 9 Delta) and the rpoS gene encoding the alternative sigma factor, the esrB repressor (10 Delta), then we overexpressed esrB and T3SS in E. piscicida to obtain the recombinant strain 10 Delta/esrB(OE). The modified strains 10 Delta and 10 Delta/esrB(OE) exhibited severe attenuation and in vivo colonization defects. Additionally, vaccination by intraperitoneal injection with 10 Delta and 10 Delta/esrB(OE) could significantly upregulate the expression of the antigen recognition related gene (TLR5) and the adaptive immune response-related gene (MHC II) in the spleen/kidney of turbot fish, and it also enhanced the hosts' serum bactericidal capacity. Finally, vaccination with 10 Delta/esrB(OE) led to increased immune protection against the challenge of wild type E. piscicida EIB202 in turbot fish. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that 10 Delta/esrB(OE) was a novel LAV strain and therefore a potential novel strategy for the construction of LAVs against bacterial pathogens.

AB  - The Centropristis striata is an important economically marine fish and facing a serious threat from various pathogens. Edwardsiella piscicida is one of the fish pathogens that seriously infect cultured and wild fish species. To understand the molecular immune mechanisms underlying the response to E. piscicida, a comparative gene transcription analysis was performed through RNA-Seq technology. The low-quality sequences were excluded, and the high-quality sequences were assembled into a total of 60,759 contigs with an average length of 988.95 bp. A gene ontology (GO) analysis was employed to classify 5744 genes according to three major functional categories: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. A total of 19,918 genes were successfully annotated into 26 functional categories according to the clusters of orthologous groups (COG) classification. Furthermore, 15,006 genes were classified into 332 KEGG pathways. The q-value was introduced to estimate 5109 genes significantly differentially expressed which includes 1781 up-regulated genes and 3328 down-regulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were involved in the major immune-related pathways which refer to the pathogen recognition, inflammation, Toll-like receptor and chemokine signalling pathways. Moreover, 24,487 potential simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 193,760 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected and identified in the C. striata liver transcriptome. This work not only provides a valuable resource for further understanding of the antibacterial molecular mechanism of C. striata but also contributes to facilitate future studies on gene expression and functional genomics.

AB  - Recently, bacterial small RNA (sRNA) has been shown to be involved as a key regulator in stress responses. sRNAs of Edwardsiella piscicida, an important aquatic pathogen, are not well characterized to date. In this study, using RNA-seq technology, we globally found and identified sRNA candidates expressed from E. piscicida grown in normal LB medium, acid pressure, iron deficiency stress, and oxidation pressure. A total of 148 sRNAs were found, including 19 previously annotated sRNAs and 129 novel sRNA candidates by searching against the Rfam database. Compared in normal condition, the expression of 103 sRNAs (DEsRNA, differentially expressed sRNA) and 1615 mRNAs (DEmRNAs, differentially expressed mRNA) showed significant differences in three stress sample. Based on the prediction by IntaRNA and relational analysis between DEsRNAs and DEmRNAs, 103 DEsRNAs were predicted to regulate 769 target mRNAs. Pleiotropic function of target DEmRNAs indicated that sRNAs extensively participated in a variety of physiological processes, including response to adversity and pathogenicity, the latter was further confirmed by infection experiment. A large number transcription factors appeared in target genes of sRNAs, which suggested that sRNAs likely deeply interlaced within complex gene regulatory networks of E. piscicida. Moreover, 49 Hfq-associated sRNAs were also identified in this study. In summary, we globally discovered sRNAs for the first time in pathogenic bacteria of fish, and our findings indicated that sRNAs in E. piscicida have important roles in adaptation to environmental stress and pathogenicity. These results also provide clues for deciphering regulation mechanism of gene expression related to physiological response and pathogenicity.

AB  - Three sets of studies of the impacts of human exposure to PCB contaminated fish from the Great Lakes basin-the Michigan Sports Fisherman Cohort, the Michigan Maternal/Infant Cohort, and the Wisconsin Maternal/Infant Cohort-were evaluated using the epidemiologic criteria of Susser (1986).  The studies were compared against each other, and against comparable data from other geographic locales.  A total of seven major categories of exposure sequelae were evaluated.  These ranged from the effects of primary exposure to contaminants upon maternal health status, to effects from secondary intrauterine fetal exposure, including alterations in birth size and gestational age, changes in neonatal health status, and effects persisting into early infancy.  Results of the evaluations suggest that the causal hypothesis may be strongly affirmed for the relationship between PCB exposure and transplacental passage of PCB molecules.  The relationship between PCB exposure and alterations in both neonatal health status and in health status in early infancy may be affirmed with reasonable certainty.  While the evidence from the Michigan Maternal/Infant Cohort related to maternal exposure to PCB and infant size at birth and gestational age affirms the causal hypothesis, studies from other geographic locales tend only to be supportive.  Analytic differences are likely responsible for this variation, but epidemiologically, the composite rating must be regarded as indeterminate.  The relationship with observed alterations in maternal health status, composite activity ranking, and McCarthy Memory Scale deficits were also classified as indeterminate.  No evidences of obvious negation were seen, although one portion of a study was disqualified because of incoherence.

AB  - The humpback dolphins of the eastern Taiwan Strait were first discovered scientifically in 2002 and since then have received much research attention. We reviewed all information published in peer-reviewed scientific journals on these dolphins and where appropriate and available, peer-reviewed scientific workshop reports and graduate theses were also examined. Recent evidence demonstrated that this population warranted recognition as a subspecies, Sousa chinensis taiwanensis. It is found in a highly restricted and linear strip of coastal waters along central western Taiwan. Numbering fewer than 80 individuals and declining, five main threats (fisheries interactions, habitat loss and degradation, loss of freshwater to estuaries within their habitat, air and water pollution, and noise) threaten the future existence of this subspecies. These dolphins have cultural and religious importance and boast the highest level of legal protection for wildlife in Taiwan. However, despite enormous efforts by local and international non-governmental groups urging immediate conservation actions, there have been no real government efforts to mitigate any existing threats; instead, some of these threats have worsened. Based on recent studies, we suggest the IUCN Red List status be revised to Critically Endangered CR 2a(ii); D for the subspecies.

AB  - Research on improvement of sugarcane by genetic engineering has been undertaken by the South African Sugarcane Research Institute (SASRI) for the last 18 years. Modifications include tolerance to herbicides (glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium) and the lepidopteran stalk borer Eldana saccharina via cry1A(b) gene insertion as well as perturbations to enzymes involved in sucrose metabolism (e. g., up-and/or down-regulation of phosphofructokinase and neutral invertase). Sugarcane containing these traits has been evaluated in confined field trials at SASRI. Field-grown transgenic material is subjected to agronomic characterization and molecular analysis to determine stability and heritability of the inserted characteristic over successive growing seasons/harvest cycles. Although no genetically modified (GM) sugarcane is grown commercially in South Africa, activities involving research and both trial and commercial release of GM crops in the country are regulated by the GMO Act (Act 15, 1997) which is administered by the Directorate Plant Genetic Resources of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Field trials can be conducted on receipt of a Trial Release Permit (i.e., intentional introduction to the environment) once a transgenic line has undergone preliminary molecular screening. Permit conditions stipulate activities such as regular field inspections, submission of annual reports, appropriate monitoring and record-keeping and destruction of test material on termination of the trial. To release commercial GM sugarcane, a General Release Permit would be required but such applications are in abeyance while issues such as intellectual property and market-related issues are under scrutiny.

AB  - Chlorothalonil is an active biocide applied in antifouling paints, and also used as fungicide in agricultural activities with the purpose to protect plants from foliar and seed diseases. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chlorothalonil exposure on biochemical biomarkers of oxidative metabolism as well as on cholinesterases in the estuarine polychaete Laeonereis acuta. Animals were exposed for 24 and 96 h to the following nominal concentrations of chlorothalonil: 0.1, 10.0 and 100.0 mu g/L. The antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and the activity of the enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and propionylcholinesterase (PChE) were evaluated in whole-body tissue. In addition, the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPO), glycogen and lactate levels were also analyzed. A reduction in ACAP levels was observed in animals exposed to the higher chlorothalonil concentration, concomitantly with an induction of GST activity as well as diminution in GSH content in these animals. This disturbance in the redox state of animal tissues leads to an oxidative stress situation, resulting in an induction in LPO levels. It was also demonstrated that chlorothalonil exposure causes alteration in AChE activity, possibly related to damage to membrane lipids. These results demonstrated that chlorothalonil possesses harmful effects to estuarine animals and its use as antifouling biocide has to be carefully reconsidered in risk analysis studies.

AB  - Nitroexplosives are essential for security and defense of the nation and hence their production continues. Their residues and transformed products, released in the environment are toxic to both terrestrial and aquatic life. This necessitates remediation of wastewaters containing such hazardous chemicals to reduce threat to human health and environment. Bioremediation technologies using microorganisms become the present day choice. High Melting Explosive (HMX) is one of the nitroexplosives produced by nitration of hexamine using ammonium nitrate and acetic anhydride and hence the wastewater bears high concentration of nitrate and acetate. The present investigation describes potential of a soil isolate of yeast Pichia sydowiorum MCM Y-3, for remediation of HMX wastewater in fixed film bioreactor (FFBR). The flask culture studies showed appreciable growth of the organism in HMX wastewater under shake culture condition within 5-6 days of incubation at ambient temperature (28 +/- A 2A degrees C). The FFBR process operated in both batch and continuous mode, with Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) of 1 week resulted in 50-55% removal in nitrate, 70-88% in acetate, 50-66% in COD, and 28-50% in HMX content. Continuous operation of the reactor showed better removal of nitrate as compared to that in the batch operation, while removal of acetate and COD was comparable in both the modes of operation of the reactor. Insertion of baffles in the reactor increased efficiency of the reactor. Thus, FFBR developed with baffles and operated in continuous mode will be beneficial for bioremediation of high nitrate and acetate containing wastewater using the culture of P. sydowiorum.

AB  - Schad AN, Dick GO. Aquatic vegetation community structure response to hydrilla management with triploid grass carp, herbicide, and native vegetation planting. Lake Reserve Manage. 34:417-425.To aid conservation managers conducting hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle) management, we evaluated changes in aquatic vegetation community structure and dominance in dioecious hydrilla-infested ponds by applying several management tools and monitoring vegetation changes on an annual basis over a 4yr period. The study was conducted in fully vegetated (dioecious hydrilla and native macrophytes) 0.3ha mesocosm ponds using 4 levels of triploid grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella Valenciennes) stocking densities (0-129 per vegetated hectare), a one-time second-year herbicide treatment to reduce standing biomass of hydrilla and other submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV), and native plantings to provide the basis for replacing hydrilla as it was controlled. Grass carp stocking density had an inverse relationship with coverage of total vegetation, hydrilla, volunteer SAV, and volunteer emergents. All vegetation categories recovered from the one-time herbicide application, although this was suppressed by higher densities of grass carp. Grass carp did not significantly affect planted growth forms (SAV, floating-leaved, and emergent), with increases in mean coverage in all treatments through time, although coverage was lowest at the highest grass carp density. Vegetation dominance shifted from hydrilla to native in both control and low grass carp density treatments, with most SAV eliminated from treatments stocked with more than 72 per hectare.

AB  - Amphibian embryos are naturally exposed to prooxidant conditions throughout their development. Environmental exposure to contaminants may affect their capacity to respond to challenging conditions, to progress in a normal ontogenesis, and finally to survive and succeed in completing metamorphosis. We studied the effects of the exposure to two anticholinesterase agents, the carbamate carbaryl and the organophosphate azinphos methyl, on the antioxidant defenses of developing embryos of the toad Rhinella (Bufo) arenarum. Reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were increased early by carbaryl, but were decreased by both pesticides at the end of embryonic development. The GSH-dependent enzymes glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidases showed oscillating activity patterns that could be attributed to an induction of activity in response to oxidative stress and inactivation by excess of reactive oxygen species. Glutathione-S-transferases, which may participate in the conjugation of lipid peroxide products in addition to pesticide detoxification, showed an increase of activity at the beginning and at the end of development. Catalase also showed variations in the activity suggesting, successively, induction and inactivation in response to pesticide exposure-induced oxidative stress. Superoxide dismutase activity was increased by carbaryl and transiently decreased by azinphos methyl exposure. judging from the depletion in GSH levels and glutathione reductase inhibition at the end of embryonic development, the oxidative stress caused by azinphos methyl seemed to be greater than that caused by carbaryl, which might be in turn related with a higher number of developmental alterations caused by the organophosphate. GSH content is a good biomarker of oxidative stress in the developing embryos exposed to pesticides. The antioxidant enzymes are in turn revealing the balance between their protective capacity and the oxidative damage to the enzyme molecules, decreasing their activity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cortisol, the main glucocorticoid in fish, undertakes pleiotropic biological effects in response to stressors to maintain homeostasis. It can exert several actions on the immune system, growth and cellular metabolism, establishing a fine-tune regulation stress response and cross-talk interactions with other regulatory pathways. In this study, we investigated a causal relationship between high levels of glucocorticoids and susceptibility to pathogens and modification of gene expression profiles in Senegalese sole. For this purpose, we carried out two experiments using post-metamorphic individuals (21 days after hatching) that were exposed to dexamethasone (DXM), a potent glucocorticoid, in order to mimic cortisol effects. We quantified transcript levels of a wide set of genes involved in innate immune system (g-type lysozyme and hepcidin (hamp1)), HPI axis (crf, crfbp, pomc alpha, pomc beta, gr1 and gr2), HPT axis (tgb), cellular stress defense system (hsp70 and hsp90a), GH/IGF axis (igf-I and igf-Ir) and the neuropeptide trh. Short-term exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 ppm DXM provoked a reduction of pomc beta transcripts and an increase of crfbp mRNAs in a dose-dependent manner at 48 and 72 h after treatment. Moreover, g-type lysozyme transcript levels decreased significantly at 72 h whereas ham p I mRNA levels increased at 48 h after exposure. Long-term DXM treatment (10 ppm DXM) affected negatively weight of soles (similar to 20% lower than controls). Moreover, reduced mRNA levels were observed for pomcg after 1 week and igf-I and hampl after 2 weeks. In contrast, crfbp and crf increased mRNA levels after 2 weeks. hsp70 exhibited a dual response increasing transcript levels at 1 week after treatment and reducing thereafter. No significant changes in gene expression were observed at any time during this study for tgb, trh, hsp90a, pomca, gr1 and gr2. Finally, a challenge experiment using the pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp piscicida confirmed earlier and higher mortalities in DXM-treated animals. Taken together, these data indicate that a prolonged exposure to DXM increases the susceptibility to pathogens and reduces growth. Moreover, DXM can trigger a wide cellular response modulating the expression of genes involved in the innate immune system, HPI and GH/IGF axes as well as cellular stress defense. These results are highly valuable to evaluate responses associated to aquaculture stressful conditions and discriminate specific glucocorticoid-mediated effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Chromosomal rearrangements, including DNA deletions are involved in carcinogenesis. The deletion (DEL) assay scoring for DNA deletions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to detect a wide range of carcinogens. Among approximately 60 compounds of known carcinogenic activity, the DEL assay detected 86% correctly whereas the Ames Salmonella assay detected only 30% correctly [R.J. Brennan, R.H. Schiestl, Detecting carcinogens with the yeast DEL assay, Methods Mol. Biol. 262 (2004) 111- 124]. Since the DEL assay is highly inducible by DNA double strand breaks, this study examined the utility of the DEL assay for detecting clastogens. Ten model compounds, with varied mechanisms of genotoxicity, were examined for their effect on the frequency of DNA deletions with the DEL assay. The compounds tested were: actinomycin D, camptothecin, methotrexate and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, which are anticancer agents, noscapine and furosemide are therapeutics, acridine, methyl acrylate and resorcinol are industrial chemicals and diazinon is an insecticide. The in vitro micronucleus assay (IVMN) in CHO cells, a commonly used tool for detection of clastogens, was performed on the same compounds and the results of the two assays were compared. The results of our study show that there is 70% concordance in the presence of metabolic activation (rat liver S9) and 80% concordance in the absence of metabolic activation between the DEL assay and the standard in vitro micronucleus assay. The lack of cytotoxicity observed for four of the ten compounds examined indicates limited diffusion of lipophilic compounds across the yeast cell wall. Thus, the development of a more permeable yeast tester strain is expected to greatly improve concordance of the DEL assay with the IVMN assay. The yeast DEL assay is inexpensive, amenable to automation and requires less expertise to perform than the IVMN. Thus, it has a strong potential as a robust, fast and economical screen for detecting clastogens in vitro. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Little has been published about the interactions of metals and parasites in economically important aquaculture species, particularly shellfish. Metal bioaccumulation and parasitic diseases could vary in different species depending on temperature changes and other environmental factors. Most studies conducted on endoparasites, such as acanthocephalans, cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes, indicate that only cestodes and acanthocephalans could absorb heavy metals successfully in their hosts, and that only adult worms could be used as indicators of environmental pollution. In Artemia parthenogenetica, cestodes increased resistance to arsenic (As) pollution and temperature changes; and infection was associated with improved antioxidant defense system without oxidative damage. The most serious parasite of Penaeus spp. is Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (Microsporidia: Enterocytozoonidae). Apostome ciliates are negatively impacting Pandalus borealis of the northeastern United States (Synophrya sp. that causes "white eggs" or Black Spot Gill Syndrome) and Penaeus spp. from the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Hyalophysa lynni that causes shrimp black gill). In freshwater fish, the larvae of the nematode Eustrongylides spp. Jagerskiold, 1909 (Nematoda: Dioctophymidae) absorbed lead (Pb), mercury, and cadmium, when the metal levels were close to zero in water and sediment. The concentration of Pb in the larvae was approximately 17 times higher than in the fish. Like the antioxidant defense reactions in the parasitized A. parthenogenetica exposed to As, an improved antioxidant defense system may be available in parasitized fish, limiting oxidative damage caused by metals. This study presents baseline concentrations of 30 metals in wild Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931 from Ecuador and other species, as well as the current taxonomy for selected shellfish species and their parasites. Research is needed to assess the relationship of metals in parasites and host tissues, and oxidative stress in shellfish. The tools of One Health including molecular ecology, population genomics, proteomics, and epigenetic epidemiology should be used to detect parasites and environmental pollution indicators that could threaten aquatic species from freshwater and marine ecosystems, particularly considering climate change and pollution threats.

AB  - This study aimed to characterise and evaluate the probiotic properties of a newly isolated marine bacterium, strain S6031. The isolated strain was identified as Pseudoalteromonas ruthenica. In vivo experiments were con-ducted with P. ruthenica-immersed larvae and P. ruthenica-enriched Artemia fed to adult zebrafish. Disease tolerance of larval zebrafish against Edwardsiella piscicida was demonstrated by 66.34% cumulative per cent survival (CPS) in the P. ruthenica-exposed group, which was higher than the CPS of the control (46.67%) at 72 h post challenge (hpc). Heat-stressed larvae had 55% CPS in the P. ruthenica-immersed group, while the control had 30% CPS at 60 hpc. Immune-stress response gene transcripts (muc5.1, muc5.2, muc5.3, alpi2, alpi3, hsp70, and hsp90a) were induced, while pro-inflammatory genes (tnf alpha, il1b, and il6) were downregulated in P. ruthenica- immersed larvae compared to the control. This trend was confirmed by low pro-inflammatory and high stress -responsive protein expression levels in P. ruthenica-exposed larvae. Adult zebrafish had higher CPS (27.2%) in the P. ruthenica-fed group than the control (9.52%) upon E. piscicida challenge, suggesting increased disease tolerance. Histological analysis demonstrated modulation of goblet cell density and average villus height in the P. ruthenica-supplemented group. Metagenomics analysis clearly indicated modulation of alpha diversity indices and the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in the P. ruthenica-supplemented zebrafish gut. Furthermore, increased Firmicutes colonisation and reduced Bacteroidetes abundance in the gut were observed upon P. ruthenica supplementation. Additionally, this study confirmed the concentration-dependent increase of colony dispersion and macrophage uptake upon mucin treatment. In summary, P. ruthenica possesses remarkable functional properties as a probiotic that enhances host defence against diseases and thermal stress.

AB  - Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was purified from the brain of the waxmoth, Galleria mellonella (L.) by affinity chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography. It resolved as a single band by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) both nondenaturing and SDS (silver stained), and as a single peak by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), in an overall yield of 32% representing 283-fold purification. This was a true acetylcholinesterase, with no activity as a non-specific cholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase). The molecular weight determined by PAGE in the absence and presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) was ca. 240,000 Da and 60,000 Da respectively, indicating an arrangement of tetrameric subunits. 2-Heptanone, the honeybee alarm pheromone, reversibly and competitively inhibited the purified Galleria AChE with a K-i value of 1.34x10(-3) M. Furthermore, five monoterpenes associated with plant defence and representing a range of functional groups, also were reversible competitive inhibitors of the purified AChE from Galleria, which is consistent with previous data for electric eel AChE (Ryan, M.F., Byme, O., 1988.

AB  - This study investigated elimination of the herbicide pendimethalin using an integrated rice and Procambarus clarkii breeding model of indoor and outdoor (pond culture) exposure tests. The pendimethalin levels in 484 samples from the primary rice and P. clarkii integrated breeding areas in Hubei province were monitored, and dietary risk assessments of pendimethalin were calculated. Pendimethalin was quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and detection levels were linear in the range of 1.0 to 10.0 mu g/L, and peak areas were positively correlated with concentration, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9996. Recoveries ranged from 86.9 to 103.5%, and the limit of quantitation was 2.5 x 10(-4) mu g/L in water, and 1 x 10(-2) mu g/kg in tissues, sediments, and waterweeds. The dissipation rate of pendimethalin in tissues and water followed first-order kinetics, with half-lives of 0.51-5.64 d. In 484 samples taken from aquaculture farms, pendimethalin was detected in 8.67% of the samples at levels in the range of 1.95 to 8.26 mu g/kg in Hubei province from 2018 to 2020. The maximum residue limit of pendimethalin in P. clarkii has not been established in China, but our dietary risk assessments indicated that consumption of P. clarkii from integrated rice farms was acceptable.

AB  - Background: Hypospadias represents the most frequent male congenital malformation in children, with a prevalence of 1 in 200-300 new born or 4-6 in 1000 male new born. Genetic and environmental factors play a strong role on developing this virilization defect acting as endocrinal disruptors (ED). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the environmental factors that may have influenced the development oh hypospadias in children treated at the Maternal and Child University Hospital od Las Palmas of Gran Canaria Island during the years 2012-2015.
   Methods: The present study represents a retrospective analysis of patients treated for hypospadias in the Maternal-Paediatric University Hospital of Las Palmas of Gran Canaria during 4 years (2012 -2015) by the use of medical records and telephone survey to families' patients. To perform the statistical analysis of the data, the SPSS program was used in version 15.0. The level of statistical significance was established for an error alpha = 0.05. The chi-square test and Fisher's correction were applied if necessary to test the associations between the qualitative variables.
   Results: From 2012 to 2015, 128 patients were treated; we could only follow 116 patients. If we analyse patients' distribution throught those years we can resume that 33% of them were treated in 2012, 23% in 2013, 24% in 2014 and 20% in 2015. We analyse the study background of both parents: 45.5% of mothers had primary studies, 37.5% had secundary studies, 15.2% had university studies and 1.8% were students; 54.3% of fathers had primary studies, 32.4% had secundary studies and 13.3% had university studies. We did not found any statistically significant diference between the place of residence and the study background both in mothers (p=0,262) and fathers (p=0,052). Within all the patients followed, 78 had a clinical history of exposition to ED as a direct family background.
   Conclusions: The chronical exposure to ED, very frequent in our society, is a very important risk factor in the development of urologic pathologies as hypospadias; for this reason, awareness measures and prevention in social areas and workplace must be carried out to avoid unnecessary exposures.

AB  - Sulfometuron methyl (SM) is a widely used herbicide and thus leading to accumulation in the environment. The toxicity assessments of SM in model organisms are currently rare. In the present study, zebrafish were utilized for evaluating the detrimental effects of SM in aquatic vertebrates. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM from 5.5 to 72 h post-fertilization (hpf), respectively. Consequently, SM exposure resulted in increasing the mortality rate and reducing hatching rate in larval zebrafish at 10, 20, and 40 mg/L SM-treated groups. The reduced numbers of immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) were observed after SM exposure by a dose-dependent manner. The inflammatory responses (TLR4, MYD88, IL-1I3, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-y, IL-10, and TGF-I3) were measured to estimate immune responses. Anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10 and TGF-I3) were downregulated in all the treated groups and significantly altered at 40 mg/L exposure group. Additionally, behavioral tests suggested that SM treatment significantly increased the total distance, average speed, and maximum acceleration of larval zebrafish during light-dark transition and subsequently enzymology test displayed the same trend to locomotor behaviors. The content significantly increased in oxidative stress, as reflected in ROS level in all the treated groups. The numbers of cell apoptosis were significantly increased at 20, and 40 mg/L and the highest concentration group induced the substantial increment (P < 0.001) of apoptosis-related genes including p53, Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-9, and caspase-3. In summary, our results demonstrated that exposure to SM caused toxicity of development, immune system, locomotor behavior, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis at the early developmental stages of zebrafish.

AB  - N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) is one of the emerging nitrogenous disinfection byproducts with probable cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenesis. Its potential toxicological effects have received extensive attention but remain to be poorly understood. In this study, changes in NDEA precursors in drinking water treatment process were studied using the trial of its formation potential (FP), and the toxicity induced by NDEA to adult zebrafish was investigated. NDEA FP in the raw water of Taihu Lake ranged from 46.9 to 68.3 ng/L. The NDEA precursors were removed effectively by O-3/BAC process. Hydrophilic fraction and low-molecular-weight fraction (<1 kDa) had the highest NDEA FP. The toxicity results demonstrated that the acute lethal concentration of NDEA causing 50% mortality in 96 h (96-h LC50) was 210.4 mg/L, and NDEA was more likely to be accumulated in kidney, followed by liver and gill. NDEA induced oxidative stress and antioxidant defense to zebrafish metabolism system at concentrations over 5 mu g/L. After a 42-day exposure, a significant DNA damage was observed in zebrafish liver cells at NDEA concentrations beyond 500 a. This study investigated NDEA properties in both engineering prospective and toxicity evaluation, thus providing comprehensive information on its control in drinking water treatment process and its toxicity effect on zebrafish as a model animal.

AB  - Adsorption of DNA molecules on mixed phase-separated monolayers composed of a hydrocarbon-containing comb copolymer with an s-triazine ring and a fluorinated s-triazine derivative and their fluorescence emission behavior were investigated. DNA molecules derived from salmon testes were selectively adsorbed only on the diamino-s-triazine ring of the hydrogenated copolymer in the monolayer from the subphase. A mixed monolayer of a hydrocarbon-based comb copolymer and an s-triazine derivative with fluorocarbons exhibited phase sepa-ration behavior on water surfaces and indicated expansion behavior, reflecting interactions on the subphase containing DNA molecules. The phase-separated morphology changed depending on the mixing ratio of the hydrogenated copolymer and fluorinated s-triazine derivative. After DNA adsorption, the height of the domain formed by the hydrocarbon chain was selectively increased. In addition, because the DNA molecules adsorbed on the phase-separated template film maintain their fluorescence emission ability, the second-order structure, which is the origin of the emission ability, was evaluated using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The phase-separated, template-adsorbed DNA molecules maintained the same positive Cotton effect as in solution and were predicted to retain exquisite and delicate steric structure, leading to functional occurrence.

AB  - Xenorhabdus nematophila produces type 1 fimbriae on the surface of Phase I cells. Fimbriae mediate recognition and adhesion of the bacteria to its target cell. To investigate the role of fimbriae in the biology of X. nematophila, we have produced a fimbrial mutant strain by insertional inactivation of the mrxA gene, encoding the structural subunit of type 1 fimbriae. Phenotypic characterization of the mutant revealed loss of fimbriae on the cell surface. Cell surface characteristics like dye absorption, biofilm formation, red blood cell agglutination remained unaltered. The mrxA mutant was defective in swarming on soft agar, although swimming motility was not affected. Flagellar expression was suppressed in the mrxA strain under swarming conditions, but not swimming conditions. Agglutination and cytotoxicity of the mutant to larval haemocytes was also reduced. When the mutant cells were injected in the haemocoel of the fourth instar larvae of Helicoverpa armigera, an increase in the LT50 of 9-12 h was observed relative to the wild-type strain. The nematode growth was slow on the lawn of the fimbrial mutant. The mrxA negative strain was unable to colonize the nematode gut efficiently. This study demonstrates importance of type 1 fimbriae in establishment of bacteria-nematode symbiosis, a key to successful pest management program.

T2  - PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES FOR EVALUATING ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION IN SILDLIFE

CP  - Workshop on Principles and Processes for Evaluating Endocrine Disruption in Wildlife
AB  - The avian endocrine system is intimately involved in the regulation of many physiological functions. The period of sexual differentiation of gonads, brain, and behavior is probably the most sensitive to the influence of endocrine modulation. Exposure to small quantities of exogenous hormones during the critical periods for sexual differentiation can result in severe and permanent alterations in gonad and brain development and in subsequent adult reproductive behavior. Relatively great concentrations of organochlorine chemicals are generally required to illicit effects that are less dramatic than those caused by exogenous hormones. Female-female pairings and low male/female ratios in some gull populations may be related to endocrine disruption by environmental contaminants, but any mechanism that could cause differential male mortality in gull populations may be a viable alternate explanation. The mechanism by which some organochlorine contaminants cause eggshell thinning is complex and may vary among sensitive avian species. The modulation of calcium homeostasis may be involved, as the transport of calcium from the eggshell gland mucosa to the lumen fluid has been implicated as a proximate cause of eggshell thinning. The modulation of thyroid hormone homeostasis by xenobiotics is a possible cause of goiter in some wildlife populations. The histological presentation of goiter can vary depending upon the etiologic agent responsible. Histological criteria were used to rule out polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as a possible cause of goiter in a population of Great Lakes herring gulls.

AB  - Transgenic crops expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins have been widely and successfully deployed for the control of target pests, while allowing a substantial reduction in insecticide use. The evolution of resistance (a heritable decrease in susceptibility to Bt toxins) can pose a threat to sustained control of target pests, but a high-dose refuge (HDR) management strategy has been key to delaying countervailing evolution of Bt resistance. The HDR strategy relies on the mating frequency between susceptible and resistant individuals, so either partial dominance of resistant alleles or nonrandom mating in the pest population itself could elevate the pace of resistance evolution. Using classic Wright-Fisher genetic models, we investigated the impact of deviations from standard refuge model assumptions on resistance evolution in the pest populations. We show that when Bt selection is strong, even deviations from random mating and/or strictly recessive resistance that are below the threshold of detection can yield dramatic increases in the pace of resistance evolution. Resistance evolution is hastened whenever the order of magnitude of model violations exceeds the initial frequency of resistant alleles. We also show that the existence of a fitness cost for resistant individuals on the refuge crop cannot easily overcome the effect of violated HDR assumptions. We propose a parametrically explicit framework that enables both comparison of various field situations and model inference. Using this model, we propose novel empiric estimators of the pace of resistance evolution (and time to loss of control), whose simple calculation relies on the observed change in resistance allele frequency.

AB  - The Phongolo floodplain is one of southern Africa's most important systems. In this study, we carried out a regional scale ecological risk assessment to evaluate the risk of multiple stressors associated with the use of the aquatic resources in the floodplain to selected social and ecological endpoints representing its sustainability. The floodplain has undergone significant changes as a result of the impacts of multiple stressors. This includes high risk of impact and threatened sustainability between the Pongolapoort Dam and the Ndumo Game Reserve (NGR). This compares to relatively low risk to the maintenance of the endpoints within the NGR. The reserve provides a protection and refuge function for regional biodiversity maintenance and ecosystem sustainability processes. In the study a range of scenarios were considered and demonstrate that the system will respond to protection measures and or increased resource use options. Should flood reductions in the or water quality pollution drivers continue on increasing trajectories, the condition of the Phongolo River and floodplain will probably deteriorate into an unacceptable, unsustainable state. Removal of the protection services of the NGR would result in an unsustainable ecosystem and loss of ecosystem services for regional vulnerable African communities. Additional evidence should be obtained from monitoring and research to refine, validate, and update the assessment in an adaptive management context. The risk assessment framework approach implemented in the Phongolo floodplain can contribute to the management of other floodplains ecosystems and the sustainability management of social and ecological attributes and processes of these important ecosystems.

AB  - Edwardsiella spp. are responsible for significant losses in important wild and cultured fish species worldwide. Recent phylogenomic investigations have determined that bacteria historically classified as Edwardsiella tarda actually represent three genetically distinct yet phenotypically ambiguous taxa with various degrees of pathogenicity in different hosts. Previous recognition of these taxa was hampered by the lack of a distinguishing phenotypic character. Commercial test panel configurations are relatively constant over time, and as new species are defined, appropriate discriminatory tests may not be present in current test panel arrangements. While phenobiochemical tests fail to discriminate between these taxa, data presented here revealed discriminatory peaks for each Edwardsiella species using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) methodology, suggesting that MALDI-TOF can offer rapid, reliable identification in line with current systematic classifications. Furthermore, a multiplex PCR assay was validated for rapid molecular differentiation of the Edwardsiella spp. affecting fish. Moreover, the limitations of relying on partial 16S rRNA for discrimination of Edwardsiella spp. and advantages of employing alternative single-copy genes gyrB and sodB for molecular identification and classification of Edwardsiella were demonstrated. Last, sodB sequencing confirmed that isolates previously defined as typical motile fish-pathogenic E. tarda are synonymous with Edwardsiella piscicida, while atypical nonmotile fish-pathogenic E. tarda isolates are equivalent to Edwardsiella anguillarum. Fish-nonpathogenic E. tarda isolates are consistent with E. tarda as it is currently defined. These analyses help deconvolute the scientific literature regarding these organisms and provide baseline information to better facilitate proper taxonomic assignment and minimize erroneous identifications of Edwardsiella isolates in clinical and research settings.

AB  - Despite growing evidence of the detrimental effect of chemical substances on organisms, limited research has focused on changes in behavioral patterns, in part due to the difficulties to obtain detailed quantitative data. Recent developments in efficient computer-based video analyses have allowed testing pesticide effects on model species such as the zebrafish. However, these new techniques have not yet been applied to amphibians and directly to conservation issues. i.e., to assess toxicological risks on threatened species. We used video-tracking analyses to test a quantitative effect of an environmental contaminant on the locomotion of amphibian tadpoles (Rana temporaria) by taking into account cumulative effects. Because recent research has demonstrated effects of de-icing salts on survival and community structure, we used sodium chloride in our experimental design (25 replicates, 4 concentrations, 4 times) to test for an effect at the scale of behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations. Analysis of 372 1-h video-tracks (5 samples/s) showed a complex action of salts on behavioral patterns with a dose and cumulative response over time. Although no effects were found on mortality or growth, the highest salt concentrations reduced the speed and movement of tadpoles in comparison with control treatments. The reduced locomotor performance could have detrimental consequences in terms of tadpoles' responses to competition and predation and may be an indicator of the low concentration effect of the contaminant. On one hand, this study demonstrates the usefulness of examining behavior to address conservation issues and understand the complex action of environmental factors and, more particularly, pollutants on organisms. On the other hand, our results highlight the need of new computerized techniques to quantitatively analyze these patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effector proteins secreted by the type 3 secretion system (T3SS) of pathogenic bacteria have been shown to precisely modulate important signaling cascades of the host for the benefit of the pathogens. Among others, the non-LEE encoded T3SS effector protein NleC of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a Zn-dependent metalloprotease and suppresses innate immune responses by directly targeting the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Many pathogenic bacteria release potent bacterial toxins of the A-B type, which-in contrast to the direct cytoplasmic injection of T3SS effector proteins-are released first into the environment. In this study, we found that NleC displays characteristics of bacterial A-B toxins, when applied to eukaryotic cells as a recombinant protein. Although lacking a B subunit, that typically mediates the uptake of toxins, recombinant NleC (rNleC) induces endocytosis via lipid rafts and follows the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. The conformation of rNleC is altered by low pH to facilitate its escape from acidified endosomes. This is reminiscent of the homologous A-B toxin AIP56 of the fish pathogen Photobacterium damselae piscicida (Phdp). The recombinant protease NleC is functional inside eukaryotic cells and cleaves p65 of the NF-kappa B pathway. Here, we describe the endocytic uptake mechanism of rNleC, characterize its intracellular trafficking and demonstrate that its specific activity of cleaving p65 requires activation of host cells e.g., by IL1 beta. Further, we propose an evolutionary link between some T3SS effector proteins and bacterial toxins from apparently unrelated bacteria. In summary, these properties might suggest rNleC as an interesting candidate for future applications as a potential therapeutic against immune disorders.

AB  - The acute toxicity of PCBs to adult birds increases with increasing chlorination of the PCB mixture, and brain residues greater than 300 mg/kg are associated with mortality, Sublethal effects in adults include reduced parental attentiveness and abnormal reproductive behavior, PCBs cause a suite of developmental effects, including endocrine disruption, immunotoxicity and teratogenesis, rather than a specific etiology such as egg shell thinning, possible polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) contamination in PCB mixtures may have been responsible for some of the reported toxic effects attributed to PCBs, such as edema, PCB concentrations causing embryo mortality range from 3.1 mu g/kg for 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl in chicken eggs to 30 mg/kg for total PCBs in double crested cormorant eggs, Dietary no adverse effect concentrations range from 0.5 ppm in the American kestrel to 50 ppm in the Japanese quail, Genetic differences related to expression of the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor, rather than toxicokinetics, may be the dominant factor determining reproductive toxicity of PCBs in birds, The assessment of potential injury to bird populations from PCBs is confounded by the presence of multiple contaminants in field-collected biota and environmental media.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to assess the water quality to chemical pollution at Roggem Dam, the headwater of the Reconquista river, and to perform a Cadmium (Cd) contamination pulse simulation through a wide battery of biomarkers which included: genotoxicity and enzymatic biomarker parameters on a neotropical teleost fish namely Cnesterodon decemmaculatus. Water samples were taken in order to determine the river's physicochemical profile. An integrative approach was applied using a biomarker index.
   The bioassay involved the use of laboratory culture adult animals, acclimatized in moderately hard water (MHW) and fed ad libitum. A semi-static 96 h bioassay was conducted and the experimental groups were as follows: [1] river water (Rg); [2] river water + 2 mg/L Cd (RgCd); [3] MHW + 2 mg/L Cadmium (Cd), positive metal control; [4] MHW + 5 mg/L Cydophosphamide (positive genotoxicity control-CP); [5] MWH, negative control (NC). At the end of the exposure time fishes were sectioned and the following biomarkers were determined: 1) condition factor rate (CF); 2) for the anterior section (A) (head): glutathione (GSH) and protein (Pr) content; 3) for the body midsection (M) (viscera): Pr, GSH, Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Blood samples were also taken from the fish specimens to estimate the frequency of micronuclei (MN) as well as other nuclear abnormalities (NA).
   The physicochemical profile of the river water sample indicated high Copper concentrations. CAT and SOD activity and total Pr content did not show any significant changes. GST activity decreased in fish exposed to Rg, while GSH content decreased significantly for all treatments compared to controls in MHW. These results would seem to point to a reduction in cell defense capability as a result of the depletion antioxidants such as GSH. The NA frequency increased significantly in all treated groups while MN frequency was increased only in Cd and CP groups.
   Using some the biomarkers measured, a biomarker index was estimated which revealed that fish exposed to Rg were 90% affected or highly affected, while those exposed to RgCd were 80% and Cd 68% affected or highly affected. The obtained results indicate the usefulness of the use of a battery of variables by means of the biomarker index to analyze water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

AB  - We conducted 96-h static acute toxicity studies to evaluate the relative sensitivity of juveniles of the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and the standard cold-water surrogate rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) to three rangeland herbicides commonly used for controlling invasive weeds in the northwestern United States. Relative species sensitivity was compared using three procedures: standard acute toxicity testing, fractional estimates of lethal concentrations, and accelerated life testing chronic estimation procedures. The acutely lethal concentrations (ALC) resulting in 50% mortality at 96 h (96-h ALC50s) were determined using linear regression and indicated that the three herbicides were toxic in the order of picloram acid > 2,4-D acid > clopyralid acid. The 96-h ALC50 values for rainbow trout were as follows: picloram, 41 mg/L; 2.4-D, 707 mg/L; and clopyralid, 700 mg/L. The 96-h ALC50 values for bull trout were as follows: picloram, 24 mg/L; 2.4-D, 398 mg/L; and clopyralid, 802 mg/L. Fractional estimates of safe concentrations, based on 5% of the 96-h ALC50, were conservative (overestimated toxicity) of regression-derived 96-h ALC5 values by an order of magnitude. Accelerated life testing procedures were used to estimate chronic lethal concentrations (CLC) resulting in 1% mortality at 30 d (30-d CLC1) for the three herbicides: picloram (1 mg/L rainbow trout, 5 mg/L bull trout), 2,4-D (56 mg/L rainbow trout, 84 mg/L bull trout), and clopyralid (477 mg/L rainbow trout; 552 mg/L bull trout). Collectively, the results indicated that the standard surrogate rainbow trout is similar in sensitivity to bull trout. Accelerated life testing procedures provided cost-effective, statistically defensible methods for estimating safe chronic concentrations (30-d CLC1s) of herbicides from acute toxicity data because they use statistical models based on the entire mortality: concentration: time data matrix.

AB  - Context: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a ubiquitous membrane detoxification pump involved in cellular defence against xenobiotics. Blood is a hub for the trade and transport of physiological molecules and xenobiotics. Our recent studies have highlighted the expression of a 140-kDa P-gp in brown trout erythrocytes in primary cell culture and its dose-dependent response to Benzo[a]pyrene pollutant.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was focused on using P-gp expression in brown trout erythrocytes as a biomarker for detecting the degree of river pollution.
   Methods: abcb1 gene and P-gp expression level were analysed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blot, in the erythrocytes of brown trouts. The latter were collected in upstream and downstream of four rivers in which 17 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 348 varieties of pesticides micro-residues were analysed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.
   Results: The abcb1 gene and the 140-kDa P-gp were not expressed in trout erythrocytes from uncontaminated river. In contrast, they are clearly expressed in contaminated rivers, in correlation with the river pollution degree and the nature of the pollutants.
   Conclusions: This biological tool may offer considerable advantages since it provides an effective response to the increasing need for an early biomarker.

TI  - Reinterpretation of the lower Cambrian brachiopod <i>Heliomedusa orienta</i> Sun and Hou, 1987a as a discinid
T2  - JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The Lower Cambrian brachiopod Heliomedusa orienta Sun and Hou, 1987a, first identified as a jellyfish, was later described as a craniopsoid brachiopod. A new sample of 1,150 individuals of this brachiopod, measuring 3.1-22.0 mm long, from two new sites of the Lower Cambrian Yuanshan Formation was examined. The sample includes several with exceptional preservation of nonmineralized skeletons that reveal previously unknown features and fill a gap in our knowledge of the detailed anatomy of fossil discinids. It is here reinterpreted as a discinid brachiopod on the basis of its many distinctive, discinid anatomical features, such as a longitudinally oval pedicle foramen in the anterior region of the posterior sector of the ventral valve; inferred, short, but large pedicle descending ventrally from the ventral valve; inferred, paired rectus muscles in the large pedicle canal; elongate scars of paired anterior adductors; and a median septum connected to a U-shaped ridge on the ventral interior. The two growing zones of its exceptionally preserved, unique lophophore extend posteriorly instead of anteriorly as in all Recent inarticulate brachiopods. Its recognition as the first and earliest discinoidean extends its stratigraphic range from the Ordovician to the Lower Cambrian. This reassignment implies that the organophosphatic, pediculate lingulids and discinids evolved before the carbonate, nonpediculate craniopsids and cramids. Its occurrence at chronological proximity to the Cambrian explosion of small metazoans sheds light on the early morphological diversification and the adaptive radiation of the Lower Cambrian brachiopods into the available niches.

AB  - Spinosyn, a potent insecticide, is a novel tetracyclic polyketide decorated with D-forosamine and tri-O-methyl-L-rhamnose. Spinosyn rhamnosyltransferase (SpnG) is a key biocatalyst with unique sequence identity and controls the biosynthetic maturation of spinosyn. The rhamnose is critical for the spinosyn insecticidal activity and cell wall biosynthesis of the spinosyn producer, Saccharopolyspora spinosa. In this study, we have functionally expressed and characterized SpnG and the three enzymes, Gdh, Epi, and Kre, responsible for dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis in S. spinosa by purified enzymes from Escherichia coli. Most notably, the substrate specificity of SpnG was thoroughly characterized by kinetic and inhibition experiments using various NDP sugar analogs made by an in situ combination of NDP-sugar-modifying enzymes. SpnG was found to exhibit striking substrate promiscuity, yielding corresponding glycosylated variants. Moreover, the critical residues presumably involved in catalytic mechanism of Gdh and SpnG were functionally evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis. The information gained from this study has provided important insight into molecular recognition and mechanism of the enzymes, especially SpnG. The results have made possible the structure-activity characterization of SpnG, as well as the use of SpnG or its engineered form to serve as a combinatorial tool to make spinosyn analogs with altered biological activities and potency.

AB  - Salmonella encounters but survives host inflammatory response. To defend host-generated oxidants, Salmonella encodes primary antioxidants and protein repair enzymes. Methionine (Met) residues are highly prone to oxidation and convert into methionine sulfoxide (Met-SO) which compromises protein functions and subsequently cellular survival. However, by reducing Met-SO to Met, methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) enhance cellular survival under stress conditions. Salmonella encodes five Msrs which are specific for particular Met-SO (free/protein bound), and 'R'/'S' types. Earlier studies assessed the effect of deletions of one or two msrs on the stress physiology of S. Typhimurium. We generated a pan msr gene deletion (Delta 5msr) strain in S. Typhimurium. The Delta 5msr mutant strain shows an initial lag in in vitro growth. However, the Delta 5msr mutant strain depicts very high sensitivity (p < 0.0001) to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), chloramine T (ChT) and superoxide-generating oxidant paraquat. Further, the Delta 5msr mutant strain shows high levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls, and protein aggregation. On the other side, the Delta 5msr mutant strain exhibits lower levels of free amines. Further, the Delta 5msr mutant strain is highly susceptible to neutrophils and shows defective fitness in the spleen and liver of mice. The results of the current study suggest that the deletions of all msrs render S. Typhimurium highly prone to oxidative stress and attenuate its virulence.

AB  - Children's exposures to chemical and non-chemical stressors from their everyday environment affects their overall health and well-being. American-Indian/Alaska-Native (AI/AN) children may have a disproportionate burden of stressors from their built and natural environments when compared to children from other races/ethnicities. Our objectives were to identify chemical and non-chemical stressors from AI/AN children's built and natural environments and evaluate their linkages with health and wellbeing outcomes from the peer reviewed literature. Library databases (e.g. PubMed) were searched to identify studies focused on these stressors. References were excluded if they: did not discuss AI/AN children or they were not the primary cohort; discussed tribes outside the United States (U.S.); were reviews or intervention studies; or did not discuss stressors from the built/natural environments. Out of 2539 references, 35 remained. Sample populations were predominantly (70%) in New York (NY) and Alaska (AK); 14 studies reported on the same cohort. Studies with matching stressors and outcomes were few, ruling out a quantitative review. Respiratory and developmental outcomes were the main outcomes evaluated. Primary nonchemical stressors were residential proximity to polluted landscapes, lack of indoor plumbing, and indoor use of wood for heating or cooking. The main chemical stressors were volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM 2.5), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p, p'-DDE, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), lead, and mercury. Our qualitative review was suggestive of a potential increase in respiratory illness from indoor wood use or no plumbing, which can be used as a guide to promote healthy environments for AI/AN children. We identified limited studies (< 40), demonstrating this population as understudied. Future studies need to consider: sample populations from other tribes in the U.S., stressors outside the household, other elements of the natural environment, and an evaluation of stressors from AI/AN children's total environment (built, natural, and social).

AB  - :researchers have developed numerous per- andpolyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-free aqueousfilm-forming foam(AFFF) formulations to replace PFAS-containing AFFF used forfire suppression. As part of the Department of Defense's StrategicEnvironmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), weexamined the direct lethal effects of seven PFAS-free AFFF and aPFAS-containing AFFF on 14 aquatic species using a series oflethal concentration (LC50) tests. We assessed the LC10, LC50,and LC90 values using log-logistic and logit analyses. Across allaquatic species tested, we discovered that exposure to at least onePFAS-free AFFF was more or as toxic as exposure to the PFAS-containing AFFF. For most cases, National Foam Avio F3 GreenKHC 3% and Buckeye Platinum Plus C6MILSPEC 3% were themost and least toxic formulations, respectively. Moreover, we found consistency among results from multiple experiments using thesame minnow species (Pimephales promelas) and among closely related taxa (e.g., daphnids, amphibians). Lastly, the LC50 values forAFFF formulations trended lower for tested marine species as compared to those of freshwater species. These results dramaticallyincrease the current knowledge on the potentially toxic effects of AFFF but also highlight the need for additional research and thedevelopment of new PFAS-free AFFF that are more"ecologically friendly"than those containing persistent PFAS.

AB  - Alachlor is a widely used pre-emergent chloroacetanilide herbicide which has been shown to have many harmful ecological and environmental effects. However, the mechanism of alachlor-induced oxidative stress is poorly understood. We found that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide anions were increased only after long-term exposure to alachlor, suggesting that alachlor is not a pro-oxidant. It is likely that alachlor-induced oxidative stress may result from protein denaturation because alachlor rapidly induced an increased protein aggregation, leading to upregulation of SSA4 and HSP82 genes encoding heat shock proteins (Hsp) of Hsp70 and Hsp90 family, respectively. Although only SOD1 encoding Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), but not SOD2 encoding Mn-SOD, is essential for alachlor tolerance, both SODs play a crucial role in reducing alachlor-induced ROS. We found that, after alachlor exposure, glutathione production was inhibited while its utilization was increased, suggesting the role of glutathione in protecting cells against alachlor, which becomes more important when lacking Cu/Zn-SOD. Based on our results, it seems that alachlor primarily causes damages to cellular macromolecules such as proteins, leading to an induction of endogenous oxidative stress, of which intracellular antioxidant defense systems are required for elimination.

AB  - All 209 congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in edible fish tissue from the central Red Sea coast (Jeddah region) of Saudi Arabia were analyzed by isotope dilution high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The upper-bound total PCB (Sigma PCB) levels in nine commonly consumed fish species from three areas were 0.2-82.5 ng/g wet weight (17-8450 ng/g lipid weight), which were at the lower end of reported global range and far below international tolerance limits (500-3000 ng/g ww). Dioxin-like congeners contributed up to 12.8% (mean 6.5%) to SPCB in tissue samples, with the total PCB toxic equivalencies (TEQs) at a tolerable range (0.05-2.6 pg TEQ/g ww or 2-238 pg TEQ/g lw) for all species. PCB profiles were dominated by moderately chlorinated homologs, mainly hexachlorobiphenyls, but less chlorinated congeners were also consistently elevated, notably in Siganus rivulatus (Area III) and Mugil cephalus (Area I). It remains to be ascertained if the latter were breakdown products or due to fresh inputs. The top congeners based on dominance by both occurrence and abundance were identified as potential markers of SPCB in fish tissue, which can be used for future selective biomonitoring in case of reasonable constraints on full congener approach.

AB  - Although many types of halogenated compounds are known to bioaccumulate in humans, few are routinely biomonitored and many have remained uncharacterized in human exposome studies due to a lack of high sensitivity and high-resolution analytical methods. In this study, we discovered tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (Ph4PCl, 10 mu M) as a simple additive to the mobile phase, which enhanced the ionizations of polyhalogenated alkyl compounds (such as organochlorinated pesticides [OCPs], chlorinated paraffins [CPs], dechlorane plus [DPs], and some brominated flame retardants [BFRs]) in the form [M + Cl]- and boosted mass spectrometry responses by an average of 1-3 orders of magnitude at a resolution of 140,000. Ph4PCl-enhanced ionization coupled with a halogenation-guided screening process was used to establish a sensitive and non-targeted method that required only single-step sample preparation and identified Cl-and/or bromine-containing alkyl compounds. The method enabled the identification of similar to 700 polyhalogenated compounds from 200 mu L of human serum, 240 of which were known compounds: 33 short-chain CPs, 52 median-chain CPs, 97 long-chain CPs, 22 very short-chain CPs (vSCCPs), 19 OCPs, 13 DPs, and 4 BFRs. We also identified 325 emerging contaminants (34 unsaturated CPs, 285 chlorinated fatty acid methyl esters [CFAMEs], and 6 chloro-bromo alkenes) and 130 new contaminants (114 oxygen-containing CPs, 2 hexachlorocyclohexane structural analogs, and 11 amino-containing and 3 nitrate-containing chlorinated compounds). The full scan results highlighted the dominance of CPs, CFAMEs, vSCCPs, and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes in the serum samples. Ph4PCl-enhanced ionization enabled the sensitive and non-targeted identifications of polyhalogenated compounds in small volumes of biological fluid.

AB  - Public and political concerns about Pfiesteria from 1997 to the present vastly exceed the attention given to other harmful algal bloom (HAB) issues in the United States. To some extent, the intense focus on Pfiesteria has served to increase attention on HABs in general. Given the strong and continuing public, political, and research interests in Pfiesteria piscicida Steidinger & Burkholder and related organisms, there is a clear need for information and resources of many different types. This article provides information on Pfiesteria-related educational products and information resources available to the general public, health officials, and researchers. These resources are compiled into five categories: reports; website resources; state outreach and communication programs; fact sheets; and training manuals and documentaries. Over the last few years there has been rapid expansion in the amount of Pflesteria-related information available, particularly on the Internet, and it is scattered among many different sources.

AB  - Southern Hemisphere Megaptera novaeangliae undertake the longest migration, which reflect their exposure to lipophilic contaminants. To assess these changes, persistent organic pollutants were analyzed in blubber samples of humpback whales from three regions: the Antarctic Peninsula (n = 46), the Strait of Magellan, Chile (n = 22), and the Brazilian coast (n = 38). The similarity in PCB and HCB levels between individuals from feeding grounds and breeding grounds suggests contamination during feeding. The whales around the Antarctic Peninsula exhibited a predominance of tetrachlorobiphenyl PCBs. Whales feeding in the Strait of Magellan showed a slight prevalence of 5Cl biphenyls, likely due to their consumption of subantarctic krill species as well as small fishes potentially contaminated by industrial activities in Chile. The dominance of 5-6Cl congeners in whales in Brazil, may be attributed to the extreme physiological changes during fasting when whales utilize blubber reserves and metabolize lighter congeners, or transfer them to their calves.

AB  - Infectious diseases are one of the main causes of social and economical losses in world aquaculture. Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) is an important species for aquaculture in southern Europe, whose production is affected by the appearance of bacterial diseases such as photobacteriosis, a septicemia caused by Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp). The aim of this study was to obtain an oral DNA nanovaccine and to evaluate its efficacy against Phdp in S. senegalensis juveniles. For this purpose, the amplified product corresponding to the protein inosine-5 '-monophophate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) from Phdp, was cloned into the expression vector pcDNATM6.2/C-EmGFP-GW obtaining the DNA vaccine named as pPDPimpdh. The correct transcription and protein expression was verified at 48 h post tansfection in HEK293 cells. Chitosan nanoparticles (CS-TPP NPs) were prepared by ionotropic gelation and their features were appropriate for use as oral delivery system. Therefore, pPDPimpdh was protected with chitosan CS-TPP NPs throughout complex coacervation method giving as a result a DNA nanovaccine referred as CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs. Sole juveniles were vaccinated orally with CS-TPP NPs, pPDPimpdh and CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs followed by a challenge with Phdp at 30 days post vaccination (dpv). The relative percentage survival (RPS) for pPDPimpdh vaccinated groups was 6.25%, probably due to its degradation in the digestive tract. RPS value obtained for CS-TPP NPs and CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs was 40% and antibodies were observed in both cases. However, a delay in mortality was observed in sole juveniles vaccinated orally with CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs. In fact, an upregulation of tf, mhcII, cd8a and igm in the posterior gut and c3, hamp1, tf and cd4 in spleen was observed in juveniles vaccinated with CSTPP+pPDPimpdh NPs. After challenge, a modulation of cd8a and cd4 expression levels in the posterior gut and c3, tf, lyg, cd4, igm and igt expression levels in spleen was observed. Moreover, the concentration of lysozyme in skin mucus significantly increased in fish vaccinated orally with CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs at 11 dpc. These data indicate that oral vaccination with CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs could be acting through the non-specific immune responses as well as the specific humoral and cell mediated immunity and provide the first step toward a development of an oral DNA nanovaccine against Phdp in sole.

TI  - Characterizing potential environmental impacts to an endangered species habitat in karst waters
T2  - SINKHOLES AND THE ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF KARST
LA  - English
CP  - 9th Multidisciplinary Conference on Sinkholes and the Engineering and Environmental Impacts of Karst
AB  - The September 1988 recognition of the Alabama cave shrimp (Palaeomonias alabamae Smalley, 1961) as a federally listed endangered species prompted the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to fund extensive geologic and hydrologic investigations to characterize the species' habitat and develop a species' recovery plan. Initial tracer-dye, water-quality, potentiometric surface, and biologic data collection centered around Shelta Cave, the historic type locality in northwest Huntsville (now considered an extirpated population), and in caves, sinks, springs, and wells within the presumed recharge area for Bobcat Cave, the only known population location since 1975. Based on historical and collected data on the hydrologic characteristics of the present and extirpated population habitats, USFWS expanded the study area to include other aquifer systems and karst areas in north Alabama. Additional cave shrimp populations were discovered in three hydrologically connected caves in southeast Madison County. Geologic and hydrologic regimes differ between the three areas of known populations. Water quality and the presence of karstic "windows" to lower aquifer levels appear to be key to species survival and continued sustainability. The presence of residual pesticides, particularly termite treatment chemicals, in soils and ground water in and surrounding Shelta Cave indicate that water quality may be the primary factor in the extirpation of the Alabama cave shrimp and the severe reduction of other aquatic species in this ground-water system. Continued hydrologic and biologic monitoring of Bobcat Cave shows the presence of single, brief pollution events, but little indication of increasing water-quality degradation. The isolated location on Redstone Arsenal (RSA) and the restricted, anomalous, north-trending recharge area of Bobcat Cave may offer additional protection from environmental impacts. The continued sustainability of cave shrimp populations in the dynamic karst system in southeast Madison County is more at risk from environmental impacts, such as water-quality degradation, loss of habitat, and potential decrease in seasonal flows, due to rapid residential development and increased agro-economic activities (timber harvesting) in this area. Additional tracer-dye studies and modeling of the karst hydrology may be needed to make educated decisions about the future coexistence of increasing development and the present cave shrimp habitats in this area.

AB  - Fungal metabolites are considered to be most efficient tools to overcome the issues related to insecticide resistance and environmental pollution. The present study focus on the evaluation of the mosquito larvicidal efficacy of metabolites of seven indigenous fungal isolates (Penicillium sp. Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. parasiticus, Rhizopus sp. Mucor sp. and Aspergillus sp.) on the larvae of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus under the laboratory condition. The preliminary screening of the isolate, Penicillium sp. showed better larvicidal effect when compared to other fungi. The fungus was grown on Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) in the laboratory (at 25 degrees C) and maintained in the relative humidity (at 76 +/- 4% for 15 days). Larvicidal potency of mycelial ethyl acetate extract (MEAE) of Penicillium sp. was performed against 1st to 4th instars larvae of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus using four different concentrations (100, 200, 300, and 500 mu g/ml) that showed better larval mortality values (mu g/ml) of LC50 = 6.554, 5.487, 6.874, 6.892, and the LC90 = 11.486, 10.366, 12.879, 13.865 for Ae. aegypti and LC50 = 7.000, 13.943, 18.129, 25.212 and the LC90 = 12.541, 23.761, 30.923, 41.696 for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Exposure of metabolite to larvae resulted in behavior changes i. e., excitation, up and down with aggressive movement, anal papillae biting behavior. Further, the larvae treated with Penicillium sp. metabolite exhibited significant reduction in the levels of acetylcholinesterase. The 4th instar mosquito larvae treated with the 500 mu g/ml mycelia extract showed severe histological damages. During the antibacterial analysis of Penicillium sp.-mycelium the maximum growth inhibition zone was recorded in Shigella dysenteriae (31.2 mm) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (31.1 mm) followed by others. In addition, to check the toxicity of Penicillium sp. MEAE against embryos of Zebrafish, a model system, using different concentrations of metabolites (1.0, 0.5, 0.125 mg/ml, 30, 3.0, and 0.5 mu g/ml) and life-stage parameters were observed at 124 hpf. Furthermore, the Fourier Transformed Infrared and GCMS spectrum analysis of mycelium reflected several chemical compounds. The outcome of the study clearly shows that Penicillium sp. metabolites could serve as an ideal eco-friendly, single-step and inexpensive source for the control of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae.

AB  - The degradation of two pesticides, carbofuran (CBF) and ioprodine (IPR), was studied by the photolytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2). The influence of two experimental parameters, H2O2 concentration and initial pH, as well as their interactions, was investigated. Optimization was carried out where experimental parameters were determined for the treatment of each pesticide. Both pesticides were totally eliminated by UV/H2O2 system under optimal conditions. However, significant differences were found: CBF degradation was influenced by both parameters and their interactions, while IPR degradation was not statistically affected by initial pH. Interestingly, analysis of degradation pathways showed a major influence of photolysis process and oxidation due to hydrogen peroxide for the CBF degradation, while the synergistic combination between both of them played the most relevant role during IPR degradation. A mixture of both pesticides was also submitted to UV/H2O2 action in which a lower rate was observed for IPR elimination while CBF was not affected. A 90 % of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed and 75 % of mineralization was achieved after the treatment of the mixture. Almost 92 % of the toxicity was eliminated making this technique a promising process to treat toxic mixtures of these pesticides.

AB  - Fishing with the aid of plant toxins was formerly very common in tropical Africa. Today this easy method of fishing is still practised in remote areas. The method is simple: the poisonous ingredients are pounded and thrown into a pool or dammed-up sections of a small river. After a short time the fish begin to rise to the surface and can then readily be taken by hand. The fish can be eaten without health problems. The main active compounds are saponins, rotenoids and diterpene esters. Such biologically active plants are of great interest to scientists of various disciplines. Some of these plants provide important insecticides, many play an important part in traditional medicine and in preparation or arrow poisons.
   258 fish-poisoning plants are presented, based on 25 years of field research by the author in tropical Africa and evaluations of herbarium notes. 10-20 per cent of the fishing poisons are probably still unknown. They are spread among 167 plant genera and 60 families. The evaluation shows a clear dominance of the Leguminosae (Caesalpiniaceae, Mimosaceae, Papilionaceae) in the hierarchy of the fish poisoning plants. It is also remarkable that a great proportion are in the Euphorbiaceae.

AB  - This work presents the development, testing, and application in high-gradient magnetic fishing of superparamagnetic supports for adsorption of lectins. Various approaches were examined to produce affinity, mixed mode, and hydrophobic charge induction type adsorbents. In clean monocomponent systems affinity supports created by direct attachment of glucose or maltose to amine-terminated iron oxide particles could bind concanavalin A at levels of up to approximate to 280 mg g(-1) support with high affinity (approximate to 1 muM dissociation constants). However, the best performance was delivered by adsorbents featuring coupled tentacular dextran chains displaying a maximum binding capacity of 238 mg g(-1) and a dissociation constant of 0.13 muM. Adsorbents derivatized with mixed mode or hydrophobic charge induction ligands likewise demonstrated very high capacities for both concanavalin A and Lens culinaris agglutinin (greater than or equal to 250 mg g(-1)) with dissociation constants in the micromolar range, though neither of these systems showed any selectivity for lectins in leguminous extracts.
   When the affinity supports were applied to carbohydrate containing legume extracts only the dextran-linked adsorbents supplied sufficient competition to dissolved sugars to selectively bind concanavalin A in an extract of jack beans. The dextran-linked supports were employed in a high-gradient magnetic fishing experiment, in which concanavalin A was purified to near homogeneity from a crude, unclarified extract of jack beans.

AB  - Cystathionine lyase, the key enzyme in transsulfuration and reverse transsulfuration pathways, is involved in a wide array of physiological and pathophysiological processes in both mammals and nonmammals. Though the biological significance of the hydrogen sulfide/cystathionine lyase system in disease states is extensively discussed, the absence of molecular methods for direct monitoring of cystathionine lyase in complex biosamples renders the result unreliable and perplexing. Here, we present the first attempt at designing and developing effective activatable fluorescent probes for cystathionine lyase based on the naphthylamide scaffold. CBLP and CSEP were designed based on the catalytic preference of cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). Briefly, incorporation of cysteine/homocysteine as the recognition moiety and a carbamate ethyl sulfide group as a self-immolated linker proved to be an effective strategy for cystathionine lyase fluorescence reporting. CBLP exhibits high selectivity and sensitivity in vitro in semiquantifying CBL levels in roots of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and cbl mutants (cbl knockout: SALK_014740C, overexpressed: OE-CBL). Meanwhile, CSEP successfully detected CSE levels in HCC-LM3 cells, zebrafish models, and upregulated CSE in frozen section slides from the liver tissue of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced septic rats, which was also validated by Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis. In summary, the practical design strategy facilitates profiling of cystathionine lyase activity in biological processes. It may pave the way for the development of accurate and efficient methods for the direct estimation of cystathionine lyase.

AB  - Following the passage of the Food Quality Protection Act, which mandated an increased focus on evaluating the potential toxicity of pesticides to children, the number of guideline developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) studies (OPPTS 870.6300) submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) was greatly increased. To evaluate the impact of available DNT studies on individual chemical risk assessments, the ways in which data from these studies are being used in pesticide risk assessment were investigated. In addition, the neurobehavioral and neuropathological parameters affected at the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for each study were evaluated to ascertain whether some types of endpoints were consistently more sensitive than others. As of December 2008, final OPP reviews of DNT studies for 72 pesticide chemicals were available; elimination of studies with major deficiencies resulted in a total of 69 that were included in this analysis. Of those studies, 15 had been used to determine the point of departure for one or more risk assessment scenarios, and an additional 13 were determined to have the potential for use as a point of departure for future risk assessments (selection is dependent upon review of the entire database available at the time of reassessment). Analysis of parameters affected at the study LOAELs indicated that no single parameter was consistently more sensitive than another. Early assessment time points (e.g., postnatal day (PND) 11/21) tended to be more sensitive than later time points (e.g., PND 60). These results demonstrate that data generated using the current guideline DNT study protocol are useful in providing points of departure for risk assessments. The results of these studies also affirm the importance of evaluating a spectrum of behavioral and neuropathological endpoints, in both young and adult animals, to improve the detection of the potential for a chemical to cause developmental neurotoxicity.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of four autochthonous bacteria isolated from juvenile sole (Solea senegalensis) intestine as dietary probiotic supplement against bacterial pathogen infection and handling/transport stressors. Growth performance and immune responses were evaluated after 85 days of feeding trial. Sole (IBW = 16.07 +/- 0.11 g) were fed six experimental diets, a control diet (CTRL, without the dietary probiotic supplementation), and five diets supplemented with probiotic bacteria: PB1 (Shewanella hafniensis), PB2 (Enterococcus raffinosus), PB3 (Shewanella hafniensis + Arthrobacter soli), PB4 (Pseudomonas protegens + Arthrobacter soli) and PB5 (Shewanella hafniensis + Arthrobacter soli + Enterococcus raffinosus). All bacteria were selected based on their in vitro antimicrobial activity. After the growth trial, fish were submitted to a stress factor (transport) and then each dietary group was divided in two additional groups: non-infected (placebo) and infected with Photobacteriutn damselae subsp. piscicida. Immune and antioxidant responses were evaluated at day 10 post-infection. In infection trial A, fish were infected on the same day of transport, whereas in trial B fish were infected after a 7-day recovery from the transport stress. At the end of the feeding trial, fish fed with PB2 and PB4 showed lower final body weight when compared with the other dietary groups. Respiratory burst activity and nitric oxide production were not affected by probiotic supplementation. Fish fed with PB5 presented lower peroxidase activity compared to CTRL. Lysozyme and alternative complement pathway activity (ACH50) showed no significant differences between treatments. The innate immune responses were significantly affected after handling stress and bacterial infection. In trial A, the ACH50 levels of infected fish were significantly lower than the placebo groups. On the other hand, in trial B fish infected with Pdp demonstrated higher ACH50 levels when compared to placebos. Peroxidase levels were strongly modulated by bacterial infection and handling stress. In trials A and B, infection had a clear downgrade effect in peroxidase levels. Lipid peroxidation, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase were altered by both bacterial infection and transport.
   Overall, dietary probiotic supplementation did not influence growth performance of sole. The immune and oxidative defenses of sole responded differently to infection depending on the probiotic and the synergy between pathogen infection and transport.

AB  - The effects of the triazine herbicide prometryne, commonly present in surface and ground waters, on oxidative stress and antioxidant status of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were investigated. Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of prometryne (0.51, 8, and 80 mu g/l) for 14, 30, and 60 days. Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR), as well as levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) were assessed in brain, gill, intestine, liver, and muscle. After 14 days exposure, decreased GR activity in brain was observed for all prometryne-exposed groups compared with the controls. Changes were observed in SOD activity in brain and gill after 30 days in all exposure groups. Changes in CAT activity were observed only at the highest concentration (80 mu g/l) in liver and intestine after 60 days. The observed effects on carp antioxidant systems may be a defense against oxidative damage. The study demonstrated changes in antioxidant parameters and the importance of evaluating the potential long-term risk to fish of prometryne, at environmentally realistic concentrations (0.51 mu g/l). The results suggest that antioxidant responses may have potential as biomarkers for monitoring residual triazine herbicides in aquatic environments.

AB  - (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene3 is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20004, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20025. This Regulation required the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 16 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 10 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force, which originally consisted of Dow AgroScience B. V. and BASF Agro B. V. BASF sold the business of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene to Kanesho Soil Treatment BVBA on 17 December 2003 and therefore was replaced in the Task Force. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 8 November 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.
   A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 February 2006 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 12 May 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 72).
   Following the Commission Decision of 20 September 2007 (2007/619/EC) 6 concerning the noninclusion of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicants, Dow AgroScience B. V. and Kanesho Soil Treatment BVBA made a resubmission application for the inclusion of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene in Annex I, in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20087. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report (European Commission, 2007) as follows:.
   A finalised assessment of consumer exposure.
   The environmental fate and ecotoxicology of the substance.
   Lack of data on the persistency, toxicological behaviour, uptake from crops, accumulation, metabolic fate and residue level of certain polychlorinated impurities
   and concerns were identified with regard to:.
   The potential contamination of groundwater.
   The consumer exposure.
   The risk to birds, mammals and aquatic organisms.
   Its possible impact on non-target organisms
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Spain, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene in the format of an Additional Report (Spain, 2009a). The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 15 April 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 20 April 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 25 May 2009. At the same time the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 2 July 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days.
   The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS' evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific telephone conferences with Member State experts in September 2009.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in all areas.
   The original conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a nematicide as proposed by the applicants. The application to bare soil comprises either introduction of the formulated product into the drip irrigation system (" EF-1478") or soil injection at 15-20 cm depth (" XRM-5048") to control nematodes in soil where tomatoes or peppers will be grown. The application rates are up to 283 kg (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene per hectare (" EF-1478") and up to 224 kg per hectare (" XRM-5048"), respectively. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene can be used as nematicide, insecticide, fungicide and herbicide, depending on the dose rate used. In general, an application of (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene by soil injection and/or drip irrigation is followed by partial sterilisation of the soil. It should be noted that the applicants stated that only the use as a nematicide would be supported in the EU review programme. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative use as a nematicide.
   The representative formulated products for the evaluation under the resubmission were the same as for the original submission, ` Telone EC Drip (EF-1478)', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Southern European countries, and ` Telone Injected (XRM-5048)' a liquid formulation (AL), registered under different trade names in the EU.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible.
   (EZ)-1,3-dichloropopene is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised in the rat. The acute oral and dermal toxicity is high and the inhalatory toxicity is moderate, proposed classification and risk phrases are T; R24/25 " Toxic in contact with and if swallowed" and R20 " Harmful by inhalation". It is a skin irritant and sensitizer, proposed classification and risk phrases are R38 " Irritant to skin" and R43 " May cause sensitization by skin contact". According to medical data 1,3-dichloropopene should also be classified as irritant to eyes and to the respiratory system, proposed classification and risk phrases are R36/R37 " Irritating to eyes and respiratory system" and R65 " May cause lung damage if swallowed". The Technical Committee for Classification and Labelling in 2005 agreed not to classify 1,3-D as mutagenic or carcinogenic, unless epichlorhydrin (a known carcinogen) had been used as a stabiliser. The applicants confirmed that the current product is not stabilised with epichlorhydrin. No reproduction toxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. The metabolites (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol8 and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid9 are both toxic. Dependent on the identity on the polychlorinated impurities, it might be necessary to require new toxicological studies. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.025 mg/kg bw/day, with the use of the safety factor of 100. The systemic Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100. As inhalation exposure is the main route of exposure and all data from operator exposure are expressed as atmospheric concentration (mg/m3), an additional inhalatory human AOEC was assigned which is 0.45 mg/m3. The ARfD is 0.2 mg/kg bw, with the safety factor of 100 added. The operator and worker exposure during drip irrigation activities is below the AOEL with the use of PPE and RPE; the estimated exposure levels for a bystander at > 7 m from the site of application are below the AOEC, however at closer distances estimated exposure levels exceed the AOEC. During soil injection activities the operator, worker and bystander exposure estimates show levels below the AOEC (operator and worker wearing PPE and RPE).
   The degradation and metabolism of 1,3-D has been studied comparatively in fruit (tomatoes and citrus), root vegetables (sugar beet), pulses and oilseeds (soybeans) following application of radiolabelled material to the soil surrounding the tree, or to the soil in which seeds were planted. Additional information from succeeding crop studies is given on leafy crops (lettuce) and cereals (wheat).
   Even though a high amount of applied 1,3-D is expected to volatilise from soil, the results of the available studies indicate that 1,3-D is also absorbed into plants, translocated and degraded. Naturally occurring plant constituents contained the majority of radioactivity recovered in edible plant parts, indicating complete metabolism of 1,3-D. Consequently, no 1,3-D residues above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are expected to be present in primary or succeeding crops. This was confirmed by supervised residue trials data.
   In the resubmission dossier of 2009 a number of additional residue trials were provided to allow some further clarification with regard to manufacturing process impurities that are applied to the soil in high amounts when 1,3-D is used at the notified application rate.
   1,3-D and six impurities (1, 2, 3, 5b, 5c and 8a) were analysed. 1,3-D and its six studied impurities did not leave detectable residues in the crop.
   However, even though potential chronic and acute dietary exposure to residues of 1,3-D per se from tomatoes and peppers is well below the ADI (< 10%) and ARfD (< 2%), respectively the consumer risk assessment cannot be considered as finalised in relation to 11 manufacturing process impurities. The consumer risk assessment is pending a conclusion on the fate and behaviour of these 11 identified impurities in the environment, and/or with regard to toxicological data on manufacturing process impurities in the updated specification in the section on mammalian toxicology.
   (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene is a volatile liquid, so even though it is injected below the soil surface or applied via drip irrigation systems, the major route of dissipation from soil is volatilisation to the air. In aerobic laboratory soil studies it exhibited low to moderate persistence and formed the major (> 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid which exhibited very low to moderate persistence and the minor (< 10% AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited very low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 11-37% AR at 49-77 days. At these times unextracted soil residue accounted for 9-28% AR.
   In laboratory soil batch adsorption studies (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene exhibited very high to high mobility. (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid exhibited very high soil mobility.
   In a laboratory study on a natural sediment water system (25 degrees C) with dosing under the water surface, volatilisation was again the major route of dissipation of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene from the systems. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene exhibited low persistence and formed the minor (< 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation products (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid and (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 57% AR at 21 days. At this time unextracted sediment residues accounted for 14% AR. Acceptable surface aquatic system PEC are only available.
   FOCUS groundwater 'tier I' modelling indicates that at the spatial scale usually assessed of the treated field, there is a very high potential for the contamination of groundwater by parent (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid. The results from an extensive targeted EU groundwater monitoring program are available. With the exception of the monitored areas in France, where critical details regarding the program are missing, this program indicates for the historical intensity of use of 1,3-D in the monitored areas, at the points of drinking water abstraction that were sampled, groundwater contamination by parent (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene > 0.1 mu g/L had not occurred. Contamination above this level by (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid had occurred but rarely (2 samples from different wells out of the 50 taken in the Spanish region of Caceres where the concentrations were 0.116 and 0.413 mu g/L). In all other monitored wells (92) (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid was < 0.1 mu g/L. It has been concluded that there is information missing that is needed to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment in relation to 11 manufacturing process impurities.
   (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene volatilises from soil even though it is applied below the soil surface. The flux losses from the soil have been measured in field studies in the USA that have been assessed as being representative for EU conditions. Member State experts' and the EFSA considered sufficient information has been provided to conclude that the (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene that will reach the upper atmosphere will degrade relatively rapidly and that this compound and its potential atmospheric degradation products are unlikely to have an adverse effect on the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, as they will be relatively short lived in this environmental compartment. For 10 manufacturing process impurities, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) calculations, on the rate of photo-oxidative reactions with hydroxyl radicals in the upper atmosphere, indicate that these impurities could be subject to long range transport through the atmosphere.
   Studies to address the data gaps identified in the EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 72 were provided for the resubmission. Confirmatory data on the compliance of the ecotoxicological test batches to the new specifications are still missing. The indoor use in glasshouse is defined as a permanent structure to which entry of birds and mammals is limited and hence the risk to birds and mammals for the indoor uses is regarded to be low. A high acute risk to earthworm-eating and insectivorous birds and mammals and a long-term risk to earthworm-eating and insectivorous mammals was identified for the outdoor uses. The risk was addressed in a refined risk assessment for herbivorous, insectivorous and earthworm-eating birds and mammals, based on worst case concentrations from residue studies in plants, insects and earthworms. All TER values for acute, short-term and long-term risk meet Annex VI triggers, indicating a low risk to birds and mammals from the intended outdoor use.
   Available data indicated a similar level of aquatic toxicity for (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene and 3chloroallyl alcohol to fish and Daphnia which was higher that the toxicity of 3-chloroacrylic acid. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene was however less toxic to algae and Lemna than the two metabolites, which had a similar toxicity. Based on the acute endpoints both the active substance and the metabolites should be classified as very toxic to the aquatic environment. The EFSA Scientific Report (2006) concluded that the acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms from the indoor use via drip irrigation could be regarded as low without the need for risk mitigation measures. The risk associated with this use will therefore not be considered further. For the outdoor use the risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low based on CHAIN-2D CODE model exposure data including 3 m buffer zones for (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene, 3-chloroallyl alcohol and 3-chloroacrylic acid.
   Extended laboratory studies on Folsomia candida, Hypoaspis aculeifer, Poecilus cupreus, Pardosa spp. and Aleochara bilineata are available but have several deficiencies (exposure method, late introduction of test species and lack of positive control product). In addition a field study was considered to inadequate (poor test design). A new field study from North Italy assessing the effect of telone II on arthropods and earthworms indicated no significant effects on arthropods. Transient effects on earthworms were observed, lasting less than 6 months post-treatment. Several shortcomings in the field study were however identified (e. g. use of other pesticides, low collection rate of collembolan and earthworms). Member state experts agreed that the new field study should only be used to refine the risk assessment for the intended use (tomatoes and soil injection) and only in case the statistical power of the field study could be confirmed.
   A high acute risk to earthworms was observed. The risk may be addressed by the field study mentioned above. However, the statistical power of the study still needs to be confirmed. The applicant provided a supportive study on abundance and diversity of earthworms in South Europe. Field surveys in November and February indicated low number of earthworms in fields potential treated with soil fumigants.
   The risk to non-target soil micro-organisms was assessed as low based on higher tier field studies. Buffer zones of 3 m were required to address the risk to non-target plants. It could not be excluded that 1,3-D might be harmful if the waste water goes to sewage treatment plants. A concern was raised that washing water from cleaning tools should not be disposed into surface water due to effects on activated sludge.

AB  - Species- and tissue-specific defenses against the possibility of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation were compared in adult fish, Oreochromis niloticus and Cyprinus carpio, exposed to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), azinphosmethyl and their combination for 96 h. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase activities were monitored in kidney, brain and gill. In all exposure groups there was a marked increase in SOD activity in gill tissues in both fish species, while it was at the control level in other tissues. The highest elevation of SOD activity by combined treatment was observed in C carpio. Individual and combined treatments caused an elevation in catalase and GPx activities in kidney of C carpio. Catalase activity was unaffected in brain of O. niloticus, while GPx activity was decreased after all treatments. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was higher than the control levels in kidney of both fish exposed to pesticides. No significant changes were observed in malondialdehyde level in kidney and brain of C. carpio. Our results indicate that the toxicities of azinphosmethyl and 2,4-D may be related to oxidative stress. Also, the results show that SOD activity in gill and GST activity in kidney may be used as biomarkers for pollution monitoring and indicate that the activities of certain biomarkers in C. carpio are more sensitive to pesticides than those in O. niloticus.

AB  - Birds can be impacted by pollution but are seldom used as bioindicators. One exception involves the Dippers Cinclus spp., a genus of five passerines adapted uniquely to swim and dive in rivers on five continents to feed on aquatic invertebrates and small fishes. Here, we review the effectiveness of Dippers as pollution indicators while identifying further opportunities, caveats and uncertainties that are transferable to other indicator organisms.Dippers have been used as biodindicators i) through relationships linking their distribution, breeding per-formance and behaviour to river pollution through effects on prey quality and quantity; ii) where contaminants occur in their eggs, tissues, faeces or regurgitates, notably metals (Hg, Se), persistent pollutants (e.g. PCBs, PBDEs, DDE, HEOD) and microplastics. Most data are from C. cinclus in Europe and C. mexicanus in North America. While some pollution effects on Dipper distribution or fitness are well-evidenced, particularly acidification, the resulting impairments are not sufficient to diagnose the source of impact without additional data on water quality or prey abundance. Dippers in these cases provide a general rather than definitive indication of pollution.For contaminants, Dippers have revealed the distribution of specific pollutants at scales ranging from point-sources and regions to different continents. Influences of land use, trophic pathways, diet-shifts, contaminant transport, intergenerational transfer and trends through time have all been identified and supported by detailed knowledge of prey use, territoriality, dispersal, migration, life history, isotopic signatures and energetics.We suggest opportunities to expand the role of Dippers as bioindicators into other locations (Asia and South America), other influences on water quality (e.g. agriculture, wastewater), other contaminants (e.g. PFAs, pharmaceuticals) and through developments in modern biology such as 'omics. Initial data also show that Dippers could integrate the effects on rivers of habitat modification, flow modification and climate change by indicating effects both directly and through interactions with other multiple stressors. This group of birds il-lustrates how fundamental ecological information aids the development of bioindicators but reveals the importance of using complementary environmental data when diagnosing bioindicator response. We suggest these are important lessons for ecological indicators more generally.

AB  - The use of agrochemicals in agriculture is intense and most of them could be carried out to aquatic environment. Nevertheless, there are only few studies that assess the effects of these xenobiotics on amphibians. Clomazone is an herbicide widely used in rice fields, where amphibian species live. Thus, those species may be threatened by non-target exposure. However, nanoparticles are being developed to be used as a carrier system for the agrochemicals. Such nanoparticles release the herbicide in a modified way, and are considered to be more efficient and less harmful to the environment. The aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate the effect of clomazone in its free form and associated with nanoparticles, in the liver of bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) when submitted to acute exposure for 96 h. According to semi-quantitative analysis, there was an increase in the frequency of melanomacrophage centres, in the accumulation of eosinophils and in lipidosis in the liver of experimental groups exposed to clomazone in its free form and associated with nanoparticles in comparison with the control group, and the nanotoxicity of chitosan-alginate nanoparticles. The increase of melanomacrophage centres in all exposed groups was significant (P < 0.0001) in comparison to control group. Therefore, the results of this research have shown that exposure to sublethal doses of the herbicide and nanoparticles triggered hepatic responses. Moreover, these results provided important data about the effect of the clomazone herbicide and organic nanoparticles, which act as carriers of agrochemicals, on the bullfrog tadpole liver.

AB  - Sixteen priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) were analyzed in surface waters and riverine sediments of Brahmaputra and Hooghly Rivers, along urban-suburban-rural transects. Sigma(16) PAHs concentrations were higher in Hooghly riverine sediment (HRS) (Avg, 445 ng g(-1)) than Brahmaputra riverine sediment (BRS) (Avg, 169 ng g(-1)) dominated by 4-ring PAHs. In contrast, PAHs concentrations in surface water of Brahmaputra River (BRW) (Avg, 4.04 mu g L-1) were comparable with Hooghly River (HRW) (Avg, 4.8 mu g L-1), with dominance by 3-ring PAHs, Toxic PAHs (BaA, Chr, BbF, BkF, BaP, InP and DBA) were dominant in sub-urban transect of HRS (Avg, 387 ng g(-1)) and BRS (Avg, 14 ng g(-1)). Diagnostic ratios, principal component analysis (PCA) and ring wise composition suggested combustion as the main PAHs source in these riverine belts. In BRS, higher PAHs in suburban and rural transects were attributed to incomplete combustion of fossil fuel and biomass burning. In HRS, >85% of high molecular weight PAHs were found in the industrial areas of the suburban transect possibly associated with the discharge of industrial effluents. Harbor and port activities were other major contributors of HMW-PAHs in Hooghly riverine system. Carcinogenic potency estimated in terms of toxic equivalent (TEQ) was several folds higher in HRS (Avg, 106 ng TEQ g(-1)) compared with BRS (Avg, 2.5 ng TEQg(-1)). Mostly low molecular weight PAHs are likely posing a risk to fishes in both the rivers. Risk on edible fish species may be a matter of concern considering the regular consumption of fishes in this region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Persistent organic pollutants ( POPs) were recorded in sediment and fish samples collected from the western coast of Alexandria. Total hydrocarbons ( aliphatic + PAHs) in sediment ranged from 683.8 to 34670.1 ng g(-1) with an average of 9286.9 ng g(-1). The sum of C16-C34 of aliphatic fractions was < 4000 ng g(-)1, indicating the presence of a fresh petroleum source. For all sediments, the anthracene/phenanthrene ratio was > 0.1, suggesting the dominance of a pyrolytic source. Total aliphatics in different fish species ranged from 253 to 11 132 ng g(-1), while total PAHs ranged from 3862 to 35 746 ng g(-1) wet weight. Benzo[a] pyrene was the most dominant PAH fraction ranged from 1902.7 to 32 905.5 with an average of 9464.5 ng g(-1) wet weight in all fish species. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs) ranged from 0.79 to 64.9 ng g(-1) with an average 12.14 ng g(-1) wet weight. The concentrations of organochlorines in fish species ( Euthynnus alleferatus, Scomberomorus commerson, Sphyraena Sphyraena, Diplodus vulgaris, and Alepes djedaba) decreased following the order: PCBs > DDTs > HCHs > total cyclodienes. Concentrations of DDTs in fish tissues ranged from 4.89 to 36.37 ng g(-1) with an average of 16.4 ng g(-1) wet weight. The concentrations of total HCHs ranged from 0.3 to 65.7 ng g(-1) with an average of 16.35 ng g(-1). The present study indicates: ( 1) fresh petroleum input where Pr/Ph > 1; ( 2) PAHs in sediment < 4000 ng g(-1); ( 3) BaP concentration exceeded the permissible levels in Alepes djedaba species; ( 4) DDTs in sediment were below the effective range low level; ( 5) PCBs > effective range low and < effective range medium; and ( 6) pesticides and PCBs in all fishes were below the acceptable limit.

AB  - The flame retardant triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) has been widely detected in surface waters. Yet, little information is known regarding its impact onmicroalgae. We investigated the uptake and toxicity of TPhP on two freshwater microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (CV) and Scenedesmus obliquus (SO) after exposure to 10 mu g/l-10 mg/l for 5 days. The presence of microalgae significantly enhanced TPhP degradation, with the final concentrations dropped to 5.5-35.1% of the original concentrations. Most of the medium TPhP were sorbed and transformed by microalgae in just one day. Growth of CV was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas growth of SO were only inhibited significantly at 10 mg/l TPhP exposure. Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics revealed concentration- and species-dependent metabolic responses. Exposure to TPhP in CV resulted in enhanced respiration (increase of fumarate and malate) and osmoregulation (increase of sucrose and myo-inositol), synthesis of membrane lipids (accumulation of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), decrease of lysoglycerolipids, fatty acids, and glyceryl-glucoside). Exposure to TPhP in SO resulted in enhanced osmoregulation (increase of valine, proline, and raffinose) and lipolysis (decrease of MGDG, accumulation of fatty acids, lysophospholipids, and glycerol phosphate). Although chlorophyll a and b contents did not change significantly, decrease of chlorophyll derivatives was observed in both CV and SO at high exposure concentrations. Further bioassays confirmed that CV exhibited enhanced membrane integrity and decreased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) possibly as a defense strategy, whereas SO showed disruption of membrane integrity and induction of ROS at 10 mg/l exposure. This study demonstrated the potential of microalgae to remove TPhP in water, and offered new insights for the risk assessment of TPhP on freshwater microalgae using metabolomics.

AB  - CosR (Campylobacter oxidative stress regulator; Cj0355c) is an OmpR-type response regulator essential for the viability of Campylobacter jejuni, a leading foodborne pathogen causing human gastroenteritis worldwide. Despite importance, the function of CosR remains completely unknown mainly because of cell death caused by its knockout mutation. To overcome this technical limitation, in this study, antisense technology was used to investigate the regulatory function of CosR by modulating the level of CosR expression. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) was performed to identify the CosR regulon either by suppressing CosR expression with antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) or by overexpressing CosR in C. jejuni. According to the results of 2DGE, CosR regulated 32 proteins involved in various cellular processes. Notably, CosR negatively regulated a few key proteins of the oxidative stress response of C. jejuni, such as SodB, Dps, Rrc and LuxS, whereas CosR positively controlled AhpC. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that CosR directly bound to the promoter region of the oxidative stress genes. DNase I footprinting assays identified 21-bp CosR binding sequences in the sodB and ahpC promoters, suggesting CosR specifically recognizes and binds to the regulated genes. Interestingly, the level of CosR protein was significantly reduced by paraquat (a superoxide generator) but not by hydrogen peroxide. Consistent with the overall negative regulation of oxidative stress defense proteins by CosR, the CosR knockdown by antisense rendered C. jejuni more resistant to oxidative stress compared to the wild type.

AB  - Fluralaner is a novel isoxazoline insecticide which shows high insecticidal activity against parasitic, sanitary and agricultural pests, but there is little information about the effect of fluralaner on non-target organisms. This study reports the acute toxicity, bioconcentration, elimination and antioxidant response of fluralaner in zebrafish. All LC50 values of fluralaner to zebrafish were higher than 10 mg L-1 at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. To study the bioconcentration and elimination, the zebrafish were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of fluralaner (2.00 and 0.20 mg L-1) for 15 d and then held 6 d in clean water. The results showed medium BCF of fluralaner with values of 12.06 (48 h) and 21.34 (144 h) after exposure to 2.00 and 0.20 mg L-1 fluralaner, respectively. In the elimination process, a concentration of only 0.113 mg kg(-1) was found in zebrafish on the 6th day after removal to clean water. After exposure in 2.00 mg L-1 fluralaner, the enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GST, GSH-PX, CarE and content of MDA were measured. Only CAT and CarE activities were significantly regulated and the others stayed at a stable level compared to the control group. Meanwhile, transcriptional expression of CYP1C2, CYP1D1, CYP11A were significantly down-regulated at 12 h exposed to 2.00 mg L-1 of fluralaner. Except CYP1D1, others CYPs were up-regulated at different time during exposure periods.
   Fluralaner and its formulated product (BRAVECTO (R)) are of low toxicity to zebrafish and are rapidly concentrated in zebrafish and eliminated after exposure in clean water. Antioxidant defense and metabolic systems were involved in the fluralaner-induced toxicity. Among them, the activities of CAT and CarE, and most mRNA expression level of CYPs showed fast response to the sub-lethal concentration of fluralaner, which could be used as a biomarker relevant to the toxicity.

AB  - The sensitive determination of foodborne pathogens in foodstuffs or water system is essential for protecting food and environment safety. Herein, we have proposed a photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor based on two-dimensional (2D)/3D organic-inorganic heterojunction for the efficient detection of Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium). The heterojunction was established via the in situ growth of copper (II) selenide (CuSe) nanosheets around the photoactive triazine covalent-organic polymer (COP) nanospheres, which was synthesized using 2,4,6-Tris(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-Triazine (TAPT) and 2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetricarbaldehyde (Tp) as building blocks (denoted as TAPT-Tp-COP@CuSe). Integrating the features of TAPT-Tp-COP (such as large specific surface and pore size, multi-functionality, and rich defects) and CuSe (such as high photoabsorption ability, fast electron transfer and effective separation of the photo-generated charge carrier) not only can accelerate the photoelectric transformation efficiency, but also can promote the aptamer immobilization. Consequently, the constructed PEC aptasensor based on TAPT-Tp-COP@CuSe illustrated a low detection limit of 3.4 CFU mL-1 with a linear range from 1 x 101 to 1 x 105 CFU mL-1 toward S. typhimurium. In addition, it demonstrated high selectivity in light of the specific recognition of aptamer toward S. typhimurium, good reproducibility and stability, and promising regeneration ability, as well as wide applications for the detection of S. typhimurium in diverse foodstuffs systems. The present work provides a new aptasensing strategy for the effective detection of foodborne pathogens from diverse foodstuffs by combining the merits of COPs and PEC technique.

AB  - There is an increased recognition in the field of toxicology of the value of medium-to-high-throughput screening methods using in vitro and alternative animal models. We have previously introduced the asexual freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica as a new alternative animal model and proposed that it is particularly well-suited for the study of developmental neurotoxicology. In this article, we discuss how we have expanded and automated our screening methodology to allow for fast screening of multiple behavioral endpoints, developmental toxicity, and mortality. Using an 87-compound library provided by the National Toxicology Program, consisting of known and suspected neurotoxicants, including drugs, flame retardants, industrial chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and presumptive negative controls, we further evaluate the benefits and limitations of the system for medium-throughput screening, focusing on the technical aspects of the system. We show that, in the context of this library, planarians are the most sensitive to pesticides with 16/16 compounds causing toxicity and the least sensitive to PAHs, with only 5/17 causing toxicity. Furthermore, while none of the presumptive negative controls were bioactive in adult planarians, 2/5, acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid, were bioactive in regenerating worms. Notably, these compounds were previously reported as developmentally toxic in mammalian studies. Through parallel screening of adults and developing animals, planarians are thus a useful model to detect such developmental-specific effects, which was observed for 13 chemicals in this library. We use the data and experience gained from this screen to propose guidelines for best practices when using planarians for toxicology screens.

AB  - Recognition of the fact that impairment of the tactile sense may occur independently of other disturbances in the vibration syndrome has rekindled an interest in developing a diagnostic method for early detection of vibration-induced neuropathy. There is also evidence suggesting that vibrotactile measurements represent a valuable diagnostic tool in compressive neuropathies, such as the carpal tunnel syndrome. The method may also become useful for diagnosing sensory neuropathies caused by other factors, such as solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, alcoholism, and diabetes. However, before vibrotactile measurement can be accepted and established as a tool for clinical diagnostic purposes, for screening, and in research, the level and the shape of the normal threshold curve have to be specified. With the purpose of assembling normative data, the vibrotactile perception thresholds (8-500 Hz) of the right index fingertip were measured in 171 healthy males (19-75 years) not exposed to vibration. A Bekesy audiometer was modified to operate in combination with a vibration exciter, instead of headphones, at frequencies lower than usual (8-500 Hz). The results showed that the perception thresholds increased from about 100 dB to about 140 dB (rel. 10(-6) m/s2rms) as a function of frequency and age. The frequency-dependent changes were not linear, however, but displayed a peak in sensitivity at 125 Hz. Threshold changes due to aging were most pronounced at the highest frequencies. It is of the utmost importance that these natural changes are taken into account when making comparisons between groups or individuals.

AB  - Exposure of marine animals to certain pollutants can enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production with subsequent damage to macromolecules and alterations in oxidant defences levels. Aimed at correlating the tissue concentration of certain contaminants (PCBs, DDT) with antioxidant defence levels and oxidative damages. two fish species with different life strategies (mullet, Mugil cephalus, and flounder, Platichthys flesus) were collected in the Douro Estuary (NW Portugal). After capture. the fish were left to depurate for 1 month in clean seawater. The levels of the two antioxidant enzyme activities revealed that they are species-dependent with mullet's livers showing higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) (13.2 +/- 0.5 U/mg protein) and catalase (CAT) (15.5 +/- 1.0 mmol/min/mg protein) activities than flounder (SOD: 7.9 +/- 0.9 U/mg protein; CAT: 11.1 +/- 0.8 mmol/min/mg protein). After I month in captivity the antioxidant enzymes activities in liver decreased in mullets. while for flounders the responses were not consistent because during the experimental period flounders did not ate and responses of antioxidant enzymes and oxidative damages were dependent on the fasting condition. The liver oxidative damages were evaluated by estimating oxidised lipids and proteins. Both species showed similar levels for these two parameters, The hepatic lipid peroxidation in flounder increased after 1 month in captivity, while in mullet an increase was observed only in summer and autumn. The oxidised protein content increased for both species after the depuration period.
   This study reveals differences between species under oxidative stress when exposed to pollutants. In a clean evironment, the mullet's primary antioxidant defences decreased indicating that the animals living in Douro estuary were facing an oxidative stress. The data indicate that. namely in mullet, the presence of pollutants induce oxidative stress responses. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transcriptional regulators of the AraC/XylS family have been associated with multidrug resistance, organic solvent tolerance, oxidative stress, and virulence in clinically relevant enterobacteria. In the present study, we identified four homologous AraC/XylS regulators, Rob, SoxS, PliA, and OpiA, from the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora Ea1189. Previous studies have shown that the regulators MarA, Rob, and SoxS from Escherichia coli mediate multiple-antibiotic resistance, primarily by upregulating the AcrAB-TolC efflux system. However, none of the four AraC/XylS regulators from E. amylovora was able to induce a multidrug resistance phenotype in the plant pathogen. Overexpression of rob led to a 2-fold increased expression of the acrA gene. However, the rob-overexpressing strain showed increased resistance to only a limited number of antibiotics. Furthermore, Rob was able to induce tolerance to organic solvents in E. amylovora by mechanisms other than efflux. We demonstrated that SoxS from E. amylovora is involved in superoxide resistance. A soxS-deficient mutant of Ea1189 was not able to grow on agar plates supplemented with the superoxide-generating agent paraquat. Furthermore, expression of soxS was induced by redox cycling agents. We identified two novel members of the AraC/XylS family in E. amylovora. PliA was highly upregulated during the early infection phase in apple rootstock and immature pear fruits. Multiple compounds were able to induce the expression of pliA, including apple leaf extracts, phenolic compounds, redox cycling agents, heavy metals, and decanoate. OpiA was shown to play a role in the regulation of osmotic and alkaline pH stress responses.

AB  - The biological activity of many nitrosubstituted compounds, many of which are produced commercially or have been identified as environmental contaminants, is dependent on metabolic activation catalyzed by nitroreductases. In the current study, we have cloned a nitroreductase gene, Salmonella typhimurium nitroreductase A (snrA), from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA1535, and characterized the purified gene product. SnrA is 240 amino acids in length and shares 87% sequence identity to the Escherichia coli homolog, E. coli nitroreductase A (NfsA). SnrA is the major nitroreductase in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA1535 and catalyzes nitroreduction through a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism in a NADPH and flavine mononucleotide (FMN) dependent manner. SmA exhibits extremely low levels of FMN reductase activity but the nitroreductase activity of SmA is competitively inhibited by exogenously added FMN. Treatment of TA 1535 with paraquat resulted in induction of nitroreductase activity, suggesting that SnrA is a member of the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SoxRS regulon associated with cellular defense against oxidative damage. Examination of the microbial genomes databases shows that SmA homologs are widely distributed in the microbial world, being present in isolates of both Archea and Eubacteria. Southern hybridization and PCR failed to detect the snrA gene in the closely related S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA 1538. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains TA1535 and TA1538 and their derivatives are commonly used in mutagenicity testing. Differences in metabolic capacity between these two strains may have implications for the interpretation of mutagenicity data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) is one of the most destructive diseases of fresh and brackish water farmed and wild fish in the Asia-Pacific region. The in vitro germination and growth of the propagules of the EUS pathogen, Aphanomyces invadans (=A. piscicida), were assessed in the presence of the head-kidney macrophages, serum, and serum heated to inactivate complement proteins, of three EUS-susceptible and one resistant fish species. The susceptible species were: striped snakehead (Channa striata), giant gourami (Osphronemus gouramy) and silver barb [Barbodes (= Puntius) gonionotus], and the resistant species was Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish of all species were acclimatised to either low temperature (20 degreesC +/- 1.6) at which EUS is known to occur, or to high temperature (32 degrees C +/- 5.0) at which EUS does not occur, except for giant gouramis which were only studied at low temperature. The respiratory burst of the macrophages was assessed in the presence of A. invadans or the stimulant phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and compared to that of controls. Anti-A. invadans antibody concentrations were assessed in all species except silver barbs. All assays were carried out at the same temperature, regardless of the temperature that the fish were kept at.
   Macrophages of all species other than snakeheads inhibited fungal germination at both temperatures, though only silver barb and gourami macrophages could inhibit germling growth. PMA increased the respiratory burst in nearly all cases. The respiratory burst in the presence of A. invadans was consistently lower than that of controls, though the difference was only significant in the case of snakeheads. The respiratory burst of all macrophage treatments was higher at a low temperature. Except in the case of PMA-stimulated macrophages, regressions between respiratory burst and inhibitory action were only found in susceptible species, suggesting that the respiratory burst is important in those species, but is unable to prevent the proliferation of A. invadans.
   Serum inhibited fungal germination in all cases other than low temperature tilapia, indicating that the EUS resistance of tilapia is not due to the serum. Inhibition of germling growth by serum only occurred in silver barbs and gourami. Heated serum did not inhibit germination in any case except that of high temperature snakehead, and in fact stimulated germination in the case of tilapia. Heating serum did not affect the growth inhibiting activity of silver barbs and gouramis, but it stimulated growth in some groups. At high temperatures snakeheads had high anti-A. invadans antibody concentrations, which may explain the inhibitory activity of their heated serum. A role for complement and antibodies in defence against A. invadans in susceptible species is suggested. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - Pond management information available to the public was assessed by content analysis of the 56 educational bulletins provided by 79 state and federal agencies in 43 states. This review indicated that an abundance and a high diversity of pond management information is available to the public in most states, except for those (primarily western states) with limited surface water resources. Certain pond management practices (stocking, population balance, weed control, fertilization, and construction) dominated the literature; fish health, habitat management, and socioeconomic aspects were treated less comprehensively. Suggested improvements to subsequent bulletins include: (1) updating the content to reflect changes in management knowledge; (2) clarifying the economic and ecological consequences of herbicide, piscicide, and fertilization applications; (3) expanding coverage to include socioeconomic benefits and liabilities of ownership; (4) developing regional or multistate sponsored bulletins to facilitate timely revisions and cost-effective production and distribution; (5) generating substantive bulletins complete with references (rather than superficial leaflets); and (6) use of multiple communication strategies (videos, workshops, teleconferencing) to augment bulletins.

AB  - The research reported here aims to understand how people react to statements expressing risk uncertainty information in the context of a commonly experienced potential hazard, food related risks. Public perception of seriousness of risk for themselves, and for other people was examined for different types of uncertainty, for each of five different food hazards. The results indicated that participants responded to the different types of uncertainty in a uniform way, suggesting that perception of risk associated with uncertainty is not affected by the 'type' of uncertainty. The results further indicated that the seriousness of risk, in the presence of statements of uncertainty, was perceived to be greater for pesticides and genetic modification compared to BSE, high fat diets and Salmonella. It was argued that this could be due to the perceptions of low personal control, and high societal responsibility to protect people and societal control over exposure to the potential risks of pesticides and genetic modification. Under circumstances where people feel they have little personal control over their exposure to a particular hazard, and those social institutions that are perceived to be in control of protecting the public indicate that there is uncertainty associated with risk estimates, the hazard may appear to be 'out of control', which is associated with a perception of serious risk.

AB  - Based on semistructured interviews (N = 7), informal interviewing (N = 63), and a survey (N = 790), this article describes the cultural models used by mid-Atlantic residents to understand Pfiesteria piscicida. A cultural model is a simplified way of understanding a complex system, shared by members of a culture. Eighty-eight percent of respondents understood Pfiesteria using one of four previously existing cultural models: a disease in fish, a parasite in fish, a water pollutant, and a toxin or poison. These models are not used by marine biologists, who are more likely to refer to Pfiesteria taxonomically or, in its fish killing form, to call it a predator. Our survey shows that the cultural model a respondent holds is correlated significantly with his or her believed pathway of human harm (e.g., eating fish versus swimming) and is correlated significantly but weakly with his or her behavioral responses. We conclude that existing cultural models, as the public has applied them to Pfiesteria, have led people to avoid a range of coastal activities and seafoods, in virtually all cases unnecessarily. Cultural models appear to explain public reaction better than previously hypothesized factors such as inaccurate media coverage. These findings suggest an approach to developing a pedagogical and communications strategy which could provide the public with a cultural model better matched to Pfiesteria.

AB  - Tropical inland capture fisheries are susceptible to a series of vulnerabilities such as habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, pollution, overfishing, invasive species and anthropogenic climate change. A comprehensive review of the impact of climatic uncertainties on Indian inland fisheries has not been adequately attempted yet. Recent approaches emphasizing ecosystem based management in a regional context, specific to inland fisheries for combating climatic changes, have not been reported to date. The paper presents a critical bibliometric review of the climatic vulnerabilities faced by Indian inland fishery resources and various adaptive and mitigation strategies put forward by the country for the sustainability of the resources. In this communication, a systematic review of the impact of climate change and other stressors on various inland ecosystems of the subcontinent and the ecosystem-based management strategies adopted in India is presented and discussed.

AB  - The effluent stream from the industrial production of the herbicide trifluraline (amination water) was submitted to a combined treatment of a physical-chemical process (coagulation) with an advanced oxidation process (Fenton). The recovering of the residual sludge was performed. The combined coagulation-Fenton-sedimentation process proved to be very suitable for wastewater color reduction (91.6%), promoting considerable abatement of the organic load (63.4% COD reduction). According to the fractionary factorial design, the main effects of pH (A) and Fenton sludge (B) variables were considered statistical fluctuations of the process (and not decisive), while the main effects of Fe3+ (C), Fe2+ (D) and H2O2 (E), as well as the interactions between variables A and B, A and E, C and D and C and E were considered significant. The obtained results suggest that the combined process can be advantageous for the treatment of recalcitrant industrial effluents, such as the amination water from the trifluraline production.

AB  - Mediterranean rice fields constitute temporary marshes artificially kept flooded throughout spring and summer, when natural wetlands dry up. These ecosystems can play an important role as a surrogate habitat for many organisms (e.g. invertebrates, amphibians), and as a foraging habitat for others (e.g. birds). The macro-invertebrate assemblages of three conventional rice fields, i.e. treated with pesticides and mineral fertilizers were studied in Camargue (Rhone delta, French Mediterranean coast) in 1999 and 2000, with a focus on spatio-temporal variability. A total of 70 taxa was recorded, represented by 42 families. Gastropods were dominant in numbers, representing up to 93% of macro-invertebrates in some fields. Arthropods were mainly represented by Diptera, that can form more than 54% of total numbers. Our study showed some changes in Camargue rice fields since the 60's, such as the absence of Triops cancriformis and the abundance of an exotic Planorbidae from Asia, Giraulus chinensis. Over the cultural season, taxonomic richness rapidly increased soon after flooding and stabilized after a few months. Rice field macro-invertebrate community dynamics could be divided into three main periods, each characterized by the dominance of specific groups. Although inter-field and inter-year differences in mean density of each group were observed, the seasonal succession of species always followed the same pattern. The influence of different biotic and abiotic factors on this animal community is discussed.

AB  - THE PRESENT experiment was conducted to assess the effects of decomposing rice straw on algal flora as well as physical, chemical, and biological-parameters of 9 earthen fish ponds of 2100m 3 for each with one-meter average depth. It was conducted for 6 months using three treatments. Each pond was stocked with 6000 fish fries of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Results showed that water quality decreased with increased loading rates of rice straw. Most of water quality parameters including EC, TDS, total alkalinity, total phosphorus, NO3, NO2, chlorophyll a, and pH were significantly lower in rice straw treatments than control. Total ammonia, Secchi disc visibility and orthophosphate were significantly higher with increase rice straw loading than control.
   Cyanophyceae constituted the dominant algal group at the initial phase at all examined ponds. This dominance remained stable in control ponds by the end of experiment. In contrast, in the final stage of the experiment Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae dominate in T2 and T3 treatments compared with control. The results of this work illustrated that the decrease of algal count was related to action of allelochemicals discharged from rice straw aqueous extract leading to suppress growth of some algal species. Hence, this technique is a way to reduce the cost and reduce the use of herbicides, by providing natural compounds that can be obtained from agricultural waste.

AB  - Legionella pneumophila expresses two catalase-peroxidase enzymes that exhibit strong peroxidatic but weak catalatic activities, suggesting that other enzymes participate in decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Comparative genomics revealed that L. pneumophila and its close relative Coxiella burnetii each contain two peroxide-scavenging alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) systems: AhpC1, which is similar to the Helicobacter pylori AhpC system, and AhpC2 AhpD (AhpC2D), which is similar to the AhpC AhpD system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To establish a catalatic function for these two systems, we expressed L. pneumophila ahpC1 or ahpC2 in a catalase/peroxidase mutant of Escherichia coli and demonstrated restoration of H2O2 resistance by a disk diffusion assay. ahpC1::Km and ahpC2D::Km chromosomal deletion mutants were two- to eightfold more sensitive to H2O2, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and paraquat than the wild-type L. pneumophila, a phenotype that could be restored by trans-complementation. Reciprocal strategies to construct double mutants were unsuccessful. Mutant strains were not enfeebled for growth in vitro or in a U937 cell infection model. Green fluorescence protein reporter assays revealed expression to be dependent on the stage of growth, with ahpC1 appearing after the exponential phase and ahpC2 appearing during early exponential phase. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that ahpC1 mRNA levels were similar to 7- to 10-fold higher than ahpC2D mRNA levels. However, expression of ahpC2D was significantly increased in the ahpC1 mutant, whereas ahpC1 expression was unchanged in the ahpC2D mutant. These results indicate that AhpC1 or AhpC2D (or both) provide an essential hydrogen peroxide- scavenging function to L. pneumophila and that the compensatory activity of the ahpC2D system is most likely induced in response to oxidative stress.

AB  - Histone H2A is a nuclear molecule tightly associated in the form of the nucleosome. Our previous studies have demonstrated the antibacterial property of piscine H2A variants against gram-negative bacteria Edwardsiella piscicida and Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae. In this study, we show the function and mechanism of piscine H2A in the negative regulation of RLR signaling pathway and host innate immune response against spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) infection. SVCV infection significantly inhibits the expression of histone H2A during an early stage of infection, but induces the expression of histone H2A during the late stage of infection such as at 48 and 72 hpi. Under normal physiological conditions, histone H2A is nuclear-localized. However, SVCV infection promotes the migration of histone H2A from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The in vivo studies revealed that histone H2A overexpression led to the increased expression of SVCV gene and decreased survival rate. The overexpression of histone H2A also significantly impaired the expression levels of those genes involved in RLR antiviral signaling pathway. Furthermore, histone H2A targeted TBK1 and IRF3 to promote their protein degradation via the lysosomal pathway and impair the formation of TBK1-IRF3 functional complex. Importantly, histone H2A completely abolished TBK1-mediated antiviral activity and enormously impaired the protein expression of IRF3, especially nuclear IRF3. Further analysis demonstrated that the inhibition of histone H2A nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking could relieve the protein degradation of TBK1 and IRF3, and blocked the negative regulation of histone H2A on the SVCV infection. Collectively, our results suggest that histone H2A nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking is essential for negative regulation of RLR signaling pathway and antiviral immune response in response to SVCV infection.

AB  - Actinobacteria in the Tsukamurella genus are aerobic, high-GC, Gram-positive mycolata, considered as opportunistic pathogens and isolated from various environmental sources, including sites contaminated with oil, urban or industrial waste and pesticides. Although studies look into xenobiotic biotransformation by Tsukamurella isolates, the relevant enzymes remain uncharacterized. We investigated the arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzyme family, known for its role in the xenobiotic metabolism of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Xenobiotic sensitivity of Tsukamurella paurometabola type strain DSM 20162(T) was assessed, followed by cloning, recombinant expression and functional characterization of its single NAT homolog (TSUPD)NAT1. The bacterium appeared quite robust against chloroanilines, but more sensitive to 4-anisidine and 2-aminophenol. However, metabolic activity was not evident towards those compounds, presumably due to mechanisms protecting cells from xenobiotic entry. Of the pharmaceutical arylhydrazines tested, hydralazine was toxic, but the bacterium was less sensitive to isoniazid, a drug targeting mycolic acid biosynthesis in mycobacteria. Although (TSUPD)NAT1 protein has an atypical Cys-His-Glu (instead of the expected Cys-His-Asp) catalytic triad, it is enzymatically active, suggesting that this deviation is likely due to evolutionary adaptation potentially serving a different function. The protein was indeed found to use malonyl-CoA, instead of the archetypal acetyl-CoA, as its preferred donor substrate. Malonyl-CoA is important for microbial biosynthesis of fatty acids (including mycolic acids) and polyketide chains, and the corresponding enzymatic systems have common evolutionary histories, also linked to xenobiotic metabolism. This study adds to accummulating evidence suggesting broad phylogenetic and functional divergence of microbial NAT enzymes that goes beyond xenobiotic metabolism and merits investigation.

AB  - The northern quahog Mercenaria mercenaria was exposed to bloom concentrations of the toxic red-tide dinoflagellate Alexandrium, the proximal cause of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in eastern North America, under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Two cultured isolates of Alexandrium, exhibiting markedly different PSP toxin compositions and specific toxicities, were used independently to determine the kinetics of toxin accumulation and loss, as well as the potential for biotransformation of individual PSP toxins in certain tissues. Clams readily ingested and absorbed a monospecific diet of the low toxicity A. tamarense isolate GtLI22. They also ingested cells of the high toxicity A. fundyense isolate GtCA29, but at a lower rate, and only when the diet was supplemented with a nontoxic diatom, Thalassiosira weissflogii. As natural populations of M. mercenaria rarely accumulate a substantial PSP toxin load, this suggests the existence of a toxin recognition mechanism. Maximum toxicities in clam tissues, attained within 2 wk of exposure to either toxic dinoflagellate, exceeded the regulatory harvest closure level (80-mu-g STXeq 100 g-1) by several orders of magnitude. Detoxification to levels acceptable for human consumption occurred within 3 to 6 wk. HPLC analyses revealed significant differences between the toxic profile of the dinoflagellates and that accumulated in various clam tissues. Clams toxified with isolate GtLI22, a strain rich in low potency C-toxins, showed: (1) de novo appearance of STX, (2) significant reduction in the proportion of C-toxins, and (3) reciprocal increase in the proportion of the gonyautoxins GTX2+3. Significant relative enrichment in STX also occurred in tissues of clams fed upon GtCA29, an isolate rich in the more potent carbamate toxins. The first experimental evidence of PSP accumulation/detoxification by M. mercenaria is provided, underscoring the potential of this species to act as a vector of PSP in humans.

AB  - Biological control manipulations of natural enemies to reduce pest populations represent large-scale ecological experiments that have both benefited from and contributed to various areas of modern ecology. Unfortunately, economic expediency and the need for rapid implementation often require that biological control programs be based more on trial and error than on sound ecological theory and testing. This approach has led to some remarkable successes but it has also produced dismal failures. This point is particularly well illustrated in the historical development and use of entomopathogenic nematodes for the biological control of insect pests. Intense effort has focused on developing these natural enemies as alternatives to chemical insecticides, in part because laboratory assays indicated that these nematodes possess a broad host range. This illusory attribute launched hundreds of field releases, many of which failed due to ecological barriers to infection that are not apparent from laboratory exposures, where conditions are optimal and host-parasite contact assured. For example, the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae is a poor choice to control scarab larvae because this nematode uses an ambusher foraging strategy near the soil surface whereas the equally sedentary scarab remains within the soil profile, shows a weak host recognition response to scarabs, has difficulty overcoming the scarab immune response, and has low reproduction in this host. Conversely, two other nematodes, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and S. glaseri, are highly adapted to parasitize scarabs: they use a cruising foraging strategy, respond strongly to scarabs, easily overcome the immune response, and reproduce well in these hosts. Increased understanding of the ecology of entomopathogenic nematodes has enabled better matches between parasites and hosts, and more accurate predictions of field performance. These results underline the importance of a strong partnership between basic and applied ecology in the area of biological control.

AB  - An ecotoxicological test battery based on a mode-of-action approach was designed and applied to the hazard identification and classification of modes of action of six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ethinyl estradiol, ibuprofen, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole). The rationale behind the design of the battery was to cover the relevant interactions that a compound may have with biological targets. It is thus not comprehensive but contains representative examples of each category of mode of toxic action including nonspecific, specific, and reactive toxicity. The test battery consists of one test system for nonspecific toxicity (baseline toxicity or narcosis), two test systems for specific effects, and two test systems for reactive toxicity. The baseline toxicity was quantified with the Kinspec test, which detects membrane leakage via measurements of membrane potential. This test system may also be used to detect the specific effects on energy transduction, although this was not relevant to any compound investigated in this study. As examples of specific receptor-mediated toxicity, we chose the yeast estrogen screen (YES) as a specific test for estrogenicity, and the inhibition of chlorophyll fluorescence in algae to assess specific effects on photosynthesis. Reactive modes of action were assessed indirectly by measuring the relevance of cellular defense systems. Differences in growth inhibition curves between a mutant of Escherichia coli that could not synthesize glutathione and its parent strain indicate the relevance of conjugation with glutathione as a defense mechanism, which is an indirect indicator of protein damage. DNA damage was assessed by comparing the growth inhibition in a strain that lacks various DNA repair systems with that in its competent parent strain. Most compounds acted merely as baseline toxicants in all test systems. As expected, ethinylestradiol was the only compound showing estrogenic activity. Propranolol was baseline-toxic in all test systems except for the photosynthesis inhibition assay, where it surprisingly showed a 100-fold excess toxicity over the predicted baseline effect. The exact mode of toxic action could not be confirmed, but additional chlorophyll fluorescence induction experiments excluded the possibility of direct interference with photosynthesis through photosystem 11 inhibition. Mixture experiments were performed as a diagnostic tool to analyze the mode of toxic action. Compounds with the same mode of toxic action showed the expected concentration addition. In the photosynthesis inhibition assay, agreement between experimental results and prediction was best for two-stage predictions considering the assigned modes of action. In a two-stage prediction, concentration addition was used as a model to predict the mixture effect of the baseline toxicants followed by their independent action as a single component combined with the specifically acting compound propranolol and the reference compound diuron. A comparison with acute toxicity data for algae, daphnia, and fish showed generally good agreement for the nonspecifically acting compounds but also that the proposed test battery offered better diagnostic value in the case of the specifically acting compounds.

AB  - The Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphin (Sousa chinensis Osbeck, 1765) is found throughout the western Pacific and Indian oceans, from southern China and northern Australia in the east to South Africa in the west. Throughout most of its range it has not been well studied, and in southern China very little is known of its biology. The goal of the present study was to provide scientific information needed for the long-term conservation and management of the population that occurs in Hong-Kong waters. From September 1997 to November 1998, 38,105 km of systematic line transect surveys were conducted throughout marine waters of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and adjacent waters to provide data on distribution and abundance. Photo-identification of individual dolphins allowed for examination of movement patterns, home ranges, and social organization. Collection of stranded dolphin carcasses and detailed neeropsies provided information on causes of death as well as samples for life history studies, such as feeding habits, growth and reproduction, ecotoxicology, and stock structure.
   The dolphin population appears to be centered around the Pearl River Estuary, and Hong Kong waters represent the eastern portion of the range, which extends far into mainland Chinese waters (Lingding Bay) and covers at least 1,800 km(2). Within Hong Kong, dolphins only occur in western waters around Lantau Island. The area north of Lantau Island is heavily used throughout the year and represents by far the most important habitat in Hong Kong. Line transect analyses indicate that between 88 (spring) and 145 (summer) dolphins occur in Hong Kong. Based on 27,6000 photographs taken, 213 individual dolphins were identified. The total size of the Pearl River breeding population is unknown, but is estimated to consist of at least 1,028 dolphins, based on line transect analysis. An apparent decline in the number of dolphins in the North Lantau area over the period from 1996-1998 was not statistically significant. Individual dolphins have overlapping home ranges of about 30-400 km(2) in different sections of the population's overall range. Groups of dolphins in Hong Kong number up to 23 animals, with an average group size of 3.8 +/- s.d. 3.63 animals. There is no significant seasonal variation in group size, but groups feeding behind pair trawl fishing vessels (mean = 8.3 +/- s.d. 7.84) are significantly larger than those in Hong Kong. Groups are very fluid and change composition frequently, with association indices ranging from 0-0.333. Behavioral patterns are similar to those of other coastal dolphins, but Hong Kong hump-backed dolphins only rarely ride bow waves. Following pair trawlers represents an important feeding strategy for some individuals. Construction work on an airport fuel facility in the dolphins' main habitat appears to have caused some disturbance (indicated by increased swimming speeds) and possibly temporary evacuation of the surrounding area.
   There is a great deal of developmental variation in the color pattern of southern Chinese hump-backed dolphins, with a general lightening from newborn to adult stages. Males appear to retain more spots in adulthood than females. Length at birth appears to be about 100 cm, and postnatal development is characterized by rapid growth in the first year and a levelling-off of the growth curve after reaching adulthood. Asymptotic length is reached at around 243 cm. Length and weight are related exponentially, with the maximum weight about 250 kg. Calving occurs throughout the year, but most young are born from January through August, with a peak in spring/summer. Scant evidence suggests that sexual maturity in females is reached at about 9-10 years of age. Dolphins feed mainly on several demersal and pelagic fish species that are often associated with estuaries. There is a lack of evidence for long-distance movements (on the order of hundreds of linear kilometers), and this presumably results in isolation of groups around major Chinese river mouths. Thus it appears that there may be at least 8 separate populations of hump-backed dolphins along the coast of southern China. The Pearl River Estuary, including Hong Kong, is apparently inhabited by one of these populations, although preliminary genetic work has shown only equivocal evidence of population separation from dolphins in the Xiamen area. Human-related causes of mortality include entanglement in fishing nets and vessel collisions. Some environmental contaminants (especially the heavy metal mercury and the pesticide DDT) were found in high levels in some dolphins, and preliminary evidence suggests that these may be affecting the health of the animals.
   A series of recommendations for management and for further research have been made to aid in the conservation of these animals. Principles for the conservation of wild living resources should be followed, and information from both the natural and social sciences are needed for proper management. Research and long-term monitoring of the population must continue for management strategies to be evaluated and refined. Overall, the population of hump-backed dolphins that occurs in Hong Kong waters appears to be viable and should be able to survive with appropriate conservation efforts.

AB  - The widespread use of pesticides is one of the major health and environmental concerns. There is an urgent need to develop improved analytical methodologies as well as for a deep insight into the mechanism behind the interaction between pesticides and the nucleic acids of living organisms. In the present work, the electrochemical behavior of the diacylhydrazine insecticide methoxyfenozide (Met) on a boron-doped diamond electrode and its interaction with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were investigated for the first time by applying cyclic voltammetry and square wave (SW) voltammetry. The influence of numerous factors, such as composition of the supporting electrolyte, its pH, and voltammetric parameters, was analyzed. Under the optimized conditions, a simple and sensitive SW voltammetric procedure was developed for the determination of Met. Quantification was found to be linear from 5.0 x 10(-7) to 7.0 x 10(-5) mol L-1, with a detection limit of 1.4 x 10(-7) mol L-1. The application of the developed voltammetric methodology for the analysis of tap water, river water and grape juice was tested with spiked samples. Studies on the interaction between methoxyfenozide and double-stranded salmon sperm DNA were conducted using both voltammetric and spectroscopic techniques. The results obtained indicated the dominance of the intercalative binding mode between Met and dsDNA. The binding constants of the formed complex were calculated based on the changes in the electrochemical and spectroscopic behaviors of Met in the presence of dsDNA.

AB  - Rice and fish are an important source of protein for the people of North Sumatra that can be produced from saline paddy cultivation. The research was conducted started from March 2017 to September 2017 using group random design method on two plots of rice plantation in Paluh Merbau Sub-district, Percut Sei Tuan district, North Sumatera. Comparison between IR 64 paddy types with nila tilapia (Tilapia mosambicca) on two plots, in the control area and tidal area is predicted to show a comparison of fish composition and diversity of species of insects identified to family/species levels categorized into 4 groups (Predators, Parasites, Pests, Parasitoids). Yellow Sticky Trap (YST) more effective used than Sweep Net (SN) and Core Sampler (CS) in Paddy of Percut. The calculation of richnesse index of Margallef (R1), Index Jaccard, Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (H') in saline paddy fields were done. Dominant pests such as Orseolia oryzae and Leptocorisa oratorius are controlled using by environmentally friendly bioinsecticides, such as P1(Neem leaf extract 100 ml), P2 (Papaya leaf extract 100 ml), and P3 (100 ml poison yam plant extract). T-Test, Kruskal-Wallis test and correlation test showed significant differences between the abundance and the dominance of insects in the control and saline areas; the effectiveness of insect trap testing and the most effective use of vegetable pesticides. Furthermore, differences in insect biodiversity during the sampling period and phase of paddy were affected by physical, chemical, and biological factors in Percut Sei Tuan, Northern Sumatra.

AB  - Penconazole is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on penconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 19 June 2007. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 1 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July-August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on cucurbits and grapes. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Topas 10 EC", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues of penconazole in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of penconazole. A data gap was identified for a confirmatory method for surface water. It is noted that the residue definition for soil and water is provisional.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. It is noted however, that further validation data are required for the impurity method and that there is no supported technical specification.
   The toxicological studies on the metabolism of penconazole have shown an extensive oral absorption, a wide distribution in the body and an excretion mainly via urine. According to the results of acute oral toxicity testing, the agreed classification was Xn, R22 Harmful if swallowed. The main target organ in short term toxicity studies was the liver, and the dog was the most sensitive species. No genotoxic potential was observed during in vitro or in vivo tests, and no carcinogenicity was observed in rats or mice after long term exposure. In the reproductive toxicity studies, an increased incidence of dystocia was considered as an effect already observed with other triazoles, and to be forwarded to EChA for a decision upon classification (R62?- "Possible risk of impaired fertility"). Developmental effects were observed in the teratogenicity studies, and the classification Reprotoxic Category 3 R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child was proposed by the experts. Several plant metabolites were considered to be of the same or lower toxicity than penconazole. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) were both 0.03 mg/kg bw/day based on the combined 90-day/1- year dog study. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.5 mg/kg bw based on early bodyweight changes in the rabbit developmental study. These reference values were all derived with the use of a safety factor of 100. The dermal absorption values were 5% for the dilution and 1% for the concentrate. The exposure estimates in different scenarios (field or greenhouse use) were all below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment.
   The metabolism of penconazole was tested in grapes, tomatoes and apples where triazole and phenyl labelled compound was applied. The meeting of experts considered that the grape data were not acceptable and they were not considered further. The apple and tomato data were acceptable and showed the same metabolic profile. The main metabolism route is oxidation at the 1, 2 and 3 positions on the alkyl chain. The triazole moiety metabolites are an issue for all the triazole fungicides and will be dealt with in a separate exercise. For completeness, a general data gap was identified for this issue which has been used in other triazole conclusions. No phenyl-ring-only metabolites were seen. The significant residues at harvest consisted of CGA 132465(2), CGA 190503(3), CGA 127841(4) and their glucoside conjugates as well as penconazole. It was agreed that the provisional residue definition for risk assessment (fruit crops only) should be penconazole and free and conjugated CGA 132465, CGA 190503 and CGA 127841 expressed as penconazole.
   The residue definition for monitoring is penconazole with a conversion factor of 6 between monitoring and risk assessment residue definitions. The residue trial data set was complete for grapes but a data gap for outdoor cucurbits in the North of Europe was identified. The stability of residues was demonstrated in freezer storage for a period of 16 months. Appropriate processing data are available. Two rotational crop metabolism studies conducted at exaggerated rates showed that no significant residue would be expected in rotational crops. No livestock metabolism studies were supplied or required, as according to current guidance the representative crops under consideration are not fed to animals.
   The chronic risk assessment showed a maximum intake of 2.9 % of the ADI for the French diet using the EFSA model. For the acute risk the highest intake was 13 % of the ARID from the consumption of table grapes for the German diet using the EFSA model. The proposed MRLs are 0.2 mg/kg for grapes and 0.1 mg/kg for cucurbits.
   In soil under aerobic conditions penconazole exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolites CGA 179944(5) (accounting for up to 18.9% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence and CGA 71019(6) (accounting for up to 38.6% of AR) which also exhibited low persistence. Mineralisation of both the phenyl and triazole rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 65 and 27 % of AR respectively after 546 and 364 days. The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 22 and 47 % of AR respectively after 364 and 336 days. A data gap was identified for the identification/characterisation of the unknown radioactivity Ul found in the aerobic soil degradation up to 17.3% of the applied radioactivity.
   Penconazole is strongly adsorbed to soils and is unlikely to leach in soil. Column leaching studies have confirmed this, demonstrating that the parent compound is only recovered from the upper layers of the columns. Metabolite CGA 179944 exhibits very high mobility in soil and CGA 71019 exhibits very high to medium mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of penconazole or that of its soil metabolites was pH dependent.
   Penconazole does not degrade significantly via either hydrolysis or photolysis. The metabolites CGA 179944 and CGA 71019 were shown to be stable to hydrolysis under environmentally relevant conditions. The fate of penconazole in the aquatic environment therefore, will be principally determined by adsorption to the sediments and slow degradation therein. The terminal metabolite, carbon dioxide was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 4.6-8.4% of AR at 678-706 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 18-19 % of AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for penconazole and metabolites CGA 179944 and CGA 71019 at steps 1-2. Additional FOCUSsw calculations for penconazole confirmed that the maximum Step 3 PECs are 85% (water) and 70% (sediment) lower than the Step 2 derived values.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by penconazole, CGA 71019 and CGA 179944 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low for the intended uses covering only neutral and alkaline soil conditions. In addition, an assessment of the potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses on vines with highest rates and numbers of applications for some FOCUS scenarios is not available. For unknown Ul, a data gap was identified for a groundwater exposure assessment. A second modelling with FOCUS PEARL model is also necessary. It was concluded that penconazole is unlikely to be subject to long range atmospheric transport as a consequence of its likely indirect photooxidation intermediated transformation (half life estimated at 15.9 hours).
   The representative uses of penconazole are applications to cucurbits and grapes. The first tier risk assessment indicated that a low risk is expected to birds and mammals. TERs for earthworm eating birds and mammals meet the Annex VI trigger value of 5. The risk to birds and mammals from intake of contaminated drinking water from surface water or puddles was considered to be low.
   The meeting agreed with the use of the toxicity data for the triazole metabolites from the report from PRAPeR 13 for the ecotoxicology and from the report from PRAPeR 14 for the mammalian endpoint.
   The penconazole avian and mammalian databases were reviewed for effects indicative of potential endocrine activity. There are no relevant mediated effects below the threshold established by the current endpoints for the mammals. The expert meeting PRAPeR 48 agrees that some uncertainties remain on potential delayed reproductive effects on birds since these effects are not covered on the basis of the currently stated data requirements of Council Directive 91/414/EEC. More information should be requested at MS level. Based on the information available penconazole is proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms.
   The first tier risk assessment indicated a low long term risk to fish and also a low acute risk to aquatic invertebrates, algae and sediment dwelling organisms. However, tier I risk assessment also indicated that there is a high acute risk to fish and a high long term risk to aquatic invertebrates and aquatic plants. The Annex VI triggers for acute and long term risk are met with the PECsw from FOCUS Step 2. The higher tier risk assessment indicated a low risk for all aquatic organisms, except for the long term risk to aquatic invertebrates. However, with FOCUS Step 3 PECsw the TER value was above the Annex VI trigger values. The applicant and the RMS proposed that an appropriate FSDT study was required to address the potential endocrine-mediated effect in DMI fungicides since the FSDT will cover the sensitive time windows with respect to effect triggering and effect manifestation. The member state experts agreed with this proposal and also noted that member states should have the opportunity to ask for an appropriate test to address the endocrine effects.
   The BCF of 320 was derived from a study with bluegill sunfish (Lepomis machrochirus). The first tier risk assessment for metabolites indicated a low acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms for both metabolites CGA 71019 and CGA 179944.
   Penconazole is of low toxicity to bees. Hazard Quotients (HQ) for oral and contact exposure were determined to be below the trigger values indicating a low risk for bees.
   The risk to non-target arthropods was assessed as high for the in-field areas, however a potential for recolonisation from the off field areas had been demonstrated.
   The acute and chronic TER values for penconazole and for both metabolites CGA 71019 and CGA 179944 were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating that the risk to earthworms is low.
   Penconazole and the metabolite CGA 71019 were tested with Folsomia candida, and the active substance was tested for effects in a litter bag study. In conclusion, the risk of penconazole and the metabolite CGA 71019 to other non-target macro-organisms was considered to be low.
   The results of the assessment of "Topas 10 EC" as well as the soil metabolites CGA 71019 and CGA 179944 indicate no adverse impact on soil non target organisms.
   In a preliminary screening test "Topas 10 EC" had only a slight effect (< 50 % effect) on seedling emergence and vegetative vigour in 3 monocotyledons and 3 dicotyledons at rates up to 30 g a.s./ha. EFSA notes that the dose used in the screening test, 30 g a.s./ha, has not covered the higher proposed intended uses of 50 g a.s./ha.
   No inhibitory effects of penconazole to respiration rates of activated sludge were observed up to 100 mg /L.

AB  - The regulation of populations through density dependence (DD) has long been a central tenet of studies of ecological systems. As an important factor in regulating populations, DD is also crucial for understanding risks to populations from stressors, including its incorporation into population models applied for this purpose. However, study of density-dependent regulation is challenging because it can occur through various mechanisms, and their identification in the field, as well as the quantification of the consequences on individuals and populations, can be difficult. We conducted a targeted literature review specifically focusing on empirical laboratory or field studies addressing negative DD in freshwater fish and small rodent populations, two vertebrate groups considered in pesticide Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA). We found that the most commonly recognized causes of negative DD were food (63% of 19 reviewed fish studies, 40% of 25 mammal studies) or space limitations (32% of mammal studies). In addition, trophic interactions were reported as causes of population regulation, with predation shaping mostly small mammal populations (36% of the mammal studies) and cannibalism impacting freshwater fish (26%). In the case of freshwater fish, 63% of the studies were experimental (i.e., with a length of weeks or months). They generally focused on the individual-level causes and effects of DD, and had a short duration. Moreover, DD affected mostly juvenile growth and survival of fish (68%). On the other hand, studies on small mammals were mainly based on time series analyzing field population properties over longer timespans (68%). Density dependence primarily affected survival in subadult and adult mammal stages and, to a lesser extent, reproduction (60% vs. 36%). Furthermore, delayed DD was often observed (56%). We conclude by making suggestions on future research paths, providing recommendations for including DD in population models developed for ERA, and making the best use of the available data.

AB  - AIP56 (apoptosis-inducing protein of 56 kDa) is a metalloprotease AB toxin secreted by Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida that acts by cleaving NF-kappa B. During infection, AIP56 spreads systemically and depletes phagocytes by postapoptotic secondary necrosis, impairing the host phagocytic defense and contributing to the genesis of infection-associated necrotic lesions. Here we show that mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDM) intoxicated by AIP56 undergo NF-kappa B p65 depletion and apoptosis. Similarly to what was reported for sea bass phagocytes, intoxication of mBMDM involves interaction of AIP56 C-terminal region with cell surface components, suggesting the existence of a conserved receptor. Biochemical approaches and confocal microscopy revealed that AIP56 undergoes clathrin-dependent endocytosis, reaches early endosomes, and follows the recycling pathway. Translocation of AIP56 into the cytosol requires endosome acidification, and an acidic pulse triggers translocation of cell surface-bound AIP56 into the cytosol. Accordingly, at acidic pH, AIP56 becomes more hydrophobic, interacting with artificial lipid bilayer membranes. Altogether, these data indicate that AIP56 is a short-trip toxin that reaches the cytosol using an acidic-pH-dependent mechanism, probably from early endosomes. Usually, for short-trip AB toxins, a minor pool reaches the cytosol by translocating from endosomes, whereas the rest is routed to lysosomes for degradation. Here we demonstrate that part of endocytosed AIP56 is recycled back and released extracellularly through a mechanism requiring phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity but independent of endosome acidification. So far, we have been unable to detect biological activity of recycled AIP56, thereby bringing into question its biological relevance as well as the importance of the recycling pathway.

AB  - Insecticidal Bt crops and seed treatments represent additional pest management tools for growers, prompting ecological studies comparing their impact on farm system inputs and effects to nontarget organisms compared with conventional practices. Using high taxonomic and temporal resolution, we contrast the dominance structure of carabids and dynamics of the most abundant species in maize (both sweet and field corn) agroecosystems using pest management tactics determined by the purchase of seed and application of pyrethroid insecticides. In the seed-based treatments, sweet corn contained Cry1Ab/c proteins, whereas field corn contained the coupled technology of Cry3Bb1 proteins for control of corn rootworm and neonicotinoid seed treatments aimed at secondary soil-borne pests. The insecticide treatments involved foliar pyrethroids in sweet corn and at-planting pyrethroids in field corn. The carabid community, comprised of 49 species, was dominated by four species, Scarites quadriceps Chaudoir, Poecilus chalcites Say, Pterostichus melanarius Illiger, and Harpalus pensylvanicus DeGeer, that each occupied a distinct temporal niche during the growing season. Two species, Pt. melanarius and H. pensylvanicus, exhibited differences between treatments over time. Only H. pensylvanicus had consistent results in both),cars, in which activity densities in field corn were significantly higher in the control in July and/or August. These results, along with laboratory bioassays, led Lis to hypothesize that lower adult captures resulted from decrease in prey availability or exposure of H. pensylvanicus larvae to soil-directed insecticides-either the neonicotinoid seed treatment in the transgenic field corn or an at-planting soil insecticide in the conventional field corn.

AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are of great environmental concern due to the exponential increase of the concentrations in the environment, especially in high trophic level organisms, and the trophodynamics of these chemicals in aquatic food webs is an important criterion for assessing their ecological risk. This study analyzed 13 PBDEs in the zooplankton, five invertebrate species, six fish species, and one marine bird species collected from Bohai Bay. PBDE concentrations in organisms from Bohai Bay (Sigma PBDEs: 0.15-32.8 ng/g lipid weight) were low compared with other marine organisms worldwide, and BDE-47 was the predominant compound in most samples, followed by BDE-28, BDE-99/BDE-100, and BDE-119. Correlation between lipid-normalized concentrations of PBDEs, and trophic levels determined by stable nitrogen isotope technologies confirmed that PBDEs were biomagnified in the marine food web, Significantly positive relationships were found for total PBDEs and four PBDE compounds (BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-100, and BDE-1 19), and their trophic magnification factors (TMFs) were 3.53, 3.57, 7.24, 3.23, and 2.60, respectively. The concentration ratios between congeners (BDE-99/BDE-100 and BDE-99/BDE-47) were found to decrease with increasing trophic levels, suggesting that trophic-level-dependent concentrations ratios between BDE-99 and BDE-100 would be contributed by trophic level-dependent biotransformation between BDE-99 and BDE-47, and therefore resulting in the dominance of BDE-100 compared with BDE-99 and the relatively high trophic magnification of BDE-47 in the marine food web.

AB  - The increase in public concern regarding food hazards and decline in public trust in food risk regulators suggests that then is a need to identify the actual concerns held by the public regarding specific food hazards in order to develop effective risk communication. In this paper we report the findings of semi-structured interviews, using the laddering technique, that aimed to identify the concerns held by the public with regard to five specific food hazards (BSE, genetic modification of food, high fat diets, pesticide residues in food and Salmonella food poisoning). It was found that most of the identified characteristics and concerns were unique to specific food hazards, though some were shared. The findings were supported in a validation study using a more representative sample of the public. The discussion argues that risk messages addressing these specific concerns will be more relevant to the public than general messages, which may lead to more effective risk communication.

AB  - Scientific study of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSTs) started in the early XXth century. In the 1920s it was understood the link between the toxicity observed in mussels with certain microalgae species. The poison was eventually purified from the clam Saxidomus giganteus, taking its name from it: saxitoxin (STX). Along the 1970s and 1980s it was understood that other STX analogues existed, both in dinoflagellates and bivalves. These were grouped into three major occurring families: the carbamate, N-sulfocarbamoyl and decarbamoyl, depending on the variation of the side chain of the tetrahydropurine core. The deoxydecarbamoyl family was additionally recognised in the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum. Chemical research into these STX analogues was conducted worldwide during the 1990s mainly by HPLC with pre- or post-column oxidation and fluorescence detection. Implementation of fluorescence detection with spectral capabilities and mass spectrometry detection during the 2000s led to the recognition of new analogues. Metabolites originated by single or double hydroxylation at C11 position were found in mussels, and later suspected in other bivalves. Designated M1-M4, these present very low fluorescence, and can only be studied resorting to HILIC-MS. Three hydroxybenzoate analogues were characterised as an important toxin fraction of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum, and named GC1-GC3. Later, many more analogues were suspected: the corresponding N1-hydroxyl variants of GC1-GC3 (GC4-GC6), di-hydroxybenzoate variants (GC1a-GC6a), and sulphate-benzoate variants (GC1b-GC6b). In bivalves, carbamoylase activity renders these analogues into decarbamoyl analogues. Other compounds with PST-like characteristics have been detected in bivalves from Angola, Argentina and Vietnam. Today, the range of naturally occurring STX derivatives, both in marine and freshwater environments, accounts to more than fifty structural variants. This poses a problem for carrying out food safety analysis based solely in chemical methods. Fortunately, most modifications to the side chain of the tetrahydropurine core result in diminished toxicity.

AB  - High resistance to benzimidazole fungicides in Venturia carpophila is caused by the point mutation E198K of the beta-tubulin (TUB2) gene. Traditional methods for detection of fungicide resistance are time-consuming, which are routinely based on tedious operation, reliance on expensive equipment, and specially trained people. Therefore, it is important to establish efficient methods for field detection of benzimidazole resistance in V. carpophila to make suitable management strategies and ensure food safety. Based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with CRISPR/Cas12a, a rapid one-pot assay ORCas12a-BRVc (one-pot RPA-CRISPR/Cas12 platform) was established for the detection of benzimidazole resistance in V. carpophila. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay enabled one-pot detection by adding components at the bottom and wall of the tube separately, solving the problems of aerosol contamination and decreased sensitivity caused by competing DNA substrates between Cas12a cleavage and RPA amplification. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay could accomplish the detection with a minimum of 7.82 x 10(3) fg mu L-1 V. carpophila genomic DNA in 45 min at 37 degrees C. Meanwhile, this assay showed excellent specificity due to the specific recognition ability of the Cas12a-crRNA complex. Further, we combined a method that could rapidly extract DNA from V. carpophila within 2 min with the ORCas12a-BRVc to achieve more rapid and simple detection of V. carpophila with benzimidazole resistance in fields. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay has the advantages of simplicity, rapidity, high sensitivity, high specificity, and ease of operation without the need for precision instruments and the need to isolate and culture pathogens. This assay is the first application of the one-pot platform based on the combination of RPA and CRISPR/Cas12a in fungicide resistance detection and can be used for monitoring of resistant populations in fields, providing guidance on making suitable management strategies for peach scab.

AB  - Cobia culture is hindered by bacterial infection (Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida) and in order to study the effect of P. damselae subsp. piscicida challenge and CpG ODN stimulation on cobia Toll like receptor 9 (RCTLR9), we used PCR to clone RCTLR9 gene and qRT-PCR to quantify gene expression. The results indicated that RCTLR9 cDNA contains 3141 bp. It encodes 1047 amino acids containing 16 typical structures of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) including an LRRTYP, LRRCT and a motif involved in PAMP binding was identified at position 240-253 amino acid. Broad expression of RCTLR9 was found in larval, juvenile and adult stages irrespective of the tissues. In larval stage, RCTLR9 mRNA expression decreased at 5 d and then increased at 10 dph. At juvenile stage cobia, the expression was significantly high (p < 0.05) in spleen and intestine compared to gill, kidney, liver and skin. However, at adult stage, the significant high expression was found in gill and intestine. Cobia challenged with P. damselae subsp. piscicida showed significant increase in RCTLR9 expression at 24 h post challenge in intestine, spleen and liver, while in kidney the expression was peak at 12 h and later it decreased at 24 h. The highest expression was 40 fold increase in spleen and the lowest expression was similar to 3.6 fold increase in liver. Cobia stimulated with CpG oligonucleotides showed that the induction of these genes was CpG ODN type and time dependent. In spleen and liver, CpG ODNs 1668 and 2006 injected group showed high expression of RCTLR9, IL-1 beta, chemokine CC compared to other groups. Meanwhile, CpG ODN 2006 has induced high expression of IgM. The CpG ODNs 2395 have induced significant high expression of Mx in spleen and liver. These results demonstrates the potential of using CpG ODN to enhance cobia resistance to P. damselae subsp. piscicida infection and use as an adjuvant in vaccine development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Acid/base modifiers are sometimes used as additives in normal phase elution on columns packed with CHIRALPAK (R) AD (R). They affect enantioseparations in ways that are not understood for the lack of systematic studies, which makes the scale-up of preparative separations difficult to predict. Once a column has been exposed to these modifiers, the selectivity of certain pairs of enantiomers may change, for the better or the worse. Numerous molecules that are affected by this phenomenon are listed in the literature. We selected five of them, the selectivity of which changes as more acidic or basic solutions are percolated through the column. The selectivity of ketoprofen, 4-chlorophenylalanine methyl and ethyl esters improves as a solution of Ethanesulfonic Acid is percolated through the column. The selectivity of Propranolol HCl and Trdger's base increases as a solution of diisopropylamine is percolated through the column. Each one of these five compounds is inversely affected by the percolation of the opposite acid/base solution. We used trans-Stilbene Oxide (tso) as a "standard" to determine the columns stability because no Memory Effect is observed for it (its retention, enantioselectivity, and resolution remain constant). Karl Fisher titrations showed that only slight changes in the water content of the mobile phase occurred, and that a unique water to polymer moiety ratio is important. Analytical studies of the stationary phase suggest that slow protonation/deprotonation of water attached to the carbamate moiety may be responsible for the acid/base Memory Effect. Finally, we showed that the Memory Effect can be minimized by percolating through the column a sufficiently concentrated solution of the appropriate acid or base. Thus, columns that were unreliable for method development, due to the Memory Effect, can now be used. As a result, the need to store several CHIRALPAK AD columns, specific for each condition of the Memory Effect, is eliminated. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the investigation was to study the flora of grasslands within the Zachodniowolynska Dolina Bugu Special Area of Conservation and to identify the types of habitats with the highest concentration of grassland species. In the years 2011-2012, floristic analyses covered the slopes of the valley of the Bug river, balks and places of shallow bedrock deposition, roadsides, as well as railway and earthwork sites. One hundred and fifty eight plant species belonging to 37 families were found. Though considered extinct in Polish flora, Dianthus collinus subsp. glabriusculus was discovered. Close to half of the recorded species (47%) were grassland taxa and 15% rare and/or protected plants, which make the studied area particularly valuable for the conservation of biodiversity. The fewest grassland plants occurred on habitats that are under the influence of agriculture, where the dominance of nitrophilous and herbicide resistant plant species was observed.

AB  - Triazoxide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triazoxide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 25 June 2007. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and to the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprises seed treatment in barley against several agriculturally important diseases. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached endpoints. The specification for the technical material as a whole should currently be regarded as provisional (September 2008).
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Raxil S FS 040", a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) containing 20 g/L triazoxide and 20 g/L tebuconazole.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant and animal origin, soil and water, however for air, a method validated to LOQ of 0.6 mu g a.s./m(3) is required.
   With regard to its toxicological properties, triazoxide was rapidly and extensively absorbed but only partly bioavailable (50%) to the target organ (blood system) due to its biokinetic properties. After single exposure, it was shown to be toxic after oral or inhalative administration, but was not irritant or skin sensitizer. Consequently, the proposed classification for acute toxicity was T, R23/25 Toxic by inhalation and if swallowed.
   After repeated oral or inhalative administration, the critical effect was the induction of haemolytic anaemia, with secondary effects in the spleen, liver and kidneys. The possible classification with Xn; R48/22 or T; R48/25 (Harmful or Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed) could not be agreed by the experts, but the classification T, R48/23 Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure through inhalation was proposed. Triazoxide did not show any genotoxic or carcinogenic properties in the available studies. No specific adverse effects on fertility were observed in the multi-generation rat study, but the classification R64 May cause harm to breastfed babies was proposed based on reduced pup survival during lactation, that could be expected to result from the presence of triazoxide in milk. No developmental toxicity or teratogenic activity was observed in rats and rabbits.
   The agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI) was 0.00005 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year rat study and using a safety factor of 100, increased by an additional safety factor of 10. This was justified by the use of a lowest observed adverse effect level, the shallow dose-response in the study and the absence of mechanistic information. The agreed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.001 mg/kg bw/ day based on the 90-day rat study, using a safety factor of 100 and a correction for bioavailability (50%). The agreed acute reference dose (ARfD) was 0.015 mg/kg bw based on the 4-week rat study and applying a safety factor of 100.
   The agreed dermal absorption values to be used in the risk assessment were 2.4% for the concentrate and 2% for the contaminated grain dust. The operator exposure estimate during the seed treatment was above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but realistic field studies showed an exposure level up to 21% of the AOEL. Similarly, the exposure estimates for the worker loading and sowing treated seed was above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but below the AOEL with a field study (26%).
   With regard to consumer exposure assessment, the nature and magnitude of residues in plant and animal commodities could not be sufficiently clarified by the submitted data on triazoxide applied as a seed treatment to barley.
   Taking into account the toxicological profile of triazoxide and its metabolites, the meeting of experts in residues agreed on data gaps with regard to the nature of residues in the plant. No final residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment could therefore be agreed. In the submitted residue trials no residues of triazoxide were found above the LOQ of 0.05 mg/kg in grain and straw. However, it was agreed that the analytical method used in these trials was not validated at a sufficiently low LOQ to ensure that an exceedance of the ADI could be definitively excluded, and therefore new trials with a lower LOQ were required. Assuming residues of triazoxide were present in barley grain at the LOQ level of 0.05 mg/kg, the ADI was exceeded for one Member State diet in the EFSA PRAPeR model. The potential for residues being present in food of animal origin due to carry-over from treated straw has not been addressed, since no data on livestock was submitted due to residues being below the LOQ of 0.05 mg/kg in grain and straw in residue trials. However, given the very low ADI of triazoxide and its metabolites, and given the presence of total residues of 0.04 mg/kg in straw, the experts had concerns that transfer of toxicologically relevant residues from straw into livestock matrices may occur, even though at very low levels. An indicative exposure assessment, using the default residue value of 0.01 mg/kg for milk, showed that the ADI would be significantly exceeded for a number of European national and regional diets, and therefore further consideration of the issue of residues in animal products is required.
   No concerns were identified with regard to residues in rotational crops, provided rotated cereals will be addressed with the required new data for the primary cereal crop.
   In conclusion, the available metabolism and residue data are not considered appropriate to conduct a robust consumer exposure and risk assessment due to the uncertainties identified with regard to the nature of residues in plant commodities, and with regard to possible transfer of residues in animal products, and the need for a lower LOQ of the analytical method for the relevant analytes in studies on the magnitude of residues.
   Triazoxide may be considered to be high to very high persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DT50 (lab (biphasic kinetic, overall)) = 208 - 278 days). Degradation of triazoxide proceeds either through reduction to desoxy-triazoxide (M01)(2), or through production of triazoxide-amine (M02)(3). Assessment based on the decline from the peak observed indicate that M01 was moderate persistent in soil (DissT(50) (lab) = 32.4 - 56.7 days), and M02 could be considered high to very high persistent (decline M02 DissT(50 field) = 239 - 447 days; excluding UK field trial where no decline is observed). A kinetic assessment of laboratory data allowed the applicant to derive kinetic half-lives for M01, that are associated with a formation fraction of 1. Unextracted residues amounted up to a maximum of 29.8 % AR after 120 days (end of the study). Mineralization was practically negligible in the four soils tested.
   Photolysis slightly enhances degradation of triazoxide in soil, but it is not expected to contribute significantly to its environmental dissipation.
   Field studies are available, with some of them including measurements of the soil metabolites. Kinetic analysis of the field data presented by the applicant was discussed by the meeting of experts. The kinetic analysis was not fully accepted, and the need of considering formation fractions of 1 for further modelling based on this analysis was agreed. Analysis of the data based on the decline of M02 has been performed by the RMS, and the resulting half-lives (decline M02 DissT(50) (field) = 239 - 447 days; excluding UK field trial where no decline is observed) may be used in conjunction with the maximum observed of 18.7 % for exposure risk assessment. PECs soil presented in the DAR were calculated by the RMS for triazoxide and its soil major metabolites following standard procedures. Updated PECs soil with parameters agreed by the meeting of experts are reported in addendum 2 and do not result in a change of the risk assessment already performed.
   According to the available studies, triazoxide may be considered as low to medium mobile in soil (K-foc = 245 - 1743 mL/g), desoxy-triazoxide (M01) may be considered slightly mobile (K-foc = 2053 4148 mL/g), and triazoxide-amine (M02) may be considered low to medium mobile (K-foc = 385.6 - 1709.0 mL/g). The RMS noted the narrow range of pH and the ionisable character of the metabolite triazoxide-amine (M02). Whereas a large margin of safety is considered to exist for the representative use proposed, further data could be needed if other uses at significant higher application rates are applied for in the future.
   Triazoxide was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, practically stable at pH 7, and readily hydrolysed at pH 9 (DT50 = 6.6 days). The main hydrolysis metabolite was triazoxide-oxone (M04)(4). Triazoxide is rapidly photolysed in water (DT50 = 24.4 hours equivalent to 3.5 natural solar days at 33 degrees N). An additional study indicates that photolysis half-life of triazoxide in water is expected to range from 1.7 to 9.7 days depending on the season and the latitude (30 - 50 degrees N).
   No ready biodegradability study is available, and therefore triazoxide is considered not readily biodegradable.
   In aquatic water / sediment systems, triazoxide dissipated rapidly from water to sediment phase, and broke down to form the metabolites M01 and triazoxide-desoxyamino (M05)(5). Unextractable residues in the sediment amounted up to 55.7 % AR in the sediment after 91 days). Mineralization was negligible in both systems. The limited sampling regime of these experiments prevents the calculation of reliable kinetic parameters. However, a simple non-linear kinetic analysis was presented by the applicant to derive dissipation and degradation rates of triazoxide and desoxy-triazoxide in the water sediment systems. This kinetic analysis was only partially validated by the RMS (only whole system results for the Lienden system were confirmed). For the IJzendoorn system, no reliable whole system half-lives for the parent compound and M01 were obtained due to poor fit. Worst-case whole system half-lives of 4.3 days and 323 days were estimated for triazoxide and triazoxide-desoxy, respectively, based on results of Lienden system.
   Input parameters to be used for FOCUS PECSW were discussed and agreed in the meeting of experts. After the meeting, the RMS has presented an addendum with new FOCUS SW (Step 1 and Step 2) for metabolite M01 and M02 following the approach agreed by the meeting. However, the new PECs calculated do not alter the outcome of the risk assessment already presented by the RMS in the DAR. Three different approaches based on FOCUS GW to calculate PEC GW were presented in the DAR. The meeting of experts agreed on the approach presented under B.8.6.d for the parent compound, but disagreed with the formation fractions assumed for metabolites M01 and M02, for which a formation fraction of 1 had to be used. After the meeting the RMS presented a new groundwater assessment based on FOCUS PEARL v.3.3.3, and the input parameters agreed by the meeting of experts. Neither the parent compound, nor its major soil metabolites (M01 and M02) exceeded the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L when the EU representative use (cereals seed treatment, 6 g a.s./ha) is simulated. However, due to the low ADI determined for this substance, 10% of the ADI would be reached for adults, toddlers and bottle fed infants, if residue levels of 0.05 mu g/L, 0.017 mu g/L and 0.011 mu g/L, respectively, of each component (triazoxide, M01 and M02) were present in the water. These levels were not exceeded in any of the scenarios simulated for the representative use in cereal seeds. Nevertheless, reliability and predictive capacity of FOCUS GW models is expected to be lower in this low range of concentrations. Triazoxide is not expected to significantly volatilize or to be subject to long range transport in air.
   The first-tier short-term TER values for granivorous birds were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating a low risk. The margin of safety (TER=23.5) was considered to cover the uncertainty related to the derivation of a short-term toxicity endpoint, due to food avoidance (endpoint based on consumption in group where there was 30% mortality). Further refinements were required to address the acute and long-term risk to birds. Based on Yellowhammer as focal species, the acute TER value was calculated to be 9.1. Yellowhammer would have to consume 159 (including a 10-fold uncertainty factor) seeds on an acute time scale to breach the Annex VI trigger. This number of seeds would cover approximately 3.45 m(2) of a field, and the number of seeds would cover 90% of the daily food requirement of a Yellowhammer. Furthermore, worst case field studies indicated that Yellowhammer could consume 1/3 of the critical number of seeds in one feeding event. Given these facts, in addition to the indication of food avoidance behaviour detected in the short-term dietary study, it was concluded that the risk to granivorous birds from consumption of treated seeds could be considered to be low on an acute time scale. The conclusion was supported by an additional assessment for a fast feeding granivorous bird, like the woodpigeon. In order to reach the LD50, woodpigeons would have to consume 2940 seeds (includes a 10-fold uncertainty factor). A long-term risk assessment on reproductive birds was considered relevant for the spring use of triazoxide as seed treatment (the autumn use may also be reproductively relevant for birds in some southern Member States). A refined long-term TER of 2.23 was calculated based on residue decline data for triazoxide in barley seed on soil surface. Further refinements were needed to address the long-term risk to granivorous birds from spring use.
   The tier 1 acute risk assessment for granivorous mammals was found to be low. Further refinements were required to identify a low long-term risk to granivorous mammals. Refinements were based on wood mouse as focal species and on use of measured residue data (see birds above), resulting in a TER value of 0.64. Further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to granivorous mammals. Risk assessment of secondary poisoning and consumption of contaminated drinking water was considered not relevant.
   Triazoxide is proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute risk to aquatic organisms was assessed to be low. Further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to fish. The risk to sediment-dwellers from the metabolite M01, M02 and M05 was assessed as low.
   The acute risk to earthworms was considered to be low. The long-term risk to earthworms needs further refinements to fully address the potential toxicity of residues in the soil matrix. As for other soil non-target macro-organisms, the risk to springtails was low for all potential soil residues, but it still remains to address the potential risk to soil litter degrading processes from triazoxide and the soil metabolites M01 and M02.
   The risk to bees and non-target arthropods was assessed to be low, as was the risk to soil non-target micro-organisms, biological methods of sewage treatment and non-target plants.

AB  - Triazoxide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triazoxide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 25 June 2007. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR to the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG, and on 5 November 2007 to the Member States for consultation. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 30 September 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 193).
   Following the Commission Decision of 30 November 2009 (2009/860/ EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of triazoxide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Bayer CropScience AG made a resubmission application for the inclusion of triazoxide in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/216/08 - rev. 0) as follows:
   the information available was insufficient to satisfy the requirements set out in Annex II and Annex III of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to:
   the available metabolism and residue data were not considered appropriate to conduct a robust consumer risk assessment due to the uncertainties identified with regard to the nature of residues in plant commodities and the possible transfer of residues in animal products
   the long-term risk for granivorous bird
   the long-term risk for granivorous mammals
   the long-term risk to fish
   the long-term risk to earthworms
   and concerns were identified with regard to:
   the consumer exposure
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the United Kingdom, being the designated RMS in the resubmission procedure, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 10 June 2010.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 16 June 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 30 July 2010.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focussed peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on triazoxide.
   The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide as proposed by the applicant, which comprise seed treatment in barley against several agriculturally important diseases. The conclusions of the resubmission were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   Data gaps were identified in the section on identity and analytical methods. The specification for the technical material should currently be regarded as provisional.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Raxil S FS 040', a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS), containing 20 g/L triazoxide and 20 g/L tebuconazole.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant origin, soil and water, however for air a method validated to a LOQ of 0.3 mu g a.s./m(3) was identified as a data gap.
   With regard to its toxicological properties, triazoxide was rapidly and extensively absorbed, but only partly bioavailable (50 %) to the target organ (blood system) due to its biokinetic properties. After single exposure it was shown to be toxic after oral or inhalative administration, but was not irritant or skin sensitizer. Consequently, the proposed classification for acute toxicity was T, R23/25 'Toxic by inhalation and if swallowed'.
   After repeated oral or inhalative administration, the critical effect was the induction of haemolytic anaemia, with secondary effects in the spleen, liver, kidneys and bone marrow. The possible classification with Xn; R48/22 or T; R48/25 ('Harmful or Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed') could not be agreed by the experts, but the classification T, R48/23 'Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure through inhalation' was proposed. Triazoxide did not show genotoxic or carcinogenic properties in the available studies.
   No specific adverse effects on fertility were observed in the multi-generation rat study, but the classification R64 'May cause harm to breastfed babies' was proposed based on reduced pup survival during lactation that could be expected to result from the presence of triazoxide in milk. No developmental toxicity or teratogenic activity was observed in rats or rabbits.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 2-year rat study and using a safety factor of 100, increased by an additional safety factor of 3. This was justified by the use of a lowest observed adverse effect level, the steep dose-response in the study and the absence of mechanistic information. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 90-day rat study, using a safety factor of 100 and a correction for bioavailability (50 %). The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.015 mg/kg bw, based on the 4-week rat study and applying a safety factor of 100.
   The dermal absorption values to be used in the risk assessment are 2.4 % for the concentrate and 2 % for the contaminated grain dust. The operator exposure estimates during the seed treatment are above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but realistic field studies show an exposure level up to 21 % of the AOEL with the use of coverall and gloves. Similarly, the exposure estimates for the worker loading and sowing treated seed are above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but below the AOEL considering a field study (26 %), with the use of long-sleeved shirt and long trousers. Bystander exposure is not expected to exceed the exposure of workers involved in loading/sowing treated seed (i.e. 26 % of the AOEL).
   Based on the new metabolism study conducted on barley with seeds treated at dose rates of 3 and 30 g a.s./100 kg seeds (N and 10N studies when compared to the critical GAP), the residue was defined as triazoxide alone for monitoring and as sum of triazoxide, desoxy-triazoxide (M01) and triazoxideamino (M02) for risk assessment. A conversion factor of 6 was proposed for risk assessment derived from the metabolism study, taking into account the respective percentage at which each compound was detected in straw.
   A new residue data set was submitted where samples were analysed using an analytical method achieving a LOQ of 0.001 mg/kg, and the MRL for barley grain was proposed at the LOQ value. Such an unusually low value was proposed, given the low ADI agreed for the parent compound. The residue data are supported by the storage stability study showing triazoxide residues to be stable up to 2 years when stored frozen at -18 degrees C. Processing studies were not submitted and are not required. The available data are sufficient to conclude that significant residues are not expected to be present in rotational crops.
   Estimated intakes by animals were calculated to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM. A goat metabolism study was however provided in order to confirm that transfer of residues in animal matrices is not expected at levels that could be of concern for the consumers. Since the total radioactive residues (TRRs) in goat matrices were shown to be below 0.0005 mg/kg when expressed on a 1N rate basis, the setting of a residue definition and proposing MRLs for animal matrices were considered not necessary.
   No chronic or acute risks were identified for the consumers, with the TMDI being less that 4 % of the ADI and the IESTI less that 0.1 % of the ARfD when calculations are performed using the EFSA PRIMo model, the proposed MRL of 0.001 mg/kg for barley, and the conversion factor of 6.
   Triazoxide may be considered to be highly to very highly persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DT50 (lab) ((biphasic kinetic, overall)) = 208 - 278 days). The degradation of triazoxide proceeds either through reduction to M01, or through production of M02. The assessment based on the decline from the peak observed indicated that metabolite M01 was moderately persistent in soil (DissT(50) (lab) = 32.4 - 56.7 days), and metabolite M02 could be considered highly persistent (decline M02 DissT(50 field) = 239 - 313 days; excluding the UK field trial where no decline is observed).
   Unextracted residues amounted to a maximum of 29.8 % AR after 120 days (end of the study). Mineralization was practically negligible in the four soils tested.
   Photolysis slightly enhances degradation of triazoxide in soil, but it is not expected to contribute significantly to its environmental dissipation.
   According to the available studies, triazoxide may be considered as low to medium mobile in soil (K-foc = 245 - 1743 mL / g), metabolite M01 may be considered slightly mobile (K-foc = 2053 - 4148 mL / g), and metabolite M02 may be considered low to medium mobile (K-foc = 385.6 - 1709.0 mL / g). The narrow range of pH and the ionisable character of the metabolite M02 were noted. Whereas a large margin of safety is considered to exist for the representative use, further data could be needed if other uses at significantly higher application rates are applied for in the future.
   Triazoxide was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, practically stable at pH 7, and readily hydrolysed at pH 9 (DT50 = 6.6 days). The main hydrolysis metabolite was M04. Triazoxide is rapidly photolysed in water (DT50 = 24.4 hours equivalent to 3.5 natural solar days at 33 degrees N). An additional study indicated that the photolysis half-life of triazoxide in water is expected to range from 1.7 to 9.7 days, depending on the season and the latitude (30 - 50 degrees N).
   No ready biodegradability study is available and therefore triazoxide is considered not readily biodegradable.
   In aquatic water / sediment systems, triazoxide dissipated rapidly from water to sediment phase, and broke down to form the metabolites M01 and M05. Unextractable residues in the sediment amounted up to 55.7 % AR in the sediment after 91 days). Mineralization was negligible in both systems. The limited sampling regime of these experiments prevents the calculation of reliable kinetic parameters. However, a simple non-linear kinetic analysis was presented by the applicant to derive dissipation and degradation rates of triazoxide and metabolite M01 in the water sediment systems. This kinetic analysis was only partially validated (only whole system results for the Lienden system were confirmed). For the IJzendoorn system, no reliable whole system half-lives for the parent compound and metabolite M01 were obtained due to poor fit. Worst-case whole system half-lives of 4.3 days and 323 days were estimated for triazoxide and metabolite M01, respectively, based on results of the Lienden system.
   The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments (Predicted environmental concentrations (PEC)) were carried out for triazoxide as well as the metabolites M01, M02 and M05 using the FOCUS step 1, step 2 and step 3 approach. For the metabolites M01 and M05 the available step 1 and step 2 values are relied on for the risk assessment. Detailed information about model parameterisation is provided in the list of end points in Appendix A.
   The necessary groundwater exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using FOCUS scenarios and the models PEARL 3.3.3 and PELMO 3.3.2 for the active substance triazoxide and the metabolites M01 and M02. To assess the risk associated with preferential transport through structured soils the Chateaudun scenarios were also simulated using the MACRO model. Detailed information about model parameterisation is provided in the list of end points in Appendix A. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses for these compounds above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations represented by all relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   Triazoxide is not expected to significantly volatilize or to be subject to long-range transport in air.
   The first-tier short-term TER values for granivorous birds were above the Annex VI trigger values, indicating a low risk. The margin of safety (TER=23.5) was considered to cover the uncertainty related to the derivation of a short-term toxicity end point, due to food avoidance (end point based on consumption in group where there was 30 % mortality). Further refinements were required to address the acute and long-term risk to birds. Based on yellowhammer as focal species, the acute TER value was calculated to be 9.1. Yellowhammer would have to consume 159 (including a 10-fold uncertainty factor) seeds on an acute time scale to breach the Annex VI trigger. This number of seeds would cover approximately 3.45 m(2) of a field, and the number of seeds would cover 90 % of the daily food requirement of a yellowhammer. Furthermore, worst-case field studies indicated that yellowhammer could consume 1/3 of the critical number of seeds in one feeding event. Given these facts, in addition to the indication of food avoidance behaviour detected in the short-term dietary study, it was concluded that the risk to granivorous birds from consumption of treated seeds could be considered to be low on an acute timescale. The conclusion was supported by an additional assessment for a fast-feeding granivorous bird like the woodpigeon. A long-term risk assessment on reproductive birds was considered relevant for the spring use of triazoxide as a seed treatment. A refined long-term TER of 2.23 was calculated based on residue decline data for triazoxide in barley seed on soil surface. Further refinements were needed to address the long-term risk to granivorous birds from the spring use. Following the initial risk assessment, further data and refinements were considered during the resubmission. Four species were identified as focal species (skylark, chaffinch, woodpigeon and yellowhammer) in the Additional Report. Further information was provided supporting the proportion of the food obtained in the treated area (PT) for each focal species as well as the proportion of food types obtained from the treated crop (PD). The refined TER values were above the Annex VI trigger values for all representative focal species, therefore the long-term risk to granivorous birds for both the use in autumn and spring sown barley was assessed as low.
   The tier 1 acute risk assessment for granivorous mammals was found to be low. Further refinements were required with regard to the long-term risk assessment for granivorous mammals. The refinements in the original review were based on wood mouse as focal species and on use of measured residue data, however they were considered as not satisfactory and further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to granivorous mammals. During the resubmission application further data were provided to refine the risk assessment. However, the higher tier risk assessment gave a TERlt below the Annex VI trigger value, indicating a potential high long-term risk. Therefore, the long-term risk assessment to granivorous mammals needs further refinements and a data gap remains. The issue has been indicated as a critical area of concern.
   Risk assessment of secondary poisoning and consumption of contaminated water was considered not relevant.
   Triazoxide is proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute and chronic risk to aquatic organisms was considered to be low. Furthermore, the risk to sediment-dwelling organisms from the metabolites M01, M02 and M05 was considered as low.
   The acute risk to earthworms was considered to be low. The long-term risk from triazoxide and the soil metabolites M01 and M02 to earthworms was considered as low. Concerning other soil non-target macro-organisms, the risk to springtails was considered low for all potential soil residues. In addition, the potential risk from triazoxide and its metabolites to soil litter degradation processes was assessed as low.
   The risk to bees and non-target arthropods was assessed to be low, as was the risk to soil non-target micro-organisms, biological methods of sewage treatment, and non-target plants.

AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production industry globally and is considered to have the greatest potential to meet the growing demand for seafood and being a solution to overfishing. Despite the benefits of aquaculture, the rapid growth and intensification of production (so-called conventional aquaculture) has raised concerns about food safety, fish welfare, and environmental and social issues stemming from a tragedy of the commons. These concerns need to be addressed to enable sustainable aquaculture development. While the negative environmental impacts of aquaculture have been evaluated using physical and chemical indicators, the social acceptance has not been fully considered when evaluating aquaculture sustainability. With this backdrop, our study investigates knowledge and beliefs towards shrimp aquaculture development among two key stakeholder groups in Vietnam: the public and producers (shrimp farmers). Our results show that stakeholders were concerned about the social and environmental impacts of conventional shrimp aquaculture, although the different stakeholder groups emphasized different aspects. The public believed biodiversity loss and the overuse of antibiotics and pesticides to be more problematic compared to producers, who believed water quality and disease outbreaks were the main problems facing the industry. Following on from this, most respondents perceived sustainable aquaculture production positively, implying social acceptability for its development. Awareness of and knowledge about sustainable aquaculture positively and significantly affected stakeholders' support for expansion, suggesting that communication and education may be effective tools for improving social acceptance of aquaculture.

AB  - Lambda-cyhalothrin (LC), a pyrethroid insecticide widely used in agriculture, causes immunotoxicity to aquatic organisms in the aquatic environment. Microalgal astaxanthin (MA) is a natural carotenoid that enhances viability of a variety of fish. To investigate the immunotoxicity of LC and the improvement effect of MA in lymphocytes (Cyprinus carpio), lymphocytes were treated with LC (80 M) and/or MA (50 M) for 24 h. Firstly, CCK8 combined with PI staining results showed that MA significantly attenuated the LC-induced lymphocyte death rate. Secondly, LC exposure resulted in excessively damaged mitochondrial and mtROS, diminished mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, which could be improved by MA. Thirdly, MA upregulated the levels of mitophagy-related regulatory factors (Beclin1, LC3, ATG5, Tom20 and Lamp2) induced by LC. Importantly, MA decreased the levels of pyroptosis-related genes treated with LC, including NLRP3, Cas-4, GSDMD and active Cas-1. Further study indicated that LC treatment caused excessive miRNA-194-5p and reduced levels of FoxO1, PINK1 and Parkin, which was inhibited by MA treatment. Overall, we concluded that MA could enhance damaged mitochondrial elimination by promoting the miRNA-194-5p-FoxO1-PINK1/Parkinmitophagy in lymphocytes, which reduced mtROS accumulation and alleviated pyroptosis. It offers insights into the importance of MA application in aquaculture as well as the defense of farmed fish against agrobiological hazards in fish under LC.

AB  - River ecosystems are exposed to a multitude of stressors, including increasing pesticide run-off driven by precipitation and irrigation. Pyrethroids are the fourth major group of insecticides in use worldwide and have extremely negative effects on aquatic fauna. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of an acute 2 h sub-lethal exposure to different levels of the pyrethroid esfenvalerate on the swimming behaviour of two Cypriniformes species: the native Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) and the non-native invasive bleak (Alburnus alburnus). The experimental set-up consisted of previous exposure to three esfenvalerate concentrations (control, 1.2 (low), and 2.0 (high) & mu;g/L) before being stocked in a three-artificial-flume-channel mesocosm for behavioural trials through direct observation. Monitored behaviours included (i) routine activity, (ii) shoal cohesion, and iii) boldness. Significant differences in fish behaviour were detected for the native species (barbel), as individuals spent significantly more time holding position (i.e., resting) in the control (44.9%) than in the high esfenvalerate concentration (25.2%). Concordantly, control barbels were also found to perform more directional changes than the ones exposed to high esfenvalerate concentrations. Behavioural changes were also found for boldness, measured by the proportion of fish attempts to negotiate the upstream ramp, which were significantly higher in the control (37.4%) and in the high concentration (41.5%) compared to the low one (21.1%). Finally, regarding shoal cohesion of the barbel, it was tighter in the control (81.3%) than in the low- (70.5%) and high- (71.1%) esfenvalerate treatments. For the invasive bleak, there were no significant differences in any of the behavioural traits upon previous exposure to an increasing esfenvalerate concentration. This experimental study demonstrated that even short-term exposure to the pyrethroid esfenvalerate was sufficient to alter the behaviour of a native Cypriniformes fish species while not affecting the non-native species. This may confer greater competitive advantages to non-native fish species in the context of global changes.

AB  - When the production or use of a product imposes a cost or benefit on a third party, this is referred to as an externality. Externalities of pesticides are associated with social and environmental costs. However, there is still a lack of a systematic method for evaluating and internalizing the externalities of pesticides. This study utilizes the pesticide's environmental impact quotient and environmental accounting methods to assess the external costs associated with pesticide usage in the winter-wheat-summer-maize cropping system in China's northern plains, with a specific focus on the pesticide use in Botou City during the year 2020 as a case study. Additionally, we introduce the concept of the net external value of pesticides and propose a methodology for its internalization, aiming to quantify the external costs induced by pesticide usage and explore the possibility of integrating them into market transactions. The results showed that the total external costs of pesticide use are 423.9 USD ha(-1), with a positive external value of 171.9 USD ha(-1) and a net external value of -252.0 USD ha(-1). The negative external costs associated with pesticide use outweigh the positive external values. External costs varied significantly according to environmental receptors, after retaining two significant figures: applicators accounted for 45% of the total external costs, followed by pickers (32%), consumers (11%), groundwater (4.5%), fish (3.9%), beneficial insects (1.7%), birds (1.3%), and bees (1.1%). The external costs of maize cultivation were 33% higher than those of wheat cultivation. The application of herbicides resulted in the highest external costs compared with fungicides and insecticides. Based on the internalization of the results, imposing an ecological tax on pesticide users is recommended, with rates of 3.29% for wheat and 6.76% for maize. This research contributes to sustainable agricultural development by providing valuable insights for farmers in selecting environmentally friendly pesticides and informing the implementation of ecological taxes on pesticide usage.

AB  - The increase in pesticide use in response to agricultural demands poses a risk to non-target organisms, including fish. Integrated analysis of biochemical, histopathological and genetic parameters in fish exposed to Malathion insecticide provide information on the toxicity mechanisms of this pesticide, which is classified as a probable carcinogen for humans. The present study assessed the biological responses of Colossoma macropomum after exposure to Malathion. We started determining the lethal concentration, which is the concentration capable of killing 50% of the subjects in an acute toxicity test (LC50-96 h), which was 15.77 +/- 3.30 mgL(-1). The fish were, then, exposed to Malathion during 96 h at a sublethal concentration, 7.30 mgL(-1). Overall, we observed an increased activity of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes, which reduced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species after 96 h exposure, as well as kept constant the mitochondrial respiration, Acetylcholinesterase activity and DNA damage. However, fish exposed to insecticide presented severe gill histopathological damage and increased expression of proto-oncogene ras. Taken together, the results suggest that, after four days of exposure to the Malathion, C. macropomum efficiently activates its defense mechanisms, suggesting that the basal response mechanisms are responsive. On the other hand, histopathologic damages evidenced the adverse effects of Malathion on fish, since it promoted gill necrosis and increased the expression of ras oncogene that is directly related to tumorigenesis events.

AB  - The Arctic is subject to long-range atmospheric deposition of globally-distilled semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) that bioaccumulate and biomagnify in lipid-rich food webs. In addition, locally contaminated sites may also contribute SVOCs to the arctic environment. Specifically, Alaska has hundreds of formerly used defense (FUD) sites, many of which are co-located with Alaska Native villages in remote parts of the state. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent of SVOC contamination on Alaska's St. Lawrence Island through the analysis of sentinel fish, the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), collected from Troutman Lake located within the watershed of an FUD site and adjacent to the Yupik community of Gambell. We measured the concentrations of legacy and emerging SVOCs in 303 fish samples (81 composites), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organophosphate esters (OPEs) and their diester metabolites, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PBDEs and PCBs were the most abundant SVOC groups found in stickleback with Sigma PBDE and Sigma PCB median concentrations of 25.8 and 10.9 ng/g ww, respectively, followed by PFAS (median Sigma PFAS 7.22 ng/g ww). Sigma OPE and Sigma OPE metabolite concentrations were lower with median concentrations of 4.97 and 1.18 ng/g ww, respectively. Chemical patterns and distributions based on correlations and comparison with SVOC concentrations in stickleback from other parts of the island suggest strong local sources of PCBs, PBDEs, and PFAS on St. Lawrence Island.

AB  - In the present study, to assess the immunotoxicity of cypermethrin (CYP) in fish, Chinese rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mu g/L) of CYP for 28 d and subjected to pathogen challenge trials for 2 d. After 28 d of CYP exposure, the levels of Immunoglobulin M (IgM), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) after treatment with 1.5 mu g/L CYP. Moreover, an induction of inflammatory cytokine transcripts (tnfa, il-6, il-8, and il-12) was observed (p < 0.05) after treatment with 1.5 mu g/L CYP. After challenge with Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens), plasma lysozyme (LYS) activity at 24 and 48 hours post-injection (hpi) was significantly decreased in the 0.5 and 1.5 mu g/L CYP treatment groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, liver Complement component 3 (C3) and CRP contents at 24 hpi were significantly decreased in the 1.5 CYP treatment group (p <0.05), whereas significant decreases in liver C3 and IgM contents were observed at 48 hpi (p < 0.05). Inhibition of expression of Toll-like receptor-nuclear factor kappa B (TLR-NF-kappa B) signaling pathway-related genes was observed in the CYP treatment groups and resulted in significant down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines (il-1 beta and il-12) in the 1.5 mu g/L CYP treatment group at 48 hpi (p <0.05). Interestingly, the mortality in the 0.5 and 1.5 mu g/L CYP treatments was significantly increased at 48 hpi (p < 0.05). These results indicated that environmentally relevant concentrations of CYP suppressed the Chinese rare minnow immune system and reduced immune defense against bacterial infection, thereby causing subsequent mortality. Meanwhile, our results demonstrated that a subsequent host resistance challenge is an effective method for determining the immunotoxicity of chemicals (e.g., CYP). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Copper sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4.5H(2)O) is commonly used as a general biocide in the agricultural fields surrounding freshwater reservoirs. So the aim of the present study was to investigate the toxic effects of CuSO4.5H(2)O by examining oxidative damage markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA) for lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant enzymatic defense system components (glutathione reductase (GR), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT)) in freshwater fish Capoeta umbla (Heckel, 1843) liver, kidney and gill. In this purpose, the 96 h LC50 values (with 95% confidence limits) of CuSO4.5H(2)O for C. umbla was estimated as a 1.478 mg/L. Three different CuSO4.5H(2)O sublethal doses (0.185, 0.370 and 0.739 mg/L) were administered to C. umbla at different time intervals (12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h). Antioxidant enzyme activities and MDA levels were measured spectrophotometrically. Liver, kidney and gills samples were collected at the end of the experiment, and analysed for their oxidant-antioxidant status, including MDA level, GR, G6PD, SOD, CAT and GPx activities. Results obtained showed that CuSO4.5H(2)O, significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the GR, G6PD and GPx activities, but increased (P < 0.05) the CAT, SOD activities and MDA levels of C. umbla liver, kidney and gill tissue in a dose-dependent manner. However, CuSO4.5H(2)O exposure did not cause to changes significantly (P < 0.05) in enzyme activities and MDA levels of C. umbla liver, kidney and gill tissue in a time-dependent manner.

AB  - Lufenuron is a benzoylurea insecticide that interfere in chitin synthesis in insects. Although lufenuron is widely used in agriculture and aquaculture, rare are studies described that relates to possible toxic effects in fish. This work aimed to evaluate acute and chronic toxic effects of benzoylurea pesticide (lufenuron) on biological parameters of Colossoma macropomum (Tambaqui). In the acute test, juveniles of Tambaqui were divided into control group and five experimental groups with exposure from 0.1 to 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron for 96 h. Animals were also submitted to chronic toxicity test for four months in concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/L of lufenuron, the concentration used in the treatment of ectoparasites in fish and 50% of LC50 96 h, respectively. The presence of hemorrhages was observed in eyes, fins and operculum of fish exposed to 0.7 and 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron. Histological analysis showed changes in the morphology of fish gills submitted to acute toxicity test, as lamellar aneurysm and blood congestion inside lamellae. Lufenuron promoted damage in fish retina as in ability to respond to stimuli in photo-receptors and in ON-bipolar cells in acute test. In chronic test, blood glucose analysis and morphometric parameters showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). In general, Tambaqui exhibited behaviors associated with stress when exposed to lufenuron. Thus, lufenuron showed several toxic effects in relation to biological parameters in Tambaqui.

AB  - Chlordecone is a persistent organochlorine pesticide widely used between 1972 and 1993 in the French West Indies to control the root borer in banana fields. Chlordecone use resulted in long-term pollution of soils, contamination of waters, of aquatic organisms, and of fields. Chlordecone is known to be neurotoxic, to increase prostate cancer, and to have negative effects on cognitive and motor development during infancy. In Guadeloupe, most of the freshwater species living in contaminated rivers exceed the French legal limit of 20 mu g center dot kg(-1) wet weight. In the present study, we chose a transcriptomic approach to study the cellular effects of chlordecone in the giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii, an important economical species in Guadeloupe. Quantitative PCR revealed an induction of genes involved in defense mechanism against oxidative stress (catalase and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase) in prawns exposed to low environmental concentrations of chlordecone after 12 and 24 h of exposure. In prawns reared in a contaminated farm, transcription of genes involved in the biotransformation process (cytochrome P450 and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)) were induced after 8 days of exposure. Our results provide information on the mechanims of defense induced by chlordecone in aquatic crustacean species. This gene expression study of selected genes should be further strengthened by proteomic analyses and enzymatic activity assays to confirm the response of these biomarkers of stress in crustaceans and to give new insights into the mechanism of toxicity by chlordecone.

AB  - The study investigated the capacity of diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)(2)] (3.0 mg/kg), on reduce the oxidative damage in liver, gills and muscle of carp and silver catfish exposed to clomazone (192 h). Silver catfish exposed to clomazone showed increased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) in liver and muscle and protein carbonyl in liver and gills. Furthermore, clomazone in silver catfish decrease non-protein thiols (NPSH) in liver and gills and glutathione peroxidase and ascorbic acid in liver. (PhSe)(2) reversed the effects caused by clomazone in silver catfish, preventing increases in TBARS and protein carbonyl. Moreover, NPSH and ascorbic acid were increased by values near control. The results suggest that (PhSe)(2) attenuated the oxidative damage induced by clomazone in silver catfish. The clomazone no caused an apparent situation of oxidative stress in carp, showing that this species is more resistant to this toxicant. Altogether, the containing (PhSe)2 diet helps fish to increase antioxidants defenses. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The energetic parameters, such as glycogen, glucose, proteins, lactate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and lactate deshydrogenase (LDH) activity in tissues and blood of carps from simazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine) contaminated waters were investigated. In order to confirm the field results, a laboratory experiment was designed in which carps were exposed to simazine at the concentration level of 45 g. L- 1 (10-fold of the amount found in natural waters) for 90 days. Fish from a contaminated reservoir showed low glycogen concentrations in hepatopancreas and muscle, while fish in another contaminated reservoir showed high LDH activity together with an increase in lactate content in muscle. Laboratory findings did not confirm field results, and fish exposed to simazine did not show alterations in the parameters studied. The results suggest that carps were not stressed by the presence of the simazine at the concentration levels found in both studies and the mechanisms of defense covered the energetic demand.

AB  - Tetraconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tetraconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 5 February 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant ISAGRO S.p.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March- April 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June - July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Eminent 40 ME", a micro-emulsion (ME) containing 40 g/L tetraconazole.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor tetraconazole residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin, soil and water; however additional ILV and confirmatory methods are required. There is no acceptable monitoring method for air.
   Mammalian toxicology of tetraconazole has been assessed in a series of tests. It is absorbed rapidly orally to an extent of about 80%. It is widely distributed in the body. It does not accumulate and is excreted rapidly and completely. It is extensively metabolised. Tetraconazole is of moderate acute toxicity by the oral and of low toxicity by the dermal and inhalation route. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant and has no skin sensitising properties. A classification as Xn; R22 "Harmful; Harmful if swallowed" is proposed. In several short-term dietary studies liver and kidneys were the target organs of toxicity (the lowest NOAEL of 2.95 mg/kg bw/d was found in dogs). Tetraconazole is not genotoxic. In a chronic rat study liver effects and at higher doses also effects on bones and incisors (fluorosis) and thyroid tumours were seen. In a carcinogenicity study with mice liver tumours were observed. Neither the thyroid tumours in rats nor the liver tumours in mice were considered relevant for human risk assessment. In a two-generation study dystocia and prolonged gestation periods were observed in dams and classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R62 "Harmful; Possible risk of impaired fertility" was proposed. In a developmental study with rats extra ribs, hydrourether and hydronephrosis occurred in the pups and classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R63 "Harmful; Possible risk of harm to the unborn child" was proposed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was set at 0.004 mg/kg bw/d, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was fixed at 0.03 mg/kg bw/d and the ARfD was set at of 0.05 mg/kg bw. Using the worst case scenario of all suggested uses for preparation EMINENT 40 ME (tractor mounted/trailed boom sprayer; hydraulic nozzles on sugar beet and wheat) the calculated exposures were 305.13% and 48.17% and 51.26% and 39.56% with and without PPE (personal protective equipment) respectively of the AOEL in the UK POEM and in the German model. Estimated maximum exposure using worst case scenarios amount to 5.5% of the AOEL for bystanders and to 28% of the AOEL for re-entry workers.
   The metabolism of tetraconazole in plants was investigated upon foliar application to wheat, sugar beet and grapes and in carrots, lettuce and wheat planted as succeeding crops. Based on the studies a residue definition including tetraconazole and the triazole derivative metabolites (triazole alanine, triazole acetic acid) has been provisionally established. A final plant residue definition for risk assessment is pending the clarification on the toxicological properties of metabolite triazole hydroxypropionic acid. This metabolite had not been identified in metabolism studies with other triazole pesticide compounds assessed in the peer review.
   The nature of the residue is not altered by processing. From processing studies transfer factors to juice, wine and dry apple pomace could be derived.
   A sufficient number of supervised residue trials are only available to cover the representative uses in wheat and sugar beets in all Europe and hence MRLs can be proposed for these crops. The representative uses in grapes and apples were initially not supported by residue trials matching the notified GAP criteria. Trials submitted during the peer review process could not be considered in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007.
   Uptake of soil residues by rotational crops is not expected to lead to residues of tetraconazole per se above the LOQ. In contrast, a significant uptake of triazole derivative metabolites is expected, but the available field studies were not considered sufficient to address residues in following crops. Hence a data gap for a new field rotational crop study has been set.
   Feed commodities may represent a significant source of exposure to tetraconazole residues for animals. Metabolism studies in lactating goats and laying hens are available, and based on the metabolic pattern in animal tissues a residue definition was proposed. However, due to data gaps the livestock dietary intake estimates cannot be finalised and thus appropriate MRLs for animal products can currently not be proposed.
   The consumer risk assessment for the notified representative uses can currently not be finalised. Excluding the uses on apples and grapes and only considering residues of tetraconazole alone, the RMS has submitted a provisional and none-peer reviewed chronic and acute consumer risk assessment indicating consumer exposure being below the toxicological reference values for tetraconazole. A robust conclusion on the consumer risk will only be possible when the identified data gaps are addressed and sufficient data and information regarding the assessment of triazole derivative metabolites in primary crops, rotational crops, and products of animal origin is available.
   Degradation of tetraconazole in soil under dark aerobic laboratory conditions was negligible. Photolysis of tetraconazole in soil was negligible.
   Degradation of tetraconazole was also investigated in three soils under aerobic outdoor conditions, exposed to sunlight. The applicant attributed degradation to a combined effect of photochemical and microbial degradation. RMS considered the reliability of the study doubtful since no clear mechanism may explain degradation. The experts considered that further experiments investigating effect of higher temperatures in dark under controlled moisture conditions and indirect aqueous photochemical studies could help to understand the mechanism of degradation prevailing in the environment.
   Therefore, a data gap was identified for these additional studies.
   Dissipation of tetraconazole under field conditions was investigated in five sites (4 in Germany and 1 Northern Italy). In the five soils dissipation followed biphasic behaviour. Tetraconazole was high to very high persistent during the second phase. The meeting of experts agreed that the field half lives cannot be used in FOCUS modelling with the current lack of understanding of the mechanism causing loss. For PEC soil the meeting of experts agreed that the longest second phase field DT50 of 1688 d should be used. Potential accumulation of tetraconazole may not be excluded since about 20 40 % AR remains as tetraconazole one year after application. Assuming yearly application and tillage, EFSA calculated a plateau background concentration over the 20 cm horizon after 36 years and peak concentration after last application. Tetraconazole is low mobile in acidic soils. Adsorption / desorption of potential metabolites M 14360-acid and TAA were investigated in different studies. Metabolite M 14360-acid may be considered high to very high mobile in soil and TAA very high mobile in soil. Potential metabolite M 14360-alcohol may be considered very high mobile in soil.
   A two years lysimeter study with two soil monoliths was performed in Switzerland. Product containing labelled tetraconazole was applied the first year. No product was applied the second year. Residue leachate concentrations observed were 0.53 0.54 mu g / L and 0.27 mu g / L parent equivalents for the first and second year respectively. The two major fractions were M11 (47 % - 66 % of radioactivity in the leachate; corresponding to 0.11 - 0.18 1.1 mu g/L) and M10 (15 - 21 % of the radioactivity in the leachate; corresponding to 0.03 - 0.08 1.1 mu g/L). A data gap was identified for the characterization of tetraconazole lysimeter metabolites M10 and Mll and to address its potential for ground water contamination.
   Tetraconazole is stable to hydrolysis and is not expected to be degraded by photolysis in water. Tetraconazole is not readily biodegradable.
   A dissipation study of tetraconzole in two water/sediment systems under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C is available. Degradation only occurs in the sediment by formation of non extractable residue. Virtually no degradation product was observed. Mineralization was negligible over the duration of the study (100 d). Tetraconazole was very high persistent in both systems (DT50 whole system = 310 372 d). New PEC SW values calculated according FOCUS SW and FOCUS kinetics were presented in the Addendum 1 to the DAR. These PECSW are based on FOCUS SW Step 2 and were agreed by the meeting of experts. However, some MSs may require Step 3 calculations. With respect to PECSED a data gap to address the potential accumulation of tetraconazole in the sediment was identified.
   FOCUS GW calculations presented for the parent compound in Addendum 2 were agreed by the meeting of experts. None of the uses and scenarios simulated resulted in 80th percentile annual average leachate concentration above the trigger of 0.1 mu g / L. For the metabolites the meeting of experts did not agree on the calculations presented. Lysimeter metabolite Mll exceed 0.1 mu g parent eq / L the year of application and the subsequent year. Lysimeter metabolite M10 reach concentrations slightly below the trigger (0.08 mu g parent eq / L) the year of application; since the substance has been applied only one season, it may not be excluded that this metabolite also exceeds the trigger of 0.1 mu g parent eq / L when tetraconazole is applied in successive seasons. On basis of the vapour pressure (1.8 10(-4) Pa) and the water solubility (196 mg /L) a Henry's Law constant of 3.6 . 10(-4) Pa m(3) mol(-1) was calculated. Half life in the troposphere due to photochemical reaction with OH. radicals was calculated to be of 1.16 d.
   The acute risk assessment to insectivorous birds in orchards and sugar beets indicated a low risk, where as the acute risk to insectivorous birds in cereals and herbivorous birds in sugar beets was assessed to be high and calls for further refinements. The short-term risk to birds from all intended uses was considered to be low, whereas the long-term risk to birds from all intended uses was found to be high. A refined long-term risk assessment for birds for all intended uses was required, taking into account the recommendations from the expert meeting. Only the long-term risk assessment to mammals was provided in the DAR, as the acute toxicity endpoint for mammals was found not to be valid by RMS. However, the mammalian toxicity experts agreed that the acute study was valid, and EFSA subsequently calculated acute TER values for mammals The risk was found to be low for all uses. The long-term risk assessment to mammals indicated a low risk to insectivorous mammals from use in cereals and a high risk to herbivorous mammals from uses in sugar beets, grapes and apples.
   Refinements were required to address the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals for uses in sugar beets, grapes and apples. The risk assessment for secondary poisoning indicated a low risk to fish eating birds and mammals and earthworm-eating mammals. The risk to earthworm-eating birds was found to be high and further refinements were required. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was considered to be low for birds and mammals. A data gap to address the risk for potential endocrine effects on birds was identified.
   Tetraconazole is very toxic to aquatic organisms. However, acute and chronic TER values were far above the Annex VI trigger for all organisms included in the aquatic risk assessment, based on FOCUSsw Step 2 South European calculation for the worst case sugar beet application. A data gap was identified for the applicant to address the potential risk of endocrine disrupting effects in fish.
   Standard glass plate tests were provided for Aphidius rhopalosiphi, Typhlodromus pyri, Crysoperla carnea and Poecilus cupreus. No effects were found in the two latter species. The study with T pyri was considered insufficient to address the risk due to high escape rates during the study. Even though in-field and off-field HQ indicated at low risk to A. rhopalosiphi, reproductive effects above 50% were derived in extended laboratory study with A. rhopalosiphi at exposure rates comparable to infield uses. Aged residue studies, however, indicated that the effects on mortality and reproduction never exceeded 50% even at day 0 of ageing. Field studies covering all intended uses indicated a low risk to T pyri. The expert meeting agreed to require an extended lab study (with fresh residues) with T pyri to conduct an off-field risk assessment in order to see if the off-field risk to mites/spiders will be addressed also for species with longer reproductive cycles than T pyri (i.e. species with lower capacity to re-colonise the in-field area).
   The formulation Eminent 125 EW had no significant effect on organic matter decomposition over a six months period in a litter bag test with worst a case application rate
   The risk from tetraconazole to bees, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.
   As uncertainties remains for potential soil metabolites, no final conclusion can be drawn for the risk from metabolites to aquatic organisms, earthworms, soil non-target micro- and macro organisms.

AB  - Fish eggs are released and embryos hatch into a pathogenically hostile environment, at a time when their immunological capacity is severely limited. Although the eggs are initially protected by the envelope as well as by several innate and adaptive immune substances, which are transferred to eggs during fish vitellogenesis, it seems that young specimens depend fundamentally on their innate defence mechanisms. Here we show in the gilthead seabream, an immunologically tractable teleost fish model, that the first lymphocyte marker genes, those coding for the two subunits for the recombination activating gene, were detected by RT-PCR around 21-27 days post-hatching (dph). In addition, the transcripts coding for the a and P subunits of the T-cell receptor and the light and heavy chains of immunoglobulin M were detected at 27-48 dph. However, most innate immune genes analyzed were already expressed at hatching, including those coding for the toll-like receptors, pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules, antiviral and antibacterial factors, and phagocyte markers. Using the information from the gene expression study, we also examined the achievement of immunocompetence by analyzing the protection induced by a bacterin against the pathogenic bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. The results show that vaccination of young larvae of this species by either immersion or oral routes resulted in increased susceptibility to infection of the specimens, and point to the lack of correlation between the achievement of immunocompetence and detection of the adaptive immunity markers.

AB  - For the past 35 years, the conflicting goals, standards, focuses, and methods of United States species protection laws and United States pesticide law have produced a fierce legal battle. The unwitting casualties of this battle are the millions of birds, fish, and other wildlife that have been killed, and the hundreds of protected species put at risk of extinction. This battle has intensified in recent years, as environmental organizations have sued the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") for its continued failure to comply with the Endangered Species Act ("ESA"). In response, EPA has invoked numerous legal and regulatory strategies, becoming further entrenched in its position of non-compliance. EPA's reluctance to conform to the ESA is due in part to its institutional bias in favor of registering pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act ("FIFRA"), and its generic bureaucratic inertia. A significant cause of the non-compliance, however, is the catch-22 in which EPA finds itself due to inherent conflicts between FIFRA and the ESA.
   This Article begins by describing the extent of the harm to wildlife, including threatened and endangered species, caused by current pesticide usage and EPA's failure to comply with wildlife protection laws. After providing an overview of the major federal species protection statutes, this Article chronicles the historic tension between those statutes, discussing the resulting litigation, EPA's regulatory actions and inaction, and the legislative response. The picture that emerges is one of unresolved crisis and massive noncompliance with federal mandates. The Article then turns to examine the sources of tension between the statutes: their conflicting goals, standards, geographic and temporal focuses, and risk reduction methods. Based on this exposition of the fundamental tensions, the Article concludes by suggesting legislative reforms intended to eliminate or at least alleviate the conflict and to reconcile the goals of wildlife protection and availability of socially useful pesticides.

AB  - The present study was designed to understand the oxidative stress potential of fenthion, an organophosphate (OP) pesticide and its involvement in glutathione metabolism modulated buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, 50 mg/kg) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 100 mg/kg) in the brain of fish, Oreochromis niloticus. A sublethal fenthion concentration (0.45 mg/L) was applied for 24, 48, and 96 In together with injection with BSO or NAC; following treatment, recovery periods for 24, 48, and 96 h were allowed. Total glutathione (tGSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), lipid peroxidation, protein level, and GSH-related enzyme activities were analyzed by using spectrophotometric methods. Fenthion in applied concentration did not change GSH levels, but increased GSSG levels. BSO application in fenthion exposure caused a depletion in GSH, while increasing the GSSG levels. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx; EC 1.11.1.9) specific activity increased in fenthion-applied groups at 24-h treatment. gamma-Glutamylcysteinyl synthetase (gamma-GCS; EC 6.3.2.2) was not detected in the brain. NAC injection in fenthion treatment decreased GSH and increased GSSG levels and GST activity. In conclusion, fenthion in sublethal concentration induced an oxidative stress processes in brain., BSO application provided an evidence for the involvement of fenthion in GSH metabolism. NAC elevated the fenthion-induced effects in spite of its antioxiclant properties. Recovery period for 96 h was not adequate to eliminate the fenthion-induced changes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the toxicity of the aqueous extract of neem leaves, a product extensively used in fish-farms as alternative for the control of fish parasites and fish fry predators, for the neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. The 24 It LC50 of neem leaf extract for juveniles P lineatus was estimated as 4.8 g L-1; the fish were then exposed for 24 h to 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 g L-1 or only clean water (control). Plasma glucose levels were higher in fish exposed to 2.5 g L-1 and 5.0 g L-1 neem extract, relative to control, indicating a typical stress response. Neem extract did not interfere with the osmoregulating capacity of the fish, as their plasma sodium, chloride, total protein and osmolarity did not change. The presence of the biopesticide interfered with the antioxidant defense system of P. lineatus, as there was a decrease in liver catalase activity at all neem concentrations and the detoxifying enzyme glutathione-S-transferase was activated in fish exposed to 5.0 g L-1. Fish exposed to all neem extract concentrations exhibited damaged gill and kidney tissue. These results indicate that although neem extract is less toxic to P. lineatus than other synthetic insecticides used in fish-farming it does cause functional and morphological changes in this fish species.

AB  - 1,3-Dichloropropene is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on 1,3-dichloropropene in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 16 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 10 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force originally consisted of Dow AgroScience B. V. and BASF Agro B. V. BASF sold the business of 1,3-dichloropropene to Kanesho Soil Treatment BVBA on 17 December 2003 and therefore was replaced in the Task Force. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 8 November 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as nematicide as proposed by the applicants. The application to bare soil comprise either introduction of the formulated product into the drip irrigation system ("EF-1478") or soil injection at 15-20 cm depth ("XRM-5048") to control nematodes in soil where tomatoes or peppers will be grew. The application rates are up to 283 kg 1,3-dichloropropene per hectare ("EF-1478") and up to 224 kg per hectare ("XRM-5048"), respectively. 1,3-dichloropropene can be used as nematicide, insecticide, fungicide and herbicide, depending on the dose rate used. In general, an application of 1,3-dichloropropene by soil injection and/or drip irrigation is followed by partial sterilisation of the soil. It should be noted that the applicants stated that only the use as nematicide will be supported in the EU review programme.
   The representative formulated products for the evaluation were "Telone EC Drip" ("EF-1478"), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Greece, Italy and Spain and "Telone Injected" ("XRM-5048") registered under different trade names in some Member States of the EU. The formulation "Telone Injected" ("XRM-5048") is coded as " any other liquid" (AL).
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   The toxicological risk assessment (and reference values) is considered to be inconclusive due to uncertainties in relation to the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. 1,3-dichloropopene is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised in the rat. The acute oral and dermal toxicity is high and the inhalatory toxicity is moderate, proposed classification and risk phrases are T; R24/25 "Toxic by dermal exposure and if swallowed" and R20 " Harmful by inhalation". It is a skin irritant and sensitizer, proposed classification and risk phrases are R38 "Irritant to skin" and R43 "May cause sensitization by skin contact". According to medical data 1,3-dichloropopene should be classified as irritant to eyes too and to the respiratory system, proposed classification and risk phrases are R36/R37 " Irritating to eyes and respiratory system".
   The weight of evidence indicates that 1,3-dichloropropene is an in vivo genotoxic agent for somatic cells, acting directly or after activation by cytochrome P450, and glutathione protects against the genotoxicity. The classification of Mutagenic Category 3, R68 is proposed.
   1,3-dichloropropene induced benign tumours in the liver of rats and in both urinary bladder epithelium and lung of mice. In addition, one hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in rats. However, the mechanism of action for tumour formation has not been yet identified. Although, results indicate that 1,3-dichloropopene can be mutagenic, the relevance of these results to mammalian tumour formation is uncertain owing to the high concentrations or doses used. The issue was to be forwarded to the PPR panel. The classification as possible human carcinogenic Category 3, R40? is highlighted. No reproduction toxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. The metabolites 3chloroallyl alcohol and 3-chloroacrylic acid are both toxic.
   Dependent on the identity on the polychlorinated imp, it might be necessary to require new toxicological studies.
   According to medical data, 1,3-dichloropropene should be classified as irritating to eyes (R36) and to irritating to respiratory system (R37). Furthermore, it is proposed to classify as R65 " Harmful, may cause lung damage if swallowed" due observed the adverse effects,
   The provisional Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) ADI is 0.0125 mg/kg bw/day, with the use of the safety factor of 200. The additional safety factor of 2 was added in order to have at least 1000 between the ADI and the dose level where tumours are evident. The provisional systemic Acceptable Operator Level (AOEL) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100.
   As inhalation exposure is the main route of exposition and all data from operator exposure are expressed as atmospheric concentration (mg/m(3)), an additional inhalatory human AOEC was assigned which is 0.066 ppm, equivalent to 0.30 mg/m(3) however should be considered as provisional. The ARfD is 0.2 mg/kg bw, with the safety factor of 100 added.
   The 1,3-dichloropropene is applied to bare soil and consisted of two scenarios. The estimations are based on field measurements. However, the estimated operator exposure should be considered only as indicative due to the uncertainties in relation to the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. For both uses drip irrigation and soil injection, PPE (gloves and coverall) and RPE (respiratory mask with filter for organic vapours) is needed in order not to exceed the AOEL (16% and 38%, respectively). The exposure for workers and bystanders should be negligible.
   The degradation and metabolism of 1,3-D has been studied comparatively in fruit (tomatoes and citrus), root vegetables (sugar beets), and pulses and oilseeds (soybeans) following application of radio labelled material to the soil surrounding the tree or to the soil in which seeds were planted. Additional information from succeeding crop studies is given on leafy crops (lettuce) and cereals (wheat).
   Even though a high amount of applied 1,3-D is expected to volatilise from soil, the results of the available studies indicate that 1,3-D is also absorbed into plants, translocated and degraded. Naturally occurring plant constituents contained the majority of radioactivity recovered in edible plant parts, indicating complete metabolism of 1,3-D. Consequently, no 1,3-D residues above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are expected to be present in primary or succeeding crops. This was confirmed by supervised residue trials data.
   However, it is stressed that the available studies don't provide any information regarding the residue behaviour of the chlorinated impurities present in the technical material that are added to soil at a high level (up to ca 6 kg/ha) when applying 1,3-D at the intended rate. There is no information on possible persistency, uptake, accumulation or metabolic fate and residue level of those chlorinated impurities, whether of known or unknown type, and moreover data on their toxicological properties are not available. This lack of data gives rise to concern in respect of consumer safety, even though potential chronic and acute dietary exposure to residues of 1,3 D per se from tomatoes and peppers is well below (< 1%) the ADI and ARfD, respectively.
   1,3-dichloropropene is a volatile liquid, so even though it is injected below the soil surface or applied via drip irrigation systems, the major route of dissipation from soil is volatilisation to the air. In aerobic laboratory soil studies it exhibited low to moderate persistence and formed the major (> 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid which exhibited very low to moderate persistence and the minor (< 10% AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited very low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 11-37% AR at 49-77 days. At these times unextracted soil residue accounted for 9-28% AR.
   In laboratory soil batch adsorption studies 1,3-dichloropropene exhibited very high to high mobility. (EZ)-3-chloroaryl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid exhibited very high soil mobility.
   In a laboratory study on a natural sediment water system (25 degrees C) with dosing under the water surface, volatilisation was again the major route of dissipation of 1,3-dichloropropene from the systems. 1,3dichloropropene exhibited low persistence and formed the minor (< 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation products (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid and (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 57% AR at 21 days. At this time unextracted sediment residues accounted for 14% AR. Acceptable surface aquatic system PEC are only available for the drip irrigation application in glasshouses. There is a data gap for acceptable concentration estimates from the outdoor uses, where the exposure from the drainage and runoff routes of entry need to be appropriately assessed. Member State experts' considered that potential deposition from the air to surface water should also be considered by the notifier when providing aquatic PEC from the outdoor uses notified.
   FOCUS groundwater tier I' modelling indicates that at the spatial scale usually assessed of the treated field, there is a very high potential for the contamination of groundwater by parent (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid. The results from an extensive targeted EU groundwater monitoring program are available. However data requirements for further information regarding aspects of this monitoring have been identified. These identified deficiencies should be addressed before this monitoring work is used for regulatory decision making.
   1,3-dichloropropene volatilises from soil even though it is applied below the soil surface. The flux losses from the soil have been measured in field studies in the USA. There is a data gap identified to provide information that these measured flux losses under American geoclimatic conditions are also pertinent to EU geoclimatic conditions. Member State experts' and the EFSA considered sufficient information has been provided to conclude that the 1,3-dichloropropene that will reach the upper atmosphere will degrade relatively rapidly and that this compound and its potential atmospheric degradation products are unlikely to have an adverse effect on the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, as they will be relatively short lived in this environmental compartment.
   Bridging studies are needed if new impurities are identified in the new five batch analysis which are not covered by the batches tested in the section on ecotoxicology. As the relevance of the impurity 1,2-dichloropropane was not discussed during the peer review process, the EFSA proposes the applicant to addresses the ecotoxicological relevance of this impurity. The levels of 1,2dichloropropane in the ecotoxicological studies must be confirmed if considered relevant.
   The indoor use in glasshouse is defined as a permanent structure to which entry of birds and mammals is limited and hence the risk to birds and mammals for the indoor uses is regarded to be low. A high acute risk to earthworm eating and insectivorous birds and mammals and a long term risk to earthworm eating and insectivorous mammals is identified for the outdoor uses. Data to address these risks is still awaited. No long term toxicity study with birds is available. A residue study on plants is awaited to assess the risk to herbivorous birds and mammals. The risk to birds and mammals for the outdoor uses can only be concluded once the outstanding data requirements become available. The EPCO expert's meeting set a data requirement for the applicant to submit the endpoints for algae based on biomass. Once these become available the risk assessment needs to be revised based on the lowest endpoint. Algae and Lemna gibba are more sensitive to the metabolites (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid than to the parent compound. Long term studies with the metabolite (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid on fish and Daphnia magna are requested as this metabolite has been identified and requires further consideration based on potential levels in ground and surface water. The acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms from the indoor use via drip irrigation can be regarded as low without the need for risk mitigation measures. The risk to aquatic organisms from the direct soil injection method of application indoors and outdoors, can only be concluded once the PEC in surface water become available (see 4.2.1 and 5.2). Given the high application rate (up to 224 kg a. s./ha) and aquatic endpoints below 1 mg a. s./L risk mitigation measures might become necessary. The risk for bioconcentration in fish for 1,3-dichloropropene and metabolites (EZ)-3chloroallyl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid is considered to be low.
   An inhalation study with bees and a calculation of relevant PEC values to conduct the risk assessment for the inhalation toxicity to bees is requested as the active substance can be found in the air even at distances of 800 m from the treated field.
   Observed effects 1 day after treatment (DAT) were below 30% for H. aculeifer, P. cupreus, A. bilineata and Pardosa spp. 1 DAT 78% effect on mortality was observed for F. candida. No adverse effects of Telone II treated soil were observed when F. candida was introduced 22 days after treatment of the soil. Given the observed effects on Folsomia candida the rapporteur Member State asked the applicant to further address the risk to non-target arthropods for the outdoor uses.
   A high acute risk to earthworms was observed. The announced new field study in UK potato fields is still awaited to address several comments which were raised on the existing earthworm field study. The long term risk to earthworm from exposure to 7 day old treated soil can be regarded as low. The acute and long term risk to earthworms exposed to freshly treated soil can only be concluded once the outstanding field data become available. The rapporteur Member State considers that this data gap only applies to the outdoor uses.
   Effects from 40.23% to 96.9% on soil microbial respiration and nitrogen transformation were observed on day 90 at the end of the study while the test soils were incubated with fresh untreated soil on day 49. A field study to address this concern was discussed at the EPCO experts' meeting and the meeting identified the need for a new field study to address this risk which should also cover the concern for the effects from the soil metabolites. The rapporteur Member State considers that this data gap only applies to the outdoor uses.
   Regarding the indoor uses, the EFSA would like to point out that earthworms, soil micro-organisms, F. candida and other soil non-target arthropods are likely to come into contact with 1,3dichloropropene as the product is applied to full soil. This could affect the function of the soil indoors.
   A potential risk to non-target plants was identified. The EPCO Expert's meeting decided that the risk should be more quantified and TER values at a few metres from the field should be calculated. The risk to non-target plants can only be concluded once this risk assessment becomes available. It cannot be excluded that 1,3-D might be harmful if the waste water goes to sewage treatment plants.

AB  - This paper examines behavioral changes in natural populations of wildlife associated with pollution. Although some changes such as lack oi nest attentiveness and decreased nest defense have been noted, the results have not been consistent and have been difficult to relate to specific pollutants. Experimental studies involving lead, mercury, and organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides are described. Although changes in behavior have been observed, they are generally more difficult to quantify and are less reproducible than biochemical changes. To date, there is no clear evidence in wildlife that behavioral changes caused by pollutants are a serious threat to populations.

Each of these studies is a longitudinal prospective study, in which women were recruited during pregnancy and the children are being followed for at least several years after birth. The study from which the largest body of data has been published to date is being performed in the Netherlands, in which exposure to PCBs and related compounds is through the general food supply. Mother-infant pairs were recruited in two cities. Half of the infants were bottle-fed and half breast-fed in each city. Four PCB congeners (118, 138, 153, 180) were assessed in maternal and cord plasma, breast milk, and plasma of the child at 3.5 years. TEQ in breast milk was calculated based on PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs. Various measures of in utero exposure were associated with suboptimal neurological status during infancy, whereas maternal plasma PCB concentration was associated with cognitive deficits (Kaufman scores) at 3.5 years of age. The child's concurrent plasma PCB levels and maternal PCB plasma levels independently predicted performance on various aspects of a vigilance task, and maternal and cord plasma levels predicted impairment of complex play behavior. Poor scores on behavioral ratings were associated with concurrent blood PCB concentrations in the child. A study in Oswego in Lake Ontario fish eaters includes mothers who never ate Great Lakes fish and mothers who consumed greater than 40 PCB-equivalent pounds of Lake Ontario fish over their lifetime. Sixty-eight PCB congeners were measured in cord blood. Suboptimal neurological status during infancy was associated with maternal fish consumption and highly chlorinated cord PCB levels, whereas deficits in short-term memory at 6 months and 1 year of age were associated with total chlorinated cord PCB levels. In a study in Germany of 171 mother-infant pairs, PCB congeners 138, 153, and 180 were measured in cord plasma and milk 2 weeks after birth; both measures are considered markers of in utero exposure. Suboptimal neurological status during infancy, decrements in Bayley scores at 30 months and Kaufman scores at 42 months were associated with PCBs in milk but not cord plasma. These studies, combined with data from previous studies, reveal a consistent relationship between PCB exposure and suboptimal neurological status during infancy, and cognitive deficits associated with in utero exposure. Data from the Dutch study revealed effects on other behavioral domains associated with concurrent (postnatal) exposure. Although it is not possible to identify specific congeners or groups of congeners that may be responsible for the neurotoxic effects observed in these studies, the TEQ approach was not particularly predictive for neurotoxic outcomes.

AB  - Ureases are nickel-dependent enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. In soybean (Glycine max), the embryo-specific urease (eSBU), the ubiquitous urease (uSBU), and a third isoform (SBU-III) are synthesized. Our group has previously demonstrated that eSBU, purified from seeds, has antifungal properties against phytopathogenic fungi, entomotoxicity against Dysdercus peruvianus, the ability to induce blood platelet aggregation, and these properties are independent of its enzymatic activity. Here we describe the biological properties of apo-uSBU fused to glutathione Stransferase (GST) produced in Escherichia cod. Removal of GST affected apo-uSBU stability. We performed a Response Surface Methodology to optimize GST-uSBU production to 5 mg per liter and then bioassays were carried out. The recombinant protein exhibited inhibitory effects on filamentous fungi and affected fungal secondary metabolism. Candida albicans and C tropicalis were also susceptible to GST-uSBU and formed pseudo-hyphae. The fusion protein was toxic against Rhodnius prolixus, with the toxicity being accompanied by in vivo and in vitro hemocyte aggregation. Rabbit platelet also aggregated in the presence of GST-uSBU. Thus, uSBU displayed similar biological properties as previously described for eSBU even when fused to GST, reinforcing the proposed role of ureases in plant defense. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It has been suggested that transgenics and vertebrate cloning have a role to play in conservation. Now is the time to evaluate their risks and benefits, before these technologies are widely implemented in our field. Direct risks of transgenics include escape and introgression of transgenes into wild populations; weedy invasion by transgenic organisms; toxicity orpathogenicity of engineered organisms and their products; and human error in the field testing and tracking of transgenic organisms. Indirect risks include environmental effects of increased herbicide use; the danger that engineered organisms may aid the development of bioweapons; the likelihood that gene patenting will lead to the privatization of natural resources; and the diversion of support from less glamorous forms of conservation. Formal risk assessments are commonly used to evaluate transgenic procedures, but our incomplete understanding of both ecosystem processes and the action of transgenes renders most of these assessments scientifically and socially unjustified. Nevertheless, a few, low-risk applications of transgenics may be possible: for example, "super-sterile" ornamental cultivars. Vertebrate cloning poses little risk to the environment, but it can consume scarce conservation resources, and its chances of success in preserving species seem poor To date, the conservation benefits of transgenics and vertebrate cloning remain entirely theoretical, but many of the risks are known and documented. Conservation biologists should devote their research and energies to the established methods of conservation, none of which require transgenics or vertebrate cloning.

AB  - For decades, multiple anthropogenic stressors have threatened the Galapagos Islands. Widespread marine pollution such as oil spills, persistent organic pollutants, metals, and ocean plastic pollution has been linked to concerning changes in the ecophysiology and health of Galapagos species. Simultaneously, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are reshaping the composition and structure of endemic and native Galapagos pelagic communities. In this novel review, we discuss the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and their associated ecotoxicological implications for Galapagos species in the face of climate change stressors. We emphasize the importance of considering fishing pressure and marine pollution, in combination with climate-change impacts, when assessing the evolutionary fitness of species inhabiting the Galapagos. For example, the survival of endemic marine iguanas has been negatively affected by organic hydrocarbons introduced via oil spills, and endangered Galapagos sea lions exhibit detectable concentrations of DDT, triggering potential feminization effects and compromising the species' survival. During periods of ocean warming (El Nino events) when endemic species undergo nutritional stress, climate change may increase the vulnerability of these species to the impacts of pollutants, resulting in the species reaching its population tipping point. Marine plastics are emerging as a deleterious and widespread threat to endemic species. The Galapagos is treasured for its historical significance and its unparalleled living laboratory and display of evolutionary processes; however, this unique and iconic paradise will remain in jeopardy until multidisciplinary and comprehensive preventative management plans are put in place to mitigate and eliminate the effects of anthropogenic stressors facing the islands today. We present a critical analysis and synthesis of anthropogenic stressors with some progress from local and international institutional efforts and call to action more precautionary measures along with new management philosophies focused on understanding the processes of change through research to champion the conservation of the Galapagos.

AB  - Integrins are expressed on the surface of some vertebrate eggs where they are thought to have a role in fertilization. The objective of this study is to determine if integrins are expressed on sea urchin eggs. The alphaB and betaC subunits were cloned using the homology polymerase chain reaction. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were developed against bacterially expressed fragments of the extracellular domains of the betaC subunit and the alphaB subunit. As well, a monoclonal antibody was developed against a synthesized peptide corresponding to part of the cytoplasmic domain of betaC. Analysis of biotinylated egg cortex extracts immunoprecipitated with either anti-betaC or anti-alphaB yields bands of 130 and 225 kDa. Immunoblots confirm that betaC is part of the complex immunoprecipitated with anti-alphaB. Confocal immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy show that betaC is present on the surface of the unfertilized egg at the tips of microvilli and in cortical granules. During the cortical reaction, immunoreactivity with antibodies to the extracellular domains of betaC and alphaB disappears from the egg surface, and microvillar casts on the fertilization envelope become immunoreactive. With antibodies to the cytoplasmic domain of betaC, immunoreactivity is lost from the surface of the egg, but the fertilization envelope does not immediately become immunoreactive. In immunoblots of egg cortex there are immunoreactive bands of the predicted sizes for alphaB and betaC. However, in fertilization envelopes, a second band that is slightly lower in molecular weight is also present. Eggs fertilized in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor have elongated microvilli that remain bound to the elevating fertilization envelope and immunoreactive to anti-betaC antibodies. Eggs fertilized in the presence of an ovoperoxidase inhibitor, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, have a patchy distribution of betaC immunoreactivity in fertilization envelopes. Together, these data suggest that alphaB betaC integrins are expressed on the surface of unfertilized eggs and, during the cortical reaction, the extracellular domains are cleaved by proteases and cross-linked into the fertilization envelope by ovoperoxidase. The alphaB betaC integrin receptors may have several potential functions prior to their removal at fertilization, including attachment of the vitelline envelope to the egg surface and anchoring the cortical cytoskeleton.

AB  - Dimoxystrobin is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC1 the United Kingdom received an application from BASF for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2002/593/EC2.
   Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and EFSA for EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the completeness of the dossier had been officially confirmed after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State United Kingdom submitted the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on dimoxystrobin, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), to the EFSA on 17 July 2003. This draft assessment report was distributed for consultation to the Member States and the notifier on 14 August 2003.
   Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 August 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 15 January 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2004.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 20 July 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises spraying using ground base equipment to control fungal pathogens in winter wheat at application rate up to 200 g dimoxystrobin per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "BAS 50700 F", a suspension concentrate (SC), which contains as a second active substance epoxiconazole (a substance to be evaluated at stage 3, part A of the review programme under Directive 91/414/EEC). Dimoxystrobin can be used only as fungicide.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of dimoxystrobin.
   Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   With respect to mammalian toxicology dimoxystrobin is rapidly and nearly completed absorbed. Dimoxystrobin is extensively metabolised to a large number of metabolites. The oral and dermal toxicity is low. However, it is harmful during inhalation, and the classification of Xn; R20 "Harmful by inhalation" is proposed. No repeated inhalation study is available. Thickening of the duodenum was the main effect observed in rats and mice. There was no evidence of genotoxicity.
   Dimoxystrobin was carcinogenic in mice causing an increased incidence of adenoma and adenomacarcinoma in the duodenum at the top dose. There was also focal hyperplasia in the duodenum at the top dose, interpreted as a pre-neoplastic lesion. Based on the results, the risk phrase and classification Xn; R40 "Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect" is proposed. There were no direct effects on reproductive performance or fertility observed up to the highest dose level. There were no indications for dimoxystrobin being neurotoxic. The metabolites 505M083 and 505M094 were considered toxicologically relevant, due to the structural similarity with dimoxystrobin.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.004 mg/kg bw/day (safety factor 1000) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day (safety factor 200).
   The formulation, BAS 507 OOF, contains two active ingredients dimoxystrobin and epoxiconazole. The studies were not performed on the representative formulation BAS 507 OOF but on dimoxystrobin diluted in a solvent formulation with a similar composition of the non-active co-formulants in BAS 507 OOF, an "artificial BAS 507 OOF". The dermal absorption value was proposed to be 1% for both undiluted and diluted formulation. For epoxiconazole the rapporteur Member State proposed 10%. As the representative formulation contains two active substances the operator exposure follows a combined approach. The rapporteur Member State presented a risk assessment for each of the two active substances. For dimoxystrobin, the risk assessment is based on dimoxystrobin in the "artificial formulation BAS 507 OOF". The risk assessment for epoxiconazole, is based on the assumptions and proposals of the rapporteur Member State. Since epoxiconazole has not yet been evaluated, but will be in the stage 3 part A of the review programme and the studies have not been peer reviewed and none of the values has been agreed on, all values should be regarded as provisional until agreed on. The proposed risk assessment is only valid when the toxicological assessment for epoxiconazole has been agreed on later in the process and thus the risk assessment of BAS 507 OOF can not be regarded as complete, but only indicative. The risk assessment for epoxiconazole is based on the estimated exposure calculated of the formulation Opus. The estimated exposure for dimoxystrobin is below the AOEL (13%) without any PPE in the "artificial BAS 507 OOF". The estimated operator exposure for epoxiconazole is below the AOEL in the German model without PPE (48%) and with PPE during both mixing and loading as well as during application according to the UK POEM (30%). If, all values are agreed on and if the actual exposure should be identified as being additive, then it might be assumed that the estimated combined exposure of dimoxystrobin and epoxiconazole is below the AOEL in the German model without PPE (61%) or with PPE during both mixing and loading as well as during application according to the UK POEM (45%) for both dimoxystrobin and epoxiconazole.
   Applied to wheat plants by foliar application dimoxystrobin itself was the major residue found at harvest in straw and in grain accounting for about 90% and 60% of the total residue, respectively. Total levels of radioactivity in grain were too low to allow further characterization of metabolites. Dimoxystrobin turned out to be persistent in soil and hence it was present in rotational crops at plant back intervals up to 365 days. However, significant residues (>0.01 mg/kg) of dimoxystrobin or other metabolites in plant parts for human consumption are not anticipated from crop rotation.
   Fed to ruminants and poultry, dimoxystrobin was intensively metabolised resulting in a comparable pattern to that observed in rat metabolism, with the exception of metabolite 505M765, which was not specifically found in the rat. Despite the lipophilic character of dimoxystrobin there was no indication of accumulation in the body fat of the tested animal species. In a feeding study levels of relevant compounds (dimoxystrobin, metabolites 505M09 and 505M76) in edible animal matrices were all found to be below the respective LOQ.
   The assessment of chronic dietary exposure of consumers to dimoxystrobin residues based on the representative GAP on cereals indicated that the most highly exposed consumer subgroup was infants at 83% of the proposed ADI. The short term exposure of all considered consumer subgroups from individual commodities, based on consumption data of UK consumers, were well within the proposed ARfD, accounting for up to 48% ARfD at a maximum from the consumption of milk by toddlers. Since there were relevant metabolites found in ground water, a consumer risk assessment was performed, considering the sum of possible intakes of dimoxystrobin and the metabolites 505M09 and 505M76 from drinking water in addition to the intake through diet. The total intakes from diet and drinking were demonstrated to be below the ADI of dimoxystrobin for the considered consumer subgroups.
   The degradation of dimoxystrobin in soil is initiated by the oxidation of methyl moieties of the phenyl ring. Metabolite 505M09 attained levels above 10 % AR in laboratory experiments and metabolite 505M08 was found at levels above 10 % of the applied parent in field trials. Maximum mineralization after 120 d was between negligible to 24 % AR. Unextractable radioactivity amounted to a maximum of 24 % after 120 d. A major photolysis metabolite 505M016 is identified in the soil photolysis study.
   Dimoxystrobin is medium to high persistent (DT50 = 88 401 d) in soil at 20 C. Metabolites 505M08 and 505M09 are less persistent in soil than parent compound. Dimoxystrobin is not degraded under anaerobic conditions.
   Degradation of dimoxystrobin is enhanced under irradiated conditions. Three field dissipation studies were performed in Germany, two in Spain and two in Sweden. Dimoxystrobin shows to be moderate to high persistent in field (DT5o (200c, pF2) = 57.6-131.6 d).
   Accumulation of dimoxystrobin in soil was investigated under field conditions in two trials in S.W. Germany, following repeated annual application to cereals over three years.
   Standard PEC soil (0 100 d) were calculated for parent and metabolite 505M01. Worst case maximum amount PEC soil for metabolite 505M01 was calculated assuming 100 % transformation from parent dimoxystrobin. The PEC soil for 505M09 values were calculated with a five compartmental model. No PEC soil was calculated for metabolite 505M08.
   In the RMS calculation of potential accumulation, maximum plateau concentration was reached after 5 years (PEC soil acc = 0.046 mg/kg). Residues seen in the field accumulation trials were considered to be mostly in the range of predicted concentrations.
   According batch equilibrium adsorption/desorption studies dimoxystrobin may be classified as low to medium mobile in soil, 505M01 as very high mobile, 505M08 as high to very high mobile and 505M09 as high to very high mobile.
   Dimoxystrobin is stable to hydrolysis at all environmental relevant pHs. Photolysis may moderately contribute to the degradation of dimoxystrobin in water.
   Degradation of dimoxystrobin in water/sediment systems was very limited. Only 10-15 % of the applied dimoxystrobin degrades after 100 d. Disappearance from the water phase is mainly attributed to partition with sediment.
   Additionally an outdoor water sediment study and an outdoor mesocosm study in Germany were used to investigate the aquatic dissipation of dimoxystrobin. Photolysis and partition to sediment were considered the main routes of dissipation of dimoxystrobin from the water phase in the outdoor water sediment study. In the mesocosm study dimoxystrobin was applied in early May and a dissipation DT50 = 60 69 d was calculated for the water phase.
   Only initial spray drift PECsw values were used in the surface water risk assessment presented by the RMS in the DAR. Other potential routes of surface water contamination such as run off and drainage are partially addressed in the DAR following published (run-off) and national RMS scheme (drainflow) but were not used further for the EU risk assessment. FOCUSsw calculations were not presented.
   In the opinion of EFSA's Scientific Panel on Plant Health, Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) related to the evaluation of dimoxystrobin7, the PPR Panel used the DT50 = 63.5 d from the outdoor pond mesocosm study, as conservative but realistic value for the exposure assessment. In this opinion it is highlighted that a single exposure event applies only to exposure via the initial spray drift. Any other exposure routes as runoff and drain flow are not covered by RMS assessment. The PPR Panel noted that FOCUSsw simulations predict higher PEC values (0.15 - 3.64 lag / L) than those calculated in the DAR (1.85 lag / L) due to the fact that drainage and runoff were the major contributors to the surface water contamination for some of the selected scenarios. A comprehensive assessment taking into account spray drift, run-off, drainage and effectiveness of potential mitigation measures to reduce surface water contamination is necessary to finalize the EU risk assessment.
   Concentrations of dimoxystrobin and its soil metabolites 505M08 and 505M09 in groundwater predicted with FOCUSgw for the representative uses proposed were below 0.1 lag / L trigger. However, in an outdoor lysimeter study in Germany exceedance of yearly average 0.1 lag / L trigger in the leachate was observed for metabolites 505M08 and 505M09 for all three years and in all the systems studied. By comparison of modelling and lysimeter results it was concluded that high interception was needed to reduce the potential of ground water contamination and that FOCUS modelling only covers risk assessment for application to late growth stages (crop interception 90 % or greater). Potential for groundwater contamination by 505M08 and 505M09 under vulnerable conditions needs to be assessed at MS level.
   The concentration of the photodegradation product 505M01 are below the 0.1 [tg/L trigger when calculated form the results of the lysimeter study.
   Concentration of dimoxystrobin in air is expected to be negligible due to low volatility and short half life in air for reaction with OH radicals.
   For birds and mammals EFSA provided a risk assessment according to the latest guidance document (Sanco/4145/2000 of 25 September 2002) in an addendum which however was not yet peer reviewed. The risk assessment for dimoxystrobin (technical) resulted in TER values for the acute, short term and long term risk to insectivorous birds and mammals which met the Annex VI trigger values. However, the complete risk assessment for birds and the long term risk assessment for mammals is based on the endpoints deriving from studies with the technical active substance. Since the lead formulation contains a second active substance (epoxiconazole, listed for the 3rd stage of the peer review process) it is questionable whether it is possible to extrapolate from the toxicity of the technical active substance to the formulated product. Furthermore, the acute toxicity studies with rats showed that the formulated active substance in the lead formulation is more acutely toxic than the technical active substance. A high risk was identified for birds and mammals from the uptake of contaminated drinking water in a first tier risk assessment.
   EFSA is of the opinion that a high risk to birds and mammals from the application of the lead formulation cannot be excluded and additional data are required to address the risk of the lead formulation to birds and mammals.
   A high risk was identified in a first tier risk assessment for all tested groups of aquatic organisms. The higher tier risk assessment for fish resulted in TER values which met the revised acute TER trigger value. No agreement was reached in the EPCO experts' meeting on ecotoxicology (EPCO 3) if the chronic risk assessment should be based on the endpoints deriving from the early life stage (ELS) test with rainbow trout (flow through test design) or on the ELS test with golden orfe (single application and presence of sediment). Therefore, this question was forwarded to the Scientific Panel on Plant Health, Plant Protection Products and their Residues. The PPR Panel concluded that the endpoint of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) should be used. Based on this endpoint (overall NOEC of 0.316 a.s./L) a high risk was calculated in the addendum provided by EFSA which was not peer reviewed. Therefore the high chronic risk to fish needs to be addressed with further data. A mesocosm study was conducted as a higher tier test to address the risk to aquatic invertebrates and algae. In the EPCO experts' meeting (EPCO 3) it was agreed that a safety factor of 5 has to be applied to the TER value of 2.7 deriving from the mesocosm study. Consequently a high risk to aquatic invertebrates and algae was identified and has to be addressed with further data and risk mitigation measures are necessary.
   Field studies with earthworms were conducted because a high long term risk to earthworms was identified in a first tier risk assessment. The results of the field studies led to the conclusion that the long term risk to earthworms is low.
   The risk to bees, non target arthropods, soil macro-, soil micro-organisms, non target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.
   The risk from the metabolites 505M01, 505M08, 505M09 to the environment is low.

AB  - At a time when sea lice control is a major issue for salmon aquaculture worldwide it has become imperative that scant veterinary medicinal resources for the treatment of fish on farms should be conserved and used effectively. This communication reports the use of the mathematical simulation model SliDESim to investigate how best to administer cypermethrin bath treatments on Scottish salmon (Salmon salar L) farms to control the challenge from lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) during a two-year production cycle. It was found that these topical treatments are most effective when administered in pairs approximately six weeks apart. Timing of treatment is critical and depends on the number of treatments administered over the production cycle. For 4, 5 or 6 treatments during a two-year production cycle. SLiDESim indicated that the first pair of treatments is best initiated in autumn of the first year of production with the second pair starting between 13 and 18 weeks later. This strategy can produce considerable gains in the predicted reduction of sea lice levels when compared with those historically observed when using cypermethrin on Scottish farms. The effects of altered efficacy were also explored using the model and indicate that even a moderate reduction in treatment efficacy can have considerable impacts on lice control over a production cycle. The SLiDESim computer model provides a framework to explore the more efficient use of veterinary treatments for the control of sea lice on salmon farms.

AB  - The anadromous sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus native range extends across the Northern Atlantic and includes much of Europe. Their complex lifecycle, involving freshwater spawning, juveniles (ammocoetes) that remain in freshwater for up to eight years, and adults migrating to sea before returning to reproduce, means native populations in Europe are threatened by multiple stressors, especially migration blockages and habitat loss. This has resulted in population declines across their European range, despite their ecological, evolutionary, and economic significance. Information on their population demography and long-term patterns are also scarce, with focus primarily on their ammocoete freshwater phase. This is inhibiting the development of biological reference points for utilization in population monitoring programs. In the Great Lakes of North America, however, P. marinus is invasive and the high damage caused to commercial fisheries resulted in their populations being controlled through a long-term, multi-method and integrated research and management approach over the last 40 years, with the development and application of a range of novel methods. Successful knowledge transfer to Europe could therefore facilitate the monitoring of threatened populations and develop new conservation actions, including modifying migration blockages to facilitate passage, implementing adult trapping programs, and applying pheromone treatments to manipulate adult movements and behaviors. This reveals the potential utility of using invasive fish populations to inform conservation practices in native ranges, and how pheromone research could further enhance fish conservation and monitoring.

AB  - Alighting of horse flies (Diptera: Tabanidae) and non-biting muscids (Diptera: Muscidae) was studied at Khartoum, Sudan, using black cylindrical models mimicking a goat, calf and cow. Flies were intercepted by attaching electrocution grids or clear adhesive film to models. Alighting sites and defensive behaviour were also documented on hosts through observation. Female Tabanus sufis (Jennicke), T. taeniola (Palisot) and Atylotus agrestis (Wiedemann) were the main tabanids captured. Muscids landed in equal numbers on all sizes of models. They had a strong preference for the upper portions of both models and hosts. Landings of T. taeniola and A. agrestis increased with model size, but not so for T. sufis. T. taeniola and A. agrestis scarcely alighted on the legs of models whereas 60-78% of T. sufis did so. Landings of T. sufis on artificial legs did not vary with model size. Landings of all tabanids on the lower and upper portions of a model increased with model size. For both hosts and models, most tabanids (88-98%) alighted on the lower half and legs. Most muscids (63-89%) alighted on the upper half. Landing of tabanids on the cow was 34.9 and 69.3 times greater than that on the calf and goat, respectively. These results are discussed in relation to strategies for the control of blood-sucking flies associated with farm animals using either insecticide-treated live baits or their mimics.

AB  - Dominant carabid species present in clops and crop rotation sequences commonly used in the northern Great Plains were assessed as an initial step toward the management of carabids as natural control agents. Ground beetle populations were determined by pitfall trapping in 4 crop rotation treatments maintained under high, managed, and low levels of chemical fertilizer and pesticide inputs. Diversity arid. species richness among crops, rotations, and input levels were compared using 3 indices-the Shannon-Weaver Index, relative diversity, and the Hierarchical Richness Index (HRI). Four carabid species, Cyclotrachelus alternans (Casey), Poecilus lucublandus Say, Harpalus pensylvanicus (DeGeer), and Bembidion quadrimaculatum L., comprising approximate to 80% of the total collected, were considered dominant species. When carabid abundance data were grouped by clop, C. alternans was the dominant species in corn and alfalfa arid P. lucublandus was dominant in wheat. In soybean plots, C. alternans and P, lucublandus were equally abundant. The relative abundance of H. pensylvanicus was highest in the low-input plots. High values of HRI for carabid diversity and species richness in the managed plots suggested that reduced chemical inputs encouraged greater abundance and diversity of beneficial carabids than were found in the high-input plots without the loss of yield seen in the low-input plots.

AB  - Organohalogen compounds are some of the most notorious persistent pollutants disturbing the Earth biosphere. Although human-made, these chemicals are not completely alien to living systems. A large number of natural organohalogens, part of the secondary metabolism, are involved in chemical trophic interactions. Surprisingly, the relationship between organisms' trophic position and synthetic organohalogen biotransformation capability has not been investigated. We studied the case for polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDE), a group of flame-retardants of widespread use in the recent years, in aquatic food webs from remote mountain lakes. These relatively simple ecosystems only receive pollution by atmospheric transport. A large predominance of the PBDE congener currently in use in Europe, BDE-209, largely dominated the PBDE composition of the basal resources of the food web. In contrast, primary consumers (herbivores and detritivores) showed a low proportion of BDE-209, and dominance of several less brominated congeners (e.g. BDE-100, BDE47). Secondary consumers (predators) showed large biomagnification of BDE-209 compare to other congeners. Finally, top predator fish characterized by low total PBDE concentrations. Examination of the bromine stable isotopic composition indicates that primary consumers showed higher PBDE biotransformation capability than secondary consumers. We suggest that the evolutionary response of primary consumers to feeding deterrents would have pre-adapted them for PBDE biotransformation. The observed few exceptions, some insect taxa, can be interpreted in the light of the trophic history of the evolutionary lineage of the organisms. Bromine isotopic composition in fish indicates that low PBDE values are due to not only biotransformation but also to some other process likely related to transport. Our finding illustrates that organohalogen compounds may strongly disturb ecosystems even at low concentrations, since the species lacking or having scarce biotransformation capability may be selectively more exposed to these halogenated hydrophobic semi-volatile organic pollutants due to their high bioaccumulation potential.

AB  - A series of experiments was conducted to examine effects of four strains of the estuarine dinoflagellate, Pfiesteria shumwayae, on the behavior and survival of larval and adult shellfish (bay scallop, Argopecten irradians; eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica; northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria; green mussels, Perna viridis [adults only]). In separate trials with larvae of A. irradians, C. virginica, and M. mercenaria, an aggressive predatory response of three strains of algal- and fish-fed P. shumwayae was observed (exception, algal-fed strain 1024C). Larval mortality resulted primarily from damage inflicted by physical attack of the flagellated cells, and secondarily from Pfiesteria toxin, as demonstrated in larval C virginica exposed to P shumwayae with versus without direct physical contact. Survival of adult shellfish and grazing activity depended upon the species and the cell density, strain, and nutritional history of P. shumwayae. No mortality of the four shellfish species was noted after 24 h of exposure to algal- or fish-fed P. shumwayae (strains 1024C, 1048C, and CCMP2089) in separate trials at <= 5 x 10(3) cells ml(-1), whereas higher densities of fish-fed, but not algal-fed, populations (> 7-8 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)) induced low (<= 15%) but significant mortality. Adults of all four shellfish species sustained > 90% mortality when exposed to fish-fed strain 270A1 (8 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)). In contrast, adult M. mercenaria and P viridis exposed to a similar density of fish-fed strain 2172C sustained < 15% mortality, and there was no mortality of A. irradians and C. virginica exposed to that strain. In mouse bioassays with tissue homogenates (adductor muscle, mantle, and whole animals) of A. irradians and M. mercenaria that had been exposed to R shumwayae (three strains, separate trials), mice experienced several minutes of disorientation followed by recovery. Mice injected with tissue extracts from control animals fed cryptomonads showed no response. Grazing rates of adult shellfish on P. shumwayae (mean cell length +/- 1 standard error [S.E.], 9 +/- 1 mu m) generally were significantly lower when fed fish-fed (toxic) populations than when fed populations that previously had been maintained on algal prey, and grazing rates were highest with the nontoxic cryptomonad, Storeatula major (cell length 7 +/- 1 mu m). Abundant cysts of P. shumwayae were found in fecal strands of all shellfish species tested, and <= 45% of the feces produced viable flagellated cells when placed into favorable culture conditions. These findings were supported by a field study wherein fecal strands collected from field-collected adult shellfish (C virginica, M. mercenaria, and ribbed mussels, Geukensia demissa) were confirmed to contain cysts of P. shumwayae, and these cysts produced fish-killing flagellated populations in standardized fish bioassays. Thus, predatory feeding by flagellated cells of R shumwayae can adversely affect survival of larval bivalve molluscs, and grazing can be depressed when adult shellfish are fed P. shumwayae. The data suggest that R shumwayae could affect recruitment of larval shellfish in estuaries and aquaculture facilities; shellfish can be adversely affected via reduced filtration rates; and adult shellfish may be vectors of toxic P shumwayae when shellfish are transported from one geographic location to another.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential utility of antioxidant parameters as indicators of exposure to toxicants and of toxic effects in the freshwater mussel Unio tumidus. Antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9), glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2), superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6)), redox status of glutathione and lipid peroxidation were measured at first in the gills and the digestive glands of mussels after exposure to copper (30 mu g l(-1)) or/and thiram (100 mu g l(-1)) for 3 days. The effects of a complex industrial effluent on the antioxidant system were investigated afterwards in a held study: encaged mussels were placed in a river upstream and downstream from a pollution source consisting of the effluent of a cokery for 1 week. These studies demonstrated that in both experimental exposures, the most sensitive parameters were selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity (SeGPx), reduced glutathione levels (GSH) and especially glutathione reductase activity (GRd) which significantly decreased. Decreases in SeGPX and GRd activities were more pronounced in the gills under coexposure to copper and thiram, with 74% and 78% of reduced activity, respectively (P < 0.01); reduction of GSH levels was 50% in this case. In the field study, the activities could be reduced by 35% and 72% in the gills for SeGPx and GRd, respectively; reduction of GSH levels could reach 45%. In contrast, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities remained generally constant in all the treatment groups compared with controls. Lipid peroxidation, as expressed by malonaldehyde content measured by HPLC, was slightly enhanced in experiment with copper+thiram and this increase (from 1.8 to 2.8 fold) was concomitant with a depletion of antioxidant defences. The responses of antioxidant parameters were overall greater in the gills than in the digestive glands of exposed mussels. These results suggest that among antioxidant defence systems, SeGPx, GSH levels and particularly GRd, could represent biomarkers of interest for the estimation of the effects of environmental contamination on freshwater invertebrates.

AB  - Background and Aim. Humic substances (HS) comprise the majority of dead and living organic carbon, including organisms. In the environment, they are considered to be chemically inert or at least refractory. Recent papers, however, show that HS (including natural organic matter - NOM, isolated by reverse osmosis) are natural chemicals which interact with aquatic organisms. They are taken up and cause a variety of stress defense reactions which are well known from man-made chemicals. These reactions include chaperon activation, induction and modulation of biotransformation enzymes, or induction of antioxidant defense enzymes. One specific reaction with freshwater plants is the reduction of photosynthetic oxygen release. In this contribution, we compare the susceptibilities (cell yield) of two closely related coccal green algae, Monoraphidium convolutum and M. minutum, towards various NOM isolates.
   Methods. Cultures of M. convolutum and M. minutum were obtained from the algal collection of the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Berlin, and from the Culture Collection of Algae, Gottingen, and maintained in a common medium. The cultures were non-axenic. The algae were exposed to 5 mg L-1 DOC of each humic material, an environmentally realistic concentration. Cell numbers were counted microscopically in Neugebauer cuvettes in 5 replicates on days 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21.
   Results and Discussion. Almost all NOM isolates modulated the growth of the algae. Only the NOM of a Norwegian raised peat bog lake did not reveal any significant effect with M. convolutum. In general, the results with two algal species are by no means uniform. For instance, Suwannee River NOM causes a decrease in cell density with M. minutum, but temporarily stimulates the growth of M. convolutum. The opposite applies to Aurevann NOM: Growth increase in M. minutum, but a bi-phasic response in M. convolutum. Different responses of both Monoraphidium species must be attributed to intrinsic factors of the algae rather than only to chemical features of the exposed materials, because the exposures were identical with both algal species. The reduction in growth yields can be explained as a herbicide-like mode of action that affects the photosystem 11 most prevalently. The growth promoting effect remains somewhat obscure. It may be due to (1) an increase in bioavailability of some trace nutrients in the presence of HS, (2) the release of some growth promoting substances by microbial or photochemical processing of the humic materials, and (3) a hormetic effect upon the exposure of HS. Hormesis means stimulation of organisms or metabolic activities when exposed to noxes in low concentrations. However, it is still open to discussion why the growth promotion only applies to one or the other, but not simultaneously to both Monoraphidium species.
   Conclusion. Exposure of the closely related coccal green algal species to humic material changes their growth characteristics. Since the reactions are not consistent within the two species and the various humic materials, it seems that the less sensitive species is favored by HS exposure. The environmental relevance, however, is subject to future studies.

AB  - This review summarises the information available on the biology, behaviour and economic significance of the common or webbing clothes moth, Tineola bisselliella (Hummel), currently the most important and widespread clothes moth pest throughout the world. These moths can cause the loss of irreplacable material of aesthetic, historic and scientific importance, as well as damaging every-day items such as clothes, furnishings and other materials prepared from animal fur, wool, feathers and hides. Methods for the detection and control of this pest are outlined, with particular emphasis on control strategies that are environmentally sustainable and avoid the use of conventional pesticides and fumigants. Improvements in storage coupled with targeted use of appropriate control measures will help to reduce pest populations. However, the continuing problems with this pest highlight the need for improved methods of detection, prevention and management. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, we considered approaches to reducing maternal exposure to hazardous environmental toxicants, focusing on risk communication to pregnant women and providers, but also considering identification of environmental toxicants in the community and reduction of environmental toxicants. We addressed the following questions: (1) What do pregnant women and their providers know about environmental toxicants and perinatal health? and (2) What, policy strategies are needed (should be considered) to move forward in risk reduction in this area? We reviewed the literature on knowledge of pregnant women and providers regarding these issues.
   While there is limited research on what pregnant women and their providers know about environmental toxicants and perinatal health, there is evidence of reproductive and perinatal toxicity. This article describes a wide range of policy strategies that could be implemented to address environmental toxicants in the context of perinatal health. Effective leadership in this area will likely require collaboration of both environmental health and maternal and child health leaders and organizations.

AB  - Vibrio harveyi is the dominant pathogen in mariculture, and biocontrol of this pathogen using antagonistic probiotics is a long-standing biological challenge. Here, Pseudoalteromonas piscicida WCPW15003 as a probiotic effectively antagonized dominant pathogenic V. harveyi in a mariculture, with a growth-of-inhibition ratio of 6.3 h(-1). The antagonistic activities of cells and intracellular components of WCPW15003 made a greater contribution to the antagonistic process than did extracellular metabolites and caused the dominance of WCPW15003 during the antagonistic process in vitro. WCPW15003 was safe for the pearl gentian grouper (female Epinephelus fuscoguttatus x male Epinephelus lanceolatus) and, as a consequence of the antagonistic effect on V. harveyi, protected the fish from an immune response in vivo. A comprehensive combined proteomics and metabolomics analysis of antagonistic WCPW15003 and pathogenic V. harveyi in a coculture compared to a monoculture was performed to investigate the antagonistic molecular mechanisms. The results showed that during the antagonistic process, WCPW15003 in a coculture had significantly downregulated metabolic pathways for histidine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism, and upregulated glycerophospholipid metabolism, leading to a competitive advantage against the cooccurring species, V. harveyi. This defined a mechanism by which multi-costimulatory pathways drove P. piscicida WCPW15003 against V. harveyi.
   IMPORTANCE V. harveyi as a dominant pathogen has become a major hazard in mariculture development and seafood safety, and biocontrol of this pathogen using antagonistic probiotic agents is a long-standing biological challenge. P. piscicida WCPW15003 has promise as a novel, safe, and effective bioagent for specifically inhibiting dominant pathogenic V. harveyi and protects mariculture animals from infection by this pathogen by moderating the host immune response, which is heavily driven by multi-costimulatory pathways in a coculture of WCPW15003 and V. harveyi. This work identified a direction for comprehensively elucidating the molecular mechanism of WCPW15003 antagonism against the dominant pathogen in mariculture using modern molecular biology techniques and provided deep insights into the advantages and potential of this antagonistic probiotic against V. harveyi for the construction of an environmentally friendly, recirculating mariculture system.

AB  - In this work we have evaluated the potential carcinogenic and acutely toxic risks associated to the exposure to highly prevalent organic and inorganic contaminants through the consumption of fishery products by the Spanish population. The concentrations of 8 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 18 polychlorinated biphenils (PCBs), 7 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (expressed as benzo[a] pyrene toxic equivalents (B[a] P-eq)), and three inorganic toxic elements [arsenic (As), cadmium(Cd), and mercury (Hg)] were determined in 93 samples of the most consumed species of white fish, blue fish, cephalopods and seafood species, which were acquired directly in markets and supermarkets in the Canary Islands, Spain. The chemical concentration data were combined with the pattern of consumption of these foodstuffs in order to calculate the daily intake of these contaminants, and on this basis the risk quotients for carcinogenicity and acute toxicity were determined for Spanish adults and children. Our results showed that the daily intake of OCPs, PCBs and B[a] Peq, which is associated to blue fish consumption was the highest within the fish group. The estimated intake of pollutants can be considered low or very low for the individual contaminants, when compared to reference values, except in the case of HCB and As. All the estimated intakes were below the reported Tolerable Daily Intakes. Considering the additive effects of multiple contaminants, the risk of acute toxic effects can also be considered as low or very low. However, our results reflect that the current consumption of white fish in adults and children, and also the blue fish in the case of adults, poses a moderate carcinogenic risk to Spanish consumers, mainly related to their concentrations of As. The conclusions of this research may be useful for the design of appropriate risk communication campaigns. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two groups of enzymes are classified as acetolactate synthase (EC 4.1.3.18). This review deals chiefly with the FAD-dependent, biosynthetic enzymes which readily catalyze the formation of acetohydroxybutyrate from pyruvate and 2-oxobutyrate, as well as of acetolactate from two molecules of pyruvate (the ALS/AHAS group). These enzymes are generally susceptible to inhibition by one or more of the branched-chain amino acids which are ultimate products of the acetohydroxyacids, as well as by several classes of herbicides (sulfonylureas, imidazolinones and others). Some ALS/AHASs also catalyze the (non-physiological) oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, leading to peracetic acid; the possible relationship of this process to oxygen toxicity is considered. The bacterial ALS/AHAS which have been well characterized consist of catalytic subunits (around 60 kDa) and smaller regulatory subunits in an alpha(2)beta(2) structure. In the case of Escherichia coli isozyme III, assembly and dissociation of the holoenzyme has been studied. The quaternary structure of the eukaryotic enzymes is less clear and in plants and yeast only catalytic polypeptides (homologous to those of bacteria) have been clearly identified. The presence of regulatory polypeptides in these organisms cannot be ruled out, however, and genes which encode putative ALS/AHAS regulatory subunits have been identified in some cases. A consensus sequence can be constructed from the 21 sequences which have been shown experimentally to represent ALS/AHAS catalytic polypeptides. Many other sequences fit this consensus, but some genes identified as putative 'acetolactate synthase genes' are almost certainly not ALS/AHAS. The solution of the crystal structures of several thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes which are homologous to ALS/AHAS, together with the availability of many amino acid sequences for the latter enzymes, has made it possible for two laboratories to propose similar, reasonable models for a dimer of catalytic subunits of an ALS/AHAS. A number of characteristics of these enzymes can now be better understood on the basis of such models: the nature of the herbicide binding site, the structural role of FAD and the binding of ThDP-Mg2+. The models are also guides for experimental testing of ideas concerning structure-function relationships in these enzymes, e.g. the nature of the substrate recognition site. Among the important remaining questions is how the enzyme suppresses alternative reactions of the intrinsically reactive hydroxyethyl ThDP enamine formed by the decarboxylation of the first substrate molecule and specifically promotes its condensation with 2-oxobutyrate or pyruvate. 0 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The management of organic wastes is an environmental and social priority. Aerobic digestion (AED) or composting and anaerobic digestion (AD) are two organic waste management practices that produce a value-added final product. Few side-by-side comparisons of both technologies and their digestate products have been performed. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of initial feedstock properties (moisture content and/or C/N ratio) on stabilization rate by AED and AD and soil amendment characteristics of the final products. Green and food wastes were considered as they are two of the main contributors to municipal organic waste. Stabilization rate was assessed by measurement of CH4 and CO2 evolution for AD and AED, respectively. For AD, CH4 yield showed a second-order relationship with the C/N content (P < 0.05); the optimal C/N ratio indicated by the relationship was 25.5. For AED, cumulative CO2 evolution values were significantly affected by the C/N ratio and moisture content of the initial feedstock (P < 0.05). A response surface model showed optimal AED stabilization for a C/N of 25.6 and moisture of 64.9% (wet basis). AD final products presented lower soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) but lower humification degree and aromaticity than the products from AED. This lower stability may lead to further degradation when amended to soil. The results suggest that composting feedstocks with higher C/N produces an end-product with higher suitability for soil amendment. The instability of end products from AD could be leveraged in pest control techniques that rely on organic matter degradation to produce compounds with pesticidal properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Demographic, industrial and agricultural development of Morocco during the last few years have often altered water quality. The Gharb district and particularly the Sebou river basin are among the most heavily polluted regions in Morocco.
   Oued Sebou collecting basin is 40,000 km(2), situated in north-western Morocco. Its water flows from the north-western slopes of the Middle Atlas range to the Atlantic Ocean. Its tributaries collect waters from the Rif range (Oued Ouerrha) and from central Morocco (Oued Beht). It is the main purveyor of water of the Gharb plain, a major agricultural region in Morocco, where fertilizers and pesticides are widely used. Along its banks, various industries (paper mills, sugar plants, tanneries, food industries, wool mills, chemical plants, etc.) have settled and contribute to the development of large towns which are not equipped with facilities for the treatment of either industrial or domestic waters. It is a real example of water pollution in a developing country.
   In order to assess the actual water quality of lower Sebou and to monitor both the effect of the release of pollutants and the influence of other factors, a wide pluridisciplinary research program on the biological, ecotoxicological and microbiological situation is in progress. Eleven stations have been selected: one on Oued Ouerrha (S1), one on Oued Beht (S6), one on Oued R'dom (S5) and eight on Oued Sebou, distributed along about 230 km (Fig. 1). The following paper reports on the physico-chemical quality of surface waters of lower Sebou, submitted to domestic, agricultural and industrial pollution and to tidal movements. Samples were analyzed for 17 parameters following AFNOR norms; 5 were determined on site (temperature, oxygen, pH, conductivity and salt content) while the others (DBO, DCO, MES, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, Cl-, SO42-, PO42-, Ca2+, total hardness and alkalinity) were determined in the laboratory.
   Temperature does not vary significantly between different stations. Suspended matters levels were mainly dependent on hydrologic sequences of the rivers (low or high waters) and showed a wide range of seasonal changes. Because of decantation, the levels decreased from upstream to downstream, but after Kenitra, they increased again, because of solid wastes from the town and of a strong bottom tidal flow that pulls out deposited solid matter.
   Organic pollution is severe. Means of BOD5 vary from 19 to 76 mg/L and of COD from 39 to 180 mg/L. They can reach 135 mg/L for BOD5 and 834 mg/L for COD. The worst situation is found downstream to Sidi Allal Tazi sugar plant. For dissolved oxygen, the lowest levels were found downstream to the town of Sidi Slimane (22%) and to Sidi Allal Tazi sugar plant (38%).
   Ammonium was mostly low (0-0.09 mg/L) while at downstream stations (8, 9, 10, 11) there was a small increase, as well as at S6 (downstream to Sidi Slimane town). The presence of ammonium nitrogen is usually considered as figuring an uncompleted degradation of organic matter (Rodier, 1984). Nitrites followed the variations of ammonium. Nitrates showed a wide range of variations, possibly because of strong turbulence enhancing locally the oxygenation.
   In order to determine which were the main parameters that drove the ecosystem dynamics, a main components analysis was performed on the matrix given by the results of 8 campaigns at 11 sampling stations. The results are given in Table 1 and Fig. 5. It appears that tidal movements, and thus salt levels, are main factors upstream to Kenitra and downstream to Sidi Allal Tazi. The tidal phenomenon has been specifically studied (Fig. 5D and E). The confrontation of fresh and sea water in the Sebou mouth gives birth to a physical stopper which prevents polluted water from reaching the ocean and thus slows the improvement of water quality.
   Oued Sebou gives a good example under Mediterranean weather conditions of a severe pollution due to hydrochemical conditions strongly influenced by municipal and industrial wastes. Most of the physico-chemical parameters are higher than the values given by Nisbet and Verneaux (1970). Moreover, downstream, tidal influence contributes to further damage water quality. Efforts should be made to reduce toxic substances release in the Gharb plain. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Seaweeds have invaded ecosystems along the coasts of many countries where they can displace native algae and seagrasses, reduce biodiversity and impair habitat of fish and invertebrates. The most widespread and notorious cases have been introductions of Caulerpa taxifolia, which now infests over 20,000 ha of Mediterranean subtidal zones. Few attempts to control seaweed invasions have been successful, due to often harsh and highly variable physical conditions in marine environments, and the lack of efficacious methods. Use of heat, copper, chlorine, salt, freshwater and various mechanical (removal) approaches have been successful in reducing or eradicating some infestations. Biological control by herbivorous mollusks and sea urchins has been investigated, but has yet to result in any operational programs. Nutrient inputs from near-shore sources have exacerbated the spread of some species (e.g., off the Florida coast). To counter the increase in seaweed introductions and the spread of these species, it will be useful to adapt, where feasible, methods that have proven successful in controlling freshwater weeds. New methods will need to be developed as well. This will require better communication among researchers and managers working to reduce introductions and negative impacts of these seaweeds.

AB  - Pesticides are from the potent chemical contaminants in aquatic environment. These chemicals are routed into the aquatic environment through several natural and anthropogenic activities. Pesticides toxicity adversely affect growth, physiology, reproduction, immunity, hemato-biochemical profile and induce serious histopathological alterations of several tissues of aquatic organisms including fish. From the aforementioned effects, histopathological and hemato-biochemical parameters serve as important biomarkers of aquatic contamination resulted from pesticides. Pesticides are major concern around the world as they can bioaccumulate into different fish tissues which will consequently result in serious health concern for the consumers. Therefore, searching out of ecofriendly, effective, and suitable alter-natives of pesticides is important to protect the aquatic ecosystems as well as health status of several aquatic living organisms especially fish. In this context, the present review depicts several histopatho-logical and hemato-biochemical alterations resulted from pesticide toxicity. It also highlights the possible methods for diminishing the negative effects of pesticides on fish to ensure healthy aquatic environment for fish farming.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted in a cider-apple orchard to evaluate the effect of six groundcover management systems (pine-bark plastic and straw mulches, tillage, herbicide and natural soil) on the occurrence of ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae).
   Eight species of carabids were collected in pitfall traps. The three most common beetles, Steropus gallega Fairmaire (65.8%), Pseudophonus rufipes (DeGeer) (18.2%) and Poecilus cupreus L. (14.6%), represented more than 98% of the total catches. The specific dominance depended on the sampling date. The soil management treatment significantly affected the following parameters. (1) The overall carabid catch: the plastic mulch (5.6% of the total catches) negatively Affected total carabid collection, which,was higher in the tilled (24.3%) and herbicide-treated (21.4%) plots, although not significantly different from the natural soil (16.5%), straw mulch (16.3%) and pine-bark mulch (15.9%) treatments. (2) The specific preferences of the three most common carabids: the plastic cover adversely affected the catches of S. gallega whilst P. rufipes was collected in greater numbers in tilled areas and P cupreus in the herbicide treatments. (3) the structure of the carabid community: based on species richness, diversity and evenness indices; herbicide and tillage provided the most diverse carabid community and the straw mulch the poorest: It was concluded that groundcover management in apple orchards may affect the activity density of epigeic predators which may contribute to the natural control of pests.

AB  - We outline an approach to pesticide risk assessment that is based upon surveys of pesticide use throughout West Africa. We have developed and used new risk assessment models to provide, to our knowledge, the first detailed, geographically extensive, scientifically based analysis of pesticide risks for this region. Human health risks from dermal exposure to adults and children are severe enough in many crops to require long periods of up to three weeks when entry to fields should be restricted. This is impractical in terms of crop management, and regulatory action is needed to remove these pesticides from the marketplace. We also found widespread risks to terrestrial and aquatic wildlife throughout the region, and if these results were extrapolated to all similar irrigated perimeters in the Senegal and Niger River Basins, they suggest that pesticides could pose a significant threat to regional biodiversity. Our analyses are presented at the regional, national and village levels to promote regulatory advances but also local risk communication and management. Without progress in pesticide risk management, supported by participatory farmer education, West African agriculture provides a weak context for the sustainable intensification of agricultural production or for the adoption of new crop technologies.

AB  - Bioaccumulation, the accumulation of a chemical in an organism relative to its level in the ambient medium, is of major environmental concern. Thus, monitoring chemical concentrations in biota are widely and increasingly used for assessing the chemical status of aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, various scientific and regulatory aspects of bioaccumulation in aquatic systems and the relevant critical issues are discussed. Monitoring chemical concentrations in biota can be used for compliance checking with regulatory directives, for identification of chemical sources or event-related environmental risk assessment. Assessing bioaccumulation in the field is challenging since many factors have to be considered that can affect the accumulation of a chemical in an organism. Passive sampling can complement biota monitoring since samplers with standardised partition properties can be used over a wide temporal and geographical range. Bioaccumulation is also assessed for regulation of chemicals of environmental concern whereby mainly data from laboratory studies on fish bioaccumulation are used. Field data can, however, provide additional important information for regulators. Strategies for bioaccumulation assessment still need to be harmonised for different regulations and groups of chemicals. To create awareness for critical issues and to mutually benefit from technical expertise and scientific findings, communication between risk assessment and monitoring communities needs to be improved. Scientists can support the establishment of new monitoring programs for bioaccumulation, e.g. in the frame of the amended European Environmental Quality Standard Directive.

AB  - Anecdotal evidence suggests that cockroaches respond to electrical appliances or outlets. Our objectives were to determine the effect of field-inducing sources and field attributes on attraction of German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.) (Blattodea: Blattellidae), and to test those parameters found effective for attraction of B.germanica for attraction of other groups of insects. In two-choice, large-arena experiments, significantly more female, but not nymphal, B.germanica settled in or near electrified coils with static or fluctuating electromagnetic fields produced by low-level direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) sources than in control coils without current. Electromagnetic fields with the magnetic, but not the electric, component of the field nulled still attracted B.germanica, suggesting that the electric component of the field may contribute to the attraction or arrestment response of B.germanica. DC-powered coils with static electromagnetic fields also attracted/arrested brown-banded cockroaches, Supella longipalpa (Fabricius) (Blattodea: Blattellidae), common silverfish, Lepisma saccharina (L.), firebrats, Thermobia domestica (Packard) (both Thysanura: Lepismatidae), and European earwigs, Forficula auricularia (L.) (Dermaptera: Forficulidae), but they repelled American cockroaches, Periplaneta americana (L.) (Blattodea: Blattidae). If proven in field experiments, electrified coils as trap baits may offer non-toxic alternatives to pesticides for selective insect control in urban environments.

AB  - Tri-allate is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tri-allate in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 August 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Gowan Comercio Internacional e Servicos. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July - August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide in barley and wheat for the control of wild oat, black-grass and meadow-grass as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached endpoints.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Avadex 15G' ('Mon 7966'), a granule (GR) containing 150 g/kg tri-allate.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor residues given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant origin and in environmental matrices, however a data gap was set for a monitoring method for residues in food of animal origin.
   In the mammalian metabolism studies, tri-allate was rapidly but incompletely absorbed after oral administration. It was evenly distributed and extensively metabolised, showing no potential for accumulation. According to the precautionary principle, classification of tri-allate as Xn, R22 "Harmful if swallowed" was proposed, however acute dermal and inhalation toxicity were low. Tri-allate was not a skin or eye irritant; classification with risk phrase R43 "May cause sensitisation by skin contact" was proposed according to the results of a Magnusson & Kligman test.
   Decreased body weight and clinical signs of neurotoxicity were the most common effects found in rats, dogs and hamsters upon short-term administration. Reversible anaemia and liver toxicity were also found in these species, while the liver was the main target organ in mice. Upon long-term exposure, reduced body weight and liver toxicity were still evident, but no potential for carcinogenicity was observed in rat, mouse or hamster.
   Although some in vitro tests (mainly Ames tests and a Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay) gave positive results, based on the weight of evidence, tri- allate was considered to have no genotoxic potential in vivo.
   Reproduction toxicity studies reflected the same kind of effects in parents, as in short-term studies. In the two generation study, reduced pregnancy rate was associated with parental toxicity and in the developmental study in rat; decreased foetal weight and retarded ossification were linked to maternal toxicity. In rabbit an apparent increase in the incidence of fused sternebrae was observed without maternal toxicity, this finding gave rise to an intense debate by the experts, but considering the low severity of the effect, the meeting agreed not to propose a classification related to developmental toxicity for tri-allate.
   No sign indicative of delayed neurotoxicity was found in acute and short-term neurotoxicity studies in hen. Clear signs of neurobehavioural toxicity were seen in an acute and a short-term neurotoxicity studies in rat. No inhibition of cholinesterase activity was detected, but a special investigation showed a strong correlation between the presence of axonal degeneration in the brain and CNS-like behavioural effects caused by tri- allate leading to a proposal for classification with Xn, R48/22 "Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed".
   A data package of studies was provided on the metabolite TCPSA(2), a major metabolite in plant and the environment, leading to the conclusion that TCPSA is not relevant for groundwater and that the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of tri-allate covers the toxicity of the metabolite.
   The ADI of tri-allate was 0.025 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year rat study and applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.032 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day neurotoxicity study in rat, a safety factor of 100 and a correction factor for low oral absorption of 50 %; and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.6 mg/kg bw based on the acute neurotoxicity study in rat and applying a safety factor of 100. Dermal absorption was 12 % for the concentrate and in-use spray dilution, based on an in vivo study in monkeys. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation 'Avadex 15G', at a maximum dose rate of 2.25 kg tri-allate/ha was below the AOEL according to selected data from the Pesticide Handler's Exposure Database (PHED), considering the use of gloves during loading and application of the granules. Worker exposure was not considered relevant for the representative use of tri-allate. Estimated bystander and residential exposure resulting from the use of 'Avadex 15G' was below the AOEL.
   Metabolism studies of tri-allate labelled in the allyl position were considered in the DAR which showed that residues consisted primarily of metabolites TCPSA, M14(3) and M15(4). A provisional residue definition for risk assessment of tri-allate, TCPSA and the glycoside conjugates (M14 and M15) expressed as tri-allate was proposed by the residues expert meeting. The residue definition proposed in the DAR did not include the glycoside conjugates. In addition, the expert meeting concluded the metabolism could not be finalised because there is a data gap for a wheat study of tri-allate labelled in the diisopropylamine moiety. The meeting identified this data gap to address a concern about the potential formation of nitrosamines from the diisopropylamine moiety in plants. It should be noted that in wheat grain, total metabolites were 0.008 mg/kg (5.10 % of TRR).
   In radio-labelled rotational crop studies the residue was made up of tri-allate and TCPSA but it was questioned why M14 and M15 were not looked for. In addition, it was considered that, on the basis of the residue levels in radish roots (at 30 days after application) in these studies, a data gap should be identified for field studies. The primary crop residue trials data in wheat and barley presented analysis for tri-allate and TCPSA. No accurate conversion factor is available to enable levels of glycoside conjugates to be accounted for.
   Residues were seen to be stable in frozen storage for up to 56 months. The need for processing studies is not currently triggered. Intakes by livestock triggered the need for animal metabolism data for ruminants. A goat metabolism study showed the majority of radioactivity was incorporated into natural compounds. The only possible compounds of significance were tri-allate and TCPSA, and the feeding studies confirmed this.
   The risk assessment could not be finalised because of the inclusion of 'glycoside conjugates' in the residue definition. Additionally, the theoretical concern over the formation of nitrosamines has resulted in a data gap for a wheat metabolism study. On this basis no maximum residue levels (MRL) were proposed by the expert meeting.
   The risk assessment can not be finalised because of the rotational crop issue amongst others.
   Only studies with tri-allate labelled in the allylic position are available in the fate and behaviour section. The need for addressing the metabolites that may result from the diisopropylamine moiety was identified during the peer review and discussed in the PRAPeR meeting. The applicant provided a position paper to clarify this issue. This position paper made use of public scientific literature to select the input parameters for modelling and as part of the consideration for estimating the formation of nitrosamines potentially produced by water treatment. These scientific papers had not been previously submitted in the dossier. In view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to the EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. However the meeting considered that the issue needs to be addressed and therefore identified a data gap to address the potential formation of diisopropylamine(5) in soil and contamination of ground water.
   Tri-allate exhibited moderate to medium persistence in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DissT(50) = 35 - 61 d); however these rates may only be considered as dissipation rates since volatilization contributed to a great extent to the losses observed. Data were reanalyzed by the applicant with ModelMaker (V.4.0.) to separate the degradation and volatilization processes. The calculated degradation rates were in the range of DT50 = 38.4 - 75.2 d.
   Of the six or seven minor metabolites identified, only TCPSA (max. 3.74 % AR by HPLC and max. 7.38 % AR by TLC) was fully characterized and further addressed for environmental risk assessment. TCPSA exhibited low to moderate persistence under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C in soil.
   Volatiles collected in the organic traps (max. 16.17 % AR after 120 d) of the aerobic degradation experiments were not characterized but were assumed to be tri-allate. Unextractable radioactivity amounted to max. 25.3 % AR at the end of the study (120 days after treatment). Radioactivity found in the ethanolamine trap (max. 21.2 % AR after 120 d) was assumed to be CO2. The need for further identification of potentially volatile tri-allate soil metabolites and the characterization of soil metabolites found in the available study had been identified during the peer review. The majority of experts agreed with the rapporteur Member State that it is reasonable to assume that the non-characterised radioactivity in the volatile traps is the active substance. The EU risk assessment of the representative use proposed could therefore be acceptably concluded without further regard to the characterisation of the volatiles. However some experts considered that it is necessary to confirm the complete route of degradation for national risk assessments and therefore a data gap was identified for a study to investigate the aerobic degradation in soil including identification of residues in volatile organic traps and adequate identification of soil metabolites.
   Tri-allate was very highly persistent in soil under anaerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. Photolysis in soil of tri-allate is almost negligible when compared with aerobic degradation. A field dissipation study with trials at four different United Kingdom sites is available. Tri-allate exhibited low to high persistence in these trials. The rapporteur Member State assessed the studies as scientifically valid and representative of Northern European conditions. However they proposed using data obtained from laboratory degradation studies for environmental modelling for EU risk assessment due to the potential effect of volatilization on the results of these trials. The DT90's observed in some of the field dissipation studies were above 1 yr and triggered the need to assess potential of accumulation of tri-allate in soil. PEC in soil and accumulation of tri-allate in soil were estimated on the basis of the worst case field half-life of 205 d. For TCPSA the PEC in soil was estimated on basis of the maximum observed in the laboratory studies determined by TLC. Tri-allate may be considered immobile to slightly mobile in soil according the available study. Metabolite TCPSA may be considered very highly mobile in soil according to the available study.
   Tri-allate was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4 and 7 at 50 degrees C, however it hydrolyses under alkaline conditions. The half-life at 25 degrees C in the aqueous pH 9 solution was 52 d. Aqueous photolysis is not expected to contribute to the environmental degradation of tri-allate on basis of the lack of UV absorption at wavelengths above 290 nm. Biodegradability studies available show that tri-allate is not readily biodegradable.
   In the water sediment systems, tri-allate dissipated relatively rapidly from water by partition to the sediment and volatilization. Half-lives of tri-allate in the whole system are 52.8 - 62.0 d. No major metabolites were identified either in the water or in the sediment phases. Mineralization and unextractable residues in the sediment are practically negligible (CO2 = 1.51 - 4.35 % AR; unextractable in sediment = 2.77 - 3.26 % AR).
   PECSW/SED were calculated for tri-allate and its soil metabolite TCPSA on the basis of the FOCUS SW scheme and models for the scenarios relevant to cereals in Northern EU (D1-D5, R1). Since the product is a granular formulation, the applicant proposed spray drift values for the granules based on a specific study. The approach was considered acceptable by the rapporteur Member State and reported as Step 3 calculations. Additional FOCUS Step 4 calculations included spray drift mitigation by buffer zones and run off mitigation by vegetative buffer strips. The method used to implement runoff mitigation is not agreed in the latest FOCUS Landscape and mitigation guidance document and therefore the rapporteur Member State recalculated the Step 4 FOCUS SW without run off mitigation.
   Potential ground water contamination by tri-allate and its soil metabolite TCPSA was addressed by modelling calculations with FOCUS PELMO 3.3.2. The rapporteur Member State calculations resulted in 80th percentile annual average concentrations in the leachate at 1 m depth below 0.001 mu g/L for tri-allate and in the range of 0.76 - 15.42 mu g/L for metabolite TCPSA. The metabolite TCPSA has a clear potential to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L in ground water and requires assessment of its toxicological and ecotoxicological relevance including consumers risk assessment. Relevance of TCPSA was assessed during the peer review following the step-wise procedure set out in the guidance document for relevance of metabolites in ground water (see sections 2.8, 3.3 and 5.2). Tri-allate is a volatile organic compound and studies available indicate that tri-allate displays significant volatilisation from soil surfaces. However on the basis of the atmospheric half-life calculated (DT50 = 3.8 h), it is considered unlikely that tri-allate may be subjected to long-range transport.
   The first tier risk assessment for direct consumption of granules results in values above the trigger values, indicating low acute, short-term and long-term risk for small seed-eating birds and mammals. The risk to grazing birds and mammals from consumption of residues of tri-allate in the young cereal shoots was estimated using the residues data presented in the DAR. The acute, short-term and long-term TER estimated for birds and the acute and long-term TER values estimated for mammals were above the Annex VI trigger values, indicating a low risk for birds and mammals.
   Potential for bioaccumulation was considered since tri-allate has a log P-ow of 4.06. The first tier TER values estimated for earthworm-eating birds was above the Annex VI trigger value, however the TER value for earthworm-eating mammals was below the Annex VI trigger value. After a refinement process the risk to earthworm-eating mammals was considered as low. The first tier TER values for fish-eating birds and mammals were 7 and 1.9, respectively, indicating a low risk for fish-eating birds. A potential high risk for fish-eating mammals was identified. A data gap was identified by the EFSA after the PRAPeR 48 meeting to ask to the applicant to submit a new refinement of the potential high risk for fish-eating mammals.
   Based on the available studies, tri-allate was considered very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute and chronic TER values based on the used of PECSW from FOCUS step 4 with a 10 m non spray buffer zone were above the Annex VI trigger values. Risk mitigation measures similar to 10 m non spray buffer zone are needed in Member States. The risk of the TCPSA metabolite for aquatic organisms is low.
   Since tri-allate has a log P-ow of 4.06 the potential for bioconcentration should be considered. The BCF = 1400 was derived from a study with Lepomis macrochirus. The EFSA noted after the meeting that tri-allate has a BCF > 1000 and a field soil DT90 > 100 days. For these reasons the EFSA identified a data gap to assess the potential for biomagnification of tri-allate through aquatic food chains.
   A low acute risk was identified for earthworms. The long-term risk to earthworms needs further refinement. It is proposed by the rapporteur Member State in the DAR that further information is required on the long-term risk to earthworms. Further information is required to fully address the potential risk of tri-allate to other non-target macro-organisms. A data gap was proposed for the submission of a litter bag study.
   Risk mitigation such as an in-field no spray buffer zone of 10 m was considered necessary for the non-target plants.
   The risk was considered to be low to bees, non-target arthropods, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the antimicrobic potential of mucus samples collected from Cyprinus carpio and identify the specific antimicrobial peptides responsible for its activity. The crude extract was tested against various bacterial and fungal pathogens, and its protein content and profile were analyzed. Purification steps, including gel filtration chromatography, were employed to isolate the most active fraction (peak IV), which was further identified via liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. The results revealed varying degrees of antimicrobial activity of the crude extract against different bacterial and fungal strains, with Leclercia adecarboxylata, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis showing the highest susceptibility. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated the existence of multiple low molecular weight protein bands in the crude extract, while fraction IV obtained from gel filtration chromatography exhibited the strongest antimicrobial activity. Peak IV displayed a range of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values against the tested pathogens, spanning from 0.038 to 4.960 mg/mL. Further investigation identified the purified peptide derived from peak IV as G-type lysozyme 2, characterized by a molecular weight of 21 kDa. These findings shed light on the existence of a highly effective antimicrobial peptide, G-type lysozyme 2, within the mucus of Cyprinus carpio. This peptide demonstrates notable activity against diverse bacterial and fungal pathogens. The insights from this study enhance our understanding of the fish's antimicrobial defense mechanisms and hold promise for developing novel antimicrobial agents.

AB  - An acute exposure study of mancozeb (MAZ) fungicide was applied on Oreochromis niloticus for 96-h duration. Three hundred fish (20.50 & PLUSMN; 1.60 g) were assigned into six groups (50 fish/ group; 10 fish/replicate) and exposed to different six concentrations (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 mg L-1) of MAZ for 96-h. The Probit analysis program was used to compute the 96-h lethal concentration 50 (96-h LC50) of MAZ. During the exposure duration, the fish's behavior, clinical symptoms, and mortalities were recorded daily. After the exposure period was ended, the hematological, biochemical, immunological, and oxidant/antioxidant parameters were evaluated. The results of this study recorded the 96-h LC50 of MAZ for O. niloticus to be 11.49 mg L-1. Acute MAZ exposure badly affected the fish's behavior in the form of increased the breath gasping and swimming activity with aggressive mode. The exposed fish showed excessive body hemorrhages and fin rot. The survival rate of the exposed fish to MAZ was 100, 80, 66, 50, 38, and 30% in 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 mg L-1 MAZ, respectively. The hematological indices (red blood cell count, hemoglobin, packed cell volume%, and white blood cell count) were significantly decreased by increasing the MAZ exposure concentration (8-20 mg L-1). The acetylcholine esterase activity and immune indices (lysozyme, nitric oxide, immunoglobulin M, complement 3) were decreased by MAZ exposure (4-20 mg L-1). Acute MAZ exposure induced hepato-renal dysfunction and elevated stress-related parameter (cortisol) by increasing the MAZ concentration. A significant reduction in the antioxidant parameters (total antioxidant activity, catalase, and superoxide dismutase) with increasing the lipid peroxidation marker (malondialdehyde) was noticed by acute MAZ exposure (4 -20 mg L-1) in O. niloticus. Based on these outcomes, the MAZ exposure induced toxicity to the fish evident in changes in fish behavior, neurological activity, hepatorenal functioning, and immune-antioxidant responses which suggest physiological disruption.

AB  - Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) is an essential growth factor to control the proliferation, differentiation and survival of the macrophage lineage in vertebrates. Sequences of MCSF have been identified in multiple teleost species, however, the functional investigations of MCSF were documented in only a few species. In this study, we examined the biological activity and the immunomodulatory property of a MCSF homologue, PoMCSF, from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Structural analysis showed that PoMCSF possesses conserved structural characteristics of MCSF proteins, including a signal peptide, a CSF-1 domain, and a transmembrane region closed to the C-terminal. Under normal physiological condition, PoMCSF expression distributes in all the examined tissues, the highest three tissues are blood, muscle, and head kidney. When infected by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and viral pathogen, the PoMCSF expression patterns vary with different types of microbial pathogens infection and different immune tissues. In vitro experiment showed recombinant PoMCSF promoted the activity of macrophage. In vivo experiment indicated that PoMCSF overexpression boosted the defensive ability of flounder against Edwardsiella piscicida, a severe fish pathogen that infects multiple species of economically important fish, and regulated the expression of multiple immune-related genes. To explore the relationship between PoMCSF and its receptor PoMCSFR, anti-PoMCSFR antibody was prepared and PoMCSFR knockdown was conducted. The neutralization assay showed that when PoMCSFR was neutralized by its antibody, the role of PoMCSF on host defense against E. piscicida was weakened. Knockdown of PoMCSFR impaired the phagocytic capacity of macrophages. Collectively, these findings suggest that PoMCSF plays a crucial role in the immune defense system of Japanese flounder and the effect of PoMCSF is dependent on PoMCSFR. This study provides new insights into the biological activity of MCSF and the relationship between MCSF and MCSFR in teleost.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystem health is the main concern to increasing pesticides application to control agricultural pests as it is the ultimate receptor of such materials. This study evaluated the impact of new metalinsecticide, the [Mg(hesp)(2)(phen)], referred as MgHP, on fish using physiological, genetic, biochemical, and morphological biomarkers. The fish, Prochilodus lineatus, was exposed to 0 (control), 1, 10, 100, 1000 mu g L-1 MgHP, for 24 and 96 h. MgHP was not lethal but caused genotoxicity, altered hematological variables and, the activity of antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes and histology of liver, depending on concentration and time exposure. Hematocrit and erythrocyte number (RBC) increased without change hemoglobin content resulting in changes in hematimetric indexes after 24 h; after 96 h, only RBC was changed. Erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities and crenate cells increased after 24 h but, not after 96 h. Erythrocytes and hepatocytes indicated instability in DNA integrity however, the absence of micronuclei suggested DNA damage repairment. After 24 h, the antioxidant defense system and the phase II biotransformation enzyme was responsiveness and catalase activity decreased at high MgHP concentrations; the antioxidant response was triggered after 96 h. Hepatocyte hypertrophy, intracellular cytoplasmic substances, cytoplasm degeneration, melanomacrophage and hyperemia increased in fish exposed from 10 mu g L-1 to higher MgHP concentrations; the organ alteration index increased as MgHP concentration increased showing dose-dependence. Most of hematological and genotoxic effects occurred after 24 h exposure evidencing potential recover capability of organism by activation of the antioxidant defense system and DNA repairment mechanisms. Nevertheless, the histopathological changes in the liver was maintained over time at high MgHP concentrations, a concentration usually no environmental relevant. In conclusion, this data reinforced the importance of continuing research on MgHP effects in other organisms considering the promising use of such compound to control the leafcutter ants and other insects.

AB  - The unconscious use of pesticides causes various adverse effects on non-target organisms, including humans. Enzymes that control metabolism become the target of the pesticide and the organs are damaged due to toxic effects. Glutathione s-transferase (GST, EC 2.5.1.18), an important enzyme of the detoxification mechanism and antioxidant defense system, can be affected by such toxic substances. Therefore, the effect of fenarimol on GST enzyme activity was investigated in our study. For this, 200 mg/kg fenarimol was administered intraperitoneally to male and female rats at different periods (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 72 hours). After application, GST enzyme activity was analysed in the liver, kidney, brain and small intestine tissues of the rats. According to our results, activation (liver, kidney, small intestine) or inhibition (brain) of the generally GST enzyme was observed in the tissues of rats exposed to fenarimol. It is thought that the increase and/or decrease in this enzyme activity may be the cause of the toxic effect of fenarimol.

AB  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals are a serious concern all over the world. In this study, the endocrine disrupting effects of commonly used insecticides thiamethoxam and lambda cyhalothrin were investigated by using Oreochromis niloticus as a model organism. The fish exposed to 1/20, 1/10 of 96-h LC50 value of thiamethoxam and lambda cyhalothrin (477.29 mg/L, 2.901 mu g/L), individually and in mixtures, for 7 and 15 days. Fish were then left to depurate in pesticide-free water for 7 days. Results showed that acetyhcholin-esterase, catalase and estradiol/testosterone levels decreased, while the amount of etoxyresorufin-O-deetylase (EROD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione (GSH) and protein carbonil (PCO) increased in comparison to the control. After the recovery period, EROD, GST, malondialdehyde, estradiol/testosterone levels were found to be lower than the control. In the pesticide mixture group, the activity of antioxidant enzymes was highest and the level of hormones was lowered. The group of the mixture pesticide showed the highest lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation than only thiamethoxam or lambda cyhalotbrin exposure. In conclusion, the mixture of the insecticides showed a more toxic effect on the gonad of tilapia compared to individual pesticide exposures. In addition, the depuration period of 7 days was not adequate to eliminate the toxic effects of these insecticides.

AB  - Monocrotophos is one of the extensively used organophosphorus insecticides in agriculture and animal husbandry in India. It induces neurotoxicity by inhibiting acetyl cholinesterase enzyme and elevating oxidative stress. Curcumin, dietary polyphenol, well known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which could elicit protective effect against monocrotophos induced neurobehavioural abnormalities. Therefore this study is aimed to investigate ameliorative effect of curcumin loaded Nanoparticles on monocrotophos induced neurotoxicity.
   Curcumin loaded PLGA nanoformulation was prepared using nanoprecipitation technique and was characterized using zeta sizer, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. For in-vivo study, 30 male rats were utilized. Exposure of monocrotophos was done at 2 mg/kg (p.o.) for 28 days. Curcumin bulk and cucurmin loaded Nanoparticles were administered with or without monocrotophos. Effect of monocrotophos exposure on behavioural changes was assessed by analysing spontaneous locomotor activity, motor coordination in rotarod WA and contextual fear memory in passive shock avoidance paradigm. Effect on biochemical alteration in blood and brain were estimated.
   The average particle size of Curcumin loaded Nanoparticles was 114.9 nm and in-vitro release study suggested suitable release of Curcumin in simulated intestinal fluid. Results of in-vivo study indicated, monocrotophos exposure caused a significant increase in reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and intracellular free calcium levels along with altered behavioural abnormalities in locomotor activity, motor coordination, learning and memory. Decline in antioxidant defence level might suggest reduced host defence response. Treatment with curcumin alone did not significantly reversed monocrotophos induced neurotoxicity in rats. Whilst, treatment with curcumin loaded nanoparticles significantly reduced monocrotophos induced behavioural and biochemical alteration in rat brain.
   The outcome of the present study suggested improved efficacy of curcumin loaded nanoparticles, possibly via its enhanced bioavailability. Further alleviation of oxidative stress and intracellular free Ca2+ level might be speculated as one of the plausible neuroprotective mechanism of curcumin in this study.

AB  - Within a population, larger individuals tend to have higher fecundity and produce higher quality eggs. For this reason, larger, older females often disproportionately contribute to recruitment. However, increases in body size and age have also been shown to correlate with increased bioaccumulation of environmental contaminants, which negatively impact reproduction and larval survival. In this study, we tested for maternal age and size effects on fecundity, egg size and quality, contaminant body burden, and maternal transfer in Alligator Gar Atractosteus spatula to assess the potential for contaminant bioaccumulation to offset reproductive benefits of large females. We measured fecundity and egg quality (via lipid content) as well as tissue concentrations of mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in female Alligator Gar from the Trinity River, Texas. Fecundity was positively correlated with body size, but egg lipid was not significantly correlated with body size or with fecundity. Total mercury (THg) in both liver and muscle was positively correlated with maternal body size, and egg THg was positively correlated with maternal body size and liver THg. All liver and egg samples contained detectable levels of PCBs and OCPs, which were positively correlated with body size. Concentrations of PCBs and OCPs were positively correlated between tissues for each female, with egg concentrations being generally higher than liver concentrations. Based on concentrations of Hg, PCBs, and OCPs known to cause biological impairment in adult and larval fishes, the concentrations observed in this study suggest that adult reproductive function and behavior-as well as egg hatching success, larval development, and survival-could be compromised. Our results provide data that are relevant for managing the lower Trinity River Alligator Gar population and also serve as a case study demonstrating that the reproductive benefits of larger, older females may be eroded by contaminant accumulation and maternal transfer.

AB  - Lake Van fish is the only vertebrate species that lives in extreme condition (salinity of 2.2%, alkalinity of 151.2 meq/kg, and pH of 9.8) of largest soda lake of the world. This fish is an important source of protein for the people living in Van and surrounding provinces. . Cypermethrin (CYP) is used extensively against insects in agricultural, livestock, and domestic applications in Lake Van basin. CYP has toxic effects highly on non-target organisms as aquatic animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of commercial formulas of CYP (0.05 mu g/L) on Van Lake fish (Alburnus tarichi) for 24, 48, 72, 96 h under semi-static conditions using oxidative damage biomarkers. In this study, antioxidant defense system enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and lipid peroxidation (LPO) product malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined in the liver, kidney, gills, and brain tissues. According to the results of this study, the decrease in SOD (at 48, 72, and 96 h) and CAT and GPx (at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h) enzyme activities were significant with exposure to CYP (p < 0.05). In addition, the increase in MDA levels, which is the indicator of LPO, was found to be significant (p < 0.05). However, in the 24 h period exposed to CYP, a significant increase in SOD activity was determined in kidney and brain compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, sublethal concentrate application of CYP is thought to cause oxidative stress and disrupt the oxidant, antioxidant balance of Lake Van fish.

AB  - A simple, rapid and sensitive method based on in situ derivatization combined with magnetic ionic liquid (MIL)-dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) was developed for the determination of biogenic amines (BAs). Six BAs (tryptamine, phenylethylamine, histamine, tyramine, spermidine, and spermine) were in situ derivatized with dansyl chloride (DNS-Cl), extracted by MIL-DLLME, and then chromatographed by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). This MIL trihexyltetradecylphosphonium tetrachlorocobalt (II) [P-6,6,6,14(+)](2)[CoCl42-] was explored as the extraction solvent with the advantages of magnetic susceptibility, hydrophobicity and mobile phase compatibility. Furthermore, the MIL was designed to reduce hydrolysis in aqueous solvent as well as decrease absorbance when submitted to HPLC. In order to obtain optimized extraction efficiency, the MIL mass, the volume of derivatizing agent, the type and volume of disperser, the derivatizing and extraction time, and pH of sample solution were investigated. The proposed method was successfully applied for the analysis of wine and fish samples, and the recoveries of analytes achieved were in the range of 93.2-103.1% and 94.5-102.3%, respectively. The limits of detection/quantification for wine and fish samples were in the range of 1.3-3.9/4.1-9.9 mu g/L and 1.2-3.8/3.9-9.6 mu g/kg, respectively. Additionally, good reproducibility with relative standard deviations lower than 4.9% (n = 5) was obtained for the analysis of wine and fish samples. The in situ DNS-Cl derivatization and MIL-DLLME method was an efficient, rapid, environmental friendly microextraction approach for the determination of BAs in foodstuffs.

AB  - The invasion of the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America by sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) in the early 20th century contributed to the depletion of commercial, recreational and culturally important fish populations, devastating the economies of communities that relied on the fishery. Sea lamprey populations were subsequently controlled using an aggressive integrated pest-management program which employed barriers and traps to prevent sea lamprey from migrating to their spawning grounds and the use of the piscicides (lampricides) 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) and niclosamide to eliminate larval sea lampreys from their nursery streams. Although sea lampreys have not been eradicated from the Great Lakes, populations have been suppressed to less than 10% of their peak numbers in the mid-1900s. The ongoing use of lampricides provides the foundation for sea lamprey control in the Great Lakes, one of the most successful invasive species control programs in the world. Yet, significant gaps remain in our understanding of how lampricides are taken-up and handled by sea lampreys, how lampricides exert their toxic effects, and how they adversely affect non-target invertebrate and vertebrates species. In this review we examine what has been learned about the uptake, handling and elimination, and the mode of TFM and niclosamide toxicity in lampreys and in non-target animals, particularly in the last 10 years. It is now clear that the mode of TFM toxicity is the same in non-target fishes and lampreys, in which TFM interferes with oxidative phosphorylation by the mitochondria leading to decreased ATP production. Vulnerability to TFM is related to abiotic factors such as water pH and alkalinity, which we propose changes the relative amounts of the bioavailable un-ionized form of TFM in the gill microenvironment. Niclosamide, which is also a molluscicide used to control snails in areas prone to schistosomiasis infections of humans, also likely works by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, but less is known about other aspects of its toxicology. The effects of TFM include reductions in energy stores, particularly glycogen and high energy phosphagens. However, non-target fishes readily recover from sub-lethal TFM exposure as demonstrated by the rapid restoration of energy stores and clearance of TFM. Although both TFM and niclosamide are non-persistent in the environment and critical for sea lamprey control, increasing public and institutional concerns about pesticides in the environment makes it imperative to explore other means of sea lamprey control. Accordingly, we also address possible "next-generation" strategies of sea lamprey control including genetic tools such as RNA interference and CRISPR-Cas9 to impair critical physiological processes (e.g. reproduction, digestion, metamorphosis) in lamprey, and the use of green chemistry to develop more environmentally benign chemical methods of sea lamprey control.

AB  - alpha-cypermethrin is a pyrethroid and environmental genotoxic pesticide extensively used worldwide for agricultural applications. However, like other pesticides, it affects non-target organisms as well as target organisms and causes various toxic effects. To evaluate alpha-cypermethrin toxicity in non-target organisms, the effect of alpha-cypermethrin on the activity of malondialdehyde (MDA, an indicator of lipid peroxidation) content, antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD; peroxidase, POX and catalase, CAT) and DNA damage were investigated in maize. For this purpose, maize seedlings were exposed to alpha-cypermethrin in different concentrations (5, 10, 25, and 50 ppm) for 7 days in Petri dishes. After the incubation root length, antioxidant enzyme levels, MDA content and RAPD profiles of seedlings were analyzed to determine toxicity. The results revealed that both MDA content and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (except for 5 ppm at POX application) significantly increased (p<0.05) by exposing to acypermethrin in a concentration dependent manner. Conversely, significant changes in RAPD profiles were observed after acypermethrin applications. These changes included loss of normal bands and the appearance of new bands, in comparison with the control group, and they also were dose-dependent. According to these obtained results, we concluded that alpha-cypermethrin cause DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner and the root cells of maize exhibits defense against alpha-cypermethrin-induced oxidative stress by enhancing their antioxidant activities.

AB  - Female individuals of Hyphessobrycon eques were exposed to Diflubenzuron (Dimilin (R)) in order to determine whether exposure to sublethal levels of this insecticide causes changes in gill morphology. Fish were exposed to 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg L-1 for 96 h and 17 days and then submitted to pathological and histometric evaluation. Pathological lesions, such as hyperplasia, lamellar fusion, vascular congestion, secondary lamellar disarray, vasodilatation, hemorrhage and increased lamellar epithelium, were significantly more common in the gills of fish exposed to Dimilin (R) than the control. Histometric analysis documented significant changes in blood vessel diameter, primary lamellae width and secondary lamellae length, and the appearance of hemorrhage foci in all concentrations tested. Even at low Dimilin (R) concentrations, the histopathological alteration index was mild to moderate, thereby indicating that the function of this tissue was compromised. These findings indicate that indiscriminate use of Dimilin can adversely affect the structural integrity of the gills of H. eques, which can cause numerous problems for fish farming systems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the genotoxic effects of starvation and dimethoate (organophosphate insecticide) in female and male wolf spiders Xerolycosa nemoralis (Lycosidae) exposed to the stressors under laboratory conditions. DNA damage was measured in haemocytes and midgut gland cells using the comet assay. In response to the two stressing factors, both cell types showed %TDNA, tail length (11) and OTM values higher in males than in females. Level of DNA damage in haemocytes was greater than in midgut gland cells. In both sexes, the strongest genotoxicity was recorded at single application of dimethoate. After five-time exposure to the pesticide, genotoxic effects of a single dose were sustained in males and reduced to the control level in females. Starvation stress was well tolerated by the females, in which neither cell type was affected by DNA damage. However, in male haemocytes food deprivation induced severe DNA damage, what suggests suppression of the defence potential at prolonged starvation periods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study examined the impacts of carbofuran on endocrinology of the catfish, Clarias gariepinus, for the first time and evaluated cortisol (CRT), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and testosterone (TST) and the oxidative stress markers including SOD, CAT, GSTs, GSH.
   The toxic effects on the metabolic enzymes, G6PDH and LDH, in addition to lipid peroxidation (LPO) and DNA damage as biomarkers in Nile catfish, to sublethal exposures of carbofuran (0.16 and 0.49 mg/L, for 35 days) were studied.
   Statistically significant differences between selected parameters between control and carbofuran-treated fish were recorded. Carbofuran caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in CRT and T3 levels; the mean levels of T4, TST, E2 exhibited significant decreases (p < 0.05) in carbofuran-treated fish. Toxicity of carbofuran on liver, kidney, gills, gonads and muscles after 35 days of exposure was found. Glycogen levels showed a highly significant decrease in liver and gills (p < 0.001), a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in kidney and muscles, and insignificant changes (p > 0.05) in gonads of treated fish. The two metabolic enzymes G6PDH and LDH in all tissues exhibited significant decreases (p < 0.05) in treated fish. SOD, CAT, GSH and GST levels showed significant decreases (p < 0.05) in all tissues of fish after exposure to carbofuran. LPO levels increased significantly (p < 0.05) in all tissues except gonads after 5 weeks of exposure to carbofuran. There was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in DNA fragmentation percentage in treated fish. Our results provide a clear evidence on the response of C gariepinus to sublethal doses of carbofuran and allow us to consider catfish as a good bioindicator to reflect the endocrine disrupting impacts of carbofuran, and reflect the potential of this pesticide to cause disturbance in antioxidant defense system as well as metabolism and induction of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and DNA damage in contaminated ecosystems.

AB  - Antioxidative defenses and more especially catalasic activity (CAT) are studied in a large range of scientific research thematics. In environmental sciences, the problematic of oxidative stress is of great interest as pollutants can induce perturbations of redox homeostasis. Consequently, changes in antioxidative defenses levels in fish tissues and particularly in liver are used as potential biomarkers of pollution. In most studies, the CAT was assayed by following during 5 min the consumption of H2O2 in cytosolic buffered extracts at 240 nm (UV-method). This study proposed a development of this method in the visible, using permanganate and a 525-nm detection, which was more accurate, sensitive, and rapid. Moreover, the hepatic CAT of six different fish species [a cyclidae (Nimbochromis linni), 3 cyprinidae (Brachydanio rerio, Rutilus rutilus, Cyprinus carpio), an anguillidae (Anguilla anguilla), and a percidae (Perca fluviatilus)] was evaluated with the two protocols (UV- and KMnO4-method). The results but also the thermal optimum of the reaction and the interest of CAT as biomarker in ecotoxicology were discussed.

AB  - The effects of vinclozolin (VIN), an anti-androgenic fungicide, on quality, oxidative stress, DNA integrity, and ATP level of sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) spermatozoa were investigated in vitro. Fish spermatozoa were incubated with different concentrations of vinclozolin (0.5, 2, 10, 15, 20 and 50 mu/l) for 2 h. A dose-dependent reduction in spermatozoa motility and velocity was observed at concentrations of 2-50 mu g/l. A dramatic increase in DNA fragmentation was recorded at concentrations 10 mu/l and above. After 2 h exposure at higher test concentrations (10-50 mu/l), oxidative stress was apparent, as reflected by significantly higher levels of protein and lipid oxidation and significantly greater superoxide dismutase activity. Intracellular ATP content of spermatozoa decreased with increasing concentrations of VIN. The results demonstrated that VIN can induce reactive oxygen species stress in fish spermatozoa, which could impair the sperm quality, DNA integrity, ATP content, and the antioxidant defense system.

AB  - The occurrence of pollutants in the aquatic environment can produce severe toxic effects on non-target organisms, including fish. These sources of contamination are numerous and include herbicides, which represent a large group of toxic chemicals. Quinclorac, an herbicide widely applied in agriculture, induces oxidative stress due to free radical generation and changes in the antioxidant defense system. The aim of this study was to assess if dietary diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)(2) has a protective effect in tissues of fish species Cyprinus carpio exposed to the quinclorac herbicide. The fish were fed with either a standard or a diet containing 3.0 mg/Kg of diphenyl diselenide for 60 d. After were exposed to 1 mg/L of Facet (quinclorac commercial formulation) for 192 h. At the end of the experimental period, parameters as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels (TBARS), protein carbonyl, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), nonprotein thiols (NPSH) and ascorbic acid in the liver, gills, brain and muscle were evaluated in Cyprinus carpio. In fish exposed to quinclorac and feeding with standard diet TBARS levels increased in liver and gills. However, SOD activity decreases in liver whereas no alterations were observed in catalase activity in this tissue. Quinclorac also decrease GST activity in liver and brain, NPSH in brain and muscle and ascorbic acid in muscle. Concerning protein carbonyl exposed to herbicide the fish did not show any alterations. The diphenyl diselenide supplemented diet reversed these effects, preventing increases in TBARS levels in liver and gills. CST activity was recovered to control values in liver. NPSH levels in brain and muscle increased remain near to control values. These results indicated that dietary diphenyl diselenide protects tissues against quinclorac induced oxidative stress ameliorating the antioxidant properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This work assessed the subchronic effects of the triazine compounds terbuthylazine and metribuzin on embryo-larval stages of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) using biotransformation enzyme and selected oxidative stress parameters.
   DESIGN: Early developmental stages of fish, from embryo to larvae, were exposed to terbuthylazine at concentrations of 0.9, 160, 520, and 820 mu g L-1, and metribuzin at concentrations of 0.9, 4, 14, and 32 mg L-1 for 30 days and compared to the non-treated control group. For assessment of free radical defence the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured; the lipid peroxidation (TBARS) level was determined as a marker of free radical damage.
   RESULTS: Terbuthylazine had no significant effect (p>0.05) at any tested concentrations on GST activity. Terbuthylazine caused an increase (p<0.05) in GR activity at the concentration of 520 mu g L-1. We found a non-significant (p>0.05) effect of terbuthylazine exposure on TBARS level.
   In metribuzin treated groups, the activity of GST was increased (p<0.05) in all experimental groups, with the highest at the concentration of 32 mg L-1. GR activity was increased in the 0.9, 4, and 14 mg L-1 groups and the TBARS levels were the highest in the 0.9 mg L-1 group.
   CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that terbuthylazine and metribuzin induced oxidative stress in embryo-larval stages of common carp. Increased activities of biotransformation enzymes or antioxidant defence enzymes were markers of free radical attack. There was low lipid peroxidation in early developed fish after triazine exposure.

AB  - Fluquinconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by Ireland, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of fluquinconazole in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC.
   Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of fluquinconazole in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant BASF Aktiengesellschaft made a resubmission application for the inclusion of fluquinconazole in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR and during the PRAPeR expert meetings.
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Ireland being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 13 April 2010.
   In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 26 April 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 9 June 2010.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on fluquinconazole.
   The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use of fluquinconazole as a fungicide on wheat, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative use can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   A data gap was identified in the section analytical methods.
   A conclusion on whether the batches used in the key toxicological studies cover the technical specification cannot be drawn from the available information, leading to a critical area of concern and a data gap. Further data gaps were identified on the relevance of the impurities present in the technical specification and for toxicological information on the triazole derivative plant metabolites (1,2,4-triazole, triazolyl alanine and triazolyl acetic acid).
   The consumer exposure assessment was not finalised. Data gaps are identified in the residue section to provide fluquinconazole supervised residue trials on wheat for southern Europe to complete the residue database and to address the contribution of the potential residues of metabolite dione in rotational crops and also the contribution of the Triazole Derivate Metabolites (TDMs) present in primary crops, processed products, rotational crops and ruminant matrices to the overall consumer exposure.
   The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative use assessed. The potential for groundwater contamination above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L from this use was assessed as low for fluquinconazole and its breakdown product 1,2,4-triazole. For the relevant breakdown product dione, contamination of groundwater might be expected in vulnerable situations as represented by the Hamburg, Kremsmanster, Okehampton and Piacenza FOCUS scenarios (FOCUS annual average recharge concentrations leaving the top 1m soil layer were estimated to be 0.283 to 0.615 mu g/L). Concentrations of this breakdown product were < 0.1 mu g/L at the remaining 5 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Fluquinconazole that enters the atmosphere by the formation of aerosols at the time of spraying may be subject to long range atmospheric transport to remote areas, as it has an atmospheric half-life estimated at longer than 2 days.
   The acute risk to insectivorous mammals (i. e. wood mouse) needs to be further addressed. A high long-term risk to insectivorous and herbivorous birds and mammals was indicated for the representative use, therefore a data gap and a critical area of concern was identified. A low risk to aquatic organisms was assessed. The potential for endocrine disruptive effects on fish were considered calculating the TER based on the ELS endpoint with an assessment factor of 50. However, a data gap was identified to submit the finalised FFLC study. The risk was considered low for bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil-macro and micro-organisms, non-target plants and methods for sewage treatment plants.

AB  - Bromuconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bromuconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 14 November 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 5 May 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience (later Sumitomo Chemical Agro Europe SAS). Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed during a written procedure in February - March 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in July and October 2007.
   A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 26 March 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 136).
   Following the Commission Decision of 3 November 2008 (2008/832/EC)4 concerning the non-inclusion of bromuconazole in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Sumitomo Chemical Agro Europe S.A. made a resubmission application for the inclusion of bromuconazole in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(5). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report (SANCO/120/08) as follows:
   the potential for contamination of surface water and groundwater;
   the high toxicity to aquatic organisms.
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Belgium, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on bromuconazole in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 8 October 2009.
   In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 20 October 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 7 December 2009.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the area of ecotoxicology and to deliver its conclusions on bromuconazole.
   The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a fungicide on wheat. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the same representative use. Full details of the representative use can be found in Appendix A to this report.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, Granit 200 SC.", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC).
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of bromuconazole. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   In mammals, bromuconazole oral LD50 is 328 mg/kg bw (classification as, harmful if swallowed. (Xn; R22), proposed). The acute toxicity by the dermal and inhalation routes is low (LD50>2000 mg/kg bw and LC50 > 5 mg/L). Bromuconazole is neither a skin nor an eye irritant. It is not a skin sensitiser. In repeated dose toxicity studies, the liver is the target organ. In subchronic tests, the dog is the most sensitive species, with an overall relevant NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kg bw/day, whereas in rat the NOAEL is 13.8 mg/kg bw/day. In genotoxicity testing there was some indication of weak clastogenicity in vitro, however there was no indication of positive results in vivo, neither in the micronucleus assay nor in the UDS assay. Overall, bromuconazole was considered devoid of genotoxic potential.
   The relevant NOAEL for long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity in rat is 0.88 mg/kg bw/day: treatment-related neoplastic lesions in rodents occurred at high doses: hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinomas in rats and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. In both rats and mice, the tumours were likely caused by liver toxicity and subsequent cell renewal. Overall, it was agreed that bromuconazole does not have carcinogenic potential relevant to humans. Bromuconazole did not show any reproductive toxicity potential: parental and foetal toxicity NOAELs were established at 1.3 mg/kg bw/day, while the reproductive NOAEL was established at 141 mg/kg bw/day. As for developmental toxicity, in the rat the relevant maternal NOAEL is 70 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the developmental NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day, based on a dose-dependent increase of placental weight and ossification delays or supernumerary bones in a number of skeletal structures. It was agreed to propose classification Cat 3, Xn; R63,, May cause harm to unborn child.. The ADI of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day was set based on the relevant long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity NOAEL of 0.88 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study, applying a safety factor (SF) of 100. For the ARfD, the value is based on the developmental NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day from the rat study, with a SF of 100, leading to an ARfD of 0.1 mg/kg bw. The AOEL of 0.025 mg/kg bw/day was set on basis of the NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day dog study (applying a standard SF of 100). The operator exposure assessment showed exposure levels below the AOEL (15.6%) according to the German model with the use of gloves during mixing/loading and application, and coveralls and sturdy footwear during application. The estimated exposure for re-entry activities (scouting) is 4.5% of the AOEL. The bystander exposure is estimated to be 1.6% of the AOEL.
   The metabolism of bromuconazole was investigated in wheat. Additional metabolism data were submitted for the category of fruit crops. A metabolic pathway could be established in cereals. At harvest, bromuconazole was still a major part of the terminal residue in cereal matrices, and identified metabolites were individually below 10% of the total residue. However, there was an indication of preferential metabolism of one bromuconazole diastereomer (LS 850647), as a significant shift in the ratio of diastereomers was found in the residues determined in the mature cereal crop when compared to the ratio in the initially applied bromuconazole. Whether the ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer was subject to any shift was not investigated. In rotational crops studies there was uptake of residues from soil into succeeding cereal, oilseed, root and leafy crops. Upon analysis of the residues the two bromuconazole diastereomers were identified as major residue, and similar to the primary cereal metabolism their ratio had been shifted compared to the one in the bromuconazole applied to the soil. No information is available on the ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer.
   The submitted livestock metabolism data in ruminants and poultry allows to establish a metabolic pathway, and suggests that no residues in food of animal origin above the limit of quantification are expected when cereals treated according to the cGAP are used in livestock diet. The data imply that there might be preferential metabolism of one diastereomer also in livestock animals. The ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer was not investigated. As plant and livestock residue data indicate that from the representative use no significant consumer exposure to bromuconazole residues is expected, the observed shift of the isomer ratio in the terminal residue is currently not a concern with regard to consumer safety. This may have to be reconsidered when authorisation of uses is sought that lead to consumer exposure to bromuconazole residues above the limit of quantification. The meeting of experts noted that all studies were performed using phenyl-labelled bromuconazole only, and thus the fate of the triazole moiety of the molecule was not investigated. The experts agreed that, based on the available data and information, cleavage of the molecule cannot be excluded and further investigation of the triazole moiety of the molecule is required to address consumer exposure to potential metabolites originating from molecule breakdown, as e.g. triazole derivative metabolites. Until then, the plant and animal residue definition is provisional. Triazole derivative metabolites are considered of concern due to their toxicological profile. In the absence of data investigating the fate of the triazole moiety of the bromuconzole molecule and the magnitude of potentially occurring metabolites originating from the triazole moiety, the consumer exposure cannot be assessed and consequently the consumer risk assessment is not finalised. As a breakdown of the bromuconazole molecule leading to the occurrence of metabolites relevant to consumer safety cannot be excluded, the issue is regarded as a critical area of concern.
   In soil under aerobic conditions bromuconazole exhibits moderate to very high persistence forming several minor (< 10% AR) metabolites. Mineralisation was limited accounting for only 1-4.4% AR after 100-120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 5-17.6 % AR after 100-120 days. A laboratory soil photolysis study indicated that photolysis may contribute to the degradation of bromuconazole at the soil surface. As a consequence, the experts agreed that the available field dissipation rates did not represent biodegradation that can be used as input to FOCUS modelling. However, following the resubmission application, field degradation rates normalised to FOCUS reference conditions that excluded photolysis losses were estimated. These estimates are considered appropriate for use as input to FOCUS modelling. Bromuconazole exhibits medium to low mobility in soil. Bromuconazole is essentially stable to hydrolysis, and photolysis is not expected to be a significant process in the breakdown of bromuconazole in natural aquatic systems. In dark natural sediment water systems bromuconazole partitioned from the water column to sediment where it exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 0.9 % AR at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a sink but represented maximum 15% AR at study end. Satisfactory FOCUS surface water exposure estimates were available for use in the EU level aquatic risk assessment, with spray drift and run-off mitigation being accounted for in step 4 calculations. The potential for groundwater contamination resulting from the representative use assessed, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic conditions represented by all 9 pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   Bromuconazole belongs to the group of triazole fungicides that are suspected to have potential endocrine disrupting properties. No information was provided to address this point with regard to the potential effects on birds and fish, and a data gap was identified. No new information on this point was provided in the Additional Report and the data gap remains.
   The TER values for herbivorous birds were all above the Annex VI triggers, indicating a low risk for herbivorous birds. Also for insectivorous birds the TER values for acute and short-term exposure were well above the trigger, however the long-term TER was below the trigger of 5, indicating a potential high long-term risk. In the Additional Report higher tier studies (mainly from open literature) were presented to select the focal species and to determine the proportion of different food types (PD) of the focal species. Two different approaches were used to refine the risk assessment. The first approach included the selection of representative focal species, and estimations of PD for these species. The second approach was to include the decline of residues in insects (f(twa) = 0.53) in the first-tier long-term risk assessment. The TERlt values based on the PD refinements, and those based on the use of ftwa of decline of residues in insects, were all above the Annex VI trigger values. Therefore the long-term risk to insectivorous birds was assessed as low. The risk to earthworm- and fish-eating birds was assessed as low.
   The acute TERs for herbivorous and insectivorous mammals were above the Annex VI trigger of 10 (including refinement of residues in plant material), however the long-term TERs were below the Annex VI trigger, indicating a high risk. The choice of the long-term end point was discussed again in the experts. meeting (PRAPeR 75), and it was agreed that the NOAEL for mammals of 13.8 mg as/kg bw/d is the relevant ecotoxicological end point. TER calculations for insectivorous mammals based on this NOAEL are provided in the DAR and in the Additional Report and were above the Annex VI trigger value, indicating a low long-term risk for insectivorous mammals. In the resubmission, a higher tier risk assessment for herbivorous mammals was based on the rabbit as focal species in late cereal growth stages. The higher tier risk assessment for herbivorous mammals was discussed in the experts. meeting (PRAPeR 75), and it was concluded that the available information is not sufficient to address the potential high long-term risk for herbivorous mammals. The risk to earthworm- and fish-eating mammals was assessed as low.
   Bromuconazole is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The applicant provided a bridging study with the new formulation SCAE0307 and Daphnia magna. The formulation SCAE0307 is less toxic than the previously assessed formulation EXP 10064-B, and has a toxicity comparable to that of the active substance. Member States experts at PRAPeR 75 agreed that the end points for the active substance should be used in the risk assessment. A low long-term risk was identified from the FOCUS step3 PECsw values in the D3 ditch, D4 pond, D4 stream, D5 pond, D5 stream, D6 pond, R1 pond and R1 stream scenarios. However, a potential high long-term risk was indicated for aquatic invertebrates from the FOCUS step3 PECsw values for the D1 ditch, D1 stream, D2 ditch, D2 stream, R3 stream and R4 stream scenarios, and further refinement was needed. The TERs were re-calculated with a 10m no-spray buffer zone for the drainage scenarios and a 10m no-spray buffer zone including a vegetated filter strip to mitigate the run-off. The long-term TER values were above 10 in 2 full FOCUS run-off scenarios (R3 stream and R4 stream). However, the TER values estimated with the drainage scenarios D1 ditch, D1 stream, D2 ditch, D2 stream were below the Annex VI trigger values even with a 10m no-spray buffer zone. Overall, taking into account the FOCUS step 3 and 4 scenarios, it can be concluded that the risk of bromuconazole to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for more than the half of the scenarios.
   The risk assessment for non-target arthropods was not in accordance with the ESCORT II scheme. The standard glass plate tests suggest that there will be some adverse effects on sensitive non-target arthropods. Extended laboratory studies gave an indication that the risk to non-target arthropods is low. Concerns were raised with regard to the comparability of the different formulations used in the studies with non-target arthropods. EFSA agrees to the assessment of the RMS that the formulations are sufficiently similar to conclude on the risk to non-target arthropods for the representative use. The applicant informed that a different formulation than Granit will be marketed. It is suggested that a risk assessment for this formulation is conducted at Member State level after the decision on Annex I inclusion.
   The formulation Granit had no significant effect on organic matter decomposition over a six months period in a litter bag test at an application rate of 180 g a.s./ha and 500 g a.s./ha. The soil concentration was calculated in the DAR as 0.67 mg a.s./ha. This concentration covers the plateau maximum PECsoil of 0.232 mg a.s./kg soil (2 x 0.200 kg a.s./ha). In conclusion, the risk of bromuconazole to non-target macro-organisms was assessed as low.
   Effects of > 25% on nitrogen transformation were observed at an application rate of 400 g a.s./ha (0.53 mg a.s./kg soil). This concentration covers the plateau maximum PECsoil of 0.232 mg a.s./kg soil (2 x 0.200 kg a.s./ha). The risk of bromuconazole to soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed as low.
   The risk to bees, earthworms, non-target plants, and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.

AB  - Penoxsulam is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC2 Italy received an application from Dow AgroScience for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2004/131/EC .
   Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State Italy made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on penoxsulam, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 10 February 2005.
   The peer review was initiated on 16 February 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed by EFSA. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2006 and January 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with Member States in April 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on rice for the control of Echinochloa crus-galli, sedges and broad leaf weeds as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ` penoxsulam DE-638' (GF-657), an oil dispersion (OD) containing 20.4 g/l of penoxsulam.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant origin and for environmental matrices.
   In the mammalian metabolism studies, penoxsulam was rapidly and almost completely absorbed upon oral administration. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation. Excretion was rapid, but dose and sex dependent as excretion was primarily observed via faeces in males and primarily excreted in urine in females. Penoxsulam was bio-transformed to a large number of metabolites; however the majority of the radioactivity was eliminated as unchanged parent compound. Plant and environmental metabolites BST4 and BSTCA5 were not identified in the rat metabolism studies. Toxicological information was lacking on the metabolite BSTCA to conclude on its relevance as a plant metabolite, moreover, it cannot be ruled out that BSTCA is also relevant according to the guidance document on the relevance of metabolites in groundwater.
   The acute toxicity of penoxsulam was low by the oral, dermal and inhalation route; slight skin and eye irritation were observed, but no potential for skin sensitisation. The dog was found to be the most sensitive species with the kidneys as the main target organ; the overall short-term NOAEL in dogs was 18 mg/kg bw/day. Long-term toxicity reflected the same target organ observed in the short-term studies: the liver in mice and the kidneys in rats. The relevant long-term NOAEL was the dose level of 5 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study. No potential for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed. No effect was seen on the reproductive performance and parameters; no developmental effect was observed either in rats. In rabbits, a slight increase in resorption rate parameters was associated with maternal toxicity, evidenced by gastro-intestinal upset and decreased body weight gain during the middle gestation.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of penoxsulam was 0.05 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL from the 2-year rat study and applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.18 mg/kg bw/day based on the short-term dog studies and a safety factor of 100, no correction factor was needed to account for enteral resorption; no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 10% for both the concentrate and in-use spray dilution of the representative formulation. The level of operator exposure for a maximum application rate of 0.04 kg penoxsulam/ha in rice was below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) according to both the German7 and the UK POEM8 models. Worker and bystander exposure were considered negligible.
   A metabolism study in rice demonstrated that following foliar application of penoxsulam the total residues decreased rapidly to insignificant levels present at harvest of the crop. Therefore, the residue definition in rice grain was proposed as penoxsulam by default.
   In supervised residue trials penoxsulam was found to be always below the Limit of Quantification of 0.01 mg/kg in rice grain, while in rice straw residues ranged up to 0.08 mg/kg. Consequently, an MRL for grain was proposed at 0.01 mg/kg, which is the lowest validated level of the analytical method. For straw an MRL is not required.
   Rice may be grown in monoculture but also in rotation with other crops. A submitted confined crop rotation study showed that after a plant back interval of 90 days low residues could still be found in some crops. Other plant back intervals were not investigated. Moreover, a metabolite BSTCA, identified at significant levels in rotated crops, was neither found in primary crop metabolism nor in rat metabolism. The toxicological relevance of this metabolite for consumer risk assessment could not be addressed. As rotation practices in Member States seem to differ and the submitted data on rotational crops were limited, a final conclusion on the relevance of residues in rotated crops other than cereals could not be reached. Hence the experts agreed that further elaboration on the issue is required. A data requirement for further rotational crop data is proposed.
   If only the scenarios of rice grown in monoculture and of rice rotated with other cereals are considered it can be concluded that exposure to livestock is not expected to be significant. Under these conditions, on the basis of the submitted animal metabolism studies, residues in food of animal origin are expected to occur at extremely low levels that would not be appropriate for monitoring. The experts therefore agreed that, for the time being, it would not be necessary to propose a residue definition and MRLs for food of animal origin. However, it should be noted that the assessment is not finalised with regard to potential livestock exposure to residues in rotational crops other than cereals.
   Consumer exposure to residues of penoxsulam in rice grain is insignificant and thus in a chronic risk assessment intakes were well below to ADI. No acute assessment was conducted as an ARfD was not allocated. However, the consumer risk assessment cannot be finalised with regard to residues of metabolite BSTCA since a lack of sufficient occurrence data and toxicological data was identified. As BSTCA may also occur in drinking water derived from ground water at a level > 0.1 mu g/L, total consumer exposure to BSTCA has to be assessed in order to conclude on the consumer risk assessment.
   Based on the available environmental fate and behaviour studies in soil and 2 field studies in rice paddies, penoxsulam and the breakdown products 5-OH-penoxsulam (max 40.5% applied radioactivity (AR) in soil) and BSTCA (max 53% AR in soil), were concluded as requiring environmental exposure assessments. In a sterilised laboratory aqueous photolysis study TPSA, 2amino-TP and 5-OH-2-amino-TP12 were major metabolites but it was concluded that these did not need to be assessed, as though sought, they were not detected in relevant field studies in rice paddies. Penoxsulam and 5-OH-penoxsulam were characterised as exhibiting moderate persistence in soil with BSTCA exhibiting medium to high persistence. Additionally in aerobic natural sediment water systems the metabolites PCA-5-OH and OH-BSTCA were formed at up to 16% AR (sum of both compounds) in sediment, so exposure assessments were necessary for these metabolites and are available.
   In the aerobic laboratory incubations mineralisation of both the phenyl and the 2-triazolopyrimidine rings to carbon dioxide was low accounting for only 0.3-2.4 % AR after 99 to 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 10-16 % AR in aerobic soil (same radiolabels) after 120 days and 21-58 % AR in aerobic natural sediment water studies after 99 days. Penoxsulam was characterised as exhibiting high to medium mobility, 5-OH-penoxsulam high mobility and BSTCA very high to medium mobility. Further details are necessary regarding a refined higher tier surface water exposure assessment that included definitions of novel scenarios, not prescribed by EU MED-Rice (2003) guidance15. It can be concluded that the potential for penoxsulam or its metabolite 5-OH-penoxsulam to contaminate vulnerable groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L from the applied for intended uses is low. For the metabolite BSTCA the potential to contaminate vulnerable groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is low in situations represented by the MED-Rice clay scenario. However in situations represented by the MED-Rice sand scenario, BSTCA may be present in vulnerable groundwater at > 0. 1 mu g/L (calculations indicate concentrations up to 0.23 mu g/L). Therefore a non-relevance assessment for BSTCA was triggered.
   In the risk assessment for birds, species representing insectivorous birds (wren), omnivorous birds eating large aquatic insects (mallard), omnivorous birds eating aquatic plants (mallard), large herbivorous birds (geese) and piscivorous birds (heron) were considered. All TER values were well above the relevant Annex VI trigger indicating a low risk to birds from the use of penoxsulam in rice paddies. Water vole (small herbivorous mammal), water shrew (eating aquatic invertebrates) and otter (eating fish and amphibians) were selected as focal species for the " in-field" risk assessment for mammals. The lowest TER obtained was 25 for the long-term risk to water vole. Since this was above the relevant Annex VI trigger a low risk was concluded. For both birds and mammals the exposure from intake of contaminated paddy water was included in the estimation of the daily dose by simply adding the drinking water dose to the dietary dose. The log P-ow for penoxsulam is <3 and also the surface water metabolites were considered to have a log P-ow<3, hence the potential for bioaccumulation and secondary poisoning was considered as low.
   Penoxsulam was classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The first tier risk assessment for algae and aquatic plants, based on PECsw in the "off-field" area, gave TERs of 46 and 2.9, respectively. An assessment was provided for fish and aquatic invertebrates in paddy water. No assessment was provided for algae or higher plants in paddy water, considering the herbicidal activity of penoxsulam.
   The lowest acute TER value was 202, which was obtained for Daphnia using the EC50 for the formulation. The lowest long-term TER was 83. It was concluded that the first tier risk to aquatic plants in the "off-field" area was high. Refinements based on a higher tier study with Lemna were not accepted in the peer review, and the risk to aquatic plants remains to be addressed. The risk to aquatic organisms from metabolites was addressed, as was the risk from bioaccumulation (log P-ow<3). The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil micro-organisms and non-target plants was assessed as low.

AB  - Trifluralin is one of the 52 substances of the second stage covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on trifluralin in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 11 July 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 24 July 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier, the European Union Trifluralin Taskforce comprising of Agan Chemical Manufacturers Ltd. and Dintec Agroquimica Produtos Quimicos Lda. at the time of finalisation of the conclusion. Subsequently, the comments received were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 15 January 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April, May and June 2004 (round 1-2 of the EPCO expert meetings).
   A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 10 February 2005 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 14 March 2005 (EFSA Scientific Report (2005) 28)
   Following the Commission Decision of 20 September 2007 (2007/629/EC) 4 concerning the non-inclusion of trifluralin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant, the European Union Trifluralin Taskforce made a resubmission application for the inclusion of trifluralin in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the European Commission review report as follows:
   the high toxicity to aquatic organisms, in particular fish
   the high potential for bioaccumulation
   the high persistence in soil
   the potential for long- range transport via air
   In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Greece, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on trifluralin in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 19 January 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 22 January 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 3 March 2009. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table.
   In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 24 April 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days.
   The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS' evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific meetings and a telephone conference with Member State experts in May 2009.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been reissued to update the risk assessment in the areas of residues, environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology.
   The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprised spraying to bare soil to control grass and broad-leaved weeds in oilseed rape, sunflower, cotton and winter cereals at application rate up to 1.2 kg trifluralin per hectare. The use on winter cereals was no longer supported in the resubmission application, and therefore the conclusion has only been updated in relation to the risk assessment for the representative uses presented in the Additional Report, i.e. use only on oilseed rape, sunflower and cotton at an application rate of up to 1.2 kg trifluralin per hectare. The risk assessment presented for winter cereals has not been updated.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'EF-1521' ('Treflan'), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe. For the uses on oilseed rape, sunflower and cotton, incorporation into soil takes place after the application. Trifluralin can be used only as a pre-sowing/pre-emergence herbicide.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition.
   In the mammalian metabolism studies, trifluralin is extensively and rapidly metabolised. Within 48 hours, 82 % is absorbed and more than 90 % is excreted within 168 hours mainly via bile. It has a low acute toxicity, but displayed sensitising properties and should be labelled with Xi; R43 "May cause sensitisation by skin contact". The relevant oral no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the short-term studies was 2.4 mg/kg bw/day in the 1-year dog study, based on increased liver weight and some minor changes in the chemistry. The dermal and inhalation toxicity after subchronic exposure was low.
   Regarding genotoxic properties of trifluralin it was concluded that trifluralin induces weak clastogenic and aneugenic effects in a number of in vivo and in vitro studies, but this was not confirmed in a more reliable micronucleus test. Trifluralin induced neoplastic changes and carcinogenic effects such as Leydig cell tumours, thyroid tumours, urinary bladder tumours and renal carcinoma in rats. Since no NOAEL could be established, the lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 30 mg/kg bw/day in the rat is assigned as the most relevant effect level. The following risk phrase is proposed Xn; R40 "Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect".
   There were no direct effects on reproductive performance or fertility observed, and the relevant NOAEL for reproduction was set to 4.5-5.8 mg/kg bw/day in the rat based on haematological changes, decreased maternal body weight during gestation and decreased offspring growth and survival, respectively. Trifluralin did not induce teratogenic or fetotoxic effects at non-maternally toxic doses. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 50 mg/kg bw/day in the rabbit based on decreased foetal weight, post implantation losses and reduced body weight, food consumption, respectively.
   The proposed acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the LOAEL in the rat carcinogenicity study with a margin of safety between LOAEL and ADI of 2000, since the ADI is based on a LOAEL value instead of a NOAEL value and that at this dose level tumour formation was evident.
   The proposed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.026 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL in the 90-day mechanistic study in rats using a safety factor of 100. No correction for oral absorption is required.
   No acute reference dose (ArfD) is allocated.
   The outcome of the risk assessment for the plant protection product 'EF-1521' ('Treflan'), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 480 g trifluralin/L showed that the estimated operator exposure levels (according to German model) were below the AOEL only if personal protective equipment (PPE) are used both during mixing/loading (gloves) and application (gloves and coverall). The calculated exposure levels for bystanders were also below the established AOEL. The value of dermal absorption is 10 % for the concentrate and the diluted formulation. There was no need for estimating the worker exposure, since trifluralin is a pre-emergence herbicide applied directly to soil.
   The metabolism of trifluralin was investigated in cereals (maize) and oilseed crops (rapeseed, soybean and cotton). In maize, trifluralin was extensively metabolised and residues were shown to consist of numerous compounds, with few being identified due to their low levels.
   The uptake was also limited in rapeseed with low radioactive residues at harvest. No parent trifluralin was detected in mature seeds and mature plant samples; the major compound identified (ca 35% of the total radioactive residue) was the metabolite TR-145, mainly as conjugate. However, and considering its absolute low level, the PRAPeR 70 meeting of experts on residues agreed not to include this metabolite in the residue definitions. Finally, it was concluded that the residue definitions for risk assessment and monitoring initially proposed by the EPCO 05 meeting of experts for cereals and limited to the parent trifluralin only, are also applicable to the oilseed crops.
   No residues of trifluralin above the limit of quantification (LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg) were detected in any of the grain samples collected in the supervised trials conducted on rapeseed, sunflower and cotton according to the critical GAP in Northern and Southern Europe.
   Processing studies were not submitted and were considered not necessary. Livestock studies were not assessed in the framework of the resubmission since no significant residues are expected in oilseed commodities at harvest.
   The chronic dietary exposure assessment for consumers based on the EFSA PRIMo rev2 and the proposed maximum residue limits (MRLs) of 0.01* mg/kg for rapeseed, sunflower and cotton leads to estimated intakes less than 0.1% of the proposed ADI for all the European diets included in the model. No ARfD was allocated, thus, no acute risk calculation was performed for trifluralin.
   In aerobic conditions degradation of trifluralin in soil did not lead to any major metabolite. Under flooded anaerobic conditions a major metabolite TR-46 is formed. Furthermore, metabolite TR-14 was formed at amounts above 5 % at the end of the study in all three anaerobic soils tested. Due to its potential degradation under aerobic conditions, TR-4 may be addressed by Member States where anaerobic conditions are envisaged to be relevant. Whereas not discussed in particular during the peer review, it is EFSA's opinion that the same conclusion may be reached for metabolite TR-14.
   Under aerobic laboratory conditions trifluralin is medium to highly persistent with half- lives between 81 to 356 days at 22 degrees C. The degradation under anaerobic conditions was faster than under aerobic conditions. Data indicate that trifluralin is strongly adsorbed to soil and could be classified as immobile. Trifluralin is hydrolytically stable under environmentally relevant conditions. Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of trifluralin producing metabolites TR-67 and TR-158. Trifluralin is not readily biodegradable. During the peer review, it was agreed that worst case DT50 = 13 days should be employed for the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion, and that a DT50 = 2 days could be used to refine the risk assessment when appropriate. Due to the potential contribution of photolysis to the dissipation of trifluralin in water, the fate and behaviour in the environment EPCO 02 expert meeting confirmed the need of a water sediment study, conducted in the presence of light, that could be used by Member States to refine the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion. In the resubmission dossier new PEC SW/SED values based on step 3 and step 4 FOCUS SW were provided for trifluralin. In spite of the drawbacks of the calculations available, the PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts concluded that the maximum PECSW and PECSED at step 3 would result from a loading to the water body driven by drift, and a reliable risk assessment would be obtained if this maximum value is used for the risk assessment. However, if information on the pattern of exposure at step 3 or step 4 calculations are needed for the assessment, then the calculations available would be not acceptable and/or would be insufficient to finalize the risk assessment. The PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts identified a data gap for FOCUS SW calculations that provide the information needed to finalize the EU risk assessment. Neither trifluralin nor its anaerobic metabolite TR-4 are expected to contaminate ground water at levels above 0.1 mu g/L under the proposed conditions of use.
   Trifluralin was designated as a "priority substance" under the water framework directive9 but has not been identified as a " priority hazardous substance". However, trifluralin was added to the OSPAR (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North- East Atlantic) List of Chemicals for Priority action in 2002, because it is considered to be a 'PBT' substance fulfilling the criteria for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity.
   Because of its high volatility, the occurrence of trifluralin in air and transport through air is possible. However, photochemical half-life in air is estimated to be short. A data gap was identified by the PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts for the monitoring data in the Arctic regions reported by Canadian researchers and quoted in the report: 'Trifluralin dossier prepared in support of a proposal of trifluralin to be considered as a candidate for inclusion in the Annex I to the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants (LRTAP Protocol on POPs)'. European Commission, DG, Environment, Brussels, July 2007.
   The risk to insectivorous and fish-eating birds and mammals, bees, ground-dwelling arthropods, soil micro-organisms and earthworms is low with respect to trifluralin and the metabolites as far as investigated.
   In the original peer review high risks were identified for aquatic organisms, in particular the chronic risk for fish, which requires consideration of appropriate risk mitigation measures. Using the initial predicted environmental concentrations (PEC's) together with the no observed effect level (NOEC) of 0.3 mu g/L leads to a toxicity exposure ratio (TER)-value of 0.38 when a bufferzone of 15 metres is taken into account, which is below the Annex VI trigger value of 10 (without detailed calculations, a bufferzone of 50 m should lead to a TERvalue of approximately 1). Further data were considered necessary to address this risk and enable conclusions on the risk assessment to be drawn.
   For the resubmission, a new 35-day static early-life-stage (ELS) study was conducted with fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) in a water-sediment system. In addition to the standard observations (i.e. growth and survival), skeletal irregularity was also analysed. The agreed end point from this study was the NOEC of 3.2 mu g a.s./L. However, since no data on the exposure pattern were available, it was not possible to conclude on the final fish chronic end point to be used for the risk assessment. Therefore, the chronic risk assessment for fish could not be finalised.
   Based on the data gap identified at the PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts on environmental fate and behaviour (see section 4.2.1), a data gap was identified to provide a chronic risk assessment for fish based on the most relevant end point and on step 3 and step 4 PECsw values.
   The EPCO 08 expert meeting (section ecotoxicology, June 2004) considered the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals as low, based on the TER value reflecting the soil accumulation plateau. EFSA would like to highlight that the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals should be considered further at Member State level when the product is applied after this plateau value is reached. EFSA initially proposed that a new litterbag study should be made available in which the tested dose rate reflects the concentration in the soil after a single application when the accumulation plateau has been reached, as the study which is available at present was performed at a lower dose rate. This data requirement was not discussed in an EPCO expert meeting. No new litterbag study was provided with the resubmission dossier. However, the PRAPeR 68 meeting of experts considered this study no longer necessary. The data gap was therefore not confirmed.
   The risk to non-target plants could not be calculated with the appropriate end point (median emergence rate (ER50) value) as this value is not reported in the DAR. Based on a conservative no observed effect concentration (NOEC), the risk to non-target plants can be certainly regarded as low if a bufferzone of 5 metres is taken into account.
   Regulation (EC) No 850/2004(10) of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC11 entered into force when the initial peer review of trifluralin was in an advanced stage. For this reason, the original EFSA conclusion finalised on 14 March 2005 (EFSA Scientific Report (2005) 28) did not specifically assess trifluralin against the criteria set in the paragraph 1 of Annex D of the Stockholm Convention(12). In the framework of the resubmission procedure, it was identified that EFSA should compare the agreed end points against the criteria set in the Stockholm Convention. The result of this assessment is presented under the section Conclusions and Recommendations. EFSA acknowledges that the assessment presented in this conclusion only considers a limited range of representative uses on the basis of the information provided by the notifier in the application dossier and the Member States during the peer review. Therefore, other information may need to be considered by the Commission and the Member States when assessing trifluralin with respect to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004.

AB  - N-Acetyl-L-cysteine, a low-molecular weight thiol compound, with two different doses was used to prevent fenthion, an organophosphorus insecticide and acaricide, related oxidative stress in the brain of a model organism, Cyprinus carpio. Fish were exposed to sub-lethal and nominal concentration of fenthion after intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 or 400 mg/kg NAC. Brain tissues were then dissected and homogenized to analyse GSH, GSSG, TBARS, and protein contents. Enzymes that constitute the first line antioxidant defence, namely SOD and CAT, GSH-related enzymes, GR and GST, together with AChE activities were also determined spectrophotometrically. Fenthion did not cause any alteration in SOD and CAT activities while increasing GSH content, GSH/GSSG ratio and GST specific enzyme activity and decreasing GSSG, TBARS, and protein contents. Although, the highest induction in SOD and GST enzymes activities and the highest increase in GSH content were observed in the 0.5 mg/kg NAC-injected fish, their protein contents showed a decrease. 400 mg/kg NAC impeded the activation of the GST enzyme and a higher decrease in lipid peroxidation was observed. Fish were also protected against protein depletion by the higher dose NAC application. AChE activity was not influenced by fenthion exposure. Xenobiotic and GSH transporters may cause mild oxidative stress conditions in brain. Cellular redox status could trigger a series of reactions that result in an increase in SOD activity and a decrease in protein content. Based on the present results, it was suggested that the usefulness of NAC against fenthion depends on applied dose and tissue characteristics. Species-specifity and concentration selection should be taken into consideration in studies dealing with anticholinesterases. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Myclobutanil is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.(2) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on myclobutanil in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 4 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 29 March 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October - November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 14 November 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises air assisted broadcast spraying to table and wine grapes and apples in the fruit development stage, against powdery mildew, black rot and scab, in Northern and Southern Europe, up to a maximum 4 applications at a maximum individual application rate per spray of 48 g a.s./ha on grapes, and 90 g a.s./ha on apples, with an interval of 10 days between applications.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, 'Systhane 20 EW', an emulsion, oil in water (EW) containing 200 g/L myclobutanil.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method.
   In mammals, myclobutanil LD50 is 1600 mg/kg bw ( classification as R22 "Harmful if swallowed" is proposed). It is not toxic via dermal and inhalation routes (LD50 >2000 mg/kg bw and LC50>5.1 mg/L). Myclobutanil is not a skin irritant or a skin sensitiser. The European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) classified myclobutanil with R36 ("Irritating to eyes"). The primary target organ following exposure to myclobutanil is the liver. Myclobutanil induces liver enlargement accompanied by slight induction of biotransformation enzymes (in rats and mice). An overall subchronic NOAEL of 100 ppm was proposed (3.09 mg/kg bw/day). Myclobutanil does not show any genotoxic potential. In long-term studies in rat, the target organ appeared to be the testes (bilateral testicular atrophy and aspermatogenesis). The relevant NOAEL for long-term toxicity is 2.5 mg/kg bw/day from the rat study. Myclobutanil did not show any carcinogenic potential. In a two-generation rat study, myclobutanil, at a dietary concentration of 1000 ppm (80 mg/kg bw/day) produced reduced parental body weight and liver effects and decreased weight gain in pups during lactation; at slight parental toxic doses the number of females delivering litters was reduced and the incidence of stillborn pups increased. The relevant parental, offspring and reproductive NOAEL is 16 mg/kg bw/day. Myclobutanil is already classified as Repr. Cat 3, R63 ("Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"). The relevant parental NOAEL is 94 mg/kg bw/day, while the relevant developmental NOAEL is 31 mg/kg bw/day. No indication of any other neurological effects was found in the toxicological studies. The proposed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is based on the relevant NOAEL from the long-term rat study, applying a safety factor of 100, giving an ADI of 0.025 mg/kg bw/day. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.03 mg/kg bw/day was agreed to be based on the overall NOAEL (90-day and 1-year in dog) of 3.09 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100. The rat developmental toxicity study was considered as the most appropriate to use for setting the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD). An NOAEL of 31.3 mg/kg bw/day was established due to embryotoxic effects (altered viability index). Based on this NOAEL and an assessment factor of 100 the proposed ARfD is 0.31 mg/kg bw. There is a 300-fold margin between the proposed ARfD and the LOAEL for developmental effects in the rat developmental toxicity study. The operator, worker and bystander exposure estimates showed levels below the AOEL even when no PPE is worn (German model).
   The metabolism of myclobutanil was investigated in grapes, apples (representative uses) and additionally in wheat. In grapes and apples at harvest, the major components of the residue were myclobutanil and its metabolite RH-9090(3) in free and conjugated form. A metabolic cleavage of the myclobutanil molecule which would generate triazole derivative metabolites was - in contrast to the wheat study - not observed in apples and grapes. Based on the available plant metabolism data for the categories fruit and cereals it was concluded that the metabolism is not comparable amongst different crop groups. As for the representative uses, however, it was agreed that the relevant residue for the category fruit crops should be defined as myclobutanil and its metabolite RH-9090 (free and conjugated). A sufficient number of residue trials in apples and grapes are available; however, there is still evidence required that the submitted trials cover the proposed residue definition. In processing studies it was investigated how the residue levels of myclobutanil and metabolite RH-9090 change when apples and grapes are processed to juice, wine, puree etc. However, a study investigating the effects of processing on the nature of the residues was identified as necessary since under processing conditions significant amounts of one or more degradation products, initially not present in the raw commodities, could be generated.
   The investigation of residues in rotational and succeeding crops was considered not relevant since both apples and grapes are perennial crops that are usually not grown in rotation with other crops. However it was highlighted that in the long term the issue of potential uptake of triazole derivative metabolites could become relevant and should be followed up separately as this concern is not specific to the active substance myclobutanil alone but common to a number of triazole pesticides.
   Since significant exposure of livestock to residues in feed may occur, a metabolism study in ruminants was triggered. The majority of the experts agreed that the level of identification was insufficient in the available study and thus a robust residue definition for food of animal origin could not be concluded on. Consequently, the relevance of the available feeding study for the assessment and likely necessary MRL proposals for food of animal origin can only be decided on when a residue definition has been concluded.
   As a consequence of the identified data gaps, the consumer risk assessment with regard to the notified representative uses on apples and grapes cannot be finalised. Moreover, the risk assessment with regard to the two isomers of myclobutanil was not addressed.
   It is noted that in addition to exposure from residues in food, the consumer could be exposed to residues of myclobutanil butyric acid, 4 a potential metabolite from ground water used as drinking water, but currently an assessment of the relevance of the metabolite and consequently of consumer risk is not available. An additional exposure to myclobutanil residues from groundwater used as drinking water can also not be excluded.
   In soil under aerobic conditions myclobutanil exhibits high to very high persistence, forming the minor soil metabolite myclobutanil butyric acid (accounting for a maximum of 6% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of both the chlorophenyl and triazole rings to carbon dioxide was limited and accounted for only 0.2 to 1.7% AR after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 4 to 16% AR after 120 days. Myclobutanil exhibits medium to low mobility in soil, myclobutanil butyric acid exhibits very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either myclobutanil or myclobutanil butyric acid was affected significantly by differing soil pH. Data on degradation in soil under anaerobic conditions are not available and it was considered they will be necessary to support the applied for use on apples in some territories of the EU.
   In dark natural sediment water systems myclobutanil partitioned from the water column to sediment where it exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 0.3% AR at 105 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a sink but represented only 4.3 to 9.8% AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for myclobutanil at steps 3 and 4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.
   On the basis of the available reliable information, it cannot be excluded that for the applied for intended uses, groundwater exposure by myclobutanil above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, will not occur over a wide range of European geoclimatic conditions. In addition for the metabolite myclobutanil butyric acid, groundwater exposure above the parametric drinking water limit might be expected and it cannot be excluded that concentrations > 0.75 mu g/L (a key assessment trigger from the groundwater metabolite relevance guidance document) may occur. A groundwater metabolite non relevance assessment is therefore necessary for myclobutanil butyric acid but this assessment is not available.
   The risk to birds and mammals was assessed as low except the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals from the use in apple orchards. A refined risk assessment applying interception factors of 65% and 70% resulted in a TER of 5.18 which is above the Annex VI trigger of 5. The risk of secondary poisoning from uptake of contaminated earthworms was assessed as low. A data gap was identified in the experts. meeting for the submission of a risk assessment for fish-eating birds and mammals since it was not possible to exclude that the logP(ow) of myclobunatil is >3. Myclobutanil is very toxic to aquatic invertebrates. The TERs based on FOCUS step 3 PECsw were above the Annex VI triggers for the representative use on grapes. For the use in apple orchards risk mitigation measures such as a no-spray buffer zone of 14 metres is required to achieve TERs above the Annex VI triggers. The assessment of the logPow value was inconclusive. In the expert meeting a data gap for a bioconcentration study with fish was identified since four applications are foreseen and chronic and repeated exposure of fish is expected. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. It was identified that the risk assessment did not address the potential for different myclobutanil isomer ratios to be present in the environment.

AB  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) produce changes in physiology and behavior via diverse mechanisms including acting as hormone mimics or antagonists, affecting intracellular signaling pathways, and altering hormone production pathways. The fungicide vinclozolin acts as an anti-androgen and is known to affect affiliative behaviors in rodents, fish and amphibians. To investigate the possible effects of exposure to EDCs on reproductive behavior in a wild population of songbirds, we examined the effects of vinclozolin in wild-caught Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis). For this and many other temperate songbird species, testosterone has powerful activational effects on affiliative behaviors in adulthood. We hypothesized that vinclozolin would affect male behaviors associated with female preference. Male juncos received daily oral gavage for 10 weeks with 2 mM vinclozolin in vehicle or vehicle alone. Juncos were photostimulated (16L:8D) to induce breeding behavior. Each pair of a treated and non-treated male was presented to an estrogen-primed female to assess female preference. Seven of eight females exhibited a strong preference for a male exposed to vinclozolin over a control male (p = 0.01). The only significant difference in measured male behaviors was increased beak wiping in controls (p = 0.006) and there was no difference in gonad size or brain weight (p > 0.05 for each). Our data suggest that estrogen-primed female juncos prefer to associate with male juncos exposed to this anti-androgen. This finding demonstrates that environmentally occurring anti-androgens can affect the social behavior of this species. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that vinclozolin has effects on the social behavior of songbirds. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Paraffin oil (CAS 8042-47-5, chain lengths C-18-C-30, reliable boiling point range not available), is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(3). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on paraffin oil (CAS 8042-47-5) in accordance with the provisions of Article 21(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 30 April 2008. The peer review was initiated on 30 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier W. Neudorff GmbH KG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide for use on pome fruit, stone fruit, berry fruits (except strawberry), grapes and ornamentals. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of endpoints.
   The representative formulated products for the evaluation were 'Promanal Neu', an oil in water emulsion (EW).
   Methods of analysis for food items are currently not required see sections 3. For environmental matrices methods are not required for groundwater and air, for surface water a method is required for alkanes (chain lengths up to C-30). For soil it is not concluded if a method is required or not, see sections 4 and 5.
   Sufficient internationally accepted methods e.g. ASTM, ISO are available to characterise the technical material and formulated product. However, at this time the technical specification is not accepted and there is no supporting batch data. Data gaps have been identified for autoflammability, flash point and a shelf-life study.
   During the mammalian toxicology meeting, as no technical specification was agreed by the meeting on physical and chemical properties, concerns were raised over relevant impurities generally associated with these compounds. The specification, as proposed by the notifier, could be accepted on toxicological grounds if its high purity is confirmed by the section on physical and chemical properties. However, while this is not demonstrated, paraffin oils have to be classified as T "Toxic", carcinogenic category 2, R45 "May cause cancer". On this basis, no toxicological studies were required, no ADI, AOEL or ARfD were proposed and no risk assessment of operator, worker and bystander exposure could be conducted as the experts considered that these specifications were not acceptable from the toxicological point of view.
   It was noted however that if highly purified paraffin oils were considered (i.e. no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the active substance), then no toxicological concern would be raised for consumers, operators, workers and bystanders. Sources of mineral oil are laxatives in pharmacology or oils are used in food technology as release agents, for lubrication purposes, or as a substitute for fat. Paraffin oils are chemically inert substances, especially the straight chain (n) alkanes and, on ingestion, most of the mineral oil (about 98 % depending on the length of the C-chain) remains unabsorbed and is rapidly excreted, mostly unchanged, via faeces.
   Paraffin oil has a low toxicity profile. No toxicological study was submitted, except an acute inhalation toxicity study in the rat. The experts agreed that no acute, short-term, long-term, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity studies would be required, provided that no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the substance. Paraffin oils are not considered to be genotoxic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic or toxic to the reproduction. Also, in line with the low toxicity of paraffin oils (of high purity), no ADI, AOEL or ARfD would be proposed, nor considered necessary, and no risk assessment for operators, workers and bystanders would be required.
   The list of endpoint on mammalian toxicology has been filled in considering that the technical material does not contain unacceptable levels of relevant impurities.
   No information on potential levels of residues in food or feed items were presented in the DAR.
   A consumer risk assessment has not been performed due to the possible high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. If these compounds are present then it would result in a toxicological classification that would mean that these compounds could not be registered as Plant Protection Products. The risk to consumers can therefore not be finalised.
   In soil under aerobic conditions this paraffin oil mixture exhibits moderate to medium persistence in terms of the time taken for carbon tetrachloride extracted alkanes to be mineralised. The alkanes in the mixture are classed as immobile in soil on the basis of QSAR estimates, and adsorption is not pH dependent. In a 55 cm deep microcosm study this paraffin oil mixture formed a layer at the water surface (spray application made), where it dissipated rapidly exhibiting low persistence in water. Sediment concentrations were not measured. The mechanism of the dissipation was not identified. Surface water exposure assessments are available using the SWASH drift calculator tool. A data gap is identified regarding the potential for water body associated sediment to be exposed, and information on degradation/dissipation potential of this paraffin oil mixture in sediment. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by alkanes up to C-30 above, the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   Based on the available data, paraffin oil was proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. EFSA re-calculated the TERs after the expert meeting, with the new PECsw and included the values in the final list of endpoints. A high potential acute and chronic risk was identified for Daphnia magna for all the intended uses. Risk mitigation measures were applied to refine the risk in the grapevine and ornamental uses. However, even using the widest no-spray buffer zones (25m for streams and ditches for the pome fruit and grapevine uses and 30m for stream and ditches for the use on ornamentals), the acute and chronic TERs for Daphnia did not meet the Annex VI trigger values for all the intended uses, except for the acute TERs estimated for the grapevine use when a 25m no-spray buffer zone was applied. Further information is necessary to address the risk to aquatic invertebrates for all of the intended uses. The TERs for fish and alga exceeded the Annex VI trigger value based on the use of a 20m no-spray buffer zone for the pome fruit use. However, the TERs estimated for fish and alga were above the Annex VI trigger values without the use of no-spray buffer zones. The risk for fish and algae was assessed to be low for the grapevine and ornamental uses. However, mitigation measures equivalent to 20m are necessary to refine the risk for fish and alga with respect to the pome fruit use. The available information did not allow the risk to sediment dwelling organisms to be assessed.
   The experts meeting agreed that, in absence of data, mitigation measures should be taken to avoid exposure to bees.
   Herbicidal effects of the formulation "Promanal Neu" on vegetative vigour were investigated in tests with six plant species. The lowest ER50 value was observed for Allium cepa ER50 > 17.64 kg a.s./ha for vegetative vigour. The TERs were 4.8 and 5.4 for post-emergence treatments based on PECs from spray drift at 3m and 5m no-spray buffer zones, respectively.
   There was no valid study evaluated in the DAR to assess the effects of paraffin oil on soil non-target macro-organisms. A data gap for information to address this issue was identified.
   The risk to birds and mammals, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target microorganisms and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low.

AB  - Fish (Astyanax sp.) were exposed to water samples from the Arroio Saldanha, locality of an oil spill, and the Barigui River (upstream and downstream of the confluence of the river and Armin Saldanha), Brazil. Histopathological and biochemical biomarkers, as acetylcholinesterase (AchE), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities, lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, and amounts of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon residues (PAHs) in bile were evaluated. PAHs, metals, and surfactants were investigated in the water samples. CAT and GST activities increased in the Arroio Saldanha sample, whereas CAT activity and LPO levels were increased in the upstream and downstream sites. The results suggested a toxic action of the free radicals and disturbance of the antioxidant defense mechanisms. However, the EROD and AchE activities were not affected. Histopathology studies showed severe lesions. The oil is still bioavailable to biota, moreover, other pollution sources continue to affect the water in the Barigui River. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Zeta-cypermethrin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on zeta-cypermethrin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 10 July 2006. The peer review was initiated on 6 October 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant FMC Chemical sprl. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in October 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Fury 10 EW (NP Free)", an emulsion, oil in water (EW) containing 100 g/L (96.9 g/kg) zeta-cypermethrin.
   The technical specification for the active substance was based on pilot scale production and was only partially accepted by the PRAPeR meeting of experts (May 2008).
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant and animal origin, environmental matrices and body fluids and tissues.
   As for mammalian toxicology, the dossier submitted contained studies on both zeta-cypermethrin and cypermethrin. Considering the ratio of the most potent isomers between zeta-cypermethrin and cypermethrin and focusing on neurotoxicity (difference using the NOAELs and LOAELs of rat studies), a factor of 2 could be established showing that zeta-cypermethrin is more toxic than cypermethrin. When orally administered, zeta-cypermethrin is toxic (proposed to be classified T, R25 "toxic if swallowed"). It is harmful for inhalation (Xn, R20). No toxic effects were observed after dermal exposure. It is not irritating to eyes or skin but is a skin sensitizer in a Buehler test (Xi, R43 - "irritant; may cause sensitisation by skin contact"). Neurotoxicity is the target effect of zeta-cypermethrin for short term exposures. The relevant NOAEL of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day is from the 2-year feeding study in dogs. The classification as R48/22 ("danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure, if swallowed") was proposed based on mortality in several studies. Overall, it was concluded that zeta-cypermethrin is neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic under experimental conditions (carcinogenicity was tested with cypermethrin). The relevant long term toxicity and carcinogenicity NOAEL of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day is from the 2-year rat study. The relevant parental and offspring NOAEL in multigeneration studies is 5.9 mg/kg bw/day, while the reproductive NOAEL is 22 mg/kg bw/day. Zeta-cypermethrin was negative for developmental toxicity when tested in rats. The relevant maternal NOAEL in rat and rabbit are 12.5 and >= 120 mg/kg bw/day, respectively; the relevant developmental NOAEL are 35 mg/kg bw/day in rat, and >= 120 mg/kg bw/day in rabbit. Zeta-cypermethrin is a neurotoxic agent (acute and subchronic NOAELs 10 mg/kg bw and 5 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, based on the overall cypermethrin NOAEL for dogs of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day and a 100-fold safety factor with an additional factor of 2 for the higher toxicity of zeta-cypermethrin vs. cypermethrin. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.125 mg/kg bw based on the developmental toxicity study in rats supported by the acute neurotoxicity with zeta-cypermethrin, applying a safety factor (SF) of 100. An acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) of 0.02 mg/kg bw/day was based on the overall cypermethrin NOAEL for dogs of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day using a 100-fold safety factor with an additional factor of 2 for the higher toxicity of zeta-cypermethrin and correcting for 50% oral absorption. The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
   In order to support the uses of zeta-cypermethrin the applicant submitted plant metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin. Several groups of plants were investigated; root crops (sugar beet), cereals (maize), pulses/oilseeds (cotton), fruit crops (apples) and leafy crops (lettuce). The major degradation pathway of cypermethrin starts with the cleavage of the parent molecule to yield cis/trans DCVA(2) and the mPBAldehyde(3), this latter metabolite being further oxidised or reduced to the corresponding mPBAcid(4) or mPBAlcohol(5) followed by conjugations. In most of the plant matrices investigated, unchanged cypermethrin was the predominant residue accounting for more than c.a. 50% of the TRR. The meeting discussed whether the plant metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin were relevant for zeta-cypermethrin and if a preferential metabolism may be suspected for some isomers with a special impact on toxicology. A bridging study on maize detailing the respective metabolism of both cypermethrin and zeta-cypermethrin was provided by the applicant, however, in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. However, and taking into account the no residue situation resulting from the intended uses on cereals, maize and peas, the meeting was of the opinion that the possible isomeric conversion from less to more toxic isomers would not be significant and concluded that a residue definition can be proposed based on the metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin. Finally, it was concluded that a global residue definition has to be proposed in order to take into account the various mixtures of cypermethrin isomers available on the market. Thus, for plants, the residue for monitoring and risk assessment was defined as "cypermethrin, including other mixtures of constituent isomers (sum of isomers)".
   Numerous supervised residue trials performed with zeta-cypermethrin were submitted to propose MRLs. Nevertheless, some of them were rejected since growth stages at application were not in compliance with the critical GAP and/or analytical methods were not sufficiently validated. Finally, MRLs were defined for wheat, triticale and pea without pods and, awaiting the evaluation of additional data provided by the applicant that were not considered during the meeting with regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, provisional MRLs were proposed for maize, barley, oat, pea with pods and pulses. No degradation of residues was observed for zeta-cypermethrin in different plant- and animal matrices when stored under frozen conditions for up to 18 months. Some instability was observed at some time points for the metabolites mPBAcid and cis-DCVA in some animal matrices, but globally, the results were considered acceptable. No processing studies were provided since no significant residues were observed in any commodities supporting the representative uses. However, the EFSA noted that the cypermethrin hydrolysis breakdown product, mPBAldehyde, was found in a tomato processing study, and this compound is suspected of endocrine activity. This concern was considered to be not relevant for the intended uses supported in the DAR but the meeting noted that this point has to be re-considered if additional uses are envisaged.
   Lactating cow and laying hen metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin were evaluated. The major route of degradation consisted of the hydrolysis of ester linkage to generate the cis and trans DCVA moiety and the mPBAldehyde that undergoes further oxidation and/or reduction to the corresponding acid (mPBAcid) or alcohol (mPBAlcohol) and their hydroxy products. The metabolism of the cyclopropyl moiety was considered as insufficiently investigated in the ruminant metabolism study as in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the additional data from literature presented in the addendum of May 2008, could not be considered in the peer review. This point remains open and has to be reconsidered. Nevertheless, and taking into account the complete metabolic pathway in poultry, and the data from the rat metabolism study indicating a similar pathway, the meeting of experts concluded that there was enough evidence to propose the residue for monitoring and risk assessment for animal products as "cypermethrin, including other mixtures of constituent isomers (sum of isomers)".
   Considering the potential livestock exposure to zeta-cypermethrin residues through consumption of treated feed items (maize, cereals, pea and pulses), feeding studies indicate that no measurable residues may be present above the LOQ in the different animal-products and the MRLs for animal commodities were proposed at LOQ values. Considering the representative uses and the toxicological endpoints set for zeta-cypermethrin, no chronic or acute concerns were observed, the theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) being less than 2% of the ADI and the maximum national estimated short term intake (NESTI) less than 1% of ARfD. In addition, the meeting concluded on the need for a global risk assessment taking into account the other sources of exposure resulting from the uses of all other cyprermethrin isomer mixtures available on the market and their respective toxicological reference values.
   In soil under aerobic conditions zeta-cypermethrin exhibits low to medium persistence forming the soil metabolites DCVA6 (accounting for up to 24% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low persistence and mPBAcid (accounting for up to 8.4 % AR in the available guideline study or 29.5% AR in a study with limited sampling intervals) which also exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation of both the cyclopropyl- and benzyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 25-27% AR after 91 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 12-26 % AR after 91 days. Isomers of cypermethrin are immobile in soil, DCVA exhibits very high mobility in soil and mPBAcid exhibits high to medium mobility. There was no indication that the soil adsorption of isomers of cypermethrin was pH dependent. There was no clear evidence that the soil adsorption of DCVA or mPBAcid was pH dependant. A data gap was identified for a satisfactory aerobic soil laboratory route of degradation study dosed with zeta-cypermethrin, which is necessary to ensure thatall potential soil metabolites that might reach levels that trigger a groundwater exposure assessment have been identified. The available route of degradation study that used cypermethrin as the test substance was considered insufficient to address the presence of zeta-cypermethrin metabolites at the 5% AR trigger for leaching assessment level as prescribed in agreed EU guidance.
   In dark natural sediment water systems zeta-cypermethrin partitioned rapidly from water to sediment where it degraded exhibiting low persistence to the metabolites mPBAcid and DCVA, which were present predominantly in the water phase where they exhibited medium to high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 22 % AR (cyclopropyl label) and 58% AR (phenyl label) at 99 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a significant sink representing 16-27 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for component isomers of the active substance at step 1. Step 3 and 4 calculations are also available (but only for surface water and not sediment), with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. However, these calculations did not adhere to the FOCUS surface water guidance, so a data gap is identified for more appropriate calculations, therefore only relatively crude estimates of surface water exposure are available for the aquatic risk assessment. For the metabolites mPBAcid and DCVA appropriate FOCUS step 1 exposure assessments were agreed by the peer review. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by component isomers of the active substance, mPBAcid and trans-DCVA above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However the groundwater exposure assessment for metabolites cannot be finalised until the data gap identified for a satisfactory soil route of degradation study is filled.
   The risk to mammals and the acute and short-term risk to birds were assessed as low but a potential high long-term risk to insectivorous birds cannot be excluded for all representative uses evaluated. A data gap was identified for further refinement of the risk assessment for insectivorous birds. Zeta-cypermethrin is very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The aquatic risk assessment was based on preliminary FOCUS step 4 PECsw values which included a 20m no-spray buffer zone. The acute TERs for fish exceeded the Annex VI trigger of 100 in all scenarios for the use in cereals and in all scenarios except R3 and R4 for the use in peas. However no full scenario resulted in a TER of >100 for the use in maize and the long-term TERs were significantly below the Annex VI trigger of 10 in all scenarios even with a no-spray buffer zone of 20m. A data gap was identified for further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment. Two mesocosm studies with zeta-cypermethrin were submitted by the applicant, however, in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. The risk to aquatic organisms from the metabolites cis-DCVA, trans-DCVA and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (mPBAcid) was assessed as low. Zeta-cypermethrin is very toxic to bees. A potential high risk was indicated in the first-tier risk assessment. The mortality of adult bees was increased in higher tier tests during the first 1-4 days after treatment. No impact on bee brood development was observed but it was noted that no reserves were accumulated in the bee hives. This observation may be explained by the repellent effect of zeta-cypermethrin. The experts considered the risk to bees as low for the use in cereals which are considered as not attractive for bees. Risk mitigation measures such as no application during flowering were proposed for the use in peas. The higher tier studies did not cover the application rate in maize and a data gap was identified to address the risk to bees further. A high in-field risk to non-target arthropods was indicated from the standard laboratory and the extended laboratory tests. The applied doses in the field tests were too low for the representative uses and a data gap was identified to address further the in-field and the off-field risk to non-target arthropods for all representative uses. Although formally not triggered, the experts considered it necessary to address the risk to soil dwelling mites and collembola because of the potential high risk to arthropods. It was suggested that investigation of soil dwelling mites and collembola should be included in a field study with non-target arthropods. The study on effects on respiration of activated sewage sludge was assessed as not valid. A new study was submitted by the applicant but in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review.
   The risk to earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants was assessed as low.

AB  - Sulcotrione is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on sulcotrione in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 9 August 2006. The peer review was initiated on 15 September 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded to by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March April 2008.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a herbicide on maize. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Mikado", a suspension concentrate (SC).
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. It is noted that the residue definitions for soil and water are not yet finalised. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Data gaps have been identified for the specification, and for a new method of analysis for sulcotrione in air.
   In the mammalian metabolism studies, sulcotrione was rapidly and completely absorbed and excreted after oral administration. It was poorly distributed into tissues and organs, and metabolism was limited. The acute toxicity of sulcotrione was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route. It did not present eye or skin irritation properties; however, it was proposed to classify the active substance with risk phrase R43 "may cause sensitisation by skin contact" as a high rate of sensitisation was observed in a Magnusson & Kligman test. Sulcotrione is a 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitor, a key enzyme of the tyrosine catabolic pathway, resulting in increased 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate, the proximal tyrosine metabolite and increased blood tyrosine concentration. Male rats were recognised as being more sensitive to sulcotrione and primary effects in short term and long term studies were characterized by corneal lesions and increased liver and kidney weights associated with histopathological findings. Corneal lesions have been shown to be irrelevant for human risk assessment, but liver and mainly kidney effects were considered as sulcotrione-mediated effects (opposed to tyrosinaemia-related effects) and relevant for human risk assessment. The relevant NOAEL for short term exposure was the dose level of 3.3 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat study, while after long term exposure, only a LOAEL could be determined, at 0.04 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study.
   Inconsistent results were obtained from genotoxicity studies, some positive in vitro tests were obtained as well as one out of three in vivo micronucleus assays. Higher relevance was given to a negative in vivo UDS assay and it was concluded, based on the weight of evidence, that sulcotrione had no genotoxic potential in vivo. No potential for carcinogenicity was found either.
   Reproduction toxicity studies reflected the same effects in parents, but abnormalities of the urinary tract were increased in pups of both generations, not observed in the first parental animals, and on this basis, a classification with Xn, R63 "possible risk of harm to the unborn child" was proposed. The relevant NOAEL (parental) was the dose level of 0.06 mg/kg bw/day, while offspring's NOAEL was 0.6 mg/kg bw/day, no effect on the reproduction or fertility was observed. No developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits when sulcotrione was administered by oral gavage and no neurotoxicity was attributed to sulcotrione administration.
   A data package of studies was provided on the metabolite CMBA(2), a significant metabolite in plant and the environment, but found only in traces in mammalian metabolism. CMBA was found to be severely irritant to eyes, where it is predominantly formed, at least in the rat, but it did not cause tyrosinaemia and showed to be less toxic than the parent compound. An ADI of 0.2 mg/kg bw/day was set for the metabolite and no relevance was attributed when found in groundwater, even above the threshold value of 0.1 mu g/L.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of sulcotrione was 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure (AOEL) was 0.0006 mg/kg bw/day and no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 0.1 % for the concentrate formulation and 0.5 % for the in-use spray dilution, based on an in vitro dermal penetration study through human epidermis. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation Mikado, at a maximum dose rate of 0.45kg sulcotrione/ha exceeded the AOEL according to the UK POEM, even when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was considered; according to the German model, estimated exposure was below the AOEL if PPE as gloves during mixing/loading and application, and coverall and sturdy footwear during application were worn. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with sulcotrione was below the AOEL, even when no PPE was considered. Bystander's exposure was low compared to the AOEL value.
   The metabolism of sulcotrione in maize was investigated after post emergence application reflecting the representative use supported by the applicant. The metabolic degradation of sulcotrione is essentially focused to the cyclohexanedione ring and the formation of CMBA. CMBA was the only significant metabolite formed and only occurs at significant levels in the forage. The meeting of experts PRAPeR 45 agreed that it should be included in the residue definition for risk assessment. However, the animal metabolism study where CMBA was dosed showed that no significant residues will occur. Therefore the risk assessment would not have changed except that the ADI has been lowered. Revised TMDI calculations showed intakes at 31 % of the ADI. As CMBA is a significant but non relevant metabolite in ground water at a level above 0.75 p.g/L a consumer risk assessment is required. The risk assessment for CMBA gives a highest intake of <0.2 % of the ADI for CMBA. An acute risk assessment was not necessary as no ARM has been set.
   In soil under aerobic conditions sulcotrione exhibits moderate to medium persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 2.5-73.8 % applied radioactivity (AR) after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting up to 26.5 % AR after 120 days. The major metabolite CMBA was detected in soil at maximum level of 60% AR. Sulcotrione and CMBA exhibit very high mobility in soil. Adsorption of sulcotrione is not only determined by the organic carbon content of the soil but at least also by the pH value, which itself correlated to the organic carbon content. There was no evidence of a correlation of adsorption with soil pH. In dark natural sediment water systems sulcotrione degraded exhibiting moderate persistence in the whole system forming the metabolite CMBA (max. 42.2% AR in water and max. 18.6% AR in sediment). The final products of degradation in water-sediment systems were carbon dioxide and bound residues (max 6 and 9% AR after 100 days). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for sulcotrione at steps 1-3. For the metabolite CMBA appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.
   The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by sulcotrione above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low for geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. CMBA concentrations (80th percentile annual average concentration at 1 m) are in the range of 0.015 1.462 mu g/L. The concentration of 0.1 mu g/L is exceeded in 6 out of 8 European FOCUS scenarios parameterised for maize and for Hamburg and Okehampton scenarios the estimated PECgw are > 0.75 mu g/L. The toxicological assessment was able to conclude that CMBA is not relevant regarding groundwater at the expected concentrations.
   As the fate and behaviour of sulcotrione in the environment was investigated using phenyl-labelled sulcotrione only, the peer review process identified a data gap for an aerobic soil degradation study and for a water-sediment study performed with cyclohexanedione-labelled sulcotrione or for evidence to demonstrate that potential metabolites containing the cyclohexanedione ring are labile. Sulcotrione is not expected to be transferred to the atmospheric compartment and potential for long range transport may be considered negligible.
   The first tier acute and short-term TERs for birds and the acute TERs for mammals were above the Annex VI trigger of 10. The first-tier long-term TERs were below the trigger of 5 indicating a potential high long-term risk. The refined risk assessment for medium herbivorous birds resulted in TERs >5 based on residue decline. The experts rejected the suggested PT refinements for insectivorous birds since they were not sufficiently supported by data. A data gap was identified in the expert meeting for the applicant to provide a new refined long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds. A new study was submitted by the applicant and a refined risk assessment based on this study was included by the RMS in the not peer-reviewed addendum 3 from May 2008. The long-term risk to mammals was refined by using residue decline data and the new (higher) long-term endpoint agreed in the experts meeting. Based on the agreed refinements (without PT refinement) the long-term TERs were above the trigger of 5 indicating a low long-term risk to mammals. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water and the risk from the major plant metabolite CMBA to birds and mammals were assessed as low.
   Sulcotrione is of low acute toxicity to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The lowest endpoint was observed for aquatic plants. The TERs for all groups of aquatic organisms were greater than the Annex VI triggers of 100 and 10 except for Lemna gibba. One (R4 stream) out of seven FOCUS step 3 scenarios resulted in a TER <10 for Lemna gibba. Risk mitigation measures are required under environmental conditions represented by scenario R4. The metabolite CMBA is of low toxicity to aquatic organisms including Lemna gibba. The Annex VI triggers were exceeded with FOCUS step2 PECsw values.
   The risk to the standard non-target arthropod indicator species Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri was assessed as low. Additional species were tested and no effects of >50% were observed in tests with Poecilus cupreus and Aleochara bilineata. Effects of >50% were observed in tests with Coccinella septempunctata and Pardosa sp at the suggested application rate of 450g sulcotrione/ha. The risk to C. septempunctata was assessed as low in higher tier (extended laboratory) studies. Several extended laboratory studies were conducted with Pardosa sp. After 42 days of ageing the residues still led to a statistically significantly increased mortality. No increased mortality was observed after 56 days of ageing of residues. Although the effects were <50% it is uncertain if recolonisation would occur in a real field situation due to the long persistence of effects. No further information was made available to demonstrate recovery/recolonisation of spiders in the in-field area. The LR50 for Pardosa sp. was calculated as 10.34g a.s./ha which is below the calculated off-field exposure rate of 12.47g a.s./ha indicating a potential high risk for spiders in the off-field area. It was agreed by the experts that risk mitigation measures comparable to a 5m in-field no-spray buffer zone should be applied to ensure that recolonisation of the in-field area is possible from unaffected off field areas. A potential high risk was identified for non-target plants in the off-field area. Risk mitigation measures comparable to a no-spray buffer zone of 10m is recommended. The risk to bees, earthworms, soil non-target macro- and micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low for the representative use in maize.

AB  - Abamectin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on abamectin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 27 October 2005. The peer review was initiated on 1 September 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the main applicant Syngenta. Probelte also submitted a dossier which was found to be substantially incomplete. A third notifier, Sinon EU Cooperation did not provide a dossier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded to by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in July - August 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in November - December 2007.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in April May 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide on citrus, lettuce and tomatoes. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Vertimec 018 EC", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).
   Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The specification of the technical material can not be concluded on as the batch data were not acceptable and a data gap has been identified. The purity of all the starting material used in the manufacturing process has not been provided and this is also now a data gap. The strain of the micro organism used in production has not been provided. The purity of the material used in the spectra study is also identified as a data gap.
   With regard to its toxicological properties, abamectin is almost completely absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract of the rat, widely distributed throughout tissues and organs, and rapidly eliminated from the body. Abamectin is very toxic by inhalation and if swallowed (T+, R26/28). Short term studies in dogs, the most sensitive species, showed a very steep dose response for clinical signs of neurotoxicity and mortality, however without histopathological correlates in the nervous tissues. Therefore the classification with '1'; R48/25 Toxic, Danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed' was proposed for abamectin. With regard to genotoxicity and long term toxicity, abamectin had no mutagenic or carcinogenic potential. In the reproductive toxicity studies, there were no strong effects on the reproductive parameters triggering classification, and the findings in neonatal rats were attributed to a higher sensitivity related to a limited expression of Pglycoprotein, not relevant to humans. Nevertheless, the teratogenic observations in rats and rabbits led to the proposed classification 'Repro. Cat.3, R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child'. With regard to specific neurotoxic effects, only clinical signs were observed in the acute and semi-chronic neurotoxicity studies. Several studies were performed with the [8,9-Z]-isomer of avermectin Bia (acute oral toxicity, Ames test, one-generation study, developmental studies) and showed the same toxicological profile as abamectin.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) are 0.0025 mg/kg bw/day based on the short term dog studies, whereas the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.005 mg/kg bw based on the acute neurotoxicity study. All were derived with a safety factor of 100. The agreed dermal absorption value was 1% for both the concentrate and the dilution. Different scenarios were considered in the operator exposure assessment, and the use of personal protective equipment was needed only during treatment of tomatoes in greenhouse, in order to have an exposure estimate below the AOEL.
   The metabolism of abamectin in plants has been elucidated and essentially results from photolysis. The major degradation product is the [8,9-Z]-isomer. The residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in plant commodities should include avermectin Bia, its [8,9-Z]-isomer and avermectin Bib which may account for up to 20 % of technical abamectin. Further degradations products of moderate polarity do not need to be included in the definition as their contribution to the toxicological burden is not expected to be significant. Supervised residue trials were conducted and form a sufficient basis for setting MRLs and for assessing consumer exposure. Nevertheless some deficiencies were identified on lettuce grown outdoor and for lettuce and tomatoes grown indoor in winter season. Indications are present that under conditions of low photolysis residues may be much higher and it is recommended not to use abamectin in glasshouse from November to February. This restriction could be cancelled on the basis of appropriate residue trials conducted in winter conditions allowing a robust consumer exposure assessment to be made.
   Limited information is available on the effect of processing on abamectin residues. Standard hydrolysis studies in buffer solution show a limited degradation of the compound but the resulting degradation products are considered of the same level of toxicity as the parent compound. Therefore no reducing factor related to processing should be used in risk assessment involving processed commodities.
   Residues in rotational crops are not expected.
   The potential critical exposure of livestock to abamectin residues was determined by the RMS on theoretical grounds. This exposure may result in residues in animal commodities in the range of the limit of quantification of avermectin Bia of the validated method of analysis used for enforcement. Nevertheless the setting of residue definitions and MRLs in animal commodities was considered not needed as these would be covered by the legal provisions already in force as a result of the use of abamectin as veterinary drug.
   The short and long term consumer exposure assessments showed that acute and chronic intakes of residues resulting from the representative uses are below respective toxicological reference values. These assessments do not consider the winter use of abamectin in glasshouse.
   It was accepted that the environmental fate and behaviour of the avermectin Bia component of abamectin would be expected to be representative for the environmental behaviour of the avermectin Bib component. In soil under aerobic conditions avermectin Bia exhibits very low to medium persistence forming the soil metabolites: 8a-oxo-avermectin Bia, 8a-hydroxy-avermectin Bia and 4,8a-dihydroxy-avermectin Bia which exhibited moderate to medium persistence and 8a-oxo-4hydroxy-avermectin Bia which exhibited medium to high persistence. Mineralisation of both the applied 23-C-14-radiolabel and 3,7,11,13,23-C-14-radiolabels to carbon dioxide was relatively limited accounting for 3.2-12.4% AR after 90-147 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 24-39 % of the applied 23-C-14-radiolabel after 90-91 days. Avermectin Bia is immobile or exhibits low mobility in soil with the 4 metabolites indicated above also exhibiting low mobility or being immobile in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of any of these compounds was pH dependant. There was an unidentified soil metabolite ascribed as U8 present in soil that triggers a groundwater exposure assessment. However such an assessment is not available. There was no satisfactory evidence presented that enabled the potential soil mobility of U8 to be characterised.
   In dark natural sediment water systems avermectin Bia partitioned to sediment where it degraded exhibiting medium persistence with the minor metabolite 4"-oxo-avermectin Bia in sediment (max. 8.6%AR) representing the greatest proportion of AR of the 4 metabolites identified. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 0.1-3 % of the applied 23-C-14-radiolabel at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a major sink representing 20-23 % of this radiolabel at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for abamectin at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the soil metabolites 8aoxo-avermectin Bla, 8a-hydroxy-avermectin Bla, 4, 8a-dihy droxy-avermectin B la, 4-hydroxy-8a-oxoavermectin Bia that may runoff or drain to surface water appropriate FOCUS surface water step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. Under sterile laboratory aqueous photolysis conditions the metabolite [8,9-Z]-isomer of avermectin Bia was formed at a maximum of 8.2%AR. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by avermectin Bia, 8a-oxo-avermectin Bia, 8a-hydroxy-avermectin Bia, 4,8a-dihy droxy-avermectin Bla and 4-hydroxy-8a-oxo-avermectin Bla above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 lag/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios.
   The acute and short-term risk to birds was assessed as low for all uses. However, the long term risk to birds was assessed as high for the uses in lettuce and tomatoes and a refined long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds is needed. In citrus orchards the long-term risk to birds is acceptable after refinement (initial insect residues). The risk to fish-eating and earthworm-eating birds is low.
   The acute risk to mammals is considered to be low. However a long term risk to mammals cannot be excluded. For the uses in citrus orchards and lettuce a refined risk assessment is needed. The risk to fish-eating and earthworm-eating mammals is low.
   Abamectin is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The risk assessment for aquatic organisms is driven by the toxicity to invertebrates and fish. To refine the first tier high risk to invertebrates two outdoor microcosm studies were submitted. In one study a renewal of the test medium was allowed (renewal within 5.9 d) and in the other study a conventional static system was used.. It was concluded by the PRAPeR meeting that the NOEC from the renewal study (0.2 lag a.s./L) can be used for risk assessment of ditches and streams. A safety factor of 2 should be used because not all species groups were included in the study. The NOEAEC of 0.049 lig a.s./L from the study with a conventional static system together with a safety factor of 3 was agreed upon and should be used for ponds and the glasshouse applications. Based on the endpoints from the outdoor microcosm studies it can be concluded that a safe use with respect to aquatic invertebrates is demonstrated only for the use in lettuce in the field (pond scenario) and the use in lettuce and tomatoes in glasshouses (ditch). For all the other uses and scenarios the risk is not acceptable without sufficient risk mitigation measures (for example no-spray bufferzones varying from 14 (stream scenario) 18 m (ditch scenario) for applications in citrus and 2 m for the applications in tomatoes and lettuce).
   The relevant regulatory endpoint for the acute risk assessment for fish was the mean HC5 based on LC50-values (= 3.08 lag a.s./L) with a safety factor of 10 = 0.31 lig a.s./L. Based on this value the use in citrus needs a bufferzone of minimal 10 m. For the other uses no additional bufferzones are necessary. For the chronic risk assessment to fish an HC5 of 0.22 lig a.s./L was agreed upon. Based on this value the use in citrus needs a buffer zone of minimal 12 m for the use in orchards. For the other uses no additional buffer zones are necessary.
   The risk of the soil metabolites and the aquatic photolysis metabolite to aquatic organisms has not been addressed in a sufficient way by the applicant and should be addressed further. Also the risk of the sediment metabolite 4"-oxo-avermectin Bia to sediment dwelling organisms should be addressed. The risk of bioconcentration in fish was assessed as low.
   The risk of abamectin to bees was assessed as high. The following labelling is suggested: "Dangerous to bees. To protect bees and other pollinating insects do not apply to crop plants when in flower. Do not use where bees are actively foraging. Do not apply when flowering weeds are present." For the use in tomatoes in glasshouses a minimum waiting period of at least 96 h should be applied before bees/bumblebees are used as pollinators in the glasshouse.
   Abamectin is very toxic to non-target arthropods. It was concluded in the PRAPeR Meeting that no acceptable off-field risk has been shown. Aged residue tests are not accepted to conclude about non flying insects off-field. Buffer zones in-field are required for acceptable off-field risk.
   Based on the results of the extended laboratory tests with Typhlodromus pyri it was concluded that for the use in citrus a buffer zone of minimal 15 m is needed to get an acceptable off-field risk.
   For the field uses in lettuce and tomatoes this buffer zone should be 5 m.
   For earthworms the acute and long-term TERs for abamectin were above the relevant trigger values of 10 and 5 indicating a low risk to earthworms. The risk from the soil metabolites to earthworms is low as well.
   For soil micro-organisms it is concluded that the risk from the active compound and soil metabolites is low for the representative uses evaluated. Since no or slight herbicidal effects were observed at in-field treatment rates the risk in the off-field area for non-target plants is considered to be low for all representative uses evaluated. It is not expected that abamectin would reach biological sewage treatment plants in relevant amounts if applied according to the GAP and therefore the risk to biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.

AB  - Epoxiconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on epoxiconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 28 April 2005. The peer review was initiated on 7 October 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF as identified by the rapporteur Member State. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in July - September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007 (in all sections) and in May 2007 (only ecotox).
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place in a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on cereals and sugar beet. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Opus", a suspension concentrate (SC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of epoxiconazole.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. It has been identified that more information is necessary to enable the impact of potential different isomer ratios on the risk assessments to be better characterised
   Mammalian toxicology of epoxiconazole was assessed in a row of tests. Epoxiconazole is absorbed rapidly but only to a limited extent (about 50%) after oral administration in rats. It is widely distributed in the body and although epoxiconazole has no potential for accumulation its elimination is slow. The substance is mainly excreted via faeces (about 78%) and urine (about 17%). Metabolism is rapid and extensive. At least 47 different metabolites have been identified in the rat. The active substance is of low acute toxicity by the oral, dermal and inhalation route. It is neither irritant to the skin nor to the eyes and has no skin sensitising potential.
   The liver has been identified as the main target of toxicity in repeated dose tests with rats, mice and dogs. Epoxiconazole does not have genotoxic potential in vitro and in vivo. In a 24-months study in rats liver toxicity was observed and additionally ovary- and adrenal gland tumours were seen. In a 18 month carcinogenicity study in mice a treatment related increase in liver tumours has been observed based on which a classification of epoxiconazole as Xn; Care. Cat. 3 R40 "Harmful; Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect" was proposed. Based on the effects on reproduction seen in a two generation study in rats (dystocia, impaired fertility, prolonged gestation and vaginal haemorrhages) it was concluded to propose a classification with Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R62 "Harmful; Possible risk of impaired fertility". Based on developmental effects such as increases in number of resorptions, skeletal variations and malformations observed in relevant studies in rats and rabbits also a classification with Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R 63 "Harmful; Possible risk of harm to the unborn child" was proposed. Results from new in vitro studies and a new developmental study in rats confirm that epoxiconazole has endocrine disrupting properties but do not merit changing relevant NOAELs or revising the proposed classification according to an evaluation by the rapporteur Member State.
   However, these new data have not been peer reviewed.
   The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.008 mg/kg bw/d derived from an 18-month carcinogenicity study in mice applying a safety factor of 100. An acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.023 mg/kg bw has been derived based on the effects observed in two generation reproduction study in rats applying a safety factor of 100. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) of 0.008 mg/kg bw/d was derived from a subchronic dog study applying a safety factor of 100. In consideration of a dermal absorption of 50% both for the concentrate and the diluted preparation (the default value agreed upon by the majority of experts at PRAPeR 19, March 2007) the exposure estimates for operators were 39% and 700% of the AOEL when wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) with the German model and the UK POEM respectively. When no PPE is worn the values rise to 991% and 4918% respectively. Exposures for re-entry workers were amounted to 55.8% (without PPE) and 2.8% (with PPE) of the systemic AOEL respectively. Exposure of bystanders was estimated to amount to 3.75% of the systemic AOEL.
   The metabolism of epoxiconazole in plants after foliar application is limited. Accordingly the proposed residue definition for monitoring is restricted to the parent compound. Indications are present that the accumulation of triazole metabolites in cereal grains is limited but due to some inadequacies in the design of the wheat metabolism study a firm conclusion on this is not possible.
   A sufficient amount of supervised residue trials are available and MRL can be proposed covering the representative uses in cereals and sugar beets in both Northern and Southern European regions. The nature of the residue is not altered by processing. Processing data show that residues are preferably transferred to the bran fraction during the milling process and that no residue above the limit of quantification (LOQ) is expected to be present in beer from the brewing process.
   Uptake of soil residues by rotational crops is not expected to lead to epoxiconazole residues above the LOQ. In contrast, a significant uptake of triazole metabolites (triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid) has been demonstrated at least for cereals.
   Feed commodities from cereals and sugar beets may represent a significant source of exposure to epoxiconazole residues for animals Livestock metabolism studies in lactating goats and laying hens are available and based on the metabolic pattern in animal tissues the residue definition for monitoring can be restricted to the parent compound. Feeding studies in dairy cows are available and appropriate MRLs for animal products can be proposed.
   For the time being the residue definition in plant and animal products for risk assessment is restricted to the parent compound. Inclusion of triazole derivative metabolites in this definition will need to be considered at a later stage.
   These compounds (mainly triazole, triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid) which are common metabolites of all triazole fungicides have been recognized as hazards given their impact on reproduction. Toxicological reference values have been agreed by the PRAPeR expert meeting 14 on toxicology in January 2007.
   Chronic and acute consumer exposures assessments have been carried out for parent compound only and were found to be well below the respective toxicological trigger values of epoxiconazole. Therefore provisionally no risk for the consumer has been identified under restriction of an uncertainty related to the isomer ratio consumer is actually exposed to. A robust conclusion on the risk will be possible when information on the actual level of triazole derivative metabolites in primary crops, rotational crops, and products of animal origin will be available. It must be noted that this lack of data is a generic issue and concerns all active substances of the triazole chemical class when their degradation pathway in primary crops, soil and livestock involves a cleavage of the triazole ring.
   Sufficient data were available to demonstrate that in soil epoxiconazole exhibits medium to very high persistence. The available laboratory studies did not identify any major (> 10% AR) soil metabolites. One metabolite appearing in minor (max. 6.6% AR after 175 days) amounts is 1,2,4-triazole. Other possible degradation products after separation of the aromatic rings are simple monohalogenated acids. Metabolite 1,2,4-triazole is rapidly degraded by soil micro-organisms and it has low persistence, with a reported laboratory mean half-life of 8 days. In anaerobic soils, the first step in degradation is cleavage of the oxirane ring resulting in the formation of the alcohol, which is readilydehydrated to the alkene BF 480 entriazole (max. 8.6% AR after 120 days). Epoxiconazole is quite stable at soil surfaces under the influence of light.
   Epoxiconazole is slightly to moderately adsorbed to soil and the leaching potential is low. Lysimeter studies were not triggered and FOCUS PEC groundwater calculations revealed no risk for groundwater contamination for the active substance or 1,2,4-triazole. A plateau concentration in soil of 0.167 mg/kg for epoxiconazole was calculated based on field accumulation studies.
   Epoxiconazole and 1,2,4-triazole are hydrolytically stable at pH 5, 7 and 9. They are also stable under the influence of light in aqueous buffer solutions. However, in a sensitized photolysis study with natural water, epoxiconazole degraded with a half life of 52 days.
   After a rapid sorption of the parent compound to the sediment, the predominant metabolite in both investigated water/sediment systems was BF 480-entriazole, being almost exclusively detected in the sediment phase (max. 32.3% AR after 59 days). Once in the sediment, BF 480-entriazole degrades with first order DT50 of 32-65 days. Besides CO2, no further degradation products of epoxiconazole were detected in significant amounts in both test systems during the incubation period. The calculated first order half lives of epoxiconazole for the total systems were 68 and 172 days. Some uncertainties were found in the assessment of the accumulation potential of BF 480-entriazole in sediment.
   The volatilization experiments showed that epoxiconazole exhibits a very low average volatilization rate from plant and soil surfaces. It is not a relevant pathway for dissipation. If it however reached the troposphere it would be degraded with a half life of 4 days indicating a potential for long range atmospheric transport. After the experts' meeting the rapporteur Member State re-estimated a half-life of 1.83 days, but the calculation is not peer reviewed.
   The first tier TER values indicated a potential high long-term risk to birds and mammals Measured residues were accepted in the expert meeting to refine the RUD values for herbivorous birds and mammals and to set the multiple application factor (MAF) to 1 provided that the residue studies were conducted with an application interval equal or lower than the interval of 21 days as suggested GAP. Whether it is sufficiently justified to use a MAF of 1 although intervals between applications were above 21 days for about half of the residues studies needs to be evaluated further at Member State level. The DT50 refinement for residue decline in plants was also discussed and it is suggested to use the geometric mean value of 14.5 days based on the available residue data. The suggested refinements of PT and PD used in the long-term risk assessment for birds were not sufficiently supported by data and therefore rejected in the meeting of experts. A data gap was identified for further refinement of the long-term risk assessment for birds.
   The hare (Lepus europaeus), common vole (Microtus arvalis) and wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) were chosen as focal species to refine the long-term risk assessment for herbivorous mammals. The experts agreed to use the hare and the wood mouse as focal species in the refined risk assessment as suggested in addendum 2. The proposed PT value of 0.3 for hare was not accepted by the meeting since it was not based on radio-tracking data. It was considered not appropriate to derive an exact PT value from the submitted information. However the TER is >5 even without PT refinement and hence the risk to medium herbivorous mammals is considered as low. The suggested PT refinement for wood mouse was not agreed. The experts concluded that the submitted information is not sufficient to derive a robust quantitative PT refinement. The use of interception factors for residues on arthropods was also rejected. The suggested PD refinement was accepted. The resulting long-term TER of 3.9 is below the trigger of 5 indicating the need for further refinement of the risk assessment. A new long-term risk assessment for wood mouse was submitted by the applicant and assessed by the rapporteur Member State in addendum 4(not peer-reviewed).The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low as well as the risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water.
   Algae and Lemna gibba were the most sensitive tested organisms. In order to detect long-term effects on fish a 28 d prolonged toxicity test, an early life stage test and three full life cycle tests were performed in order to investigate potential endocrine effects. A new test with Lemna gibba was perfumed and evaluated in addendum 2. The experts agreed to the assessment of the rapporteur Member State. The endpoint (7d EbC(50) = 0.0043 mg a.s./L) derived from standard test conditions should be used in the risk assessment. The endpoint derived from the test system with sediment present was considered as not being of direct use in the risk assessment since epoxiconazole partitions rapidly to the sediment and thus reducing the exposure of free floating Lemna fronds. The TERs were above the trigger of 10 in only 2 FOCUS step3 part scenarios (D4 pond, D5 pond) out of 9. No full FOCUS step 3 scenario resulted in TERs above the trigger. The available full life cycle studies with fish were discussed in the expert meeting. It was agreed that the latest study where fish were exposed to a single peak of epoxiconazole could be used in the risk assessment. The experts agreed that a NOEC of 0.03 mg a.s./L can be used in the risk assessment. The effect observed on male vitellogenin levels (NOEC = 0.012 mg a.s./L) was considered as not relevant since it did not affect the reproductive performance of the tested animals The long-term TERs for fish were above the trigger of 10 for all 9 FOCUS part scenarios as well as the TERs calculated with time weighted PECsw and the lower long-term endpoint for fish (NOEC of 0.01 mg a.s./L) which was based on effects on growth in one of the fish full life cycle tests conducted under flow-through conditions. Epoxiconazole was of similar toxicity to algae when formulated but was significantly more toxic to fish. The acute TERs for fish were above the trigger of 100 in the FOCUS step3 part scenarios D4 (pond) and D5 (pond). In the part scenario D4 (stream) a TER of 99 was calculated which is close to the trigger of 100. Taking into consideration that part of the active substance reach the surface water via drainage and run-off and thus not as the intact formulation the rapporteur Member State concludes that the acute risk to fish from the formulation BAS 480 13 F to fish is addressed for the full FOCUS scenario D4 (pond and stream). EFSA agrees to the opinion of the rapporteur Member State. The risk of bioaccumulation (BCF = 70) was assessed as low. The metabolites 1,2,4-triazole and BF480-entriazole were less toxic to aquatic organisms and the risk posed to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for the representative uses in cereals. The TERs for sediment dwellers was calculated as 5.3 and 40.3 (depending on the test system from which the endpoint was derived). Overall it is concluded that the aquatic risk assessment needs further refinement and/or risk mitigation such as no-spray buffer zones.
   The acute risk of epoxiconazole to earthworms is low but the first tier long term TER values were below the Annex VI trigger of 5. Field studies were conducted to assess the effects of continued use of epoxiconazole on earthworm populations in treated fields and also a terrestrial model ecosystemstudy. The presented studies had some limitations but the long-term risk to earthworms and soil dwelling arthropods was sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated if all the available information is considered together
   The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.

AB  - Cyanobacteria ("blue-green algae") from marine and freshwater habitats are known to produce a diverse array of toxic or otherwise bioactive metabolites. However, the functional role of the vast majority of these compounds, particularly in terms of the physiology and ecology of the cyanobacteria that produce them, remains largely unknown. A limited number of studies have suggested that some of the compounds may have ecological roles as allelochemicals, specifically including compounds that may inhibit competing sympatric macrophytes, algae and microbes. These allelochemicals may also play a role in defense against potential predators and grazers, particularly aquatic invertebrates and their larvae. This review will discuss the existing evidence for the allelochemical roles of cyanobacterial toxins, as well as the potential for development and application of these compounds as algaecides, herbicides and insecticides, and specifically present relevant results from investigations into toxins of cyanobacteria from the Florida Everglades and associated waterways.

AB  - The paper presents experimental data on the determination of some Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) present in surface waters which might affect environmental quality and human health by up taking them through food chain. For this purpose specific terms have been defined for the risk assessment of population exposed to POPs. Evolution of spatial and temporal pesticide use imposes consideration of geographical, social and economical factors. All the ecosystem trophic rings, plankton, rush, periphyton and fish, accumulate significant quantities of toxic agents, these being potentially dangerous, via uptaken by food, to human health.

AB  - Prothioconazole is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC' United Kingdom received an application from Bayer CropScience for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/35/EC2.
   Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on prothioconazole, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 18 October 2004. This draft assessment report was distributed for consultation to the Member States and the notifier on 21 October 2004.
   The peer review was initiated on 21 October 2004 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed during a written procedure in January 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2006.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 25 April 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar application to wheat, rye, triticale, barley, oats and oilseed rape and as a seed treatment to the same crops excluding oilseed rape. Full details of the application rates and timings can be found in the attached end points. There are two representative formulated products evaluated Proline an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation and Redigo a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) formulation.
   Methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food of plant origin, water, soil and air. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi method (The German S19 method has been validated for prothioconazole-desthio). Only single methods are available to determine residues of prothioconazole-desthio, in products of animal origin and prothioconazole, prothioconazole-desthio in soil water and air. A method is not available to monitor the glucuronide conjugate in products of animal origin. Also if the active is classified as toxic then methods for body fluids and tissues would need to be considered. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Methods for the relevant impurities in the formulation are not available.
   Prothioconazole is of low acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity; it does not show any eye and skin irritation or sensitising potential. The relevant short term oral NOAEL is 25 mg/kg bw/day and the chronic NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day (the liver being the main target organ with increases in hepatic enzyme activity, increased liver weights and hepatocellular hypertrophy were consistent with hepatic enzyme induction). Prothioconazole does not show in vivo genotoxic and carcinogenic potential. The relevant reproductive NOAEL is 95.6 mg/kg bw/day, while the developmental NOAEL is 20 mg/kg bw/day. In rats, an increased incidence of microphthalmia was observed at the high dose level. The increased incidence of rudimentary supernumerary ribs at the high dose level was also considered to be treatment related. Hence, prothioconazole was proposed to be classified as Repro cat 3, R 63 (Repro cat 2?), based on the increased incidences of microphthalmia (at 1000 mg/kg, maternal toxic dose) in one out of two rat strains tested. Prothioconazole did not show toxicity to the nervous system. The proposed ADI for prothioconazole is 0.05 mg/kg bw/day, and the ARM and AOEL are 0.2 mg/kg bw. The estimated operator exposure to the 250 EC formulation is below the AOEL when PPE is worn for mechanical spraying in cereals, using the UK-POEM and the German model. The exposure of operators working at the treatment of seeds with the prothioconazole FS formulation accounts for about 45% of the AOEL for operators performing mixing/loading/calibration/cleaning and bagging. For sowing, the estimated exposure is about 2% of the AOEL. The exposure of workers after spraying in cereals is about 45% of the AOEL. Estimated exposure of bystanders is negligible The main metabolite prothioconazole-desthio, M04, is considered relevant. An ADI of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day was set based on the NOAEL of 1.1 mg/kg bw/day (liver histopathology and reduced weight gain in the rat carcinogenicity study), applying a 100 fold assessment factor. The ARM was discussed in the experts' meeting: the experts agreed on the NOAEL from the rat developmental study (1 mg/kg bw/day), based on an increase in supernumerary ribs at 3 mg/kg bw/day, with a SF 100. The same value of 0.01 mg/kg bw was considered as an AOEL. M04 was toxic for the development in rats and rabbits and the classification Repro.cat.2, R61 was proposed by the experts.
   The metabolism of prothioconazole has been fully investigated in cereals, oilseeds, rotational crops as well as in livestock and mainly proceeds through oxidative reactions. In most plant parts and animal tissues, the major compound of the metabolic pattern is prothioconazole-desthio, which is more toxic than the parent compound. Given the complex plant and animal metabolic pattern and to reflect adequately the toxicological burden the consumer is exposed to, the residue definition for risk assessment in all commodities is the sum of prothioconazole-desthio and all metabolites containing the 2-(1-chlorocyclopropy1)-3-(2-chloropheny1)-2-hydroxypropyl-2H-1,2,4-triazole moiety, expressed as prothioconazole-desthio.
   This residue definition for risk assessment is however provisional as beside the metabolites which are structurally related to the parent compound, cereal grains, oilseeds, rotational crops and animal products are expected to contain significant amounts of non specific triazole derivative metabolites. These compounds (mainly triazole, triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid) which are common metabolites of all triazole fungicides have been recognized as hazards given their impact on reproduction. Toxicological reference values have been agreed by the PRAPeR expert meeting 14 on toxicology in January 2007.
   The monitoring of plant and animal commodities can be targeted on prothioconazole-desthio, but in animal tissue, its glucuronide conjugate needs to be included in the analysis. A sufficient amount of data has been submitted in order to set MRLs. Chronic and acute consumer exposures are well below the respective toxicological trigger values allocated to prothioconazole-desthio. This assessment was conducted on the basis of the provisional residue definition for risk assessment and does not cover the triazole derivative metabolites. A robust conclusion on the risk for the consumer cannot be finalised at this stage. Information on the actual level of those derivatives in primary crops, rotational crops, and products of animal origin is lacking. It must be noted that this lack of data is a generic issue and concerns all active substances of the triazole chemical class whose degradation pathway in primary crops, soil and livestock involves a cleavage of the triazole ring.
   The available studies on the environmental fate and behaviour of prothioconazole indicated that there is no potential for persistence or accumulation of prothioconazole and its degradation products in the environmental compartments. Prothioconazole is of low persistence in soil in both laboratory and field studies (lab DT50 = 0.07-1.27 days; field DT50 = 1.3-2.8 days, median = 1.6 day). The major metabolites formed in soil, i.e. prothioconazole-desthio (M04, max. 49.4% AR) and prothioconazoleS-methyl (M01, max. 14.6% AR), are more persistent (in laboratory studies DT50 for MO1 = 5.9-46.0 days, and DT50 for M04 = 7.0-34.0 days). Under field conditions, the dissipation time for prothioconazole-desthio was estimated to be in the range of 16.3-72.3 days. In all field trials no residues of prothioconazole or of its metabolites were detected below 20 cm depth of soils. These findings confirmed the results obtained from different laboratory mobility studies, which showed that prothioconazole is of low mobility (K0. = 1765 mLig, determined in aged column leaching study), as well as prothioconazole-S-methyl and prothioconazole-desthio (Kf0. = 1974 - 2995 mL/g and 523 625 mLig, respectively). Exposure assessment with FOCUS-PELMO model indicated that no concerns related to groundwater contamination by prothioconazole or its metabolite prothioconazoledesthio (M04) and prothioconazole-S-methyl (M01) are to be expected. From soil photolysis studies, there appeared to be no significant influence of light on the rate of degradation of prothioconazole. Prothioconazole is considered stable to hydrolysis and hydrolytic breakdown will not contribute to the degradation of prothioconazole in the aquatic environment. Whenever surface water will be contaminated by the parent compound, solar radiation may contribute to the degradation of prothioconazole via phototransformation reactions (predicted environmental half-life under June solar summer conditions of 11 days in Athens, Greece). Prothioconazole-desthio (M04) was identified as the main photolytic degradation product (max. 56% AR). Other two major degradation products were identified as prothioconazole-thiazocine (M12) at 14% AR and 1,2,4-triazole (M13) at 12% AR. Taking into account the fast dissipation of prothioconazole from the water phase (DT5owater = 0.8-1.0 days at 20 degrees C in the dark) observed in a water/sediment study, it is unlikely that prothioconazolethiazocine (M12) will be formed at >10% in natural surface water systems under realistic environmental conditions. 1,2,4-triazole (M13) shows no light adsorption above 290 nm and is regarded as stable to photolytic degradation in water. Prothioconazole rapidly disappeared from two aerobic natural water/sediment systems, with a calculated half-life of 1.6-2.8 days referring to the whole system. A proportion of prothioconazole partitioned quite rapidly into the sediment (max 22.623.4% AR in the sediment on day 1), but there is also rapid degradation to prothioconazole-desthio (M04), which can also partition into sediment (max 26.9% AR). Another metabolite exceeding 10% of the applied radioactivity in the water layer was identified as L2,4-triazole (M13, max. 37.2% AR). No DT50 values for metabolites were available. Predicted Environmental Concentration in surface water (PECsw) and sediment (PECsed) were estimated for prothioconazole, prothioconazole-desthio (M04) and 1,2,4-triazole (no PECsed calculations provided as not being a major metabolite in sediment) assuming spray drift from the maximum three recommended foliar applications.
   Based on the results concerning vapour pressure, Henry Law constant and photo oxidative stability in ambient air, it can be concluded that neither emission of prothioconazole into the air, nor accumulation and contamination by wet or dry deposition are to be expected for the parent compound and its metabolite prothioconazole-desthio (M04).
   The risk to birds and mammals from the use of prothioconazole as a foliar application in cereals and oilseed rape is considered to be low. The assessment of long-term risk for birds and mammals from the use as cereal seed treatment indicates a high risk based on the available and peer reviewed data and information. Risk mitigation measures to reduce spray drift input comparable to 5 m spray free buffer zones are required to protect the aquatic environment based on the currently evaluated data and information. EFSA recommends that the available full life cycle study with the metabolite prothioconazole-desthio is evaluated before a final conclusion on the risk to fish is drawn. Furthermore, bioconcentration of prothioconazole-S-methyl should be considered at Member State level should MS surface water exposure assessment show that this metabolite may contaminate surface water from drainage and/or run-off. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, other non-target soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non -target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low

AB  - Fish skin mucus contains a variety of antimicrobial proteins and peptides that seem to play a role in self defense. We previously reported an antibacterial protein in the skin secretion of the rockfish, Sebastes schlegeli, which showed selective antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. This study aimed to isolate and structurally and functionally characterize this protein. The antibacterial protein, termed SSAP ( S. schlegeli antibacterial protein), was purified to homogeneity by lectin affinity column chromatography, anion-exchange HPLC and hydroxyapatite HPLC. It was found to be a glycoprotein containing N-linked glycochains and FAD. Its molecular mass was estimated to be 120 kDa by gel filtration HPLC and 53 kDa by SDS/PAGE, suggesting that it is a homodimer. On the basis of the partial amino-acid sequence determined, a full-length cDNA of 2037 bp including an ORF of 1662 bp that encodes 554 amino-acid residues was cloned by 3 ' RACE, 5 ' RACE and RT-PCR. A blast search showed that a mature protein (496 residues) is homologous to L-amino acid oxidase (LAO) family proteins. SSAP was determined to have LAO activity by the H2O2-generation assay and substrate specificity for only L-Lys with a K-m of 0.19 mM. It showed potent antibacterial activity against fish pathogens such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida and Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida. The antibacterial activity was completely lost on the addition of catalase, confirming that H2O2 is responsible for the growth inhibition. This study identifies SSAP as a new member of the LAO family and reveals LAO involvement in the innate immunity of fish skin.

AB  - Benfuracarb is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on benfuracarb in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 2 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 17 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Otsuka Chemical Co., Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 7 March 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises incorporation into soil (pre-plantation) to control soil and foliar insects, where brassica will be grown. Benfuracarb can be used as insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process only the use as insecticide was evaluated. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Oncol 8.6G", a granule (GR), registered in France and Spain.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food of plant origin and surface water.
   Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Benfuracarb is rapidly and nearly completed absorbed reaching in the rat. The main metabolite of benfuracarb is carbofuran (approximately 30%). The acute inhalatory toxicity is high, whereas the oral toxicity moderate. The toxicity via dermal route was low. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant nor a skin sensitizer, proposed risk phrases are: T, R23 "Toxic by inhalation" and R22 "Harmful if swallowed" The critical effects are cholinesterase inhibition. Effects on reproduction parameters were observed such as, decreased male fertility, number of live pups and pup weight was decreased, even the entire second generation was lost The appropriate classification for reproduction toxicity could not be agreed and the question should be forwarded to ECB, R62 is high lighted. ECB has concluded R62 but not voted.
   The main metabolite of benfuracarb is the active ingredient carbofuran which is more toxic than benfuracarb. The relevant impurity 1,2 dichloroethane, is classified as toxic, Carcinogenic Category 2 (T; R45).
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100.
   The default value of 100% was agreed on for the granular formulation Oncol 8.6 G as no studies were provided. The estimated operator exposure according to the US PHED model is below (86%) the AOEL only if personal protective equipment as well as respiratory equipment is used.
   The metabolism, distribution and residue behaviour of benfuracarb was investigated in various crops with different methods of application and at different timings. Based on studies involving a foliar treatment or stem injection a metabolic pathway of benfuracarb in directly treated plants could be established. Currently, benfuracarb, carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran were considered the relevant residues to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. Whether this will be fully applicable to all crops and regardless the mode of application still needs to be confirmed by further data, since the available data on soil applied uses didnt sufficiently identify potentially relevant metabolites for the supported brassica uses. Moreover a need to address residues of carbofuran in succeeding crops following application of benfuracarb was identified.
   Based on the currently proposed residue definition, supervised residue trials in cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage indicated that no residues above the respective LOQ are anticipated, however the validity of the results needs to be confirmed by further data. Moreover the residue trial database for brassicas needs to be completed.
   With the current knowledge and limited data available and with the provisionally agreed toxicological reference values for carbofuran it is only possible to asses consumer risk preliminary.
   Consumer risk has been separately assessed by the rapporteur Member State for benfuracarb residues and for carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran residues. The estimated chronic dietary intake of benfuracarb and its metabolites carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran was found to be below the ADI of benfuracarb and carbofuran, respectively. A potential acute exposure concern noted for adults and toddlers (up to 370% of carbofuran ARfD) consuming head and flowering brassicas, is primarily caused by the limited sensitivity of the analytical methods applied in the residue trials. In the acute and chronic consumer risk assessment the possible intake of carbofuran through drinking water derived from groundwater was not considered although a significant contribution to the acute and chronic exposure might be expected.
   Benfuracarb is rapidly degraded in soil under laboratory dark aerobic conditions yielding carbofuran (maximum 84.6 % AR after 2 d) as major metabolite. This metabolite is low to moderate persistent in soil according the studies presented in the benfuracarb dossier, but may be high persistent according some studies presented by a different applicant in the carbofuran dossier. Relevance of carbofuran data for the assessment of benfuracarb may need further consideration.
   Other minor metabolites were detected (maximum sum of them: 34.9 % AR after 0.24 d) that individually did not reached the 10 % AR. Mineralization was high at the end of the study (CO2 = 27.7 % AR - 66.6 % AR). Amount of unextractable residues reached a maximum = 74.1 % at the end of the study in one of the soils.
   Experts meeting agreed that 3-ketocarbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran (minor carbofuran metabolites containing the carbamate moiety) need to be addressed, as potential benfuracarb soil metabolites, for ground water contamination.
   The applicant was required to address the degradation of benfuracarb in alkaline soils. A position paper and a new study are available but are still neither evaluated nor peer reviewed.
   No soil photolysis study has been provided for benfuracarb. Carbofuran is photolytically stable on soil surface, according the data available in carbofuran dossier.
   Degradation of carbofuran seems to be very dependent of the temperature. The rapporteur Member State informed that the applicant had submitted a position paper and a new study to address the degradation of carbofuran at low temperatures but these reports have still not been evaluated and peer reviewed.
   Worst case laboratory half lives were used to calculate PEC soil of benfuracarb. Data from a different applicant in carbosulfan dossier show that field worst case half life for carbofuran is 71.9 d in EU sites. Therefore, carbofuran PECs soil were calculated by the rapporteur Member State with this half life. According the conclusion for carbofuran, reliability of this value needs to be further assessed and confirmed.
   It was estimated, by the HPLC method, that benfuracarb may be classified as immobile in soil (K-oc = 9100 mL / g). Carbofuran may be classified as very high mobile compound (K-oc = 17 - 28 mL / g). No data is available with respect the adsorption desorption properties of minor relevant soil metabolites 3-OH-carbofuran and 3-keto-carbofuran.
   A lysimeter study is available where two different lysimeters are investigated. Benfuracarb was found at maximum amounts of 0.25 mu g / L and carbofuran at maximum amounts of 0.16 mu g / L. A new lysimeter study was required by the rapporteur Member State in the DAR. The meeting of MS experts agreed that the new FOCUS GW modelling required can substitute the requirement for a new lysimeter at this stage.
   Hydrolysis of benfuracarb is pH dependent with half lives between less than half hour (pH 4) and 26.9 d (pH 9). In the natural water experiment (pH approximate to 7-8) photolysis seems not to contribute significantly to the aqueous degradation of benfuracarb. However, irradiation seems to enhance the degradation of the metabolite carbofuran to carbofuran-7-phenol.
   Benfuracarb is not readily biodegradable.
   A study with two water sediment systems is available. Both systems are in the alkaline range (pH (water) 7.8-8.4). Main compounds found in the water phase are benfuracarb and carbofuran (maximum = 58.26 % AR after 2d). Main compounds found in the sediment phase are carbofuran (maximum = 25.31 % after 14 d) and carbofuran-7-phenol (maximum = 13.6 %). The cumulative amounts of CO2 at the end of the study accounted for 13.6 % AR and 16.7 % AR. Most of the radioactivity was present as bounded residue to the sediment by the end of the study (73.8 % AR = 75.9 % AR).
   Benfuracarb dissipates rapidly in water phase with a half life between 6 h to 15 h. Main dissipation process is transformation to carbofuran. Carbofuran dissipates from water phase with half life between 8.2 d to 27.2 d. Main dissipation process is partitioning into sediment. Whole system and sediment phase half lives had not been calculated. A report with the estimation of the whole system half life is available but not evaluated and peer reviewed. Also the half life in the sediment for carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol needs to be assessed.
   In the carbofuran dossier, dissipation of carbofuran in the water sediment was investigated in two studies with a total of three systems. In an acidic system carbofuran degraded in the whole system with a half life of approximately 41 d. In the neutral or alkaline systems carbofuran dissipated from the water phase with half lives of 5.3-6.9 d and degraded in the whole system with half lives of 7.8 - 11.6 d. These experiments seem to indicate that the degradation of carbofuran may be pH dependent in water sediment systems.
   PECSW of carbofuran has been calculated for a limited number of FOCUS sw scenarios. Calculation of PECSW, for parent benfuracarb and PECSED for benfuracarb, carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol, need to be performed. Updated FOCUS PECSW / (SED) are available but have still not been evaluated and peer reviewed.
   PEC gw have been calculated for benfuracarb and carbofuran. Annual average 80th percentiles of benfuracarb were < 0.001 mu g / L for all calculated scenarios (7 cabbage spring, 5 cabbage summer). Carbofuran exceed the 0.1 mu g / L trigger in 4 of the 7 spring scenarios and in three of the five summer scenarios. In one of the summer scenarios (Hamburg) an 80th percentile annual average of 1.212 mu g / L was reached. The applicant was required to address the potential for ground water contamination by the metabolite 3-keto carbofuran. New calculations to address potential groundwater contamination by metabolites 3-OH-carbofuran, carbofuran-7-phenol and 3-keto-carbofuran are available but neither evaluated nor peer reviewed. However, it is noted that these calculations do not take into consideration the longer half lives observed for carbofuran from the data of the second carbofuran applicant.
   Concentrations of benfuracarb in the air compartment are expected to be negligible, due to short persistence in the atmosphere.
   An addendum to the fate and behaviour chapter has been provided the 18th of May 2006. The information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability. Studies or reports presumably submitted by the applicant are not adequately referenced.
   Substantial data requirements to address the risk to birds and mammals from uptake of granules, ingestion of treated seedlings and contaminated earthworms were identified by the rapporteur Member State. Further studies were submitted by the applicant. The aquatic risk assessment based on PECsw from drainage resulted in a high acute and chronic risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates in 2 out of 3 scenarios. Based on the peer-reviewed data a high risk to aquatic organisms cannot be excluded. However the new data need to be evaluated before drawing a final conclusion on the risk to aquatic organisms. The risk to bees from exposure to residues in cabbage was assessed as low since cabbage has no flower in the production crop. The potential risk to bees from residues in flowering weeds should be assessed at Member State level taking into account the agricultural practice (management of weeds in cabbage fields). Data requirements were identified in the DAR to address the risk to ground dwelling arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and other non-target organisms. New data/information was submitted by the applicant. An addendum to the chapter on ecotoxicology has been provided on the 18th of May 2006. When reported, the information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability.
   The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative use.

   Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on carbosulfan in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 11 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 17 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant FMC Chemical sprl. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises incorporation into soil (at drilling) to control soil insects, where maize and sugar beet will be grew. The application rate is 0.75 kg carbosulfan per hectare. Carbosulfan can be used as insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process only the use as insecticide was evaluated.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Marshal 10G", a granule (GR), registered in some Member States of the EU.
   It should be noted that the applicant no longer supports the second formulation, presented in the dossier and DAR ("Marshal 25CS"). Consequently the uses on citrus and cotton are no longer supported.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food of plant origin, soil and water.
   Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Carbosulfan is toxic if swallowed and should be classified as T, R25 "Toxic if swallowed". It is of low toxicity via dermal route and toxic via inhalation (classification as T, R23 is proposed).
   Carbosulfan is not a skin or eye irritant but is a skin sensitiser and should be classified R43 "May cause sensitisation by skin contact". Carbosulfan gave negative results in in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests and did not show any carcinogenic potential. Nevertheless, the level of impurities in batches used for toxicological studies remains a concern. In the three-generation rat study, the relevant maternal and reproductive NOAEL was 1.2 mg/kg bw/day. In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, the relevant maternal and developmental NOAEL was 2 mg/kg bw/d. Carbosulfan displayed no potential for induced delayed neurotoxicity. The provisional reference values are as follows: ADI and ARfD are 0.01 mg/kg bw/day; AOEL is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day. The risk assessment for operators has to be considered as inconclusive until the AOEL is confirmed. However, it can be assumed that bystander and worker exposure is likely to be negligible under the supported conditions of use.
   The metabolism, distribution and residue behaviour of carbosulfan was investigated in various crops with different methods of application. Based on these studies the metabolic pathway of carbosulfan in plants can be considered as sufficiently investigated. At the time being, carbosulfan, carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran were considered the relevant residues to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. However, the metabolite dibutylamine is still under discussion concerning its possible genotoxicity and ought to be therefore considered a potential candidate to include in the residue definition, too. Moreover a need to address residues of dibutylamine but also carbofuran and its metabolites in succeeding crops following application of carbosulfan was identified.
   Based on the currently proposed residue definition, supervised residue trials in sugar beet and maize indicated that residues were low and mostly below the respective LOQ. However, the available residue trials have to be reconsidered for their validity and sufficiency. With regard to the metabolite dibuytlamine no residue data have been reported. Further residue data in cotton seed and citrus will be needed if foliar uses are reinstated in the future.
   Since the assessment of plant residues still needs to be finalized and due to the lack of peer reviewed evaluation of relevant data and information it is not possible to conclude on whether or not significant residues may occur in edible animal matrices.
   The consumer risk assessment should be considered as inconclusive due to the uncertainties caused by lacking data identified during the evaluation.
   In soil under laboratory aerobic conditions, carbosulfan yields carbofuran (max. 48.7 % - 69.3 % AR after 7 d). Also 3-keto-carbofuran is produced in significant amounts (max. 5.3 % - 6.6 %) and needs to be further assessed as it contains the active carbamate moiety. The mineralization was very limited and bounded residues increased up to maximum of 90 % AR after 100 d. In a study performed with 14C-dibutylamine labelled carbosulfan, dibutylamine was found as a major aerobic soil metabolite.
   No valid degradation study of carbosulfan in soil under anaerobic conditions is available. Also photolysis in soil was not investigated. Metabolite carbofuran was considered stable to photolysis in soil in its DAR.
   Evaluation meeting agreed that a re-evaluation of the degradation kinetic in degradation studies had to be performed. Reassessment is available but has not been evaluated and peer reviewed. Therefore, end points for laboratory soil degradation of carbosulfan have not been established.
   Summaries of some field dissipation studies in EU are available. Half life of carbosulfan in these trials ranges between 0.35 to 31.3 d and half life of carbofuran is between 1.3 to 71.9 d. EFSA notes that, in the context of the carbofuran discussion, the meeting of MS experts was not able to determine the reliability of these studies. A position paper is available (June 2005) but has still not been assessed and peer reviewed. PEC in soil were calculated in the DAR for carbosulfan and carbofuran based on the field worst case half lives and the representative uses in maize, sugar beet, citrus and cotton. Evaluation meeting agreed that half life and PEC soil of dibutylamine need to be determined. A position paper is already available but has not been evaluated and peer reviewed.
   The rapporteur Member State concluded that the soil adsorption / desorption study is of limited quality. The meeting of MS experts agreed that the study was not valid and identified a data gap for a valid study for carbosulfan and dibutylamine. For the metabolite carbofuran an additional study (from a different notifier Dianica) is available in its dossier as active substance.
   A lysimeter study is available. However, annual average concentrations and detailed characterization of the residue are missing. Evaluation meeting agreed that levels of dibutylamine need to be determined in the leachate samples and that the two new lysimeters performed with carbofuran should be submitted and assessed. These studies and a position paper are already available but have not been evaluated and peer reviewed.
   Carbosulfan hydrolyses with half lives lower than 1 d at pH 5 and 7 and of 7 d at pH 9. Main products are carbofuran and dibutylamine. Carbofuran degrades to carbofuran-7-phenol.
   Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of carbosulfan in water. Two regions of polar degradation products (66.7 % AR) were found but not characterized. Their environmental relevance is uncertain and was not examined by the meeting of MS experts since the study was still not evaluated. Carbosulfan is not readily biodegradable.
   Carbosulfan was low persistent in aerobic water / sediment systems. Main metabolites formed were carbofuran (max. 34.7 % AR in water; max. 20.1 % AR in sediment) and carbofuran-7-phenol (max. 11.6 % AR in water; max. 3.21 % AR in sediment). A non characterized metabolite (Unknown 3) appears at levels above 10 % AR in the sediment of some systems (max. 20.11 % AR after 7 d). This compound has been tentatively identified as a structure that contains the carbamate moiety and may be expected to produce carbofuran when degraded. The amount of bound residues increased steadily up to 30.5 - 43.0 % AR at the end of the experiments (102 d).
   No half lives are reported in carbosulfan DAR for metabolites carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol in the water / sediment systems. From water / sediment studies summarized in the carbofuran DAR, carbofuran degraded in the whole system with a first order half life of approximately 41 d. Available water sediment studies under alkaline conditions (from carbofuran applicant Dianica) show a faster degradation of carbofuran and the formation of carbofuran-7-phenol at high levels.
   PECSW/SED were calculated by the applicant based on an ad hoc modelling exercise. Evaluation Meeting confirmed the rapporteur Member State data requirement for FOCUS SW PECSW/SED and agreed that PECSW for dibutylamine need to be calculated. FOCUS SW calculations and a position paper for dibutylamine are available but have not been evaluated and peer reviewed.
   The applicant presented an estimation of the potential for ground water contamination based on the FOCUS GW scheme (PRZM). The rapporteur Member State considered that half life and Koc employed for carbofuran in the calculation were not justified and proposed a data requirement for new PECGW. This data requirement was confirmed by the Evaluation Meeting that additionally required calculation of PECGW for metabolite dibutylamine. New FOCUS GW calculations for carbofuran and a position paper for dibutylamine are available but have not been evaluated and peer reviewed. Additionally, experts meeting indicated that potential ground water contamination by soil metabolite 3-keto-carbofuran should be addressed.
   It is not expected that neither carbosulfan nor its transformation product carbofuran (from data in carbofuran dossier) may contaminate the air compartment or be prone to long range transport through air.
   An addendum to the fate and behaviour chapter has been provided on 18 May 2006. When reported, the information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability. Studies or reports presumably submitted by the applicant are not adequately referenced. Therefore studies submitted by the applicant after the DAR was submitted are considered neither evaluated nor peer-reviewed in this conclusion.
   The first tier risk assessment based on generic species identified a potential risk to insectivorous birds in citrus and cotton, to medium herbivorous birds in cotton and to small herbivorous mammals in citrus from foliar application of carbosulfan. Only a small number of granules have to be ingested by a small bird to reach the acute LD50 or the LC50, hence the risk of ingestion of granules should be further addressed. The number of granules that have to be ingested by a small mammal to reach the LD50 is relatively high and since granules are not attractive to mammals the acute risk is considered to be low. Few granules are however needed to reach the NOAEL for mammals and the long-term risk needs to be further addressed. Also the risk from ingestion of treated seedlings, contaminated earthworms, fish and drinking water needs to be evaluated.
   Carbosulfan and the metabolite carbofuran are classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. For citrus and cotton the risk assessment indicates acute and long-term risk to aquatic organisms even with 50 m buffer zones based on contamination by spray drift only. Based on available data for PECsw, a long-term risk is indicated for all representative uses evaluated from exposure to the metabolite carbofuran via drainage to surface water. The assessment needs to be refined based on FOCUS modelling of PECsw.
   Carbosulfan is toxic to bees. For the representative uses in citrus and cotton the risk needs to be further addressed by semi-field or field tests. Since sugar beet crop is not flowering the risk from the use in sugar beet is considered low. The risk to bees from exposure to carbosulfan/carbofuran in nectar and pollen following granular application was not assessed due to non evaluated data on oral toxicity for carbofuran. Laboratory studies confirm that carbosulfan is toxic to arthropods. Further semi-field or field studies are required to evaluate the risk. The risk to earthworms from the use of MARCHAL 25 CS is considered as low. For the granular formulation further clarification is needed on whether the field study with MARCHAL 25 CS can be used for the assessment. No evaluation of the risk to soil micro-organisms and non-target plants is available. For biological methods of sewage treatment the risk is considered to be low.

AB  - Cadusafos is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on cadusafos in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 1 June 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant FMC Chemical. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative as insecticide and nematicide comprise the application by spraying or via the drip irrigation system to control a range of soil insects and nematodes in bananas and potatoes at application rates of up to 6 kg cadusafos per hectare. In case of potatoes incorporation into soil takes place after the application. Cadusafos can be used as insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated that only the use in bananas will be supported in the EU review process.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Ruby 200 CS", a capsule suspension (CS). Preparations containing cadusafos are registered in Cyprus, France, Greece and Spain.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition only for soil, water and air, i.e. cadusafos in soil, water and air. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Insufficient data are available for the determination of cadusafos in the technical material and in the representative formulation to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   The absorption of cadusafos is extensive and rapid, the excretion is mainly via urine, without evidence of body accumulation. The acute oral toxicity is high, and the acute inhalation and dermal toxicity are very high. The proposed classification is T+, R26/27 "Very toxic by inhalation and in contact with skin"; T, R25 "Toxic if swallowed". The main effect after short term oral administration is the decrease of cholinesterase activities in all species. Cadusafos has no genotoxic potential and is not considered to be carcinogenic. In the two-generation rat study, there was no effect on reproductive performance or fertility, and in the rat and rabbit teratology studies, no evidence of teratogenic effects in the absence of maternal toxicity. Supplementary studies were performed due to the introduction of a new impurity in the technical material. The acute and subchronic oral tests revealed no difference in toxicity. The Ames test was negative.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.0007 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.003 mg/kg bw/day. The comparison of the oral and dermal LD50 values results in a dermal absorption value of 100%. The operator exposure estimates are based solely on one specific and restricted representative use in bananas, with automatic drip irrigation, work rate of 1 ha/day, application rate of 6 kg a.s./ha, and assuming that the microcapsules in the formulation do not release cadusafos until they are diluted for application. The results are below the AOEL according to the currently used models which do not apply properly to this particular scenario. Worker and bystander exposures are expected to be very low due to the mode of application by drip irrigation.
   The metabolism of cadusafos has been investigated on several crops after soil application. The representative use on potatoes can be considered as adequately covered by these data and the residue definition for this use can be cadusafos only, for both monitoring and risk assessment. The available residue trials in potatoes for Southern Europe are however not sufficient to draw a robust conclusion on the residue levels consumers may be exposed to. The available data suggest that residues are below 0.01 mg/kg, but results from trials in Northern Europe indicate that the currently available data may underestimate the actual situation. Further supervised residue trials should be carried out.
   For the representative use on bananas, although 2 metabolism studies for this crop were submitted, the data are not sufficient to propose a residue definition. This is due to major deficiencies in the studies, making it impossible to evaluate the possible presence of degradation products still exhibiting the anticholinesterase activity of the parent compound. Therefore a new metabolism study in bananas is needed as well as residue trials carried out according to the representative use pattern. The compounds to be analysed in the residue trials should be determined on the basis of the results of the metabolism study.
   The situation for rotational crops has not been addressed by the notifier, although the soil persistence of the compound exceeds the trigger value for conducting uptake and metabolism studies in succeeding crops. Therefore these studies should be requested.
   Based on the current knowledge of the residue situation in potatoes, the exposure of livestock is very low and metabolism studies in domestic animals do not need to be carried out. Only preliminary acute and chronic exposure assessments could be conducted for the use on potatoes, but these assessments need to be re-examined on the basis of complete and robust data. No MRLs can be proposed at this stage.
   The available data demonstrate that in soil cadusafos degrades to the minor (<10% applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone. Mineralisation of the butyl-2-C-14 radiolabel accounted for 43-71% AR after 90-120 days incubation at 25(circle)C. The values for residues not extracted by acetonitrile / water were 25-32% AR after 90-120 days. In soil cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and methyl-2-butyl sulfone exhibited low persistence.
   In guideline batch soil adsorption studies cadusafos exhibited medium mobility. There was no evidence of pH dependant adsorption. Data on the adsorption of methyl-2-butyl sulfone were not available. As this metabolite accounted for > 5% AR at 2 consecutive sampling points in a soil route of degradation study, information on its mobility in soil is required to complete the groundwater exposure assessment for this metabolite.
   In sediment water systems cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and produced no major metabolites. It dissipated by partitioning to sediment, volatilising and mineralising to CO2 (butyl-2-C-14 radiolabel accounted for 12-18% AR after 100 days incubation at 20(circle)C). Residues not extracted from sediment by acetonitrile/water accounted for only 6-8% AR at 100 days.
   The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on bananas (application via drip irrigation) just in Tenerife indicated that surface water exposure and consequently sediment exposure would be negligible. This conclusion is specific to this use in Tenerife and should not be applied to bananas grown elsewhere. The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on potatoes is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route of entry to surface water for initial PEC in aquatic systems. However MS would need to carry out a surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessments from the runoff and drainage routes of exposure at the national level, as the available EU level assessment does not cover these situations.
   The available FOCUS groundwater modelling for potatoes and the specifically parameterised scenario for bananas in Tenerife for parent cadusafos has not been carried out with appropriate soil DT50 or Henry's law parameters. The potential for groundwater contamination is therefore currently unclear. New groundwater modelling is therefore required for cadusafos. A groundwater leaching assessment for the soil metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone is triggered. It is not available.
   Cadusafos is moderately volatile and volatilisation will contribute to dissipation from soil and water. However cadusafos is not expected to be subject to long range transport via the upper atmosphere due to a relatively rapid calculated photochemical oxidative degradation rate with hydroxyl radicals.
   In the first tier assessment an acute and long-term risk was identified for insectivorous birds. A risk was also identified for earthworm-eating birds and mammals as well as for fish-eating birds and mammals for the use in potatoes. Since the use in potatoes was withdrawn by the applicant the refinements of the risk to birds and mammals from this use was not further considered. For the use in banana plantations a conclusion on the risk to birds and mammals can not be reached at this stage. The risk needs to be further addressed based on species that occur in banana plantations and their associated diets.
   Cadusafos is very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The assessment indicates a high risk. However, for the specific use in banana plantations in Tenerife the risk to aquatic organisms is considered low based on negligible contamination of surface water.
   The toxicity to bees is high, but since for the proposed uses application will be to bare soil the risk is considered low. No in-field exposure of leaf dwelling non-target arthropods is expected from the evaluated uses. The available test with Poecilius cupreus was conducted at an application rate which is lower than the proposed. An ongoing study with Aleochara bilineata should be submitted for the use in banana due to the perceived low sensitivity of P. cupreus. For the application of cadusafos by drip-irrigation to banana plants no off-field exposure is expected.
   A high acute and long-term risk was identified for earthworms. The ongoing field study conducted in United Kingdom should be submitted and the relevance for the proposed uses should be addressed. It should be noted that the application rate in this study is 4.5 kg cadusafos per hectare, which is below the proposed application rate for the intended uses. A study with Collembola and mites is required to address the risk to other soil macro-organisms. The risk to soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment plants is low. For the drip irrigation use in banana no off-crop exposure is expected and hence the risk to non-target plants is considered low.

AB  - Fenamiphos is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenamiphos in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 27 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Irvita. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 30 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as nematicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises application by drip irrigation and "chisel application" (spray application followed by incorporation into the soil) in bell-pepper and tobacco, respectively. The application rates are 10 kg fenamiphos per hectare in bell pepper and 6 kg per hectare in tobacco. Fenamiphos can be used as nematicide and insecticide. It should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated that only the use as nematicide will be supported in the EU review programme.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Nemacur CS 240, a capsule suspension (CS), registered in South Europe.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition except for a method for fenamiphos-sulfone-phenol in ground water and a method for blood and animal tissues.
   Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   Fenamiphos is rapidly and almost completely absorbed within 24 hours. It is extensively metabolised into fenamiphos-phenols. It has a high acute toxicity (therefore, the following classifications were proposed: T+; R28 "Very toxic if swallowed", T; R24 "Toxic in contact with skin" and T+; R26 "Very toxic by inhalation"). Fenamiphos was irritating to the eye in rabbits (classification Xi; R36 "Irritating to eyes" is proposed). It showed no skin sensitising properties. The relevant short and long term oral no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) are 0.083 mg/kg bw/day and 0.56 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. Based on the available in vitro and in vivo tests, fenamiphos is considered not genotoxic. There was no evidence of treatment related increase in carcinogenicity. In a multigeneration study in rats the relevant NOAEL for parental toxicity was 0.17 mg/kg bw/day, the relevant NOAEL for offspring toxicity was 0.64 mg/kg bw/day, and the relevant reproductive NOAEL was 2.8 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant NOAEL for developmental effects is 0.3 mg/kg bw/day in a teratogenicity study with rabbits. Fenamiphos showed no potential to induce delayed neuropathy after acute or subchronic administration in hens. The NOAEL for acute neurotoxicity is 0.25 mg/kg bw/day based on clinical signs and decreased erythrocyte cholinesterase in the acute dog study. Some metabolites showed high acute toxicity (LD50 <25 mg/kg bw). The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure level (AOEL) are 0.0008 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.0025 mg/kg bw (safety factor - SF- 100). Operator, worker and bystander estimated exposure is below the AOEL (<5%).
   The behaviour and metabolism of fenamiphos was investigated in a range of crops representing fruity crops, root and tuber crops, leafy crops, oilseeds and pulses as well as different kinds of application. All studies show a similar metabolic pathway in the plants. Fenamiphos is only found directly following application. A short period after treatment, fenamiphos-sulfoxide is the dominant metabolite. In some plants, fenamiphos-sulfone is increasing in time. Therefore, fenamiphos, fenamiphos-sulfoxide and fenamiphos-sulfone form the toxicological relevant residue. Residues of fenamiphos in rotation crops were found in soybean, Swiss chard, beet root, wheat green forage and wheat straw planted up to 8 months after treatment. Fruiting vegetables planted as rotational crops are not tested. It is recommended to prescribe a safety interval for planting or sowing rotational crops of 8 months. Furthermore, it is concluded that the rotational crops investigated are not representative for fruiting vegetables and therefore further data is still required.
   Information on fenamiphos fed to ruminants and poultry is present, but is not relevant for the intended uses on sweet pepper and tobacco.
   It is concluded that application of fenamiphos on tobacco and sweet pepper following the representative cGAP lead to residue levels on food not giving rise to concern for consumer exposure. However, since there were relevant metabolites found in ground water, a consumer risk assessment was performed, considering the sum of possible intakes of fenamiphos and the metabolites fenamiphos-sulfoxide and fenamiphos-sulfone from drinking water in addition to the intake through diet. The total intakes from diet and drinking were demonstrated to be significantly above the ADI and ARfD of fenamiphos for the considered consumer subgroups. Fenamiphos is very low or low persistent in soil under aerobic conditions being rapidly oxidized to the major metabolites fenamiphos-sulfoxide and fenamiphos-sulfone.
   Fenamiphos-sulfoxide is moderate to high persistent in soil and fenamiphos-sulfone low to moderately persistent. Both organophosphate metabolites are hydrolysed to the major metabolites fenamiphos-sulfoxide-phenol and fenamiphos-sulfone-phenol. These metabolites are subsequently transformed to non extractable residues and mineralized to CO2. Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of fenamiphos.
   Bare soil field dissipation in four Southern European locations with fenamiphos formulated as the representative capsule suspension product (Nemacur 240 CS) was investigated in one study. All major metabolites were found in the 0-10 cm layer and fenamiphos-sulfoxide was also found at deeper layers. Experts' meeting agreed that photolysis was not likely to have affected the degradation rate of fenamiphos and its metabolites in the field trials but leaching could not be completely excluded taking onto account the adsorbtion/desorption properties of these compounds.
   The data provided after the expert's meeting confirm that the Spanish field trial should not be considered in the assessment of soil compartment and for PEC soil calculations.
   Experts' meeting agreed with the RMS not to consider Nemacur 240 CS a slow release formulation. New PECs soil have been provided by the RMS in the list of end points to take also into account the application rates of the representative uses and the maximum percentage of metabolites found in the laboratory studies, as agreed by the experts' meeting.
   According batch adsorption/desorption studies, fenamiphos is low to high mobile whereas fenamiphos-sulfoxide, fenamiphos-sulfone, fenamiphos-sulfoxide-phenol and fenamiphos-sulfonephenol are medium to very high mobile. No column leaching, field leaching or lysimeter studies are available for fenamiphos.
   In sterile buffer solutions (pH 5, 7 and 9) at 20 degrees C fenamiphos may be considered stable (DT50 >200 d). Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the transformation of fenamiphos into fenamiphos-sulfoxide. Fenamiphos sulfonic acid was detected as a minor metabolite and fenamiphos-phenolsulfonic acid as a major photolysis metabolite of fenamiphos. This later metabolite shown to be stable to photolysis in water (DT50 = 768 d).
   The experts' meeting proposed to classify fenamiphos as not ready biodegradable.
   In water sediment systems fenamiphos dissipated relatively fast from the water phase but may be highly persistent in the whole system (DT50 whole system = 9.3 - 111 d). Major metabolites in water were fenamiphos-sulfoxide and fenamiphos-sulfoxide-phenol. Fenamiphos-sulfoxide was also a major metabolite in the sediment. Mineralization reached a maximum of 2.4-14.3 % AR at the end of the study (100 d) and bound residues reached maximum amounts of 17.4 - 48 % AR.
   For the representative uses of NEMACUR CS 240 (soil treatment with incorporation and drip irrigation) direct emissions to surface water are not expected. However, emissions via run-off and drainage may not be excluded. RMS presented FOCUS PECSW / (SED) (Steps 1 and 2) calculations for fenamiphos, and initial FOCUS PECSW / (SED) (step 1 and 2) for fenamiphos-sulfoxide, fenamiphossulfoxide- phenol, fenamiphos-phenol-sulfonic acid, fenamiphos-sulfone and fenamiphos-sulfonephenol in an addendum that was discussed in the experts meeting. The meeting agreed that further refinement by FOCUS Step 3 should be provided by the applicant taking into consideration EFSA Opinion on the use of FOCUS SW.
   For the FOCUS PECGW presented in the original DAR field dissipation half lives were employed as input parameters. The experts' meeting expressed concerns on the use the field dissipation half lives as degradation parameters for modelling in this case. New FOCUS-PEARL calculations, using normalized laboratory half lives, have been provided by the RMS in the list of end points and the updated addendum for the FOCUS scenarios Piacenza, Porto, Sevilla and Thiva. Potential contamination of ground water under vulnerable situations by fenamiphos metabolites over the triggers of 0.1 mu g/L, 0.75 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L may be deduced from these new calculations. Two of the metabolites are relevant. The experts' meeting recognized the difficulty to address potential ground water contamination from protected crop uses with the available scenarios. Since the practices to grow crops under protection are variable among EU a better definition of greenhouse uses is necessary. According to the applicant, NEMACUR CS 240 is used on permanent structures covered with plastic and nets and the crops are planted over the natural soil. The crop is irrigated to satisfy the crop water requirements. With the results of the new FOCUSGW simulations an assessment of the applicability of available FOCUS scenarios for the greenhouse use would be necessary.
   Based on the available volatilisation experiment and the calculated atmospheric half life contamination of the air compartment and long range transport through air are not expected.
   For the representative uses evaluated the only potentially relevant routes of bird and mammal exposure are via intake of contaminated soil arthropods, earthworms and fish. Since birds and mammals have no access to permanent glasshouses the only route of exposure from the use on bell peppers is via ingestion of contaminated fish. For the use on tobacco fields exposure via contaminated earthworms and soil arthropods is also possible. The initial risk assessment indicated a high risk for fish-eating birds and mammals from both uses and a high risk for earthworm-eating birds and mammals for the use in tobacco fields. Limited field surveys indicate that earthworms are not present in tobacco fields, but this has to be investigated further. The risk assessment for fish-eating birds and mammals needs to be refined based on refined PEC surface water data.
   Fenamiphos and the metabolites fenamiphos-sulfoxide and fenamiphos-sulfone are very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates.
   The results from a mesocosm study indicate a potential high risk and the assessment need to be refined based on refined PEC surface water data. The risk to bees and other non-target arthropods is considered low from the representative uses evaluated, while a risk to earthworms, other soil macro-organism and micro-organism has been identified and needs to be further addressed.
   The risk to non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered low.

AB  - Metconazole is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on metconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 27 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 16 April 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April - Mai 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control foliar and ear diseases in cereals and oilseed rape at application rate up to 90 g metconazole per hectare. Metconazole can be used only as fungicide.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "Caramba 60 SL", a soluble concentrate (SL), registered in some EU Member States.
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food and soil can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of metconazole.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.
   The acute oral toxicity of metconazole is moderate (a classification Xn; R22 "Harmful if swallowed" is proposed). Metconazole is of low acute dermal and inhalatory toxicity. It is not a skin or eye irritant or a skin sensitiser. The relevant NOAEL for short term toxicity is 6.4 mg/kg bw/day. Adrenals, liver and spleen were detected as target organs. Overall, metconazole is not genotoxic. The NOAEL for chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity is 4.4 mg/kg bw/day. It was considered that the compound was unlikely to be classified as a carcinogenic substance. The NOAELs for parental, reproduction and offspring toxicity are 8 mg/kg bw/day; based on the absence of effect on fertility in the rat 2-generation study (only modification of fertility parameters at maternotoxic doses). Both compounds are embryo- and foetotoxic at doses also producing maternal toxicity in rat developmental toxicity studies. Therefore, classification as Repro Cat. 3 (Xn; R63) was agreed on. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Levels (AOEL) are 0.01 mg/kg bw/day based on an overall NOAEL of 4 mg/kg bw/d with a safety factor of 400 (the increased SF is due to teratogenic effects).
   Operator exposure is below the AOEL when PPE is worn. The exposure during re-entry activities and for bystanders is negligible.
   In the plant metabolism studies conducted in wheat and oilseed rape, metconazole, triazolyl alanine and triazolyl acetic acid were identified as the major components of the total residues in the edible plant parts of the tested crops. Triazolyl alanine is a common metabolite of triazole fungicides, and its toxicological profile was considered as sufficiently investigated. The residue of concern in cereals and oilseed crops is therefore metconazole only. The enrichment of edible plant parts of succeeding crops with metconazole was not sufficient to reach quantifiable levels, when metconazole is used according cGAP. A complete residue trials data base on wheat, rye, triticale and oilseed rape was provided for Northern and Southern Europe and allowed MRL proposals. For barley uses in Southern Europe additional trial data need to be submitted to confirm the compliance with currently proposed MRL based on Northern European trials. Due to low consumer exposure industrial or household processing studies are not required.
   Since significant residues occur in potential feed stuff, metabolism studies have been submitted in lactating goats and laying hens. In lactating goats, metconazole undergoes an extensive metabolisation, but was still detected in edible goat matrices bar kidney. All the metabolites found in goat tissues have been recovered in the rat. In a non peer reviewed addendum (December 2005) RMS concluded that representative uses do not give rise to significant residues in animal products and MRLs do not need to be proposed.
   In contrast, estimates of possibly occurring residues levels in animal matrices done by EFSA indicated that relevant residue levels might be expected in ruminant liver. According to current guidelines a feeding study with ruminants would be required and MRLs for food of animal origin (i.e. ruminant liver) need to be proposed. In laying hens, the metabolic profile was not further investigated and no such data is currently required since the intake by poultry is not significant with regard to the representative uses.
   The dietary risk assessment performed for different consumer groups indicates that there are no chronic and acute concerns related to dietary exposure resulting from the representative uses.
   Sufficient data were available to demonstrate that in soil metconazole exhibits medium to high persistence based on northern and southern European field studies where applications were made in May and June. Consequently the available laboratory studies did not identify any major (>10% of applied radioactivity (AR)) soil metabolites. Mineralization of the 3,5-triazole-14C radiolabel accounted for 10.3% AR in dark aerobic laboratory soil studies after 91 days. The formation of unextracted residues in the soil organic carbon was the significant sink (accounting for 12-28% AR at 91-112 days). Metconazole exhibited low mobility in soil (based on evidence from laboratory soil batch adsorption studies) There was no evidence that adsorption changed with variation in soil pH.
   In natural sediment water systems (dark laboratory studies) metconazole dissipated from the water relatively rapidly by partitioning to sediment. Once in the sediment degradation was slow with metconazole exhibiting high to very high persistence. The 3,5-triazole-C-14-label, did not mineralize to CO2 at all. Formation of unextracted sediment radioactivity (11-19%AR at 100 days) and the formation of up to 6 resolved minor (<= 9% AR) metabolites (5 identified) accounted for the slow loss of metconazole in these static experimental systems. It is a concern, that from the acceptable standard guideline studies required and provided, in terms of accounting for the route of breakdown and completing the material balance of metconazole, it is only possible to conclude that metconazole is persistent in the sediment of aquatic systems (there was no evidence that the metabolites formed were mineralised, the only sink identified was unextracted sediment radioactivity). Based on the available data, photolysis is not expected to be a significant process in the breakdown of metconazole in natural aquatic systems.
   The environmental exposure assessments available are sufficient to complete the necessary EU level estimates of Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) for the representative uses applied for, for annex 1 listing. Because of the persistence of metconazole in soil and aquatic sediment it was necessary for exposure assessments to take into account the potential accumulation of metconazole in these environmental matrices from potential use in consecutive years. Member States must also do this when assessing potential uses of metconazole at the national level. Member States also need to carry out aquatic exposure and risk assessments from the drainage and runoff routes of exposure to surface water as these routes of entry have not been considered in the EU level assessments available.
   FOCUS groundwater modelling indicated a low potential for groundwater contamination in vulnerable situations over a wide range of geoclimatic conditions across the EU for the uses assessed in this conclusion. (At all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios annual average leachate concentrations of metconazole leaving the top 1m soil layer were predicted to be below the parametric legal drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L).
   The acute and short-term risk to birds and the acute risk to mammals are low from the representative uses. The first tier TER values indicated a high long-term risk for insectivorous and herbivorous birds (TER of 2.3 to 3.1) and a high long-term risk to herbivorous mammals. The EPCO experts meeting identified the requirement for further information to justify the choice of the focal species and data on more species to refine the long term risk to insectivorous birds. The experts meeting agreed to the refinement of long-term exposure based on residue data in cereals. The long-term risk to herbivorous birds was shown to be low for both representative uses. However, further refinement steps are necessary to address the risk to small herbivorous mammals for the representative use in cereals (TER of 2.9). The acute and the long term risk to mammals from the representative use in oilseed rape are considered to be low.
   The risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning from uptake of contaminated earthworms was discussed at the experts meeting. It was agreed that the TER calculations should be based on the plateau PECsoil plus one application. The resulting TER values for birds and mammals of 10.5 and 5.3 are above the Annex VI trigger of 5 indicating a low risk from the representative uses. The risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated drinking water was calculated by EFSA according to Sanco/4145/2000 in an addendum. The first tier TER values indicated a high short-term and long term risk to birds and a high long-term risk to mammals. A refined risk assessment for the uptake of contaminated drinking water is required for the intended uses in cereals and oilseed rape.
   The acute risk to aquatic organisms is low. The long-term risk to fish and daphnids is high and risk mitigation measures such as buffer zones up to 15 m are required.
   The Annex VI trigger values were not met for NTA in a first tier testing. The higher tier tests showed that the risk to non-target arthropods is low.
   A field litter bag study has been performed at an application rate equivalent to the supported GAP. No effects were observed in the study after 3 months and after 6 months of exposure. As some drawbacks have been identified in the study, the experts meeting set a data requirement to submit a new litter bag study available to the applicant. The evaluation of this new study would allow completing the risk assessment.
   The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants is considered to be low for the representative uses.

AB  - Pests often evolve resistance to pest controls used in agriculture and aquaculture. The rate of pest adaptation is influenced by the type of control, the selective pressure it imposes, and the gene flow between farms. By understanding how these factors influence evolution at the metapopulation level, pest management strategies that prevent resistance from evolving can be developed. We developed a model for the metapopulation and evolutionary dynamics of the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which is a major parasite affecting salmon aquaculture. Different management scenarios were simulated across a network of salmon farms covering half of Norway, and their effects on louse epidemiology and evolution were investigated. We compared louse controls that differed in how they were deployed through time (discrete vs. continuous), how they impacted the louse life cycle, and in their overall efficacy. We adjusted the strength of selection imposed by treatments, the dominance effect of the resistant allele, and the geographic location at which resistance originated. Continuously acting strategies (e.g., louse-resistant salmon) were generally more effective than discrete strategies at controlling lice, especially when they increased louse mortality during early developmental stages. However, effective strategies also risked imposing frequent and/or strong selection on lice, thus driving rapid adaptation. Resistant alleles were more likely to be lost through genetic drift when they were recessive, had a low-fitness advantage, or originated in low-farm-density areas. The north-flowing current along the Norwegian coastline dispersed resistant genes from south to north, and limited gene flow in the opposite direction. We demonstrate how evolutionary models can produce quantitative predictions over large spatial and temporal scales and for a range of pest control scenarios. Quantitative outputs can be translated into practical management decisions applied at a regional level to minimise the risk of resistance developing.

AB  - Dust samples collected by researchers and study participants from 43 U.S. urban homes were analyzed and compared to evaluate the feasibility of using participant-collected samples to assess indoor environmental ex-posures. The microbial and chemical composition of participant-collected (and shipped) samples were compared to researcher-collected samples from the same household, using dust recovered from each home's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) filter. The bacterial and fungal communities present in all dust samples were determined via MiSeq 16S and ITS sequencing, and the concentrations of 27 semi-volatile organic com-pounds (7 orthophosphates, 6 phthalates, and 14 brominated flame retardants) were determined via GC-MS. Self-report data on the home environment was collected via an online survey of study participants. While the researcher-collected samples (RCS) yielded greater mass than the participant-collected samples (PCS), the alpha and beta diversities of the bacterial and fungal communities recovered in the RCS and PCS were not significantly different, indicating that PCS is a viable option for indoor microbiome studies of residential homes. The microbial communities recovered in both cases reflected the dominance of human-associated bacterial taxa and outdoor-associated fungal taxa with similar pathogen-associated taxa present in each sample type. In both PCS and RCS, the amount of carpet in the home and the frequency of bleach use had a significant effect on the composition of fungal communities. Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) of potential human health concern, were commonly detected in the homes. Organophosphates and phthalates were recovered at a similar frequency in both PCS and RCS. Measured SVOC concentration levels were consistent with previous indoor studies although differences were observed between PCS and RCS for several SVOCs. This study demonstrates the potential and challenges associated with participant-collected dust samples for indoor environment studies.

AB  - Evolution of resistance by pests can reduce the efficacy of transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt). In conjunction with refuges of non-Bt host plants, fitness costs can delay the evolution of resistance. Furthermore, fitness costs often vary with ecological conditions, suggesting that agricultural landscapes can be manipulated to magnify fitness costs and thereby prolong the efficacy of Bt crops. In the current study, we tested the effects of four species of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) on the magnitude and dominance of fitness costs of resistance to Bt toxin Cry1Ac in pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). For more than a decade, field populations of pink bollworm in the United States have remained susceptible to Bt cotton Gossypium hirsutum L. producing Cry1Ac; however, we used laboratory strains that had a mixture of susceptible and resistant individuals. In laboratory experiments, dominant fitness costs were imposed by the nematode Steinernema riobrave Cabanillas, Poinar, and Raulston but no fitness costs were imposed by Steinernema carpocapsae Weiser, Steinernema sp. (ML18 strain), or Heterorhabditis sonorensis Stock, Rivera-Orduno, and Flores-Lara. In computer simulations, evolution of resistance to Cry1Ac by pink bollworm was substantially delayed by treating some non-Bt cotton refuge fields with nematodes that imposed a dominant fitness cost, similar to the cost observed in laboratory experiments with S. riobrave. Based on the results here and in related studies, we conclude that entomopathogenic nematodes could bolster insect resistance management, but the success of this approach will depend on selecting the appropriate species of nematode and environment, as fitness costs were magnified by only two of five species evaluated and also depended on environmental factors.

AB  - The article reviewed the four major Bioinspired intelligent algorithms for agricultural applications, namely ecological, swarm-intelligence-based, ecology-based, and multi-objective algorithms. The key emphasis was placed on the variants of the swarm intelligence algorithms, namely the artificial bee colony (ABC), genetic algorithm, flower pollination algorithm (FPA), particle swarm, the ant colony, firefly algorithm, artificial fish swarm, and Krill herd algorithm because they had been widely employed in the agricultural sector. There was a broad consensus among scholars that certain BIAs' variants were more effective than others. For example, the Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm and genetic algorithm were best suited for farm machinery path optimization and pest detection, among other applications. On the contrary, the particle swarm algorithm was useful in determining the plant evapotranspiration rates, which predicted the water requirements and optimization of the irrigation process. Despite the promising applications, the adoption of hyper-heuristic algorithms in agriculture remained low. No universal algorithm could perform multiple functions in farms; different algorithms were designed to perform specific functions. Secondary concerns relate to data integrity and cyber security, considering the history of cyber-attacks on smart farms. Despite the concerns, the benefits associated with the BIAs outweighed the risks. On average, farmers can save 647-1866 L on fuel which is equivalent to US$734-851, with the use of GPS-guided systems. The accuracy of the BIAs mitigated the risk of errors in applying pesticides, fertilizers, irrigation, and crop monitoring for better yields.

AB  - An integrated biological effect monitoring concept has been tested in flounder (Platichthys flesus L.) from four locations with different anthropogenic impact in the German Eight. During 3 years of sampling, biomarkers at all levels of biological organisation from the molecular to the ecosystem level were applied and tested on 742 individual fish of body lengths between 18 and 25 cm. At the ecosystem level, the fish were taken as a habitat for the parasite assemblage. The hypothesis was that changes in the environment might lead to changes in the species diversity of parasites and in the infection intensity of single species, as well as between heteroxenic and monoxenic parasite species (H/M ratio). At the molecular level, activity of the CYP1A-dependent monooxygenase ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) was used as a biomarker of exposure. At the subcellular level, the integrity of lysosomal membranes in hepatocytes was taken as an indicator of non-specific acute and chronic toxic effects. Both biomarkers are recommended by the ICES Advisory Committee on the Marine Environment for the application in biological effects monitoring programmes. In addition, neutral lipid content in the liver was used as a marker for pathologically induced fat accumulation. In the same individual fish, a new method for the measurement of macrophage aggregate activity in the liver was tested for its application and reliability in reflecting immunosuppression. Tests were accompanied by chemical analysis of standard organochlorine and heavy metal residues in flounder tissue, A total of 33 parasite species were found. As an indicator species, the mean abundance of Trichodina sp. reflected best the pollution gradient observed with highest infection intensity at the most polluted location. Species diversity was significantly higher in fish caught near the reference site and significantly lower in fish from the polluted Elbe estuary. The use of the heteroxenous/monoxenous species ratio as a marker was not useful at the locations investigated because of the dominance of heteroxenous species at all habitats. Since EROD activity and macrophage aggregate activity were dependent on sex and maturity of female flounder, only male fish were taken into consideration for the integrated evaluation of data. All biochemical and histochemical tests were able to reflect accurately the site-specific differences, as well as an observed pollution event at the end of 1995 as determined by chemical analyses. The correlation analysis revealed a connection not only between the single parasitological and biochemical parameters but also within these groups. The non-specific immune response and TrichodinL1 infection intensity were correlated with all other parameters, leading to the assumption that these may serve as links between the lowest and the highest levels of biological organisation. The simultaneous use of metabolic and parasitological results facilitated the interpretation of the observed variations of the data and the distinction between natural variation and pollution-mediated effects.

AB  - In late January 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sponsored a workshop to discuss standardizing the laboratory materials and methods used for in vivo fish bioassays and-toxin induction experiments. Representatives from six laboratories using these assays to conduct research on Pfiesteria piscicida Steidinger & Burkholder, similar organisms (i.e., members of the toxic Pfiesteria complex) or their toxins were invited to attend. The workshop objectives were a) to discuss the need for uniform quality assurance for fish bioassays and toxin induction, b) to encourage publishing the relevant materials and methods in the literature, c) to foster communication among the laboratories conducting this work, and d) to respond to requests from state health and environmental protection agencies for guidance in interpreting the results from-fish bioassays conducted in different laboratories. To facilitate discussion at the workshop, researchers conducting Pfiesteria research completed a de tailed questionnaire in advance about fish bioassays and toxin production assays. Workshop participants discussed experimental factors that might influence the reproducibility or interpretation of fish bioassays and toxin-induction experiments. The experimental factors were categorized into physical, chemical, and biological parameters. In addition, participants ranked experimental factors by their relative importance in conducting these assays as a) factors that are critically important and should be maintained within a recommended range, b) factors that are important in conducting the assays but that may be variable among laboratories or within experiments and whose values should be recorded and reported by investigators, and c) factors of unknown importance that should be considered important research questions. This article summarizes results obtained from the questionnaire and workshop discussions.

AB  - The Long Island Sound American lobster (Homarus americanus) fishery was declared a "commercial" fishing failure clue to a resource disaster under Magnuson-Stevens Act in 2000, following a 1999 die-off. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission formed a steering committee representing state federal agencies, Sea Grant, and the commercial lobster industry, and charge with oversight of a $6.6 million research initiative investigating possible cause(s) of the die-off and assessment of the lobster resource status. Connecticut and York Sea Grant Extension facilitated the communication among members, stermen, researchers, and the public, and conducted extension and outre activities for the research initiative. A civil lawsuit filed by lobstermen against chemical manufacturers attributed the die-off to pesticides applied for mosquito control. The lawsuit added another layer of complexity to the resource disaster response, and its impacts on the research effort, the media response, and typical Sea Grant extension methodology are outlined and discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Ctenolepisma longicaudata is emerging as a nuisance pest in private homes in some European countries, and it is considered a serious problem in museums and libraries where it can do damage to objects of historical value. It is a silverfish that may be difficult to eradicate because it utilizes many parts of a building. Heavy use of pesticides is undesirable from a health perspective, and baits with low concentrations of toxins are consequently preferable. To safeguard the indoor environment during management, the present study describes procedures for the efficient control of Ctenolepisma longicaudata with small amounts of bait. This is as efficient, as sprayable pesticides and declines with more than 90% reduction of the pest population can be achieved within 15 to 20 weeks. Successful eradication can be achieved with as little as 0.5 to 1.0 g bait per 100 m(2).
   Pest management strives to be an efficient, yet healthy and environmentally safe control method, and the use of poisoned bait often fulfils these criteria. In the present study, we show that bait with indoxacarb as the active ingredient is highly efficient for controlling Ctenolepisma longicaudata (Escherich, 1905) and two of its relatives, Lepisma saccharina (Linnaeus, 1758) and Ctenolepisma calva (Ritter, 1910). Applying small bait droplets (size similar to 10 mg) along the walls of several types of buildings, at no more than 0.5 to 1.0 g bait per 100 m(2), was a cost-efficient and safe strategy for the knockdown and eradication of C. longicaudata. During field experiments, the demography changed from an initial mixture of different stages to total dominance of early instars preceding the population collapse. Poisonous bait outcompeted mass-trapping with sticky-traps and conventional insect spray treatment for the efficient control of C. longicaudata in apartments. Different droplet densities (1 vs. 0.5/m(2)) and active ingredients (indoxacarb vs. clothianidin) did not have different effects in field experiments. These results show that poisoned bait is a highly relevant tool for managing C. longicaudata and potentially against other silverfish infestations.

AB  - The study of the R&D in this paper is to determine the range of essential oils (EOs) in the raw materials of species of the genus Thymus of the natural flora in the Carpathian region and their antimicrobial activity. It was found that the component range of EO in species of the genus Thymus depends on the microclimatic conditions of the population. The range of essential oils in the raw material of Th. Serpyllum and Th. Pulegoides is 7-9 mL and Th. Marschallianus is 3.5 mL. The research found that the plants Th. Serpyllum and Th. Pulegoides that grow in sunny habitats have an aromatic mono- and bicyclic monoterpenoid chemotype (K/alpha-T-neol/ G/p-C/B), with total dominance of carvacrol and p-cymene. The populations of Th. Serpyllum, which grow on the edges of sparse pine forests, and populations of Th. Pullegioide, with denser plant cover and which grow in meadows, have an acyclic and bicyclic monoterpene chemotype (G/alpha-T-neol/B/K). Plants that grow in the communities of meadow-steppe vegetation have the following chemotypes: Th. Serpyllum-L/K/G with 63% of linalool, Th. Pullegioides-G/alpha-T-neol/L/B, and Th. Marschallianus-alpha-T-neol/K/L/alpha-T-nen/G/B. Of these, the dominant chemotypes are alpha-terpineol and carvacrol (28:6.5%). A wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity was registered in samples of Th. Pullegoides and Th. Serpyllum that have an aromatic-monoterpenoid chemotype. Essential oils of Th. Pullegoides were dominated by carvacrol, and p-cymene had the highest fungicidal action (41.00 +/- 1.0%). Plant populations of Th. Pullegoides and Th. Serpyllum with the aromatic-monoterpenoid chemotype are suggested by R&D to be of use in the pharmaceutical industry. They have high contents of natural components, which are effective in a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity. The EO of Th. Marschallianus had the lowest influence on the inhibition of bacterial and fungal reproduction.

AB  - Background: Occupational insecticidal poisoning (OIP) is a global phenomenon, which is even more prevalent among indoor residual spray-workers and this can pose a serious threat to their health.
   Objectives: This study aimed to assess spray-workers' management of insecticide risk indicators and occupational insecticidal poisoning. Materials and
   Methods: An analytical cross-sectional survey was adopted, that involved all of the professional indoor residual spray-workers serving in the Omo-Nada woreda (district), Ethiopia. The survey was conducted between January and April 2011 by administering a pretested questionnaire. All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS v. 19.0. A two-sided Fisher's exact test was performed to determine associations between the variables.
   Results: Overall, 52.4% of the study participants had an awareness of the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), whereas 41.9% were unable to read the pesticide labels. About 75.3% of spray-workers never drink or eat or smoke, while spraying. Statistical analysis (two-sided Fisher's exact test) confirmed that there is no statistically significant association between safe insecticide practice with the spray-worker's gender (P = 0.332), whereas, there were strong correlations found with age (P = 0.001), educational status (P = 0.001) and years of work experience (P = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Despite adequate awareness of safe insecticide management, most of the spray-workers were observed to be reluctant to put this knowledge into practice, either due to the inadequacy of PPE or negligence. Furthermore, a sizable faction of these workers still had limited knowledge and erroneous risk perceptions, thus increasing their risk of OIP. Therefore, appropriate communication strategies and training could reduce the occupational risk of insecticide exposure, which would ultimately minimize the related health hazards of insecticidal poisoning.

AB  - This review covers selected 2018 articles on the biological effects of pollutants, including human physical disturbances, on marine and estuarine plants, animals, ecosystems, and habitats. The review, based largely on journal articles, covers field and laboratory measurement activities (bioaccumulation of contaminants, field assessment surveys, toxicity testing, and biomarkers) as well as pollution issues of current interest including endocrine disrupters, emerging contaminants, wastewater discharges, marine debris, dredging, and disposal. Special emphasis is placed on effects of oil spills and marine debris due largely to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico and proliferation of data on the assimilation and effects of marine debris. Several topical areas reviewed in the past (e.g., mass mortalities ocean acidification) were dropped this year. The focus of this review is on effects, not on pollutant sources, chemistry, fate, or transport. There is considerable overlap across subject areas (e.g., some bioaccumulation data may be appear in other topical categories such as effects of wastewater discharges, or biomarker studies appearing in oil toxicity literature). Therefore, we strongly urge readers to use keyword searching of the text and references to locate related but distributed information. Although nearly 400 papers are cited, these now represent a fraction of the literature on these subjects. Use this review mainly as a starting point. And please consult the original papers before citing them.

AB  - Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) control in the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America is an example of using physiological knowledge to successfully control an invasive species and rehabilitate an ecosystem and valuable fishery. The parasitic sea lamprey contributed to the devastating collapse of native fish communities after invading the Great Lakes during the 1800s and early 1900s. Economic tragedy ensued with the loss of the fishery and severe impacts to property values and tourism resulting from sea lamprey-induced ecological changes. To control the sea lamprey and rehabilitate the once vibrant Great Lakes ecosystem and economy, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission (Commission) was formed by treaty between Canada and the United States in 1955. The Commission has developed a sea lamprey control programme based on their physiological vulnerabilities, which includes (i) the application of selective pesticides (lampricides), which successfully kill sedentary sea lamprey larvae in their natal streams; (ii) barriers to spawning migrations and associated traps to prevent infestations of upstream habitats and remove adult sea lamprey before they reproduce; and (iii) the release of sterilized males to reduce the reproductive potential of spawning populations in select streams. Since 1958, the application of the sea lamprey control programme has suppressed sea lamprey populations by similar to 90% from peak abundance. Great Lakes fish populations have rebounded and the economy is now thriving. In hopes of further enhancing the efficacy and selectivity of the sea lamprey control programme, the Commission is exploring the use of (i) sea lamprey chemosensory cues (pheromones and alarm cues) to manipulate behaviours and physiologies, and (ii) genetics to identify and manipulate genes associated with key physiological functions, for control purposes. Overall, the Commission capitalizes on the unique physiology of the sea lamprey and strives to develop a diverse integrated programme to successfully control a once devastating invasive species.

AB  - Freeze-frame click chemistry is a proven approach for design in situ of high affinity ligands from bioorthogonal, reactive building blocks and macromolecular template targets. We recently described in situ design of femtomolar reversible inhibitors of fish and mammalian acetylcholinesterases (EC 3.1.1.7; AChEs) using several different libraries of acetylene and azide building blocks. Active center gorge geometries of those AChEs are rather similar and identical triazole inhibitors were detected in situ when incubating the same building block libraries in different AChEs. Drosophila melanogaster AChE crystal structure and other insect AChE homology models differ more in their overall 3D structure than other members of the cholinesterase family. The portion of the gorge proximal to the catalytic triad and choline binding site has a similar to 50% reduction in volume, and the gorge entrance at the peripheral anionic site (PAS) is more constricted than in the fish and mammalian AChEs. In this communication we describe rationale for using purified recombinant Drosophila AChE as a template for in Situ reaction of tacrine and propidium based libraries of acetylene and azide building blocks. The Structures of resulting triazole inhibitors synthesized in situ are expected to differ appreciably from the fish and mammalian AChEs. While the latter AChEs exclusively promote synthesis of syn-substituted triazoles, the best Drosophila AChE triazole inhibitors were always anti-substituted. The anti-regioisomer triazoles were by about one order of magnitude better inhibitors of Drosophila than mammalian and fish AChEs. Moreover, the preferred site of acetylene + azide reaction in insect AChE and the resulting triazole ring formation shifts from near the base of the gorge to closer to its rim due to substantial differences of the gorge geometry in Drosophila AChE. Thus, in addition to synthesizing high affinity, lead inhibitors in situ, freeze-frame, click chemistry has capacity to generate species-specific AChE ligands that conform to the determinants in the gorge.

AB  - Non-target species trapped by synthetic pheromone-baited sticky traps for six lepidopterous pests on apple trees, Carposina sasakii, Adoxophyes orana fasciata, Archips breviplicanus, Archips fuscocupreanus, Grapholita molesta and Phyllonorycter ringoniella, were studied in central Hokkaido from 1984 to 1985 and in northern Hokkaido in 2004. In northern Hokkaido, surveys were conducted not only in a conventional pesticide-application orchard but in a communication disruption orchard. The following species were numerous comparatively; Meridarchis excisa in traps for C. sasakii, Archips audax and Neocalyptis angustilineata in traps for A. orana fasciata, A. audax, Homonopsis foederatana and Pandemis monticolana in traps for A. breviplicanus, and Cnephasia stephensiana stolidana in traps for G. molesta. Although the distinction of these non-target species from the target species was generally easy, it was difficult to distinguish Grapholita spp. (e.g. G. dimorpha, G. tenebrosana) from G. molesta in the same trap. It was considered that most of the non-target moths caught by traps had invaded from the orchard surroundings and trap specificity was influenced largely by the flora of the orchard periphery.

AB  - The dewatering of New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina created an unprecedented situation regarding public safety, including the perception of unsafe seafood. The floodwaters flowing into nearshore areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) were known to contain oils, metals, and a wide range of pathogens and enteric bacteria, and there was also concern about synthetic chemical contaminants from flooded businesses and homes. The Northwest Fisheries Science Center was asked to mount an immediate response, both to collect samples of fish and shrimp from the potentially affected area as well as providing a wide range of chemical and microbiological analyses. Consequently, we conducted several sampling cruises from a variety of research vessels and chartered fishing boats in the GoM over the course of the following 12 months. While we sampled many species, we focused our analyses on Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulalus and white shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus. Sampling began on 13 September 2005, within 1 week after floodwater pumping was intitated, and continued through September 2006. More than 300 seafood, water, and sediment samples were analyzed for a suite of organic chemical contaminants, including organochlorines, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs). The samples were also tested for bacterial contamination, including fecal contaminants such as Escherichia coli and potentially pathogenic Vibrio spp. While a range of both chemical and microbiological substances were detected, none were present in edible tissues at levels that posed any appreciable risk to human consumers of seafood products from the GoM, assuming that normal seafood preparation practices were followed. Petroleum-derived PACs in whites shrimp from both Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound increased over several sampling periods in the fall and early winter (p < 0.001). However, these levels were quite low and had declined considerably by April 2006. Other than the increases in petroleum-derived PACs. our findings suggested little evidence of increased levels of contaminants immediately following the hurricane; however, the lackk of prestorm data hampered that determination. A lack of standard protocols, as well as issues related to risk assessment methodologies, complicated the ability to provide a coordinated multiagency communication of the results. As a result of our experiences in responding to this unprecedented environmental emergency. we recommend a more unified national capability for assessing seafood safety in our nation's coastal waters.

AB  - Background & objectives: To ensure that the activities of Malaria Control Programme were taking place in effective and judicious manner, an intensive monitoring and supervision of various activities of the programme were carried out in Karbi-Anglong, Cachar and Nagaon districts of Assam, India during July-October 2007.
   Methods: Questionnaire-based protocol prepared by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme was used to evaluate the activities. Sixteen villages belonging to five different Primary Health Centres (PHCs) of three districts were selected for investigations.
   Results: Results of monitoring of indoor residual spraying (IRS) revealed inadequate spraying coverage. Although recorded to be about 69-99%, but apparently it was 17-43% in the districts investigated. Cross-examination of 180 blood smears (90 positive and negative each) in the 4 Zn laboratories of the study PHCs, revealed discrepancy in the results of 67 blood smears. Maximum (44%) discrepancy was observed in positive blood smears and 30% in negative blood smears. Out of 22 Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) interrogated, none was found involved in antimalaria activities. However, out of 13 fever treatment depots monitored, one was found partially functional. Criteria laid down for preparation of micro action plan were not followed properly in any of the districts sruveyed. Various important components of the programme like constitution of Village Health Sanitation Committee, information education communication (IEC) activities, capacity building, use of larvivorous fishes, supervision, etc. were not exercised properly. However, 100% community acceptance was recorded for insecticide-treated bed nets in the villages surveyed. Indiscriminate use of rapid diagnostic test kits yielded poor and unsatisfactory response. Declining trend of malaria was observed during 2002-06 in Districts Nagaon and Karbi-Anglong (up to 2005). In District Cachar, however, a little increasing trend was observed during 2002-04.
   Conclusion: The results of this investigation revealed that the malaria control programme had been jeopardized seriously due to improper implementation of vector control measures, lack of adequate professional support and varied commitment on the part of the State Government. It can be concluded that long-term malaria control strategy should be based on generation of increased awareness on the disease and various methods of its control, health care access and administrative commitment for increased prosperity in resource-poor settings. The observation also necessitates further in-depth evaluation with appropriate regular active surveillance round the year with prompt detection and treatment facilities in order to control malaria effectively in these districts.

AB  - Environmental risk-management decisions in the U.S. involving potential exposures to methylmercury currently use a reference dose (RfD) developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). This RfD is based on retrospective studies of an acute poisoning incident in Iraq in which grain contaminated with a methylmercury fungicide was inadvertently used in the baking of bread.(1) The exposures, which were relatively high but lasted only a few months, were associated with neurological effects in both adults (primarily paresthesia) and infants (late walking, late talking, etc.). It is generally believed that the developing fetus represents a particularly sensitive subpopulation for the neurological effects of methylmercury. The USEPA derived an RfD of 0.1 mug/kg/day based on benchmark dose (BMD) modeling of the combined neurological endpoints reported for children exposed in utero. This RfD included an uncertainty factor of 10 to consider human pharmacokinetic variability and database limitations (lack of data on multigeneration effects or possible long-term sequelae of perinatal exposure). Alcoa signed an Administrative Order of Consent for the conduct of a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) at their Point Comfort Operations and the adjacent Lavaca Bay in Texas to address the effects of historical discharges of mercury-containing wastewater. In cooperation with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and USEPA Region VI, Alcoa conducted a baseline risk assessment to assess potential risk to human health and the environment. As a part of this assessments Alcoa pursued the development of a site-specific RfD for methylmercury to specifically address the potential human health effects associated with the ingestion of contaminated finfish and shellfish from Lavaca Bay. Application of the published USEPA RfD to this site is problematic; while the study underlying the RfD represented acute exposure to relatively high concentrations of methylmercury, the exposures of concern. for the Point Comfort site are from the chronic consumption of relatively low concentrations of methylmercury in fish. Since the publication of the USEPA RfD, several analyses of chronic exposure to methylmercury in fish-eating populations have been reported. The purpose of the analysis reported here was to evaluate the possibility of deriving an RfD for methylmercury, specifically for the case of fish ingestion, on the basis of these new studies. In order to better support the risk-management decisions associated with developing a remediation approach for the site in question, the analysis was designed to provide information on the distribution of acceptable ingestion rates across a population, which could reasonably be expected to be consistent with the results of the epidemiological studies of other fish-eating populations. Based on a review of the available literature on the effects of methylmercury, a study conducted with a population in the Seychelles Islands was selected as the critical study for this analysis. The exposures to methylmercury in this population result from chronic, multigenerational ingestion of contaminated fish. This prospective study was carefully conducted and analyzed, included a large cohort of mother-infant pairs, and was relatively free of confounding factors.
   The results of this study are essentially negative, and a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) derived from the estimated exposures has recently been used by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) as the basis for a chronic oral minimal risk level (MRL) for methylmercury. In spite of the fact that no statistically significant effects were observed in this study, the data as reported are suitable for dose-response analysis using the BMD method. Evaluation of the BMD method used in this analysis, as well as in the current USEPA RtD, has demonstrated that the resulting 95% lower bound on the 10% benchmark dose (BMDL) represents a conservative estimate of the traditional NOAEL, and that it is superior to the use of "average" or "grouped" exposure estimates when dose-response information is available, as is the case for the Seychelles study. A more recent study in the Faroe Islands, which did report statistically significant associations between methylmercury exposure and neurological effects, could not be used for dose-response modeling due to inadequate reporting of the data and confounding from coexposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). BMD modeling over the wide range of neurological endpoints reported in the Seychelles study yielded a lowest BMDL for methylmercury in maternal hair of 21 ppm. This BMDL was then converted to an expected distribution of daily ingestion rates across a population using Monte Carlo analysis with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to evaluate the impact of interindividual variability. The resulting distribution of ingestion rates at the BMDL had a geometric mean of 1.60 mug/kg/day with a geometric standard deviation of 1.33; the 1st, 5th, and 10th percentiles of the distribution were 0.86, 1.04,- and 1.15 mug/kg/day. In place of the use of an uncertainty factor of 3 for pharmacokinetic variability, as is done in the current RfD, one of these lower percentiles of the daily ingestion rate distribution provides a scientifically based, conservative basis for taking into consideration the impact of pharmacokinetic variability across the population. On the other hand, it was felt that an uncertainty factor of 3 for database limitations should be used in the current analysis. Although there can be high confidence in the benchmark-estimated NOAEL of 21 ppm in the Seychelles study, some results in the New Zealand and Faroe Islands studies could be construed to suggest the possibility of effects at maternal hair concentrations below 10 ppm. In addition, while concerns regarding the possibility of chronic sequelae are not supported by the available data, neither can they be absolutely ruled out. The use of an uncertainty factor of 3 is equivalent to using a NOAEL of 7 ppm in. maternal hair, which provides additional protection against the possibility that effects could occur at lower concentrations in some populations. Based on the analysis described above, the distribution of acceptable daily ingestion rates (RfDs) recommended to serve as the basis for site-specific risk-management decisions at Alcoa's Point Comfort Operations ranges from approximately 0.3 to 1.1 mug/kg/day, with a population median (50th percentile) of 0.5 mug/kg/day. By analogy with USEPA guidelines for the use of percentiles in applications of distributions in exposure assessments, the 10th percentile provides a reasonably conservative measure. On this basis, a site-specific RfD of 0.4 mug/kg/day is recommended.

AB  - Resistance to antibiotics is an increasingly serious threat to global public health and its management translates to significant health care costs. The validation of new Gram-negative antibacterial targets as sources for potential new antibiotics remains a challenge for all the scientists working in this field. The interference with bacterial Quorum Sensing (QS) mechanisms represents a potentially interesting approach to control bacterial growth and pursue the next generation of antimicrobials. In this context, our research is focused on the discovery of novel compounds structurally related to (S)-4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione, commonly known as (S)-DPD, a small signaling molecule able to modulate bacterial QS in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In this study, a practical and versatile synthesis of racemic DPD is presented. Compared to previously reported syntheses, the proposed strategy is short and robust: it requires only one purification step and avoids the use of expensive or hazardous starting materials as well as the use of specific equipment. It is therefore well suited to the synthesis of derivatives for pharmaceutical research, as demonstrated by four series of novel DPD-related compounds described herein.

AB  - The Theory of Planned Behavior was used as a framework for investigating recreationists' attitudes, subjective norms, and behavioral control beliefs pertaining to behaviors that reduce the spread of invasive species. A series of focus groups comprised of gardeners, fishers, hunters, and boaters was convened in Oregon, USA. Findings indicate six belief barriers to changing leisure behaviors. These are the attitudes that: (1) behaviors, such as using pesticides, may be worse for the environment than invasive species; and (2) the fight against invasive species is a losing battle. Also, the norm beliefs that: (3) invasive species management is a low priority for many institutions; and (4) the general public does not know and does not care about invasive species. Finally, the behavioral control beliefs that: (5) one does not know enough about invasive species preventive behaviors to be effective; and (6) recommended preventive behaviors are too difficult to perform. Understanding the beliefs that inhibit behavior changes can help inform the creation of effective campaigns to engage stakeholders in finding solutions to halt the spread of invasive species, as well as provide a foundation on which to build additional research. Findings suggest that the first steps to overcoming these belief barriers include developing targeted education and communication to influence existing norms and beliefs.

This presentation was subsequently published (Smrchek and Morcock 1999). Recently, there has been a great increase in harmonization activities between OPPTS and OECD. Many additional activities are currently ongoing in five test method areas: physical chemical properties (e.g., K-ow methods), effects on biotic systems (ecological effects, e.g., Lemna growth inhibition, covered elsewhere), fate (degradation and accumulation, e.g., aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation), health effects, and in special activities such as in method development and testing of endocrine disrupters (e.g., avian reproduction, fish whole life cycle). The goal remains as before: to harmonize OPPTS guidelines (eventually to be published final as parts 810-885 in volume 40 of the U.S, Code of Federal Regulations) and test guidance with OECD so as to avoid unnecessary and duplicative testing of those chemicals marketed on a world wide basis, to increase efficiency, save test animals, and to reduce nontariff barriers to trade. The latest harmonization activities and results achieved, with a specific emphasis on aquatic and sediment methods are presented. ASTM has played and must continue to play an important part in the U.S. role in the development of these OECD tests. Recent activities include revision of OECD Test Guideline No. 202, Daphnia sp., Acute Immobilisation Test; development of a new oligochaete reproduction test; two chironomid sediment tests (spiked water and spiked sediment); an oligochaete bioaccumulation test; and a guidance document on Aquatic Toxicity Testing of Difficult Substances and Mixtures. Challenges and potential problems for effective harmonization continue to be present. These can be categorized into internal within the U.S. EPA and external to the agency. The former include having adequate available resources, redistribution and changes in workloads to accommodate OECD work, continual education to demonstrate the advantages of harmonization, and obtaining continued support in an environment of budget constraints. External aspects include challenges from the public, the problem of incurring continuing harmonization costs by U.S. industry, accommodating voluntary standards organizations such as ASTM, and difficulties in developing a "U.S. position" on OECD test guidelines. There also continue to be difficulties (not unexpected) in coordination, communication, and cooperation in expert panels and among participating OECD member countries. Several principles for effective harmonization in updating existing OECD test guidelines or in developing new test guidelines are discussed.

AB  - Serum amyloid A (SAA) predominantly synthesized by hepatocytes is a classical acute phase protein and has been extensively studied in mammals. However, the studies on the structure and properties of fish SAA are limited although SAA genes have been cloned and identified from various fishes. In the present study, a cDNA of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) SAA (gcSAA) was cloned and characterized, displaying a high homology with its counterparts in vertebrates. gcSAA mRNA was expressed with highest abundance in the liver and its levels were increased by a 24-hour infection of Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) for more than 5 folds in the intestine, 15 folds in the spleen, 75 folds in the head kidney and 100 folds in the liver, implying that it is an acute phase protein in grass carp. Subsequently, recombinant gcSAA protein (rgcSAA) was prepared from a prokaryotic expression system after codon optimization of its coding sequence. The direct antibacterial activity assay and the plate count assay disclosed that gcSAA inhibited the growth and survival of A. hydrophila but not Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida) which both are common bacterial pathogens in aquaculture. The propidium iodide (PI) uptake assay confirmed the bactericidal property of gcSAA, showing that it is able to enhance the uptake of PI in A. hydrophila but not E. piscicida. These findings revealed the molecular features of gcSAA and its roles in host defense against bacterial infection.

AB  - New approach methodologies (NAM), including omics and in vitro approaches, are contributing to the implementation of 3R (reduction, refinement and replacement) strategies in regulatory science and risk assessment. In this study, we present an integrative transcriptomics and proteomics analysis workflow for the validation and revision of complex fish genomes and demonstrate how proteogenomics expression matrices can be used to support multi-level omics data integration in non-model species in vivo and in vitro. Using Atlantic salmon as an example, we constructed proteogenomic databases from publicly available transcriptomic data and in-house generated RNA-Seq and LC-MS/MS data. Our analysis identified similar to 80,000 peptides, providing direct evidence of translation for over 40,000 RefSeq structures. The data also highlighted 183 co-located peptide groups that supported a single transcript each, and in each case, either corrected a previous annotation, supported Ensembl annotations not present in RefSeq, or identified novel previously unannotated genes. Proteogenomics data-derived expression matrices revealed distinct profiles for the different tissue types analyzed. Focusing on proteins involved in defense against xenobiotics, we detected distinct expression patterns across different salmon tissues and observed homology in the expression of chemical defense proteins between in vivo and in vitro liver systems. Our study demonstrates the potential of proteogenomic analyses in extending our understanding of complex fish genomes and provides an advanced bioinformatic toolkit to support the further development of NAMs and their application in regulatory science and (eco)toxicological studies of non-model species.

AB  - The enzyme nitric oxide synthase 2 or inducible NOS (NOS2), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) are important participants in various inflammatory and immune responses. However, the functional sig-nificances of the correlations among piscine NOS2, ROS and NO during pathogen infection remain unclear. In teleost, there are two nos2 genes (nos2a and nos2b). It has been previously reported that zebrafish nos2a behaves as a classical inducible NOS, and nos2b exerts some functions similar to mammalian NOS3. In the present study, we reported the functional characterization of zebrafish nos2a during bacterial infection. We found that zebrafish nos2a promoted bacterial proliferation, accompanied by an increased susceptibility to Edwardsiella piscicida infection. The nagative regulation of zebrafish nos2a during E. piscicida infection was characterized by the impaired ROS levels, the induced NO production and the decreased expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, antibacterial genes and oxidant factors. Furthermore, although both inducing ROS and inhibiting NO production significantly inhibited bacterial proliferation, only inhibiting NO production but not inducing ROS significantly increased resistance to E. piscicida infection. More importantly, ROS supplementation and inhibition of NO completely abolished this detrimental consequence mediated by zebrafish nos2a during E. piscicida infection. All together, these results firstly demonstrate that the innate response mediated by zebrafish nos2a in promoting bacterial proliferation is dependent on the lower ROS level and higher NO production. The present study also reveals that inhibition of NO can be effective in the protection against E. piscicida infection.

AB  - Biocontrol of subterranean termites is largely impeded by their social immune responses. Studies on biocontrol agents combined with natural insecticides and their possible effects on the immune defense mechanisms of termites are limited. In this study, we investigated the effects of a combined biocontrol strategy using a plantderived insect ATPase inhibitor, alpha-terpineol, with the entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) Steinernema carpocapsae against the subterranean termite Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki. Survival assays showed that even a low lethal concentration of alpha-terpineol significantly increased the EPNs-induced virulence in C. formosanus. alpha-terpineol treatment majorly inhibited the activity of Na+- K+- ATPase, which disturbed the EPNs-induced enhancement of locomotor activity and grooming behavior in termites treated with the combined strategy. Furthermore, the combination treatment had a synergistic inhibitory effect on innate immune responses in C. formosanus, which were measured as changes in the expression of immune-related genes and activities of immune system enzymes. In conclusion, alpha-terpineol can weaken the immune defense of termites against EPNs at low lethal concentrations, and is a suitable non-synthetic insecticide to prove the biocontrol efficiency of EPNs on C. formosanus. This study provides a theoretical basis and technical reference for a novel biocontrol strategy that promises to overcome the problems of host immune defense in termites.

AB  - The effects of herbicides on non-target organisms in paddy fields have become a popular research topic. As a widely used herbicide, it is necessary to explore the potential toxicity of metamifop in non-target organisms, especially aquatic animals, in co-culture mode. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of metamifop (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/L) on the defense system (antioxidation, immunity, and apoptosis) in Monopterus albus. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and protein carbonylation (PCO) increased significantly (p < 0.05) with the increasing metamifop concentration, resulting in oxidative damage. In the antioxidant system, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the 0.2 mg/L treatment group compared with the control group, and decreased in 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/L treatment groups. Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity decreased significantly (p < 0.05) with the increasing metamifop concentration. In the immune system, white cell number (WCN) increased significantly (p < 0.05) in 0.2 mg/L treatment group, and then decreased with the increase in metamifop concentration. Compared with control group, acid phosphatase (ACP) activity not only increased significantly (p < 0.05) in 0.2 mg/L treatment group, but also decreased significantly (p < 0.05) compared with the increase in metamifop concentration. However, in all treatment groups, alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). In the inflammatory response, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta expression levels in the NF-kappa B signaling pathway decreased significantly (p < 0.05) with the increase in metamifop concentration, while IL-8 expression level in the same signaling pathway increased significantly (p < 0.05) in treatment groups. The expression levels of genes related to apoptosis showed that apoptosis was promoted after exposure to metamifop. The results of the present study show that metamifop induced oxidative damage via a high level of ROS production, and then inhibited or damaged the defense systems of M. albus.

AB  - Polymeric immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor-like (pIgRL) molecules have been identified in teleost fish. However, compared to functional studies of their related genes (e.g., mammalian CD300 family) in eliminating pathogen invasion while preserving homeostasis, the roles of pIgRL in teleost fish remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that a pair of pIgRL molecules in zebrafish, pIgRL3.5 and pIgRL4.2, were highly expressed in the intestine and immune cells. Moreover, we constructed an Edwardsiella piscicida infection model, which induced strong inflammatory responses in the zebrafish intestine. Interestingly, pIgRL3.5 and pIgRL4.2 exhibited opposite inducible expression patterns in response to bacterial infection, suggesting that they perform different roles. More importantly, by conducting overexpression and knockdown experiments, our findings demonstrated that zebrafish pIgRL3.5 played a protective role in host defense against E. piscicida infection by inhibiting excessive inflammatory responses. In contrast, pIgRL4.2 facilitated pathogen growth and dissemination in zebrafish intestine. Collectively, our findings are the first to demonstrate that a pair of pIgRL molecules in teleost fish play opposite roles in mucosal immune response to bacterial infection. Therefore, our results provide crucial insights into the conserved role of pIgRL molecules in immune regulatory functions throughout vertebrate evolution.

AB  - PurposeRice agroecosystems must grow sustainably to meet the increasing demand for food. A fish-rice co-culture was introduced to conserve rice agroecosystems in farming communities. This study aims to assess the technical, socio-economic and environmental outcomes as the pillars of sustainability.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs a mixed qualitative-quantitative approach to assess a sustainable intensification programme's impact on sustainability. Data were collected using group discussions and self-assessment surveys. The study sites cover East Java and West Java provinces.FindingsThis study found that rice-fish co-culture improved the sustainability of the farming system. Farmers applied pest and disease management and partially substituted inorganic fertilisers with organic ones. The outcomes were apparent in the diversity of harvested products. Economically, the rice yield increased, the production costs decreased and the resultant increased income. Environmentally, the fish-rice co-culture was sound because of ecological inputs. The population of natural enemies of pests increased. Socially, fish-rice co-culture was acceptable to the community since there was no conflict with the local governments, local norms and religions and the existing farming practices of other crops.Research limitations/implicationsThis study was based on five groups as case studies, such that the result might not represent the general condition.Originality/valueThe study's methodology was supported by valid economic theories and data directly gathered from farmers.

AB  - The sensitivity of fish towards pollutants serves as an excellent tool for the analysis of water pollution. The effluents generated from various anthropogenic activities may contain heavy metals, pesticides, microplastics, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and ultimately find its way to aquatic environment. The enzymatic activities of fish collected from water bodies near major cities, oil spillage sites, agricultural land, and intensively industrialized areas have been reported to be significantly impacted in various field studies. These significant alterations in enzymatic activities act as a biomarker for monitoring purposes. The use of biomarkers not only helps in the identification of known and unknown pollutants and their detrimental health impacts, but also identifies the interaction between pollutants and organisms. The conventional method majorly used is physicochemical analysis, which is recognized as the backbone of the system for monitoring water quality. In physicochemical monitoring, major problems exist in assessing or predicting biological effects from chemical or physical data. Xenobiotic-induced enzymatic changes in fish may serve as an intuitive and efficient biomarker for determining contaminants in water bodies. Therefore, field validated biomarker (ValidBIO) approach needs to be integrated in water quality monitoring program for environmental health risk assessment of aquatic life impacted due to various point and non-point sources of water pollution.

AB  - Thiamethoxam (THM) isa commercial neonicotinoid insecticide with broad-spectrum insecticidal activity. It has been widely detected in the aquatic environment, but its behavioral toxicity on aquatic organisms received limited atten-tion. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to THM at three levels (0.1, 10, and 1000 mu g/L) for 45 days to inves-tigate its effect on their ecological behavior, histopathology, bioaccumulation, and stress response. The bioconcentration factor in zebrafish brain was significantly higher (p < 0.05) at low concentration of THM (0.1 mu g/L) than in other treatment groups. In terms of individual behavior, the locomotor activity, aggregation, and social activity of fish were enhanced after THM exposure, but the memory of the food zone was disturbed and abnormal swimming behavior was observed. THM exposure caused brain tissue necrosis, erythrocyte infiltration, cloudy swell-ing, and other pathological changes in brain tissue and affected the concentrations of acetylcholinesterase and cortisol related to neurotoxicity. The condition factor and organ coefficients (brain, heart, and intestine) of zebrafish were markedly impacted by THM treatment at 0.1 and 1000 mu g/L, respectively. This finding showed that THM was more harmful to fish behavior than lethality, reproduction, and growth, anda behavioral study can be a useful tool for eco-logical risk assessment.

AB  - NF -KB signaling pathway plays important roles in innate immunity, which could response to various microbials infection and mediate immune defense. It has been reported that NF -KB signaling could be activated after Edwardsiella piscicida infection in zebrafish, while the molecular mechanism of NF -KB signaling in defensing against E. piscicida remains largely unknown. Herein, we use an in vivo NF -KB detection model in larvae, and confirm that the NF -KB signaling pathway was activated by upstream receptor TLR5b through recognizing the flagella of E. piscicida. Besides, we explore the expression of immune-related genes which regulated by NF -KB during infection. Specifically, NF -KB activation upregulates the expression of cxcl8a, promoting the recruitment of neutrophils. Moreover, we prove that NF -KB signaling activation decrease the colonization of E. piscicida and rescue the mortality of larvae. Taken together, our study reveals that TLR5b-mediated NF -KB activation promotes cxcl8a-dependent neutrophils recruitment to defense E. piscicida infection in zebrafish, which contributes to better understanding the mechanism of NF -KB signaling activation in teleost fish.

AB  - Both the American lobster fishery and salmon aquaculture are important to the economy of Atlantic Canada. Where these industries operate in proximity, research is needed to better understand any interactions and their possible effects. This study explored the effects of azamethiphos on survival and development of larval American lobsters, Homarus americanus, using exposures that reflect concentrations and durations of azamethiphos (anti-sea lice therapeutant used in salmon aquaculture) that can be found in the environment following treatment. In adult trials, we recorded the survival and behaviour of individuals consecutively exposed to short pulses of low concentrations of azamethiphos for a period of 1 to 4 days. Larvae from all stages (I-IV) exhibited an immobilization response when exposed to azamethiphos and that the concentration of azamethiphos that results in a 50% increase in immobilization decreases at increasing exposure time and was as low as 2.9 mu gL(-1) for a 3 h exposure. After exposure, we registered mortality occurring within 5 days and during the moulting window. In the larval trials the concentration required to reduce the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity by 50% increased from stages I to III. In the trials conducted with adults, we observed no mortality over 21 days, but did record an increase in aggressive behaviour with an increasing number of exposures. The temporal overlap between the release of larval lobster stages and the use of azamethiphos is important to consider when assessing potential risk.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz is an oilseed relict crop. This article recognizes camelina's current and potential future uses based on a comprehensive scientific and patent document analysis. The annual number of literature on camelina increased significantly; in the case of patent documents, this increase is most evident after 2009 and in the case of scientific publications - after 2010. We identified six main thematic groups among 1039 scientific papers analyzed: cultivation, genetics, biological characteristics, livestock feeding, energetic use, and oil extraction technology. We also showed the links between these groups. There are seven vital patent applications among 2307, which meet two conditions: they are highly cited in other patent documents and submitted for protection in many global patent jurisdictions. The current scientific research on the use of camelina focuses on: animal feed, human foodstuff, industrial chemical raw materials (glycerin, polymers, ethanol, lignin), fuels (diesel, jet fuel, biogas, energy pellet, pyrolysis oil), and compost to improve soil. The results of the analysis of scientific and patent documents point to potential future applications of camelina: as a pioneer crop in reclaimed areas, as a cover or companion crop in agriculture, and as a source for new chemical additives (to pesticides, coatings, glue, and filaments in 3D printing technology), as meat analogs, as a feedstock in construction and packaging materials production, as a source of biochar and as straw water filters.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of the present study was to evaluate the Trichlorfon effects on the retrotransposable elements in tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) genome, which is a highly popular and well-known fish in the Amazon with a large reproduction number mediated by pisciculture. Thereby, tambaqui specimens were submitted to two different Trichlorfon concentrations (30% and 50% of LC50-96 h) under experimental conditions. The retrotransposons were analyzed using the FISH technique and the heterochromatin standard with the C-band technique. The retrotransposons studied presented a dispersed distribution profile in the tambaqui karyotype with Rex3 being more prominent than the others, showing the greatest increase in markings. Furthermore, the heterochromatin profile showed that these retrotransposons can be found in the heterochromatic portions of the chromosomes. Thus, it was observed that Trichlorfon has an activation mechanism for these retroelements, especially Rex3. Rex retroelements are the best-known transposable elements class and are broadly distributed through fish and also individual genomes, playing an important role in their evolutionary dynamics. Several agents can stress these elements; among them, there are some parasitic compounds such as the organochlorophosphate Trichlorfon. Consequently, knowing that the organochlorophosphate Trichlorfon is indiscriminately used as an antiparasitic in aquaculture, the current study aimed to analyze the effects of this compound on the activation of the Transposable Elements (TEs) Rex1, Rex3, and Rex6 and the structure of heterochromatin in the mitotic chromosomes of the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum). For this, two concentrations of the pesticide were used: 30% (0.261 mg/L) and 50% (0.435 mg/L) of the recommended LC50-96 h concentration (0.87 mg/L) for this fish species. The results revealed a dispersed distribution for Rex1 and Rex6 retroelements. Rex3 showed an increase in both marking intensity and distribution, as well as enhanced chromosomal heterochromatinization. This probably happened by the mediation of epigenetic adaptive mechanisms, causing the retroelement mobilization to be repressed. However, this behavior was most evident when Trichlorfon concentrations and exposure times were the greatest, reflecting the genetic flexibility necessary for this species to successfully adapt to environmental changes.

AB  - Ecological engineering is an agroecological approach to pest management that has been adopted by thousands of rice farmers in the Mekong Delta Region of Vietnam. Farmers adopted the intervention as part of a heuristic approach to developing the technology. This study assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices related to ecological engineering among participating and non-participating farmers. Interviews with 315 farmers revealed a diversity of practices under the umbrella of ecological engineering, all of which were associated with the establishment of linear vegetation strips as habitat for natural enemies. As a restoring service from society to the rice ecosystem, ecological engineering incorporated significant positive-feedback loops, particularly regarding the production of supplementary foods (provisioning services) and the aesthetic value (cultural services) of planted rice bunds. Participating farmers reported fewer insecticide applications to their main rice crop; they applied insecticides at a later crop growth stage (protecting pest regulating services); and they reported higher rice yields. However, a high dependency on government support, the role of agrochemical extensionists in providing information, a tendency to apply pesticides to vegetation strips and little change in the appreciation of wildlife-related services all threaten the social sustainability of the intervention. We recommend greater attention to optimizing linear strips to not only support natural enemies but to also enhance supplementary farm incomes while reducing material and labor costs.

AB  - Consumption of seafood brings health benefits but may increase the ingestion of contaminants. Compared with other ethnic groups in the U.S., Asians consume seafood more frequently. However, there is little information about how culturally specific fish consumption contributes to exposure to toxicants. In this work, we surveyed fish consumption among Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese communities and purchased 103 seafood samples from local markets in Chicago. Each sample was analyzed for mercury (Hg) and 92 organic chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and Dechlorane Plus and related compounds (DPs). The rank order of pollutant concentration in all samples was Hg >> sigma 66PCBs > sigma 17OCPs > sigma 8PBDEs > sigma 8DPs. Positive correlations were noted among most contaminant groups. Bluefish, pike and tuna steak had the highest mean Hg (>1 mg/kg). The mean sigma 66PCBs was highest in pike and bluefish (>100 ng/g) followed by pollock and mackerel (>40 ng/g). Overall, octopus, shrimp and tilapia were the least contaminated; while pike, bluefish, and pollock were the most contaminated. Omega-3 fatty acids were more strongly affiliated with the organic contaminants than mercury. A risk assessment identified seven types of fish that should have consumption limitations and six that should not be consumed. For these seafoods, consumption advice based on Hg levels would adequately protect health. In the survey participants, 17% of seafood mass consumed is from types of fish that should be limited to 1 or 2 meals/week, while 7% of the seafood mass consumed comes from types that should not be consumed at all. This work adds additional contaminants to the profile of health risks resulting from fish consumption among Asian Americans, which can be used in interventions aimed at conserving consumption of healthy fish while avoiding contaminants.

AB  - Environmental pollution causes adverse health effects in many organisms and contributes to health disparities for Arctic communities that depend on subsistence foods, including the Yupik residents of Sivuqaq (St. Lawrence Island), Alaska. Sivuqaq's proximity to Russia made it a strategic location for U.S. military defense sites during the Cold War. Two radar surveillance stations were installed on Sivuqaq, including at the Northeast Cape. High levels of persistent organic pollutants and toxic metals continue to leach from the Northeast Cape formerly used defense (FUD) site despite remediation efforts. We quantified total mercury (Hg) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations, and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures, in skin and muscle samples from Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), an important subsistence species. We found that Hg and PCB concentrations significantly differed across locations, with the highest concentrations found in fish collected near the FUD site. We found that 89% of fish collected from near the FUD site had Hg concentrations that exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) unlimited Hg-contaminated fish consumption screening level for subsistence fishers (0.049 mu g/g). All fish sampled near the FUD site exceeded the EPA's PCB guidelines for cancer risk for unrestricted human consumption (0.0015 mu g/g ww). Both Hg and PCB concentrations had a significant negative correlation with 813C when sites receiving input from the FUD site were included in the analysis, but these relationships were insignificant when input sites were excluded. 815N had a significant negative correlation with Hg concentration, but not with PCB concentration. These results sug- gest that the Northeast Cape FUD site remains a point source of Hg and PCB pollution and contributes to higher con- centrations in resident fish, including subsistence species. Moreover, elevated Hg and PCB levels in fish near the FUD site may pose a health risk for Sivuqaq residents.

TI  - Persistent and Toxic Chemical Pollutants in Fish Consumed by Asians in Chicago, United States (vol 811, 152214, 2022)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT

AB  - Consumption of seafood brings health benefits but may increase the ingestion of contaminants. Compared with other ethnic groups in the U.S., Asians consume seafood more frequently. However, there is little information about how culturally specific fish consumption contributes to exposure to toxicants. In this work, we surveyed fish consumption among Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese communities and purchased 103 seafood samples from local markets in Chicago. Each sample was analyzed for mercury (Hg) and 92 organic chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and Dechlorane Plus and related compounds (DPs). The rank order of pollutant concentration in all samples was Hg >> Sigma(66)PCBs > Sigma(17)OCPs > Sigma 8PBDEs > Sigma(8)DPs. Positive correlations were noted among most contaminant groups. Bluefish, pike, tuna steak, and albacore tuna had the highest mean Hg (>300 ng/g). The mean Sigma(66)PCBs was highest in pike and bluefish (>100 ng/g) followed by pollock and mackerel (>40 ng/g). Overall, octopus, shrimp and tilapia were the least contaminated; while pike, bluefish, and pollock were the most contaminated. Omega-3 fatty acids were more strongly affiliated with the organic contaminants than mercury. A risk assessment identified seven types of fish that should have consumption limitations and six that should not be consumed. For these seafoods, consumption advice based on Hg levels would adequately protect health, except for mackerel. In the survey participants, 10.3% of seafood mass consumed is from types of fish that should be limited to 1 or 2 meals/week, while 1.3% of the seafood mass consumed comes from types that should not be consumed at all. This work adds additional contaminants to the profile of health risks resulting from fish consumption among Asian Americans, which can be used in interventions aimed at conserving consumption of healthy fish while avoiding contaminants.

AB  - Ecosystem managers confronted with newly invasive species may respond with a program of suppression or eradication. Suppression of an invasive species refers to management of a species such that its effect on other biota in the local ecosystem is acceptable. Eradication is the removal of all individuals of a species from a defined region. We examine the cost and benefit trade-offs between suppression and eradication of Laurentian Great Lakes sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) based on discussions at the 3rd Sea Lamprey International Symposium (held in 2019). Substantial effort has been expended annually since the 1960s to suppress sea lampreys in the Great Lakes basin. Choosing between suppression and eradication is a value judgement, ideally made jointly by scientists, decision-makers, stakeholders, and society. Successful large-scale eradications have been limited to a small number of cases for which the cost to human society justified and supported the long-term commitment necessary for success. The greatest challenge to successful eradication of sea lampreys from the Great Lakes may be a suitable social, political, legal, and institutional environment. Preparations could be made now for a transition in which public pushback on current control methods (pesticide applications and barriers to fish passage) leads to more extensive use of an alternative control method, such as genetic control.

AB  - Azoxystrobin (AZ) has entered aquatic ecosystems and produced serious damages to fish associated with potentially increasing the susceptibility to pathogens. This study characterized the defense abilities of fish by exposed to AZ on challenging with the infection of spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV). The results showed that SVCV replication increased significantly in EPC cells and zebrafish that were exposed to up to 50 mu g/L of AZ at 3, 5, 7, and 14 d. Intracellular biochemical assays indicated that AZ at 5 and 50 mu g/L inhibited the activation of Nrf2-ARE pathway including a decrease in Nrf2 expression, Nrf2 phosphorylation, HO-1 content, and three antioxidant activities. While no significant difference in ERK1/2 and JNK MAPKs in zebrafish was observed, P38 phosphorylation was significantly decreased at 7 and 14 d, and the changes in MAPKs were more evident in EPC cells previously exposed to AZ at 7 d. These results revealed that AZ initially induced low phosphorylation of MAPKs, triggering the attenuation of Nrf2 phosphorylation to weaken Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus in a longer exposure period (more than 5 d). The data in the cells and fish also showed that antioxidant activities were decreased to some extent at 5-7 d for the cells and 7-14 d for the fish. Furthermore, interferon-related factors were decreased in AZ-exposed zebrafish, explaining the reason that fish can't resist the virus infection. Overall, the present study provided a new adverse threat of AZ by amplifying the viral outbreak to endanger ecological safety in aquatic environment.

AB  - The Lymphocyte antigen-6 (Ly-6) superfamily has been considered to play an important role in the innate immunity of mammals. The functions of Ly-6 proteins are diverse since their low sequence homology. Currently, the function of Ly-6D, a member of Ly-6 family proteins, is completely unknown in teleost. In the present study, we identified and characterized a Ly-6D homologue (named PoLy-6D) from the teleost fish Paralichthys olivaceus and examined its immune function. PoLy-6D possesses a hydrophobic signal peptide, a LU domain including a conserved "LXCXXC" motif in N-terminus and a "CCXXXXCN" motif in C-terminus. Under normal physiological condition, PoLy-6D expression distributes in all the examined tissues, the highest three tissues are successively spleen, head kidney, and blood. When infected by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and viral pathogen, PoLy-6D expression was induced and the patterns vary with different types of microbial pathogens infection and different immune tissues. In vitro experiment showed recombinant PoLy-6D (rPoLy-6D) inhibited the lysis of rabbit red blood cells by serum and selectively improved bacterial survival in serum. After serum were treated by antibody of rPoLy-6D, bacteriostatic effect of serum was obviously enhanced. These results indicate the importance of PoLy-6D as a complement regulator. rPoLy-6D possessed the binding activity to multiple bacteria but did not exhibit antimicrobial activities. The interaction between rPoLy-6D and bacteria suggests that PoLy-6D is involved in host clearance of pathogens probably by serving as a receptor for pathogens. Overexpression of PoLy-6D in vivo promoted the host defense against invading E. piscicida. These findings add new insights into the regulation mechanism of the complement system in teleost and emphasize the importance of Ly6D products for the control of pathogen infection.
