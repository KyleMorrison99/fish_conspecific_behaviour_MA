The potential for FN to act as an anti-androgen (at exposures of 1, 50, and 200 mu g FN/l over a 26-day period) was assessed in male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring kidney spiggin concentration, nest-building, and courtship behavior. Spiggin is the glue protein that male sticklebacks use to build their nests and is directly controlled by androgens. FN exposure significantly reduced spiggin production as well as nest-building activity. It also adversely affected courtship-especially the 'zigzag dance' and biting behavior of the males. FN thus appears to have anti-androgenic effects on both the physiology and behavior of the male stickleback.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  36     Total Times Cited:  40     Cited Reference Count:  83 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10646-008-0265-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Fenitrothion;Anti-androgen;Stickleback;Spiggin;Nest-building behavior;Courtship behavior;BRAIN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;SECONDARY SEX CHARACTERS;ENVIRONMENTAL ANTIANDROGENS;ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION;MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS;ESTROGENIC CHEMICALS;KIDNEY HYPERTROPHY;MALE-PREFERENCE;SPERM COUNT;ANDROGEN;Pesticides;Reproductive Behavior,NA,NA

While fenpropathrin was found to have neurotoxic effects in mammals, it remains unclear whether it has similar effects on fish. Here, we used adult zebrafish to investigate the impacts of fenpropathrin on fish social behaviors and neural activity. Exposure of adult zebrafish to 500 ppb of fenpropathrin for 72 h increased anxiety levels but decreased physical fitness, as measured by a novel tank diving test and swimming tunnel test. Fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to spend more time in the conspecific zone of the tank, possibly seeking greater comfort from their companions. Although learning, memory, and aggressive behavior did not change, fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to have shorter fighting durations. The immunocytochemical results showed the tyrosine hydroxylase antibody-labeled dopaminergic neurons in the teleost posterior tuberculum decreased in the zebrafish brain. According to a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of the brain, exposure to fenpropathrin resulted in a decrease in the messenger (m)RNA expression of monoamine oxidase (mao), an enzyme that facilitates the deamination of dopamine. In contrast, the mRNA expression of the sncga gene, which may trigger Parkinson's disease, was found to have increased. There were no changes observed in expressions of genes related to antioxidants and apoptosis between the control and fenpropathrin-exposed groups. We provide evidence to demonstrate the defect of the neurotoxicity of fenpropathrin toward dopaminergic neurons in adult zebrafish.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106756,Fenpropathrin;Locomotion;Zebrafish;Dopaminergic neurons;MONOAMINE-OXIDASE;INSECTICIDES;CALIFORNIA;DOPAMINE;TOXICITY;WATER;PESTICIDE;SEDIMENT;EXPOSURE;VALLEY;Social Behavior,NA,NA

Four adult males and two ovulated females were placed in the aquarium together with eight mature male parr. Four of the parr were exposed during the previous 4 days to two concentrations (0.1 or 1.0 mu g l(-1)) of the pyrethroid pesticide cypermethrin (a disrupter of olfactory receptor function) and four of the parr to the solvent ethanol. The behaviour of all fish was followed for 24 h and then blood and milt was collected. Exposure to the higher concentration of cypermethrin disturbed the reproductive behaviour of the parr. They displayed fewer courting events, spent less time near the nesting females and had lower volumes of strippable milt. They also had significantly lower amounts of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) in the blood plasma than the control roup. The higher cypermethrin group also had significantly lower levels of all these variables than the 9 lower cypermethrin group, apart from strippable milt that showed no significant differences between two groups. No significant differences in non-reproductive behaviours were observed between any of the groups. In the control fish, there were significant positive Correlations between (a) the number of courting events and the amount of time spent near the female, (b) blood plasma levels of 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta-P) and time spent near the female and (c) plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P and the number of courting events. Further, in control fish, higher plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P were observed in part-interacting with a female compared to those with no female contacts. A priming experiment confirmed a previous study that cypermethrin damages olfactory reception. Parr exposed to cypermethrin had significantly lower blood plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P and 11-KT than control males after exposure to ovarian fluid and urine (known to contain reproductive priming pheromones). When ethanol-exposed males were exposed to ovarian fluid and urine they had significantly higher plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P compared to those exposed to water only. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Thirty-day laboratory chronic studies were conducted to determine the relative sensitivity of standard (e.g. survival and growth) and non-standard behavioral (e.g. swimming capacity, feeding efficiency, and aggression) endpoints in predicting concentrations of fonofos protective of bluegill growth and survival. The lowest observable effect concentration (LOECs) for the standard measures of survival and growth was 5.6 mu g/L. Two behavioral endpoints were of similar sensitivity to the standard measures: swimming capacity, LOEC of 5.6 mu g/L; and prey strike frequency, LOEC of 5.6 mu g/L. However, aggressive interactions were ten-fold more sensitive than swimming or feeding behavior with a LOEC occurring at 0.6 mu g/L. Lab results were compared to an aquatic mesocosm study which exposed adult and juvenile bluegill to a 9.41 mu g/L concentration of fonofos. The dissipation half-life of fonofos was 5 days in 0.1 hectare aquatic mesocosms. Significant mortality among caged bluegill occurred within 4 days of exposure at 9.41 mu g/L. However, the 9.41 mu g/L concentration of fonofos had no statistically significant effects on survival, growth, reproduction, or total biomass of free-ranging populations of bluegill. We conclude from these studies that laboratory data can accurately estimate concentrations that are Lethal in the field and that the use of behavioral endpoints can provide ecologically relevant, yet conservative estimates of concentrations that are protective of field populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""}",10.1520/STP15817S     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),bluegill;fonofos;insecticide;behavior;sublethal toxicity;mesocosm;ORGANOPHOSPHATE INSECTICIDE;TOXICITY TESTS;RESPONSES;EXPOSURES;HAZARD;FIELD;Endpoint Determination,NA,NA

These compounds have household and agricultural applications with different formulations. Two important compounds used as household insecticides are prallethrin and transfluthrin, both from the pyrethroid chemical group. With the mode of action centered on sodium channels, pyrethroids keep the ionic sodium channels open for a long time causing the death of the insect by nervous hyperexcitability. Given the increased use of household insecticides by humans and the incidence of disease outbreaks with unknown etiology such as autism spectrum disease, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease we investigate some physiological inputs of these compounds on zebrafish. In this study, we evaluated the social interaction, shoaling formation, and anxiety-like behavior of zebrafish exposed chronically to trans- fluthrin-and prallthrin-based insecticides (T-BI and P-BI). In addition, we quantified the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in different brain regions. We observed that both compounds caused anxiolytic behavior and reduced shoaling formation and social interaction. Their behavioral biomarkers indicated a harmful ecological effect on the specie as well as a possible impact of these compounds on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZP). In addition, the AChE activity would change its activity in different brain regions modulating the anxiety-like behavior and social behavior in zebrafish.

During the acute toxicity test, fish mortality progressively increased with RT concentration along with behavioral abnormalities were detected. The calculated 96 h-LC50 value of RT was found as 1.21 mg/L. Fish exposed to 0.5 mg/L of RT (40% of 96 h-LC50) showed a significant increase in the hepatic somatic index (HSI) with a concomitant decrease in Fulton’s condition factor (K). The sublethal exposure also induced significant increases (p < 0.05) in the hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, reduced glutathione (GSH) content, and catalase (CAT) activity, with a concomitant decrease in the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. In the gills, RT exposure induced significant increases in the GST activity, GSH and LPO levels, whereas CAT activity was inhibited. RT also induced CAT and GST activities together with the content of GSH and LPO levels in the white muscle. On the other hand, significant decreases in the CAT and GST activities were detected in the heart with a marked increase in the GSH content and no changes in LPO levels. Therefore, the exposure to 0.5 mg/L of RT induced oxidative stress in the liver, gills and white muscle with tissue-specific responses related to antioxidant defenses.

Therefore, based on the previously reported beneficial functions of the L1 cell adhesion molecule, we hypothesized that L1 mimetic compounds may serve to neutralize neurotoxicity triggered by the pesticide paraquat (PQ). In this study, we attempt to use PQ for inducing PD-like pathology and the L1 mimetic compounds phenelzine sulfate (PS) and tacrine (TC) as potential candidates for the amelioration of PD symptoms using zebrafish as a model system. Administration of PQ together with the L1 mimetic compounds PS or TC (250 nM) improved survival of zebrafish larvae, protected them from locomotor deficits, and increased their sensorimotor reflexes. Moreover, application of PQ together with PS (500 nM) or TC (1000 nM) in adult zebrafish counteracted PQ-induced toxicity, maintaining normal locomotor functions and spatial memory in an open field and T-maze task, respectively. Both L1 mimetic compounds prevented reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine levels, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, protected against impairment of mitochondrial viability, improved the antioxidant enzyme system, and prevented a decrease in ATP levels. Altogether, our findings highlight the beneficial functions of the agonistic L1 mimetics PS and TC by improving several vital cell functions against PQ-triggered neurotoxicity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  141 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Aneesh""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: unsure on life stage and behaviours",10.3389/fnins.2020.00458     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),pesticide;paraquat;zebrafish;Parkinson's disease-like pathology;L1 cell adhesion molecule;phenelzine sulfate;tacrine;OXYGEN SPECIES PRODUCTION;SPINAL-CORD REGENERATION;PARKINSONS-DISEASE;OXIDATIVE STRESS;MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION;RECOGNITION MOLECULES;ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN;RAT-BRAIN;IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY;FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY;Pesticides,NA,NA

In mammals, it inhibits monoamine uptake through binding to the dopamine transporter, with a mechanism of action similar to cocaine, resulting in higher levels of dopamine at the synapse. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in a broad spectrum of processes such as locomotion, cognition, reward, and mental disorders. In this work we have studied, for the first time, the effects of TDF on behavior of both larval and adult zebrafish and its connection with changes in the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We evaluated the acute exposure of 5 dpf larvae to different concentrations of TDF, ranging from 5 mg/L to 35 mg/L. The lowest concentration does not alter neither locomotor activity nor dopamine levels but produced changes in the expression of two genes, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine transporter (dat). Besides, it induced a reduction in extracellular serotonin and had an anxiolytic-like effect, supported by a decrease in cortisol production. On the other hand, a high concentration of TDF produced a dose-dependent reduction in locomotion, which was reversed or enhanced by D1 (SCH-23390) or D2 (Haloperidol) dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively. Using in vivo electrochemistry, we show that these changes could be associated with higher levels of dopamine in the brain. Thus, in adult zebrafish, though not in larvae, TDF exposure increases locomotor activity, anxiety and aggressiveness, which coincides with the behaviors observed in mammals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: seems to be larvae exposure and adult behaviour but unsure",10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.12.012     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Triadimefon;Dopamine;Serotonin;Zebrafish;Behavior;TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE;DOWN-REGULATION;LARVAL;THIGMOTAXIS;MODULATION;LOCOMOTION;FUNGICIDES;PATTERNS;RELEASE;NEURONS,NA,NA

The agricultural workers were exposed to high concentrations of these pesticides due to unsafe work practices, and also the individual exposed to these pesticides shows alterations in their neurobehavioral. The present study aimed to evaluate the toxic effects of Monocrotophos on the locomotor activity, antioxidant activity, lipid peroxidation, and expression of genes related to apoptosis using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model. The neurotoxic effects of sub-lethal concentration of the Monocrotophos on fish were evaluated. The locomotor activity of the fishes was determined, followed by an antioxidant activity, and lipid peroxidation assays were performed. The expression of genes related to apoptosis in the brain was also determined by qPCR. The Lethal Concentration for 96 hrs. was estimated to be 36.5 mg/L. When exposed to sub-lethal concentration, marked changes were observed in locomotor activity (distance traveled, swimming speed and meandering), acetylcholinesterase activity, oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxidation) and antioxidant defenses in the brain. Expression of apoptotic genes determined by qPCR revealed an increase in Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 expressions. Data from this study suggest that Monocrotophos based pesticides induce cellular toxicity, and has the potential to alter the behavior and health.

The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 μg/L of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: S.N.

The selective mode of action of diflubenzuron provided us with a unique tool for examining the indirect responses of an experimental aquatic ecosystem following direct impacts at the primary consumer (invertebrate) trophic level. Twelve outdoor aquatic mesocosms (0.1 ha each) were randomly assigned to three treatments of diflubenzuron (four mesocosms/treatment): control, monthly (five total 10-mu g/L applications), or biweekly (twice monthly; nine total 10-mu g/L applications). Direct impacts on invertebrates (numbers and species composition of insects and zooplankton) and indirect impacts on fish (mortality, growth, and reproduction of bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass), phytoplankton (biomass and productivity), and water quality were measured over 16 weeks posttreatment. Both monthly and biweekly treatments of diflubenzuron decreased total numbers (fivefold reduction) and species richness (twofold reduction) and increased dominance (twofold increase) of zooplankton within 4 weeks posttreatment; Cladocerans, Copepods, and Rotifers were all sensitive. Diflubenzuron reduced species richness of emergent insects, which resulted in increased dominance by a few species; however, impacts on emergent insects were confounded by a treatment x time interaction. Direct reductions in invertebrate grazers caused indirect increases in algal biomass. Indirect effects on biomass (50% reduction) and individual weight (50% reduction) of juvenile bluegill occurred because of apparent decreases in invertebrate food resources. No statistically significant impacts were observed on adult bluegill or largemouth bass for the duration of the experiment. Results indicated that di8ubenzuron had both direct and indirect impacts on the experimental aquatic ecosystems under the conditions tested.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""}",10.1002/etc.5620151023     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),diflubenzuron;aquatic;indirect effects;ecological restructuring;TROPHIC CASCADES;COMMUNITY-LEVEL;INSECTICIDE;FISH;LAKE;PERSISTENCE;RESPONSES;TOXICITY;BLUEGILL;PONDS,NA,NA

The role of Petroselinum crispum essential oil (PEO) supplementation in mitigating the resulted neurotoxic insult was also investigated. The acute toxicity study revealed that the 96-h LC50 of BF is 6.81 mu g/L, and varying degrees of behavioral changes were recorded in a dose-dependent manner. The subchronic study revealed reduction of dissolved oxygen and increased ammonia in aquaria of BF-exposed fish. Clinical signs revealed high degree of discomfort and aggressiveness together with reductions in survival rate and body weight gain. The levels of monoamines in brain, and GABA and amino acids in serum were reduced, together with decreased activities of Na+/K+-ATPase and acetylcholine esterases (AchE). The activities of antioxidant enzymes were also diminshed in the brain while oxdative damage and DNA breaks were elevated. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in serum increased with overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain tissue. BF also upregulated the expression of brain-stress related genes HSP70, Caspase-3 and P53. Supplemention of PEO to BF markedly abrogated the toxic impacts of the insecticide, specially at the high level. These findings demonstrate neuroprotective, antioxidant, genoprotective, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptic effects of PEO in BF-intoxicated fish.

Both compounds are nonionic surfactants produced by the alkoxylation of ethylene oxide with tallow amine, and they are used in variety of industries such as textiles, paints, metal working, agriculture, and polish manufacture. Fish were exposed to six concentrations of TA15 (0.2–4.0 mg/L) or TH30 (8–140 mg/L) for 96 h. The LC50 for TA15 was 2.08 mg/L and for TH30 47.32 mg/L. The main clinical signs observed in fish exposed to 4 mg/L of TA15 and 32 to 140 mg/L of TH30, were lethargy, loss of shoaling behavior, respiratory distress, changes in swimming pattern, such as, loss of balance and abnormal buoyancy, prolapse of the lower lip and superior location in the water column. The highest concentrations of these compounds induced nervous signs and collapse. The relevant macroscopic lesions were skin and fins erosions with necrotic lysis of the caudal peduncle. In addition, hemorrhages in mouth, branchial arches, and petechial hemorrhages in skin were observed. An increased fluid in the celomic cavity and meningeal hemorrhages were also evident. Organs as gills, liver, brain, and anterior kidney presented severe lesions at the highest concentrations of each compound. For the first time, it is reported lesions in interrenal tissues and choroidal bodies, as well as severe telencephalic lesions associated with the POEA toxicity. These last lesions were more severe in fish exposed to TA15 than to TH30, although the pattern of injuries was similar with both substances. According to the Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemical (GHS) by the United Nations, we reported that TA15 is classified as Acute Category 2 and TH30 is Acute Category 3 for white cachama.

In this study, we tested the effects of two reference toxicants, copper (Cu) and the pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate [(S)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylbutyrate], on lethal (mortality) and sublethal endpoints (growth, swimming behavior, transcription levels of stress response genes) in juvenile (81-90-day-old) striped bass (Morone saxatilis). We established cellular stress response markers for proteotoxicity (HSP70, HSP90), phase I detoxification mechanism (CYP1A1), metal-binding (metallothionein), as well as immune-function and pathogen-defense (TGF-beta, Mx-protein, nRAMP). Quantitative real-time TaqMan (R) PCR was used to examine tissue-specific changes in the transcriptome of liver, spleen, white muscle, anterior kidney and gills after 7-day Cu exposures and 24-h esfenvalerate exposures. On the transcriptome level, exposure to Cu showed strongest effects on the transcription of metallothionein in spleen tissue, causing a 4-fold increase of mRNA at 42 ppb total Cu and a 10-fold increase at 160 ppb Cu. Exposure to Cu also caused significant tissue-specific changes in gene transcription for immune-system related genes. Esfenvalerate exposure had tissue-specific effects on the transcription of HSP70, HSP90 and CYP1A1. The most significant effects were detected in liver tissue after exposure to 0.64 mu g/L esfenvalerate.        Our results show that the stress response at the transcriptome level is a more sensitive indicator for Cu and esfenvalerate exposures at low concentrations than swimming behavior, growth or mortality. The accuracy of studies on quantitative changes in the transcriptome can benefit from an initial evaluation or the inclusion of several different tissues and the use of multiple housekeeping genes.

The physiological and biochemical responses of juvenile Nile tilapia were studied after 96 hours of exposure to TCF. The experiment was conducted randomly with two treatments: control and TCF (0.5 mg L-1). No mortality or changes in hematological profile were recorded for the fish. On the other hand, we found that TCF exposure caused behavioral, metabolic and hormonal changes that modified the response patterns of the immune and enzymatic defense system in muscle and liver tissues. Increased plasma cortisol and glucose combined with the reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle and liver tissue after 96-h of TCF exposure indicates chemical stress. In response to this harmful situation, we observed changes in the immune system that lead to an increased number of leukocytes, thrombocytes, monocytes, lysozyme and leukocyte respiratory burst activity. Furthermore, we associate the increased activity of glutathione-S-transferase in liver tissue as a strategy fish use to combat the effects of TCF. Thus, we conclude that TCF affects the physiologic parameters of Nile tilapia, which can generate irreversible situations of recovery of the clinical condition. Such fact highlights the need to search for new compounds that could replace TCF, that have no or few adverse effects on fish species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Aneesh""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: unclear on behaviours measured",10.22034/IAR.2020.1904943.1071     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Aquaculture;Toxicology;Chemotherapy;Trichlorfon;LEUKOCYTES RESPIRATORY BURST;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;OXIDATIVE STRESS;INNATE IMMUNITY;COMMON CARP;FISH;DIAZINON;GLUTATHIONE;LYSOZYME;AQUACULTURE,NA,NA

Therefore, it is of great practical importance to evaluate the combined toxic effects of pesticides. In this study, the mixture acute toxicities of fenvalerate with tebuconazole on zebrafish larvae and adults were investigated. The effects of mixture toxicity on swimming behavior of larvae were also analyzed. The mixture acute toxicity of the systems showed antagonistic effects on adult zebrafish when the mixing ratios of fenvalerate and tebuconazole were equal, but the other two ratios of the mixes both showed synergistic effects. The strongest synergistic effect was observed when fenvalerate was mixed with tebuconazole in the ratio of 8:2. The swimming behavior of zebrafish larvae was significantly inhibited after exposure to single or mixed systems for 2 days. However, significant up-regulation of behavioral indicators in zebrafish larvae was observed at the beginning of exposure in the mixture exposure groups. The results showed that fenvalerate and tebuconazole had the risk of synergistic toxic effect on zebrafish.

The effects of different concentrations of the antifoulant Mexel®432 (0.5, 1 and 2 mg L-1) on osmoregulation (osmolality and Na+/K+-ATPase activity) and stress parameters (cortisol, glucose, and lactate) were assessed in juveniles of the flatfish Solea senegalensis. Gill histopathology and alterations due to oxidative stress (increased lipid peroxidation, LPO, levels) at branchial and hepatic levels were also considered. Other parameters tested were the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, CAT; glutathione peroxidase, GPX; and glutathione reductase, GR), xenobiotic metabolism defenses involved in detoxification (carboxylesterase, CbE; 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, EROD; and glutathione S-transferase, GST) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Significant variations in osmoregulatory parameters, histological lesions and decreased branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity were observed in exposed fish. Other gill biomarkers presented little or no significant variations in relation to controls. In contrast, hepatic parameters, such as CAT activity, were inhibited while EROD activity was initially elevated but after longer exposures it recovered basal values. These results suggested that under our experimental protocol exists toxic associated to Mexel®432 exposures. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which dieldrin and p,p′-DDE cause endocrine disruption in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), fish were exposed subchronically through the diet to both contaminants. Following 120 days of exposure, p,p′-DDE decreased estradiol in females, but increased 11-ketotestosterone in both sexes. Dieldrin on the other hand, decreased estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone in both sexes. Both pesticides also altered steady state mRNA expression levels of a set of genes chosen to represent three possible mechanisms of endocrine disruption: (1) direct interaction with soluble sex steroid receptors, (2) biosynthesis of endogenous sex hormones, and (3) metabolism of endogenous hormones. p,p′-DDE acted as a weak estrogen, increasing the expression of vitellogenin and estrogen receptor α in the liver. p,p′-DDE also altered the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of endogenous hormones as well as their metabolism. Dieldrin, on the other hand, only altered expression of vitellogenin and not estrogen receptor α. Dieldrin also altered the expression of genes involved in hormone synthesis and metabolism, and it dramatically lowered plasma hormone levels.

By collecting and counting the number of sperm released during separate mating events we observed that gametes are released asynchronously. Sperms are released in the form of sperm trails laid on the nest surface; subsequently active spermatozoa leave the trails and move in the water for several minutes. Sperm trails consist of bands of viscous material in which sperm are embedded. The water samples for the estimation of sperm presence were collected gradually within 180min after 24h, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months of exposure. It was established that the reductions in count, activity of sperm, and average life span of sperm trails were significant (P<0.05) at the tested concentrations, 5 and 50μg/L after 1 month and 2 weeks of exposure to each chemical tested and to their mixture, respectively.

Despite their widespread use, the impacts of these pesticides on the neurological health of wild salmon are not well understood. Of particular concern are the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides that block synaptic transmission by inhibiting neuronal acetylcholinesterase. Here we assess the effects of diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, on alarm pheromone induced antipredator responses and homing behavior in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Nominal exposure concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 μg·L-1) were chosen to emulate diazinon pulses in the natural environment. In the antipredator study, diazinon had no effect on swimming behavior or visually guided food capture. However, the pesticide significantly inhibited olfactory-mediated alarm responses at concentrations as low as 1.0 μg·L-1. Similarly, homing behavior was impaired at 10.0 μg·L-1. Our results suggest that olfactory-mediated behaviors are sensitive to anticholinesterase neurotoxicity in salmonids and that short-term, sublethal exposures to these insecticides may cause significant behavioral deficits. Such deficits may have negative consequences for survival and reproductive success in these fish.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 184; Correspondence Address: N.L.

Thus, as androgen receptor antagonists, the fungicide vinclozolin and the principal DDT metabolite p,p'-DDE have been demonstrated to induce demasculinization in rats. Whether this is also the case in fish remains to be demonstrated. For a period of 30 days, groups of adult male guppies were exposed to vinclozolin, p,p'-DDE, or the therapeutic antiandrogen flutamide (used as positive control) applied to the fodder at concentrations between 0.1 and 100 μg/g fodder. Subsequently, sexual characteristics of relevance to the male reproductive capacity were measured and compared with untreated control fish. All three chemicals caused profound alterations at increasing levels of biological organization, even in these fully matured males. At the cellular level, the three compounds induced a significant reduction in the number of ejaculated sperm cells. At the organ level, the sexually attractive orange-yellow coloration was reduced in area and discolored, and treated fish also had smaller testes. Further, at the organismal level, computer-aided behavior analyses demonstrated a severe disruption in male courtship behavior. We conclude that this demasculinization is consistent with an antiandrogenic action of vinclozolin and p,p'-DDE and is likely to compromise reproductive capability in this fish.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 166; Correspondence Address: E.

Sperm is released in the form of sperm trails laid on the nest surface; subsequently active spermatozoa leave the trails and move in the water for several minutes. Sperm trails consists of bands of viscous material in which sperm is embedded. The water samples for the estimation of sperm presence were collected gradually within 180 min after 24 hr, 2 weeks, 1 month and 2 months of exposure.

These chemicals can be continually released, persist, or even accumulate over time, with adverse effects on the physiology and behavior of aquatic species. Most studies aimed at evaluating the intergenerational effects of CECs have focused exclusively on single chemicals. By comparison, little is known about the effects of complex CEC mixtures on the behavior of organisms, or how these effects might manifest in subsequent generations. In this study, we exposed three generations of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to environmentally relevant concentrations of a complex CEC mixture representative of urban-impacted waterways and assessed the growth and behavior of larval and adult fish in life-stage-relevant fitness contexts (foraging, boldness, courtship). We found that (i) multigenerational exposure to a complex mixture of CECs altered the behavior of both larvae and adults in different fitness contexts; (ii) concentration-dependent patterns of behavioral impairment were consistent across fitness contexts and life stages; and (iii) the effects of exposure were magnified in the F1 and F2 generations. These results highlight the need for long-term, multigenerational assessments of CECs in affected waterways to robustly inform conservation practices aimed at managing aquatic systems.

We investigated the effects of the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos and the trematode parasite Euhaplorchis californiensis on three important traits of California killifish (Fundulus parvipinnis): neurotransmitter activity, release of the stress hormone cortisol, and behavior. Killifish were collected from a population without E. californiensis, and then half of the fish were experimentally infected. Following a 30 day period for parasite maturation, infected and uninfected groups were exposed to four concentrations of chlorpyrifos (solvent control, 1-3 ppb) prior to behavior trials to quantify activity, feeding behavior, and anti-predator responses. Water-borne cortisol release rates were measured non-invasively from each fish prior to infection, one-month post-infection, and following pesticide exposure. Killifish exposed to 3 ppb chlorpyrifos exhibited a 74.6 +/- 6.8% and 60.5 +/- 8.3% reduction in brain and muscle acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity relative to controls. The rate of cortisol release was suppressed by each chlorpyrifos level relative to controls. Killifish exposed to the medium (2 ppb) and high (3 ppb) pesticide concentrations exhibited reduced activity and a decrease in mean swimming speed following a simulated predator attack. Muscle AChE was positively related to swimming activity while brain AChE was positively related to foraging behavior. No effects of the parasite were observed, possibly because of low metacercariae densities achieved through controlled infections. We found that sublethal pesticide exposure has the potential to modify several organismal endpoints with consequences for reduced fitness, including neurological, endocrine, and behavioral responses in an ecologically abundant fish.

After 96 h of exposure, carbofuran induced a decrease of the swimming velocity and inhibition of EROD activity at all concentrations tested, and inhibition of muscle ChE and brain AChE activities at 250 mu g/L. No relevant alterations in any of the other tested parameters were found. These results show that carbofuran induced adverse effects on fish by interfering with neurofunction, capability of detoxication and swimming velocity. In addition, positive and significant correlations between the swimming velocity and (i) brain AChE activity, (ii) muscle ChE activity and (iii) EROD activity suggest that the inhibition of these enzymes may somehow be related to the behavioural changes observed. Since these functions are determinant for the survival and performance of the fish in the wild, the findings of the present study suggest that adverse effects may occur in populations exposed to carbofuran if a sufficient number of animals is affected.

Swimming changes in zebrafish were detected at a concentration as low as 1% of the LC50-24h within five hours. Hyperactivity was the first response, followed by a second response of fish surfacing. The change patterns of swimming speed in zebrafish were similar in all exposure groups, but the degree increased with increasing concentrations. Swimming speed and depth were altered within the first two hours after exposure, which was regarded as the most vital phase for water quality monitoring. The duration of hyperactivity and the time of zebrafish surfacing were both logarithmically correlated with exposure concentrations, which was helpful to distinguish the level of pollution.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  47     Total Times Cited:  53     Cited Reference Count:  28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Jack""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: unsure on behaviours measured",10.3390/ijerph110403650     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioral response;bio-monitoring;zebrafish;hyperactivity;surfacing;GUPPIES POECILIA-RETICULATA;RAINBOW-TROUT;ACUTE TOXICITY;FISH;RISK;CYPERMETHRIN;INHIBITION;POLLUTANTS;INDICATORS;CADMIUM,NA,NA

Following application, endosulfan can get to watercourses through surface runoff from agricultural fields and disturb the non-target aquatic animals including freshwater fish species. Given that the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the most recurrently used biomarkers of exposure to pesticides and there are controversial results concerning the effects of endosulfan exposure and AChE activity in fish, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of endosulfan in brain AChE activity and its gene expression pattern using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an animal model. Moreover, we have analyzed the effects of endosulfan exposure in different parameters of zebrafish swimming activity and in long-term memory formation. After 96 h of exposition, fish in the 2.4 mu g endosulfan/L group presented a significant decrease in AChE activity (9.44 +/- 1.038 mu mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1): p = 0.0205) when compared to the control group (15.87 +/- 1.768 mu mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1); p = 0.0205) which corresponds to approximately 40%. The down-regulation of brain AChE activity is not directly related with the transcriptional control as demonstrated by the RT-qPCR analysis. Our results reinforce AChE activity inhibition as a pathway of endosulfan-induced toxicity in brain of fish species. In addition, exposure to 2.4 mu g endosulfan/L during 96 h impaired all exploratory parameters evaluated: decreased line crossings (approximate to 21%, 273.7 +/- 28.12 number of line crossings compared to the control group 344.6 +/- 21.30, p = 0.0483), traveled distance (approximate to 20%, 23.44 +/- 2.127 m compared to the control group 29.39 +/- 1.585, p = 0.0281), mean speed (approximate to 25%, 0.03 +/- 0.003 m/s compared to the control group 0.04 +/- 0.002, p = 0.0275) and body turn angle (approximate to 21%, 69.940 +/- 4871 absolute turn angle compared to the control group 88.010 +/- 4560, p = 0.0114). These results suggest that endosulfan exposure significantly impairs animals' exploratory performance, and potentially compromises their ecological and interspecific interaction. Our results also showed that the same endosulfan exposure did not compromise animals' performance in the inhibitory avoidance apparatus. These findings provide further evidence of the deleterious effects of endosulfan exposure in the nervous system. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The spleen and head kidney in the bony fish are the major hematopoietic organs, and play a crucial part in immune responses. This study evaluated the subchronic effects of ATR and CPF on the mRNA and protein levels of HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 in the immune organs of common carp and compared the acute and subchronic effects of ATR and CPF on the swimming speed (SS) of common carp. The results of acute toxicity tests showed that the 96 h-LC50 of AIR and CPF for common carp was determined to be 2.142 and 0.582 mg/L, respectively. Meanwhile, acute and subacute toxicity of ATR and CPF in common carp resulted in hypoactivity. We also found that the mRNA and protein levels of HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 genes were induced in the spleen and head kidney of common carp exposed to ATR and CPF in the subchronic toxicity test. Our results indicate that ATR and CPF are highly toxic to common carp, and hypoactivity in common carp by acute and subchronic toxicity of ATR and CPF may provide a useful tool for assessing the toxicity of triazine herbicide and organophosphorous pesticides to aquatic organisms. In addition, the results from the subchronic toxicity test exhibited that increasing concentration of AIR and CPF in the environment causes considerable stress for common carp, suggesting that AIR and CPF exposure cause immunotoxicity to common carp.

Traditionally, female ornaments have been considered nonfunctional, being merely a genetically correlated response to selection for male ornamentation. However, this hypothesis is only relevant to species in which the ornament is basically the same in the two sexes. Alternatively, female ornaments may be influenced by selection acting directly on the females, either through female-female competition or male choice. We tested the latter hypothesis in mate-choice experiments with two-spotted gobies (Gobiusculus flavescens). In this small marine fish, females have bright yellow-orange bellies during the breeding season, a conspicuous trait that is not present in males. We conducted two aquarium experiments to test whether males preferred to mate with more colorful females. In the first experiment, males had a choice between two females that varied in natural coloration (and belly roundness). In the second experiment, we manipulated belly coloration and kept roundness constant. Males spent more time with colorful than with drab females in both experiments and also performed far more courtship displays toward colorful females. our study provides experimental evidence that males prefer ornamented females in a fish that is not sex-role reversed, supporting the hypothesis that female ornamentation is sexually selected.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  302     Total Times Cited:  352     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Jack""=>""Included""}",10.1073/pnas.211439298     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),SEXUAL SELECTION;PARENTAL INVESTMENT;DICHROMATISM;EVOLUTION;IMMUNOCOMPETENCE;STICKLEBACKS;ASTAXANTHIN;COMPETITION;DIMORPHISM;DIRECTION;Color,NA,NA

This potential threat to animal populations posed by xenoestrogens has, hardly surprisingly, been met by an intensive global effort to identify and develop biomarkers suitable for screening chemicals for estrogen mimicking capacity. Despite this effort, there are few biomarkers capable of linking exposure to xenoestrogens to impaired reproductive capability. The reproductive success of most animals depends strongly on the ability to perform the appropriate sexual behavior. The sexual display of the male guppy is strongly linked to reproductive success and is readily quantified under laboratory conditions. This preliminary study demonstrates that exposure of adult male guppies to water weakly contaminated with either natural estrogen (17 beta-estradiol) or the xenoestrogen (4-tert-octylphenol) causes a dramatic decrease in the rate and intensity of sexual display, It is concluded that quantitative analysis of the sexual display of male guppies holds great promise as a biomarker at the organismal level for the effects of estrogen mimicking xenobiotics.

Exposure to NP at and above the EPA chronic exposure criterion resulted in an induction of plasma vitellogenin (VTG) within 14 days. However, 7 days after the cessation of exposure, VTG concentrations had dropped more than 50% and few males expressed VTG above the detection threshold. All of the morphological endpoints, including gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, secondary sexual characters, and histopathology, were unaltered by all NP treatments. However, when NP-exposed male fish were allowed to compete with control males for access to nest sites and females, most treatments altered the reproductive competence of exposed males. At lower NP concentrations, exposed males out-competed control males, possibly by being primed through the estrogenic NP exposure in a fashion similar to priming by pheromones released from female fathead minnows. At higher NP exposure concentrations, this priming effect was negated by the adverse effects of the exposure and control males out-competed treated males. Results of this study indicate the complexity of endocrine disrupting effects and the need for multiple analysis levels to assess the effects of these compounds on aquatic organisms.

Thirty-day laboratory chronic studies were conducted to determine the relative sensitivity of standard (e.g. survival and growth) and non-standard behavioral (e.g. swimming capacity, feeding efficiency, and aggression) endpoints in predicting concentrations of fonofos protective of bluegill growth and survival. The lowest observable effect concentration (LOECs) for the standard measures of survival and growth was 5.6 μg/L. Two behavioral endpoints were of similar sensitivity to the standard measures: swimming capacity, LOEC of 5.6 μg/L; and prey strike frequency, LOEC of 5.6 μg/L. However, aggressive interactions were ten-fold more sensitive than swimming or feeding behavior with a LOEC occurring at 0.6 μg/L. Lab results were compared to an aquatic mesocosm study which exposed adult and juvenile bluegill to a 9.41 μg/L concentration of fonofos. The dissipation half-life of fonofos was 5 days in 0.1 hectare aquatic mesocosms. Significant mortality among caged bluegill occurred within 4 days of exposure at 9.41 μg/L. However, the 9.41 μg/L concentration of fonofos had no statistically significant effects on survival, growth, reproduction, or total biomass of free-ranging populations of bluegill. We conclude from these studies that laboratory data can accurately estimate concentrations that are lethal in the field and that the use of behavioral endpoints can provide ecologically relevant, yet conservative estimates of concentrations that are protective of field populations.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Conference name: Proceedings of the 1998 8th Symposium on Environmental Toxicology and Risk Assessment: Standardization of Biomarkers for Endocrine Disruption and Environmental Assessment; Conference date: 20 April 1998 through 22 April 1998; Conference code: 55926; CODEN: ASTTA | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Jack""=>""Included""}",,Biomass;Ecology;Fisheries;Insecticides;Marine biology;Pesticide effects;Phosphates;Standards;Statistical methods;Toxicity;Aquatic mesocosms;Fonofos;Organophosphate;Marine pollution;Endpoint Determination,NA,NA

In our previous study, we found that neburon has strong aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist activity, but whether it causes reproductive toxicity is not clear. In the present study, zebrafish were conducted as a model organism to evaluate whether environmental concentrations of neburon (0.1, 1 and 10 pg/L) induce reproductive disorder in males. After exposure to neburon for 150 days from embryo to adult, that the average spawning egg number in high concentration group was 106.40, which was significantly lower than 193.00 in control group. This result was mainly due to the abnormal male reproductive behavior caused by abnormal transcription of genes associated with reproductive behavior in the brain, such as secretogranin-2a. The proportions of spermatozoa in the medium and high concentration groups were 82.40% and 83.84%, respectively, which were significantly lower than 89.45% in control group. This result was mainly caused by hormonal disturbances and an increased proportion of apoptotic cells. The hormonal disruption was due to the significant changes in the transcription levels of key genes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis following neburon treatment. Neburon treatment also significantly activated the AhR signaling pathway, causing oxidative stress damage and eventually leading to a significant increase in apoptosis in the exposed group. Together, these data filled the currently more vacant profile of neburon toxicity and might provide information to assess the ecotoxicity of neburon on male reproduction at environmentally relevant concentrations.

Guppies (P. reticulata) were exposed to progressive concentrations of methyl parathion (MP) and chlorpyrifos (CPF); a semi-static method according to guidelines of OECD was used. Tests of acute toxicity were conducted using 10 fish for each separate concentration and for the control group. The results were subjected to probit analysis to determine the 96h LC50 values. The 96h LC50 values of MP and CPF to P. reticulata were 8.48ppm/L (5.98-10.89) and 0.176ppm/L (0.313-0.224) respectively. In addition, behavioral changes at each concentration were observed for the individual fish. Fish were exposed for 96h to different sublethal concentrations of MP and CPF (1/4 LC50, 1/8 LC50 and 1/10 LC50) and their oxidative stress-induction potential was estimated in brain, liver and gills of fish. MDA content is induced in all tissues but maximum rise was observed in gills (161% and 153% for MP and CPF respectively). With regard to antioxidant defense system (ADS), GSH level decreased in the brain, liver and gills of tissues of MP treated fishes (22%, 6% and 13% respectively) and showed increase in brain and gills CPF treated (23% and 21% respectively). CAT, GST, GR and SOD levels fluctuated in all treatment groups relative to the control. Brain AChE showed dose-dependent inhibition in fish exposed to the higher concentrations reached 45% and 66% for MP and CPF respectively. Collective findings demonstrated that pesticide exposure of fish induced an increase in MDA and fluctuated ADS along with inhibited AChE.

In a controlled experiment, we found 26 compounds common to municipal effluent in treatment raceways all at concentrations <1.0 μg/L.

Female bonytail chub in treatment tanks had significantly lower concentrations of 17β-estradiol than control females (p = 0.001). The normally inverse relationship between primary male and female sex hormones, expected in un-impaired fish, was greatly decreased in treatment (r = 0.00) versus control (r = -0.66) female fish. We found a similar, but not as significant, trend between treatment (r = -0.45) and control (r = -0.82) male fish. Measures of fish condition showed no significant differences between male or female fish housed in effluent or clean water. Inter-sex condition did not occur and testicular and ovarian cells appeared normal for the respective developmental stage and we observed no morphological alteration in fish. The population-level impacts of these findings are uncertain.

Over this period, the widely-used organochlorines were eventually  replaced by organophosphates, with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and  chlorpyrifos (CPF) as the principal prototypes. Considerable research has  characterized the risks of DDT and CPF individually, but little is known about  the toxicology of transitioning from one class of insecticides to another, as has  been commonplace for agricultural and pest control workers. This study used adult  zebrafish to investigate neurobehavioral toxicity following 5-week chronic  exposure to either DDT or CPF, to or their sequential exposure (DDT for 5 weeks  followed by CPF for 5 weeks). At the end of the exposure period, a subset of fish  were analyzed for brain cholinesterase activity. Behavioral effects were  initially assessed one week following the end of the CPF exposure and again at  14 months of age using a behavioral test battery covering sensorimotor responses,  anxiety-like functions, predator avoidance and social attraction. Adult  insecticide exposures, individually or sequentially, were found to modulate  multiple behavioral features, including startle responsivity, social approach,  predator avoidance, locomotor activity and novel location recognition and  avoidance. Locomotor activity and startle responsivity were each impacted to a  greater degree by the sequential exposures than by individual compounds, with the  latter being pronounced at the early (1-week post exposure) time point, but not  3-4 months later in aging. Social approach responses were similarly impaired by  the sequential exposure as by CPF-alone at the aging time point. Fleeing  responses in the predator test showed flee-enhancing effects of both compounds  individually versus controls, and no additive impact of the two following  sequential exposure. Each compound was also associated with changes in  recognition or avoidance patterns in a novel place recognition task in late  adulthood, but sequential exposures did not enhance these phenotypes. The  potential for chemical x chemical interactions did not appear related to changes  in CPF metabolism to the active oxon, as prior DDT exposure did not affect the  cholinesterase inhibition resulting from CPF. This study shows that the effects  of chronic adult insecticide exposures may be relevant to behavioral health  initially and much later in life, and that the effects of sequential exposures  may be unpredictable based on their constituent exposures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ntt.2021.106985,"Aging;Animals;Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Brain/drug effects;Chlorpyrifos/*toxicity;Cholinesterase Inhibitors/toxicity;DDT;DDT/metabolism/*toxicity;Insecticides/toxicity;Locomotion/*drug effects;Neurobehavioral toxicology, anxiety-related behavior;Zebrafish;Zebrafish/metabolism",NA,NA

All three chemicals caused profound alterations at  increasing levels of biological organization, even in these fully matured males.  At the cellular level, the three compounds induced a significant reduction in the  number of ejaculated sperm cells. At the organ level, the sexually attractive  orange-yellow coloration was reduced in area and discolored, and treated fish  also had smaller testes. Further, at the organismal level, computer-aided  behavior analyses demonstrated a severe disruption in male courtship behavior.

While some evidence supports this assumption in mammals and birds, exposure to certain pyrethroids can affect concentrations of hormones vital to reproduction in fish. Thus, we hypothesized that pyrethroid exposure impacts fish reproductive behavior and the expression of genes associated with reproduction. We tested our hypothesis by examining effects of the widely used pyrethroid pesticide, bifenthrin, on the reproductive behaviors of the broadly distributed livebearing western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis. We exposed sexually mature female fish to one of five environmentally relevant concentrations of bifenthrin and conducted behavioral assays to assess reproductive, social, and space use behaviors before and after exposure. We did not detect changes in behaviors measured in response to bifenthrin. However, exposure was associated with increased expression of an estrogen receptor gene (ER-α) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in brain tissue at bifenthrin concentrations at concentrations of 5.90 and 24.82 ng/L, and 5.90 and 12.21 ng/L, respectively. Our study supports the perspective that the use of multiple endpoints through integrative approaches is essential for understanding the cumulative impact of pollutants.

ATZ is one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and a known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). The behavior of sailfin mollies is well documented in the scientific literature. Moreover, they are ecologically important indicators of environmental health, widely distributed among the mangroves along the Gulf Coast of the Southeastern US where significant amounts of ATZ are introduced via runoff and storm water drainage from coastal households, businesses, and farms. Four sets of experiments designed to assess ATZ’s impact on various aspects of male and female reproductive behavior, aggression, anxiety, and boldness were conducted following 12 weeks of exposure to 1 or 15 ppb water-borne ATZ, along with a no-exposure control group. Results indicated that the behavior of ATZ-exposed individuals differed from those of controls: ATZ exposure affected which stimulus fish (a male vs. a female) subject females preferred to associate with while also affecting female strength of preference for males of larger body size and their sexual receptivity to conspecific males in general. ATZ-exposed males also showed reduced overall responsiveness to conspecific stimuli and directed significantly less aggression toward their mirror image compared with controls. Finally, ATZ exposure affected multiple aspects of male and female behavior that are often used as proxies for boldness and anxiety. Overall, ATZ exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behaviors attributed to sexual receptivity, mate choice and motivation to mate, aggression, as well as boldness and anxiety. These ATZ-induced behavioral changes may adversely affect the long-term health of natural populations exposed to similar, environmentally realistic concentrations and add to a growing body of empirical data demonstrating substantial fitness consequences of exposure to sublethal concentrations of this known EDC. © 2023 by the author.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""Adult fish?""]}",10.3390/w15020306,"",NA,NA

The presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the aquatic environment may affect fitness by changing morphology or altering behaviors like courtship and exploration. Most research on EDC-generated behavioral effects has focused on estrogen mimics and reproductive endpoints. Far fewer studies have examined the effects of other types of EDCs or measured non-reproductive behaviors. EDCs with antiandrogenic properties are present in waterways yet we know little about their effects on exposed individuals although they may produce effects similar to those caused by estrogen mimics because they act on the same hormonal pathway. To examine the effects of antiandrogens on boldness, this study exposed male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, to a high or low dose of one of two antiandrogens, vinclozolin or flutamide, and observed behavior in three boldness assays, both before and after exposure. Overall, antiandrogen exposure increased boldness behavior, especially following exposure to the higher dose. Whether or not antiandrogen exposure influenced boldness, as well as the nature and intensity of the effect, was assay-dependent. This demonstrates the importance of studying EDC effects in a range of contexts and, at least within this species, suggests that antiandrogenic compounds may generate distinct physiological effects in different situations. How and why the behavioral effects differ from those caused by exposure to an estrogen mimic, as well as the potential consequences of increased activity levels, are discussed. Exposure to an antiandrogen, regardless of dose, produced elevated activity levels and altered shoaling and exploration in male Siamese fighting fish.

Histopathological studies, mutagenic, genotoxic and Poecilia reticulata (Guppy) were motivated by the scarcity of data in the literature concerning the effects of the formulation of the herbicide Roundup Transorb®. With everything, we sought to ascertain the effects produced by this formulation that is widely used in the Midwest of the country. This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity and mutagenic and genotoxic herbicide R. Transorb® in liver, gill and erythrocytes of the guppy, calculating and applying the LC50 test micronucleus (MN) and Comet assay (AC). The toxicity bioassays were performed to calculate the LC50;12-96h, to evaluate the effects of sublethal concentrations of herbicide subjected to acute treatment. We used 36 adult fish, weighing on average 0.496 g ± 0.28 g to calculate the LC50 and 75 adult fish also carry the MN and AC. During exposure to the herbicide was observed fish behavior at all concentrations and controlled chemical and physical changes of water. The erythrocytes were obtained by centrifugation of the gills being added to precipitate fetal calf serum, and then dripped on the slides to make the smear and electrophoresis. For the analysis of plates, 75.000 cells were counted and stipulate the frequency of occurrence of Nuclear Morphological Changes (AMNs) and AC were analyzed for 100 cells per specimen. The LC50; 12, 24, 48, 72 e 96h of R. Transorb® were 11:24, 8:55, 6.5, 6.10 and 5.65μl/L, respectively, indicating that this species is very sensitive to the herbicide studied in relation to other tropical species analyzed. These factors may be related to different formulations of herbicides and their respective surfactants. It was found that the mortality rate of fish poisoned by the herbicide increased as exposure concentrations increased. The values of LC50,12-96h show a downward trend over time, suggesting that during periods of reduced exposure will require greater amounts of herbicide to cause mortality of 50% of the population of animals. Animals exposed to the herbicide showed behavioral changes varied, such as aggressiveness, irritability, loss of the escape reflex, darkening of the body surface and banging against the wall of the aquarium. In addition, R. Transorb® hitológicas induced liver changes appreciably impairing the normal functioning of this organ. In MN and EC was possible to detect significant genotoxic and mutagenic effects in erythrocytes and gill cells, occurring gradual increase in the number of cells with AMNs and ADN damage under higher concentrations,indicating concentration-dependent effect. This herbicide has acute toxicity to guppy, promoting behavioral changes, possibly acting in a manner damaging to the liver but also in the nervous system and gill. These results also suggest that the formulation of this herbicide has genotoxic and mutagenic in erythrocytes and gill cells detected by the MN and AC. Therefore, it confirms the high risk of herbicide to the environment, its contamination may present a strong threat to populations of fish and other organisms both vertebrates and invertebrates and human health. ; Os efeitos de substâncias tóxicas, mutagênicas e genotóxica sobre órgãos-alvos e o genoma de peixes tem sido objeto de muitos estudos, sobretudo daqueles que buscam estabelecer respostas destes órgãos e dos genes aos estímulos ambientais. Estudos histopatológicos, mutagênicos, genotóxicos e em Poecilia reticulata (Guppy) foram motivados pela escassez de dados na literatura referente aos efeitos provocados pela formulação do herbicida Roundup Transorb®. Com tudo, pretendeu-se conhecer os efeitos produzidos por essa formulação que é bastante utilizada no Centro-Oeste do país. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar a ação tóxica, mutagênica e genotóxica do herbicida R. Transorb® em fígado, brânquia e eritrócito do guppy, calculando a CL50 e aplicando Teste de Micronúcleo (MN) e Ensaio Cometa (EC). Os bioensaios de toxicidade foram realizados para calcular a CL50,12-96h, avaliar os efeitos das concentrações subletais do herbicida submetido a tratamento agudo. Utilizou-se 36 peixes adultos, pesando em média 0,496g ± 0,28g para cálculo da CL50 e 75 peixes também adultos para realizar o MN e EC. Durante a exposição ao herbicida observou-se o comportamento dos peixes em todas as concentrações e controlada as variações químicas e físicas da água. Os eritrócitos foram obtidos pela centrifugação das brânquias sendo adicionado soro fetal bovino ao precipitado, e posteriormente gotejado sobre as lâminas para realizar o esfregaço e eletroforese. Para a análise das lâminas, foram contadas 75.000 células e estipulada a frequência de ocorrência de Alterações Morfológicas Nucleares (AMNs), e para EC foram analisadas 100 células por espécime. A CL50; 12, 24, 48, 72 e 96 h do R. Transorb® foram de 11.24; 8.55; 6.5; 6.10 e 5.65μl/L, respectivamente, indicando que esta espécie é bastante sensível ao herbicida estudado em relação às demais espécies tropicais analisadas. Esses fatores podem estar relacionados às diferentes formulações dos herbicidas e seus respectivos surfactantes. Verificou-se que a porcentagem de mortalidade dos peixes intoxicados pelo herbicida aumentou à medida que as concentrações de exposição aumentaram. Os valores da CL50; 12- 96 h apresentam tendência de queda ao longo do tempo, sugerindo que em períodos de menor exposição serão necessárias quantidades maiores de herbicida para causar a mortalidade de 50% da população de animais. Os animais expostos ao herbicida apresentaram alterações comportamentais variadas, tais como: agressividade; irritabilidade; perda do reflexo de fuga; escurecimento da superfície corporal e choque contra a parede do aquário. Além disso, o R. Transorb® induziu alterações hitológicas hepáticas prejudicando de forma sensível o funcionamento normal deste órgão. No MN e EC foi possível detectar efeitos mutagênicos e genotóxicos significativos nos eritrócitos e células da brânquia, ocorrendo aumento gradual no número de células com AMNs e com danos ao DNA de acordo com aumento das concentrações, indicando efeito concentração-dependente. Este herbicida apresenta toxidade aguda para guppy, promovendo alterações comportamentais, agindo possivelmente de forma danosa não só no fígado, mas também no sistema nervoso e branquial. Tais resultados sugerem também que a formulação deste herbicida possui ação genotóxica e mutagênica em eritrócitos e células branquiais detectados através dos MN e EC. Por tanto, se confirma o alto risco deste herbicida ao meio ambiente, sua contaminação pode apresentar forte ameaça para as populações de peixes e outros organismos tanto vertebrados como invertebrados e saúde do homem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",,Poecilia reticulata;Herbicida;Glifosato;Ensaio cometa;Teste micronúcleo;Pesticides;Glyphosate;Comet assay;Micronucleos test;CNPQ::CIENCIAS BIOLOGICAS,NA,NA

Considering the issues regarding the housing of the zebrafish, we aimed to investigate whether different cues, used alone or together, would interfere in zebrafish behavior. In this study, we detected that the animals have different behaviors when in the presence of isolated cues and together, therefore, we emphasize the importance of the description and detailing of the conditions of housing of these fish. After the development of this first article, we had the idea of working with imidacloprid (IMI). IMI is an insecticidal pesticide used globally in the treatment of seeds and leaves of crops such as vegetables, sugar beet, cotton and tobacco. The use of IMI is mainly due to its high insecticidal potential and low toxic potential in mammals, acting as a specific nicotinic acetylcholine agonist for invertebrate receptors. However, non-target species have been affected by this compound, which can cause from the mortality of these animals to endocrine and physiological changes in sublethal concentrations, mostly based on the LC50/LD50 (concentration/dose capable of killing 50% of the population tested), in chronic or acute exposures, within 96 hours. However, little is known about the effect that concentrations already detected in the environment and in periods shorter than 96 hours can have on non-target organisms. Therefore, our aim was to analyze whether an IBI (imidacloprid-based insecticide) alters behavior, cortisol levels and redox status in zebrafish, in a 30-minute exposure protocol and at environmentally relevant concentrations.

In this aim, we exposed the goldfish to environmental relevant concentrations of herbicide and fungicide mixtures at two temperatures for 96 hours or 16 days. The fish responses were assessed from the molecular level to individual endpoints, including omic approaches (proteomic and metabolomic), biochemical analyses (cortisol, antioxidant defenses, cellular energy allocation), indexes (somatic and condition factors) and behavioral assays (sediment reworking, activity, exploration and feeding). Our results showed that individual chemical or thermal stresses induced a general stress response including biochemical, metabolic, physiological and behavioral compensations. The absence of deleterious effect on the global condition of fish suggested the implementation of an efficient and adaptive stress response, while the hypoactivity of fish exposed to pesticide mixtures could entrain a decreased performance and fitness into the wild. At the opposite, the combined chemical and thermal stresses induced reciprocal inactivation of the stress response, with antagonism effect on cortisol secretion, antioxidant defense induction and metabolic compensation. However, increased effect on behavioral traits and decreased global condition of fish were observed. Our study showed that temperature rising sensitized fish to pesticide exposure.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rams) are popular freshwater animal models. However, their behavioral use in aquatic toxicology research is generally ham pered by oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are not well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented a comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e.,anxiety-like behavior, novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory). We found that only medaka (d-rR) presented a weak or no response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus. In addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the three species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01% v/v carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and DMSO). In contrast to zebrafish and Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes in spatial memory after subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5 mu g/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead, a hyperactivity response in the open field test and reduced social time were induced by cpf and imidacloprid, respectively. Our results suggest that: (1) behavioral effects are negligible when using <0.01% v/v carrier solvents for behavioral assessment: (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be insufficient for estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other environmental contaminants.

Pesticides are toxic to aquatic biota which form important components of the food chain such as fishes. Fishes are important sources of protein in nation-state’s diet. So a detailed understanding of the pollutant effect on fishes would be rewarding for fish conservation and fishery development. Cypermethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid pesticide and potential toxic pollutant contaminating aquatic ecosystems, was investigated in the present study for acute toxicity. Indian major carp (Cirrhinus mrigala) were selected for the bioassay experiments. Experimental fish were subjected to different concentrations of cypermethrin ranging from 0.40 to 6.40μg/l for 96 hrs in test containers. The static renewal test method of acute toxicity test was used. Water temperature was regulated at 26.8 ± 3° C. In addition, behavioral changes such as loss of schooling behaviour, swimming near the water surface, hyper activity, erratic movements, seizures, loss of buoyancy, darting movements and hitting against the walls of test tanks at each cypermethrin concentration were observed for the individual fish. Data acquired from the cypermethrin acute toxicity tests were evaluated using the arithmetic method of Karber. The 96 hr LC50 value for Cirrhinus mrigala was estimated as 4.57μg/l. The possible variation in the LC 50 values can be attributed to toxicant sensitivity, its concentration and duration of exposure. ; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",,Cirrhinus mrigala;LC50;Static renewal bioassay;Cypermethrin;Toxicity,NA,NA

Both compounds are highly neurotoxic to fish, but each with distinct biological target sites and mechanisms of action. We used common biochemical and physiological indicators of toxicity, and correlated these effects with potentially significant behavioral alterations. For chlorpyrifos, the mechanism of toxic action is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) throughout the peripheral and central nervous system. Here, we conducted biochemical assays of AChE activity in brain and muscle tissues after exposing steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (0. kisutch) to chlorpyrifos for 96 hours. We then correlated the AChE inhibition with behavioral impairment in swimming and feeding activities. In juvenile steelhead and coho exposed to 0.6-2.5 μg/L chlorpyrifos, AChE activity was inhibited between ~10-65%. This biochemical indicator was significantly correlated with changes in behavioral patterns. Spontaneous swimming rates were reduced ~30-80% in the exposed fish, and strikes at food items (brine shrimp) were reduced ~10-70%. For copper and some other neurotoxicants, the olfactory nervous system is a sensitive target site in fish. The highly-developed olfactory system in salmonids is particularly susceptible to toxic insult by dissolved chemicals since receptor neurons are in direct contact with the aquatic environment. Here, we used electrophysiological techniques to record odor-evoked responses from the sensory epithelium and the olfactory bulb as direct measures of olfactory function in juvenile coho salmon. In fish exposed to copper, chlorpyrifos, or esfenvalerate for 7 days, field potentials recorded from the sensory epithelium and the olfactory bulb showed reduced or obscured olfactory responses to two classes of odorants, which activate non-overlapping populations ...","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",,Salmonidae;Effect of pollution on;Copper;Environmental aspects;Effect of pesticides on;Chlorpyrifos,NA,NA

Global climate change, urbanization, habitat fragmentation, and pollutants are all contributing to rapid and extensive environmental change and posing significant challenges to many species. An anthropogenic impact of growing concern is exposure to a class of contaminants known as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). EDCs are natural or synthetic compounds that interfere in some way with endogenous hormones responsible for maintaining and regulating myriad phenotypic traits. These contaminants enter aquatic environments through agricultural runoff, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and sewage overflow. They have been shown to alter morphology, physiology, and behavior in exposed organisms. Mangrove ecosystems are often retrofitted with WWTPs due to their natural ability to cycle nutrients; however, little is known of how EDC exposure impacts the organisms that inhabit mangroves. The mangrove rivulus fish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, is a mangrove specialist and a suitable organism in which to study the effects of EDC exposure. Here, I use environmentally relevant concentrations of two prevalent EDCs - ethinyl estradiol, the main synthetic estrogen in contraceptive, and nonylphenol, a widespread compound used in plastics and pesticides - to assess how exposure can alter morphology, physiology, and behavior in juvenile and adult mangrove rivulus, in compound-, dose-, and route-specific ways. I also measure the extent to which exposure alters phenotypic variance-covariance structure, which can inform us about how EDCs trigger coordinated changes in many phenotypic traits, and allows us to better assess how anthropogenic activities might induce opportunities for natural selection to act and drive evolutionary change.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",,Biology;Ecology;Toxicology;Phenotype,NA,NA

Evidence exists that many non target animals in and around agricultural areas are at risk of being affected due to the mobile nature of pesticides and the intermittent nature of pesticide application. The extent to which non-target animals are affected by exposure to two organophosphates (azinphos-methyl and chlorpyrifos) was investigated through monitoring selected biomarker responses and life cycle effects under laboratory conditions in two selected test species. A representative species from both the aquatic and terrestrial environment was used as these two compartments of the environment are inevitably linked due to the mobility of pesticides from the area of application to surrounding areas. The earthworm Eisenia fetida was used as test organism in the terrestrial environment while the fish Oreochromis mossambicus served as representative of the aquatic environment. Juvenile life stages of both species were subjected to standard acute toxicity tests which showed that for both species, juvenile life stages were more sensitive to both pesticides than adults. It was also illustrated that azinphos-methyl is more toxic than chlorpyrifos to both species. Both test species were also subjected to an intermittent exposure regime in order to assess the effects of repeated pesticide application on biomarker, life-cycle and behaviour responses. The results indicated that for similar exposure regimes, azinphos-methyl was more toxic to E. fetida than chlorpyrifos and detrimentally affected all endpoints investigated. The present study suggests that exposure concentration may have a more pronounced effect in inducing a toxic response than exposure interval, irrespective of the pesticide used.

The major focus of the studies presented here is on the impairment of the relatively exposed olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), since their functionality is critical to several indispensable behaviours. The responses of OSNs to various behaviourally-relevant odorants were impaired following exposure to several pesticide classes, including triazine (e.g. atrazine), carbamate (e.g. IPBC), organophosphorus (e.g. dimethoate), and phenylurea (e.g. linuron) pesticides, as well as a pesticide formulation (i.e. Roundup). In many cases, within minutes of exposure to environmentally realistic (part per billion) concentrations, impairments of greater than 50% in OSN responses were noted. Pesticides can selectively affect different OSN classes, since one pesticide (linuron) negatively affected amino acid but not bile salt responses. Lengthy (four-day) exposure to a mixture of pesticides modelled after that found in the Nicomekl River (British Columbia) also reduced OSN responses, confirming that pesticide mixtures found in salmon-producing waterways may be injurious. In fact, the ability to discern a change in odorant intensity was reduced by 25%. This may have partially been due to inadequate neuroprotection, as glutathione-S-transferase, an enzyme that protects against cellular damage, was not upregulated to any greater of an extent than it was in fish given a 10-fold lower exposure concentration. To relate changes in OSN responses to behavioural responses, experiments were conducted on two olfactory-mediated behaviours: an amino acid-evoked searching behaviour, and an anti-predator alarm response. In the first case, exposure to three different pesticides disproportionately impacted searching behaviour with respect to neurological impairment, as the searching response was completely eliminated at greater than 60% impairment of neurological response. In the second case, the freezing behaviour salmon perform after detecting harm in a conspecific was progressively reduced with exposure to increasing concentrations of a carbamate. The work here endeavoured to assess how pesticides affect salmon neurophysiology, then relate the effects to altered behaviours, and finally place the findings within a context of environmental realism, regulations, and the status of salmon within Canada and the world.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",,Pesticides,NA,NA

In Chapter 1, I investigated the separate and combined effects of an acute 4 h exposure of the pyrethroid pesticide esfenvalerate and structural habitat complexity on the behavior and predation risk of larval topsmelt, Atherinops affinis. Larvae were exposed to four nominal esfenvalerate concentrations (control, 0.12, 0.59, 1.18 ppb) before placement into 12 L mesocosms with a predator, the three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Artificial eelgrass was manipulated to create a uniform and patchy distribution of vegetative structure at a low (500 shoots per m2 ) and high density (1000 shoots per m2 ), in addition to the absence of eelgrass. The capture success of predators and aggregative behavior of prey was quantified during the first 10 min of each trial, and mortality of prey was recorded after 60 min. I observed an increase in the proportion of swimming abnormalities of larvae exposed to esfenvalerate. Surprisingly, prey mortality did not increase linearly with pesticide exposure but increased with habitat structure (density of eelgrass), which may have been a consequence of compensating predator behavior. The degree of prey aggregation decreased with both habitat structure and iv pesticide exposure, suggesting that anti-predator behaviors by prey may have been hampered by the interactive effects of both of these factors.

I sought to characterize the impacts of chemical disturbance events occurring at multiple levels of biological organization in anthropogenically impacted freshwater ecosystems.I first evaluated the lethality and sublethal effects of two pesticides: imidacloprid (IMI) and chlorantraniliprole (CHL), as single compounds and binary mixtures, on invertebrates (Daphnia magna) and fish (Pimephales promelas). To explore the effects of complex mixtures, I also conducted exposures as described above on contaminated surface water samples collected near agricultural fields associated with the Salinas River Watershed CA (USA). Analytical chemistry data from surface water samples showed chemicals of emerging concern as common analytes at levels expected to cause detrimental effects on aquatic life. I measured acute toxicity in invertebrates exposed to field-collected surface water, and fish exposed to these water samples had significant changes in expression of genes (RT-qPCR) involved with detoxification and neuromuscular function. Exposure of fish to single compounds or binary mixtures of IMI and CHL led to increased relative gene expression of ryanodine receptors (RyR) in fish. Furthermore, IMI targeted the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in aquatic invertebrates and CHL caused overactivation of RyR in invertebrates and fish. Overall, high levels of invertebrate toxicity and impacts to neuromuscular health in fish are occurring, and pesticides of emerging concern result in detrimental effects in both invertebrates and fish.Based on these findings, I examined behavioral endpoints in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) after the surface water exposures outlined above. I detected differences in both light-induced startle responses and average total distance moved (mm/s), as well as the duration and/or frequency of cruising, bursting and freezing endpoints. These behaviors directly relate to factors influencing survival, feeding and growth, as well as potential for predator avoidance, and thus changes induced by chemical exposure contribute to ecological risk. I detected sublethal and environmentally relevant effects from exposure to contaminated surface waters, which would likely be missed in standard toxicology assessments based on mortality, illustrating the importance of incorporating sublethal endpoints in risk assessments. I then examined behavioral effects of exposure to contaminated surface water before and after a disturbance event (a “first flush” rainstorm at the end of a dry period). I postulated that the swimming behavior of D. magna would be a sensitive bioindicator of exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides of concern (IMI and CHL) under laboratory conditions as well as within complex mixtures in contaminated surface waters. I determined that average total distance moved is a sensitive endpoint for pesticide exposure. Daphnia magna response to light stimulus was the most sensitive endpoint measured. In exposures conducted before the first flush event, I detected strong dose-response patterns, with exposed organisms showing a significantly reduced response compared to controls. After first flush, I measured hypoactivity for all sites. I detected different response patterns to light stimulus for each site tested: negative dose-response, non-monotonic, and positive dose-response patterns, with significantly different responses from controls at all concentrations tested.Having determined sublethal and toxic effects from organismal exposure to water samples collected from the Salinas River Watershed, I sought to evaluate how aquatic biodiversity may be distributed across a chemically impacted watershed, and how diversity estimates obtained from both eDNA metabarcoding and morphological identification would correlate with biotic index scores. I collected eDNA from sediment at sites throughout the Salinas River Watershed, across a range of habitat qualities, and compared the resulting taxonomy with morphological data from a subset of high-diversity sites. I detected sensitive invertebrate taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera; EPT) from morphology and eDNA, with significant overlap (> 76.67%) between methods, but some taxa were missing from the sequence database, highlighting the importance of taxonomic database development. Sequencing detected more benthic macroinvertebrate taxa than morphology when compared at the genus and species levels of taxonomic resolution. Metabarcoding of sampled eDNA detected rare species of concern and invasive species. Impacted sites contained greater numbers of species known to be tolerant to poor water quality, whereas I only detected several sensitive EPT taxa from least impacted reference sites. Hydrologic distance (waterbody) and biotic index score both accounted for > 27% of the dissimilarity in taxa measured between sites. These findings suggest that biotic indices obtained from eDNA metabarcoding data can be effectively incorporated into watershed-wide, multitrophic assessments of freshwater biodiversity.Freshwater ecosystems in urban and agriculturally developed watersheds are simultaneously exposed to chemical mixtures often include new and emerging contaminants of concern, for which toxicological data may be limited. As the complexity of mixtures increases, non-targeted, effect-based evaluations become necessary for determining potential detrimental outcomes. Through my dissertation work I demonstrate that subcellular, organismal and community level effects are induced by pesticides of concern present in surface water.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

The intensive applications of glyphosate-based herbicides  and its half-life in water lead to its presence in many aquatic ecosystems.  Whereas recent studies have reported neurotoxic effects of glyphosate including  autism-related effects, most of them used extremely high (mg/L to g/L)  concentrations, so it is still unclear if chronic, low environmentally relevant  concentrations of this compound (ng/L to μg/L) can induce neurotoxicity. In this  study we analyzed the neurotoxicity of glyphosate in adult zebrafish after  waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 3 μg/L)  for two weeks. Our data showed that exposed fish presented a significant  impairment of exploratory and social behaviors consistent with increased anxiety.  The anterior brain of the exposed fish presented a significant increase in  dopamine and serotonin levels, as well as in the DOPAC/dopamine and homovanillic  acid/dopamine turnover ratios. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in the  dopaminergic system, as th1, th2, comtb, and scl6a3 was downregulated. Finally,  the brain of exposed fish presented a significant increase in the catalase and  superoxide dismutase activities, with a concomitant decrease of glutathione  stores. These changes in the antioxidant defense system are consistent with the  observed increase in oxidative stress, reflected by the increase in the levels of  lipid peroxidation in the brain. The presented results show that current  glyphosate concentrations commonly found in many aquatic ecosystems may have  detrimental consequences on fish survival by decreasing exploration of the  environment or altering social interactions. Furthermore, as zebrafish is also a  vertebrate model widely used in human neurobehavioral studies, these results are  relevant not only for environmental risk assessment, but also for understanding  the risk of chronic low-dose exposures on human health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",10.1016/j.envint.2020.106253,"*Herbicides/toxicity;*Water Pollutants, Chemical/toxicity;Animals;Anxiety/chemically induced;Behavioral impairment;Dopaminergic system;Ecosystem;Glycine/analogs & derivatives;Glyphosate;Humans;Neurotoxicity;Oxidative stress;Oxidative Stress;Zebrafish;Anxiety",NA,NA

The indiscriminate application  poses numerous problems, both for the health of the applicators and consumers,  and for the environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death  of plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is quickly gaining popularity in  behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals, sensitivity  to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost, short spawning  intervals, external fertilization, transparency of embryos through larval stages,  and rapid development. The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of  glyphosate and Roundup(®) on behavioral and morphological parameters in zebrafish  larvae and adults. Zebrafish larvae at 3days post-fertilization and adults were  exposed to glyphosate (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5mg/L) or Roundup(®) (0.01, 0.065, and  0.5mg/L) for 96h. Immediately after the exposure, we performed the analysis of  locomotor activity, aversive behavior, and morphology for the larvae and  exploratory behavior, aggression and inhibitory avoidance memory for adult  zebrafish. In zebrafish larvae, there were significant differences in the  locomotor activity and aversive behavior after glyphosate or Roundup(®) exposure  when compared to the control group. Our findings demonstrated that exposure to  glyphosate at the concentration of 0.5mg/L, Roundup(®) at 0.065 or 0.5mg/L  reduced the distance traveled, the mean speed and the line crossings in adult  zebrafish. A decreased ocular distance was observed for larvae exposed at 0.5mg/L  of glyphosate. We verified that at 0.5mg/L of Roundup(®)-treated adult zebrafish  demonstrated a significant impairment in memory. Both glyphosate and Roundup(®)  reduced aggressive behavior. Our data suggest that there are small differences  between the effects induced by glyphosate and Roundup(®), altering morphological  and behavioral parameters in zebrafish, suggesting common mechanisms of toxicity  and cellular response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",10.1016/j.tox.2017.10.007,"Aggression/drug effects;Animals;Behavior;Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Embryo, Nonmammalian/*drug effects;Female;Glycine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity;Glyphosate;Herbicides/*toxicity;Larva/drug effects;Male;Memory;Memory/drug effects;Roundup(®);Toxicity;Zebrafish;Zebrafish/*physiology",NA,NA

Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a  Parkinson’s disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical  spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses  through the blood−brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochondria.  Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the  present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination  with different potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive  behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material  and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT—2.5 µg/L, valproic acid (VPA)—0.5  mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)—250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics  (PROBIO)—3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti-social profile and mirror tests  and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We  observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a)  CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views,  this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal  intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05). Four out of  eight studied groups—(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA—displayed  an impaired, often antithetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on  distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p < 0.05, 0.005, and  0.0005). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT +  PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the  above groups (p > 0.05). Except for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a  normalized trend in terms of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental  groups exhibited exacerbated levels of aggression (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001)  not only near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001).  Conclusions: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement compared with  (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT-treated zebrafish (e−h).

Excessive and unrestricted use of pesticides is the most  serious threat to aquatic animals including amphibians and fishes. Among the  known pesticides, glyphosate based formulations have been shown to have lethal  effects on many aquatic organisms. However, negative effects of pesticides on  crucial ecological interactions such as prey-predator interactions are relatively  unknown from tropics. In many aquatic organisms, recognition of predators is  based on odor signatures; and therefore any anthropogenic alteration in water  chemistry has the potential to impair recognition and learning of predators.  Through a series of behavioral experiments we evaluated the effect of glyphosate  based herbicide (Roundup®) on the antipredator behavior of common spiny loach,  Lepidocephalichthys thermalis to understand the effects of pesticide-exposure on  recognition of conspecific alarm cues, and associative learning to avoid  predation. We exposed common spiny loach (for 3 h or 15 days) to sub-lethal  concentration (0.5 mg a.e./L) of Roundup® and subsequently with conspecific alarm  cues, signaling the proximity of a predator. Unexposed prey fish showed a  significant reduction in activity level in response to conspecific alarm cues.  Whereas such alarm response was not observed in prey fish that were exposed to  Roundup® either for 3 h or 15 days. Such lack of response could be associated  with alteration of olfactory function in prey individuals. However, this  inability to detect the conspecific alarm cues was found to be transient and  exposed fish recovered within 2 days. In subsequent experiments, we showed that  Roundup® deactivates the conspecific alarm cues thus making them unavailable for  prey to evoke the response. Furthermore, Roundup® mediated degradation of  conspecific alarm cues and diminished the associative learning necessary for  detection of the invasive/unknown/novel predators. Overall, due to the worldwide  occurrence of glyphosate in water bodies, glyphosate mediated behavioral  suppression exposes the prey animals to a considerable risk of predation, both by  native and non-native predators.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",10.1007/s10646-018-02011-z,"Animals;Association Learning/*drug effects;Chemical cues;Cues;Cypriniformes/*physiology;Food Chain;Glycine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives;Glyphosate;Herbicides/*adverse effects;Learning;Olfactory Perception/*drug effects;Pesticides;Recognition, Psychology/*drug effects;Sub-lethal;Tilapia;Time Factors;Prednisolone",NA,NA

Herein, the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was  continuously exposed to environmentally realistic levels of diuron from the  fertilised egg stage to the adult stage. Behavioural evaluation of adult marine  medaka indicated that exposure to diuron increased anxiety in the light-dark test  and increased predator avoidance. In addition, diuron exposure significantly  reduced aggression, social interaction, shoaling, and learning and memory  ability. However, only negligible variations in foraging behaviour and in  behaviour in the novel tank test were observed. Marine medaka chronically exposed  to diuron also showed decreased levels of dopamine in the brain, and changes were  observed in the transcription of genes related to dopamine synthesis, degradation  and receptors. Exposure to 5000 ng/L diuron caused significant downregulation of  the expression of the genes of tyrosine hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase and  significantly upregulated the expression of the genes of the D(5) dopaminergic  receptor.

The latest reports have  indeed revealed that rotenone promotes Parkinson's in humans, but studies aiming  to show congruent effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) are lacking. Material and  Methods. In this context, the aim of the present study was to demonstrate how  chronic administration of rotenone for 3 weeks impairs the locomotor activity and  sociability and induces oxidative stress in zebrafish. RESULTS: There were no  statistically significant differences following the analysis of their social  interaction and locomotor tests (p > 0.05). However, several exceptions have been  noted in the control, rotenone, and probiotics groups when we compared their  locomotor activity during the pretreatment and treatment interval (p < 0.05). We  further assessed the role of rotenone in disturbing the detoxifying system as  represented by three enzymes known as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione  peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Despite the fact that there were no  statistically significant changes within SOD and GPx levels between the control  group and rotenone, probiotics, and rotenone + probiotics (p > 0.05), relevant  changes have been observed between the analyzed groups (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005,  respectively).

The role of Petroselinum crispum essential oil  (PEO) supplementation in mitigating the resulted neurotoxic insult was also  investigated. The acute toxicity study revealed that the 96-h LC(50) of BF is  6.81 μg/L, and varying degrees of behavioral changes were recorded in a  dose-dependent manner. The subchronic study revealed reduction of dissolved  oxygen and increased ammonia in aquaria of BF-exposed fish. Clinical signs  revealed high degree of discomfort and aggressiveness together with reductions in  survival rate and body weight gain. The levels of monoamines in brain, and GABA  and amino acids in serum were reduced, together with decreased activities of  Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and acetylcholine esterases (AchE). The activities of  antioxidant enzymes were also diminshed in the brain while oxdative damage and  DNA breaks were elevated. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in serum increased with  overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain tissue. BF also  upregulated the expression of brain-stress related genes HSP70, Caspase-3 and  P53. Supplemention of PEO to BF markedly abrogated the toxic impacts of the  insecticide, specially at the high level. These findings demonstrate  neuroprotective, antioxidant, genoprotective, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptic  effects of PEO in BF-intoxicated fish. Based on these mechanistic insights of  PEO, we recommend its use as an invaluable supplement in the fish feed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""adults? conspecific interactions?""]}",10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105715,"*Dietary Supplements;Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism;Amino Acids/metabolism;Animals;Antioxidants/metabolism;Behavior, Animal;Bifenthrin;Biomarkers/metabolism;Brain/drug effects/*pathology;Cichlids/growth & development/*physiology;Cytokines/metabolism;DNA Damage;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/metabolism;Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects;Inflammation/*pathology;Insecticides/metabolism;Lethal Dose 50;Neurobehavioral toxicity;Neurotoxins/toxicity;Neurotransmitter Agents/metabolism;Oils, Volatile/*pharmacology;Oreochromis niloticus;Oxidative Stress/drug effects;Petroselinum crispum;Petroselinum/*chemistry;Pyrethrins/*toxicity;Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/metabolism;Survival Analysis;Water Pollutants, Chemical/toxicity;Water Quality;Dietary Supplements;Oils, Volatile",NA,NA

Observations were also made  to assess the influence of such exposure on the behavioral responses of fish to  the flow of a crude skin extract solution from conspecifics, active in social  chemocommunication and producing alarm behaviors. Additive tests were run to  check the behavioral responses of previously unexposed goldfish to the flow of a  solution of atrazine- or diuron-contaminated water, at three concentrations (0.1,  1, 10 mg/L). Significant burst swimming reactions appeared in response to a 24-h  exposure to atrazine, at the lowest concentration tested (0.5 microgram/L). A  24-h exposure to 5 microgram/L atrazine or diuron was found to induce various  significant behavioral alterations in fish. At this concentration, both  herbicides decreased grouping behavior and atrazine also increased surfacing  activity. Herbicide-exposed fish showed a decreased grouping behavior during the  flow of the skin extract solution. Sheltering was also decreased during the flow  of the biological solution in fish exposed to atrazine. Moreover, fish exposed to  diuron clearly displayed attraction responses to the flow of the skin solution.  Previously unexposed fish showed a significant increase in burst swimming  reactions in response to the flow of a solution of atrazine- or  diuron-contaminated water, at all concentrations tested (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L).  Furthermore, the diuron-contaminated flow was found to be significantly  attractive at the highest concentration. These results indicate that a short-term  exposure to a relatively low concentration (5 microgram/L) of atrazine or diuron  can affect various behaviors of fish not only directly but also indirectly by  altering the chemical perception of natural substances of eco-ethological  importance.

However, in the  last 50 years, the effects of chemicals on the behavior of model species have  been actively investigated. Progressively, behavioral endpoints were incorporated  into neurotoxicological screening protocols, and these functional outcomes are  now routinely used to identify and determine the potential neurotoxicity of  chemicals. Behavioral assays in adult zebrafish provide a standardized and  reliable means to study a wide range of behaviors, including anxiety, social  interaction, learning, memory, and addiction. Behavioral assays in adult  zebrafish typically involve placing the fish in an experimental arena and  recording and analyzing their behavior using video tracking software. Fish can be  exposed to various stimuli, and their behavior can be quantified using a variety  of metrics. The novel tank test is one of the most accepted and widely used tests  to study anxiety-like behavior in fish. The shoaling and social preference tests  are useful in studying the social behavior of zebrafish. This assay is  particularly interesting since the behavior of the entire shoal is studied. These  assays have proven to be highly reproducible and sensitive to pharmacological and  genetic manipulations, making them valuable tools for studying the neural  circuits and molecular mechanisms underlying behavior. Additionally, these assays  can be used in drug screening to identify compounds that may be potential  modulators of behavior. We will show in this work how to apply behavioral tools  in fish neurotoxicology, analyzing the effect of methamphetamine, a recreational  drug, and glyphosate, an environmental pollutant.

Variations in  environmental conditions, as those caused by contaminants, may lead to  neurochemical impairments altering the pattern of the behavioural repertoire of  the species. Atrazine (ATZ) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture that is  frequently detected in surface water, affecting non-target species. The zebrafish  is a valuable model organism to assess behavioural and neurochemical effects of  different contaminants since it presents a robust behavioural repertoire and also  all major neurotransmitter systems described for mammalian species. The goal of  this study was to evaluate the effects of subchronic ATZ exposure in defensive  behaviours of zebrafish (shoaling, thigmotaxis, and depth preference) using the  split depth tank. Furthermore, to investigate a putative role of cholinergic  signalling on ATZ-mediated effects, we tested whether this herbicide alters  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain and muscle preparations. Fish were  exposed to ATZ for 14days and the following groups were tested: control (0.2%  acetone) and ATZ (10 and 1000μg/L). The behaviour of four animals in the same  tank was recorded for 6min and biological samples were prepared. Our results  showed that 1000μg/L ATZ significantly increased the inter-fish distance, as well  as the nearest and farthest neighbour distances. This group also presented an  increase in the shoal area with decreased social interaction. No significant  differences were detected for the number of animals in the shallow area, latency  to enter the shallow and time spent in shallow and deep areas of the apparatus,  but the ATZ 1000 group spent significantly more time near the walls. Although ATZ  did not affect muscular AChE, it significantly reduced AChE activity in brain.  Exposure to 10μg/L ATZ did not affect behaviour or AChE activity. These data  suggest that ATZ impairs defensive behaviours of zebrafish, which could be  related to its action on brain cholinergic neurotransmission.

Zebrafish larvae aged 4 days  post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed for 24 h at 10 µg/L (0.01 ppm) and 100 µg/L  (0.1 ppm) of PBZ, respectively, and adults were incubated at 100 µg/L (0.1 ppm)  and 1000 µg/L (1 ppm) concentrations of PBZ, respectively, for fourteen days.  After incubation, the locomotor activity, burst, and rotation movement for the  larvae; and multiple behavioral tests such as novel tank exploration, mirror  biting, shoaling, predator avoidance, and social interaction for adult zebrafish  were evaluated. Brain tissues of the adult fish were dissected and subjected to  biochemical analyses of the antioxidant response, oxidative stress, superoxide  dismutase (SOD), and neurotransmitter levels. Zebrafish larvae exposed to PBZ  exhibited locomotion hyperactivity with a high burst movement and swimming  pattern. In adult zebrafish, PBZ resulted in anxiolytic exploratory behavior,  while no significant results were found in social interaction, shoal making, and  predator avoidance behaviors. Interestingly, high dose PBZ exposure significantly  compromised the innate aggressive behavior of the adult fish. Biochemical assays  for oxidative stress, antioxidant response, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed  significant reductions in their relative contents. In conclusion, for the first  time, our behavior assays revealed that chronic PBZ exposure induced behavioral  alterations in both larvae and the adult zebrafish. Because PBZ is a widely-used  plant growth regulator, we suggest that it is necessary to conduct more thorough  tests for its biosafety and bioaccumulation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""control?""]}",10.3390/ijerph17134632,"*Anti-Anxiety Agents/toxicity;*Zebrafish;Animals;antioxidant response;anxiolytic behavior;Behavior, Animal;biosafety;Ecosystem;Exploratory Behavior/*drug effects;Larva/drug effects;Locomotion;Motor Activity;Paclobutrazol;Triazoles;Anti-Anxiety Agents",NA,NA

Previous studies have  investigated the influences of cyprodinil on the developmental and reproductive  toxicity of fish.

In our current study, zebrafish, an ideal model  animal for behavioral studies, were exposed to cyprodinil from fertilization to  240 days postfertilization at 0.1 μg/L (environmentally relevant concentration)  and 1, 10 μg/L. Firstly, we observed that aggressive behavior of zebrafish was  significantly enhanced after exposure to 0.1-10 μg/L cyprodinil and antipredator  behavior was decreased after exposure. Cyprodinil exposure altered the  adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels, which regulate cortisol  homeostasis and were significantly reduced in all exposure groups (0.1-10 μg/L).  In addition, most of the key genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal gland  axis, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone and melanocortin 2 receptor, were  downregulated significantly in all exposure groups, which was consistent with the  hormone levels. In addition, in the hypothalamus, the number of apoptotic cells  increased in a dose-dependent manner in the cyprodinil exposure groups. Moreover,  these changes were potentially responsible for the increased aggression of  zebrafish during the mirror-like aggressive test and for the reduced antipredator  behavior during the predator avoidance test.

Environmental pollutants, notably endocrine disrupting compounds,  can interfere with the proper functioning of hormones, thereby impacting the  expression of hormonally regulated traits. Atrazine, one of the most widely used  herbicides, can alter sex hormone levels in exposed animals. I tested the effects  of environmentally relevant atrazine exposures on mating signals and behaviors in  male guppies, a sexually dimorphic freshwater fish. Prolonged atrazine exposure  reduced the expression of two honest signals: the area of orange spots  (ornaments) and the number of courtship displays performed. Atrazine exposure  also reduced aggression towards competing males in the context of mate  competition. In the wild, exposure levels vary among individuals because of  differential distribution of the pollutants across habitats; hence, differently  impacted males often compete for the same mates. Disrupted mating signals can  reduce reproductive success as females avoid mating with perceptibly suboptimal  males. Less aggressive males are at a competitive disadvantage and lose access to  females. This study highlights the effects of atrazine on ecologically relevant  mating signals and behaviors in exposed wildlife. Altered reproductive traits  have important implications for population dynamics, evolutionary patterns, and  conservation of wildlife species.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""control?

Here, to develop a quantitative assessment  parameter for spatial distribution, the zebrafish were exposed to ethanol,  pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), paraquat dichloride (paraquat) and wastewater, followed  by a behavioral test in a narrow tank. Behavioral data was acquired and analyzed  by idTracker and MATLAB. By comparing the effects of all treatments on behavior  parameters, we confirmed that the spatial distribution was more easily altered  rather than general locomotor parameters, e.g. 0.7-70 mg/L PTZ and 5-20 mg/L  paraquat being effective for altering spatial distribution but having little  effects on general locomotor parameters. Based on the heatmap, i.e., the  cumulative proportion of grids and that of frequency in grids, we calculated the  behavioral Gini coefficient (G(b)) for quantitative assessment of fish spatial  distribution. The Gini coefficient ranged from zero to 1, with larger values  meaning poorer evenness of spatial distribution. Of note, G(b) showed smaller  coefficient of variations (CV) with 3%-19% between replicate tanks in all  treatments than the highest frequency (4%-79%), displaying well robustness.  Especially, G(b) addressed the challenge of the complicated heatmap with multiple  hotspots. Overall, the behavioral Gini coefficient we established is an ideal  parameter to quantitatively assess spatial distribution of fish shoal, which is  expected to be applied in toxicity testing for chemicals and wastewater and  automatic quality monitoring for surface water and aquaculture water.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",10.1016/j.jes.2023.06.002,"*Wastewater;*Zebrafish;Animals;Behavior, Animal;Behavioral Gini coefficient;Behavioral test;Paraquat/pharmacology;Spatial distribution;Water;Zebrafish",NA,NA

The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 mu g/L. of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation.

Despite their widespread use, the impacts of these pesticides on the neurological health of wild salmon are not well understood. Of particular concern are the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides that block synaptic transmission by inhibiting neuronal acetylcholinesterase. Here we assess the effects of diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, on alarm pheromone induced antipredator responses and homing behavior in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Nominal exposure concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mu g.L-1) were chosen to emulate diazinon pulses in the natural environment. In the antipredator study, diazinon had no effect on swimming behavior or visually guided food capture. However, the pesticide significantly inhibited olfactory-mediated alarm responses at concentrations as low as 1.0 mu g.L-1. Similarly, homing behavior was impaired at 10.0 mu g.L-1. Our results suggest that olfactory-mediated behaviors are sensitive to anticholinesterase neurotoxicity in salmonids and that short-term, sublethal exposures to these insecticides may cause significant behavioral deficits. Such deficits may have negative consequences for survival and reproductive success in these fish.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  158     Total Times Cited:  184     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1139/cjfas-57-9-1911     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CHEMICAL ALARM SIGNALS;RAINBOW-TROUT;CYPRINODON-VARIEGATUS;ENDOCRINE FUNCTION;MOLECULAR-FORMS;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE;PESTICIDE;PREDATION;TOXICITY;PARR,NA,NA

Upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals also produced fewer eggs, and these eggs took significantly longer to hatch. Medaka exposed to endosulfan shortly after hatching did not differ in early mobility or foraging ability. Interestingly, upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals produced more eggs than did unexposed females. The observed effects were not dose-dependent, with medaka exposed to intermediate concentrations of endosulfan (0.10 mug/L) exhibiting the greatest response.

The ""smooth"" pattern was typically shown as a normal movement behavior, while the ""shaking"" pattern was frequently observed after treatments of diazinon.

Parameters characterizing the movement tracks, such as speed, degree of backward movements, stop duration, turning rate, meander, and maximum distance movements in the y-axis of 1-min duration, were given as input (six nodes) to a multi-layer perceptron with the backpropagation algorithm. Binary information for the smooth and shaking patterns was separately given as the matching output (one node), while eight nodes were assigned to a single hidden layer. As new input data were given to the trained network, it was possible to recognize the smooth and shaking patterns of the new input data. Average recognition rates of the smooth pattern decreased significantly while those for the shaking pattern increased to a higher degree after treatments of diazinon. The trained network was able to reveal the difference in the shaking pattern in different light phases before treatments of diazinon.

The effects of diuron on fish behaviour are currently poorly understood. Herein, the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was continuously exposed to environmentally realistic levels of diuron from the fertilised egg stage to the adult stage. Behavioural evaluation of adult marine medaka indicated that exposure to diuron increased anxiety in the light-dark test and increased predator avoidance. In addition, diumn exposure significantly reduced aggression, social interaction, shoaling, and learning and memory ability. However, only negligible variations in foraging behaviour and in behaviour in the novel tank test were observed. Marine medaka chronically exposed to diuron also showed decreased levels of dopamine in the brain, and changes were observed in the transcription of genes related to dopamine synthesis, degradation and receptors. Exposure to 5000 ng/L diumn caused significant downregulation of the expression of the genes of tyrosine hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase and significantly upregulated the expression of the genes of the D-5 dopaminergic receptor. The relative expression of the D-4 dopaminergic receptor was significantly upregulated in the 50, 500 and 5000 ng/L diuron-treated groups. These findings highlight the significant neumtoxic effects of diumn and the extent to which this may involve the dopaminergic system of the brain.

In addition, fish exhibited significant alterations in social behavior (schooling duration increased to 2.6 times and solitary duration decreased to 28% that of the control). Our findings clearly demonstrate a subacute effect of chlorpyrifos on the social behavior of medaka, which may pose a risk at population level because of the disturbance of social behavior. In addition, the recorded behavioral alterations may provide a useful tool for assessing the toxicity of organophosphorous pesticides to aquatic organisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Medaka in three developmental periods, namely 0, 20 and 40 day-old post-hatch (i.e. time points 0, 20 and 40, respectively), were exposed to CPF (12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mu g/L) for 48 h under semi-static conditions. The CPF half-lives during exposures were evaluated and the swimming patterns in a flume section (arena) were presented on two-dimensional gradient maps of forced movement of fish against water current. A comparative numerical analysis of fish residence times between each time point control and the corresponding CPF groups was performed by dividing arenas into 15 proportional areas. The time point 0 control group gradient map showed a noticeably different swim pattern from those of the >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups, which was statistically supported by the differences for residence times seen in >= 12 corresponding areas. The control group gradient maps for time points 20 and 40 differed from those of the respective >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups. The comparative analysis of the residence times in the corresponding 15 areas revealed differences in >= 5 areas for time point 20 and in >= 3 areas for time point 40. The integrative analysis of the gradient maps and the numerical statistics revealed stage-specific effects and a concentration-response relationship between CPF and alterations on forced medaka swimming despite the dissipation of CPF from the water column. These results indicate the validity of the miniaturized swim flume toward a more environmentally realistic scenario for the evaluation of neurodevelopmental and behavioral toxicity in small fish models.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not adult fish,not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.04.008     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chlorpyrifos;Forced swimming;Locomotor analysis;Small fish models;Swimming behavior;Swim flume;SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR;DANIO-RERIO;ZEBRAFISH;TOXICITY;EXPOSURE;BIOMARKERS;FISH;RESPONSES;NEUROTOXICITY;FENITROTHION,NA,NA

Pyrethroids are the fourth major group of insecticides in use worldwide and have extremely negative effects on aquatic fauna. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of an acute 2 h sub-lethal exposure to different levels of the pyrethroid esfenvalerate on the swimming behaviour of two Cypriniformes species: the native Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) and the non-native invasive bleak (Alburnus alburnus). The experimental set-up consisted of previous exposure to three esfenvalerate concentrations (control, 1.2 (low), and 2.0 (high) μg/L) before being stocked in a three-artificial-flume-channel mesocosm for behavioural trials through direct observation. Monitored behaviours included (i) routine activity, (ii) shoal cohesion, and iii) boldness. Significant differences in fish behaviour were detected for the native species (barbel), as individuals spent significantly more time holding position (i.e., resting) in the control (44.9%) than in the high esfenvalerate concentration (25.2%). Concordantly, control barbels were also found to perform more directional changes than the ones exposed to high esfenvalerate concentrations. Behavioural changes were also found for boldness, measured by the proportion of fish attempts to negotiate the upstream ramp, which were significantly higher in the control (37.4%) and in the high concentration (41.5%) compared to the low one (21.1%). Finally, regarding shoal cohesion of the barbel, it was tighter in the control (81.3%) than in the low- (70.5%) and high- (71.1%) esfenvalerate treatments. For the invasive bleak, there were no significant differences in any of the behavioural traits upon previous exposure to an increasing esfenvalerate concentration. This experimental study demonstrated that even short-term exposure to the pyrethroid esfenvalerate was sufficient to alter the behaviour of a native Cypriniformes fish species while not affecting the non-native species. This may confer greater competitive advantages to non-native fish species in the context of global changes. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: T.

Genetic and environmental factors are believed to be responsible for neuronal diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. It is difficult to restore normal nervous function after neurodegeneration; hence, prevention could be the best strategy against these diseases. Ayurved medicines such as Suvarna Bhasma (SB) have enormous potential to treat these neurological diseases. Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the protective effect of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish. Materials and methods: In this study, we induced Parkinson's-like disease model in zebrafish by inducing it with rotenone (7 μg/L). We examined the behavioural, proteomics and dopamine alterations of rotenone induced zebrafish of SB pre-treated group as compared to the control group. Results: The behavioural experiments showed that due to rotenone exposure, Parkinson's-like behavioural abnormality was induced in zebrafish. However, because of SB treatment, this behavioural abnormality was reduced. The proteomics study of zebrafish brains clearly showed that the SB-treated group was not significantly affected due to rotenone exposure. However, in the SB non-treated group, expression of nine proteins that are linked to Parkinson's disease (gene name: sncgb, ywhae1, ywhah, uchl1, ywhaba, psma6a, ywhabl, ywhaqb, and ywhabb) were differentially expressed after rotenone exposure. Finally, prevention of dopamine alteration in SB-treated fish brains confirmed the protective action of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish.

This study presents a new approach for the investigation of predator prey interactions between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) impaired by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic insecticide. With a simple experimental design including four different treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed, (3) prey exposed and (4) both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect by visual observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 mu g/l CHP. Previously, a decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid larvae was observed. However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both predators and prey, no significant differences in the feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. This suggests an impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP concentration (1 mu g/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. We therefore propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in higher tier studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk assessment.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: may do other behaviours",10.1007/s10646-010-0516-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Feeding depression;Pesticide;Non-biting midge;Fish;Interspecific interaction;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTION;TENTANS DIPTERA;FISH PREDATION;TOXICITY;BEHAVIOR;FOOD;SEDIMENT;EXPOSURE;ATRAZINE;RIVER,NA,NA

Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are environmental contaminants that mimic or alter the process of hormone signaling. In particular, EDCs that alter estrogen and androgen signaling pathways are of major concern for fishes because these EDCs may alter reproductive physiology, behavior, and ultimately sex ratio. Bifenthrin, a pyrethroid with escalating usage, is confirmed to disrupt estrogen signaling in several species of fish, including Menidia beryllina (inland silverside), an Atherinid recently established as a euryhaline model. Our main objective was to broadly assess the molecular and physiological responses of M. beryllina to the ng/L concentrations of bifenthrin typically found in the environment, with a focus on endocrine-related effects, and to discern links between different tiers of the biological hierarchy. As such, we evaluated the response of juvenile Menidia to bifenthrin using a Menidia-specific microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on specific endocrine-related genes of interest, and a Menidia-specific ELISA to the egg-coat protein choriogenin, to evaluate a multitude of molecular-level responses that would inform mechanisms of toxicity and any underlying causes of change at higher biological levels of organization. The sublethal nominal concentrations tested (0.5, 5 and 50 ng/L) were chosen to represent the range of concentrations observed in the environment and to provide coverage of a variety of potential responses. We then employed a 21-day reproductive assay to evaluate reproductive responses to bifenthrin (at 0.5 ng/L) in a separate group of adult M. beryllina. The microarray analysis indicated that bifenthrin influences a diverse suite of molecular pathways, from baseline metabolic processes to carcinogenesis. A more targeted examination of gene expression via qPCR demonstrated that bifenthrin downregulates a number of estrogen-related transcripts, particularly at the lowest exposure level. Choriogenin protein also decreased with exposure to increasing concentrations of bifenthrin, and adult M. beryllina exposed to 0.5 ng/L had significantly reduced reproductive output (fertilized eggs per female). This reduction in fecundity is consistent with observed changes in endocrine-related gene expression and choriogenin production. Taken together, our results demonstrate that environmental concentrations of bifenthrin have potential to interfere with metabolic processes, endocrine signaling, and to decrease reproductive output.

The 96 h LC50 values of MP and CPF to P. reticulata were 8.48 ppm/L (5.98-10.89) and 0.176 ppm/L (0.313-0.224) respectively. In addition, behavioral changes at each concentration were observed for the individual fish. Fish were exposed for 96 h to different sublethal concentrations of MP and CPF (1/4 LC50, 1/8 LC50 and 1/10 LC50) and their oxidative stress-induction potential was estimated in brain, liver and gills of fish. MDA content is induced in all tissues but maximum rise was observed in gills (161% and 153% for MP and CPF respectively). With regard to antioxidant defense system (ADS). GSH level decreased in the brain, liver and gills of tissues of MP treated fishes (22%, 6% and 13% respectively) and showed increase in brain and gills CPF treated (23% and 21% respectively). CAT, GST, GR and SOD levels fluctuated in all treatment groups relative to the control. Brain AChE showed dose-dependent inhibition in fish exposed to the higher concentrations reached 45% and 66% for MP and CPF respectively. Collective findings demonstrated that pesticide exposure of fish induced an increase in MDA and fluctuated ADS along with inhibited AChE. These findings may be used as valuable biomarkers for evaluation of water pollution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Olfactory function of juvenile chinook salmon was evaluated in two separate experiments following 2-h immersion exposures to 0, 1, 10, or 100 mu g diazinon/L. In the first test system. groups of 10 salmon were transferred to the prechoice zone of a Y-maze fluviarium with parallel streams of water. A dilute alarm scent composed of either chinook skin extract or L-serine was pumped into the water supply of one arm. Fish were allowed to choose either upstream arm by raising a containment screen for 10 min, then their positions were photographed and the screen lowered. In the second test system the relationship of diazinon exposure to predation susceptibility was directly examined by transferring groups of 20 salmon (10 diazinon-exposed, 10 control) to troughs containing a protective cover. These salmon were given two olfactory warnings by delivering conspecific skin extract to both their transfer container and the predation tank they entered. After a 2-min prey acclimation period, larger predator rainbow trout were allowed access to the downstream section of the tank containing the test salmon. The combined fish were observed until approximately 50% of the prey fish had been consumed. Statistical comparisons indicated that although the salmon did avoid the water streams containing alarm scents. none of the diazinon exposure levels resulted in significantly different outcomes from the controls (alpha = 0.05) in either the two-choice maze study or the predation study. Possible environmental and population implications are discussed in light of related olfaction and diazinon studies. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010:29:1113-1122.

Given the widespread uses of and exposure to glyphosate, studies on developmental toxicity are needed. Here we utilize the zebrafish vertebrate model system to study early effects of glyphosate on the developing heart. Treatment by embryo soaking with 50 mu g/ml glyphosate starting at gastrulation results in structural abnormalities in the atrium and ventricle, irregular heart looping, situs inversus as well as decreased heartbeats by 48 h as determined by live imaging and immunohistochemistry. Vasculature in the body was also affected as determined using fli-1 transgenic embryos. To determine if the effects noted at 48 h post fertilization are due to early stage alterations in myocardial precursors, we also investigate cardiomyocyte development with a Mef2 antibody and by mef2ca in situ hybridization and find alterations in the Mef2/mef2ca staining patterns during early cardiac patterning stages.

In this study, we investigate the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate on the gut microbiota, neurotransmitter levels, and anxiety in zebrafish. Our findings demonstrate that glyphosate exposure leads to dysbiosis in the zebrafish gut, alterations in central and peripheral serotonin levels, increased dopamine levels in the brain, and notable changes in anxiety and social behavior. While the dysbiosis can be attributed to glyphosate's antimicrobial properties, the observed effects on neurotransmitter levels leading to the reported induction of oxidative stress in the brain indicate a novel and significant mode of action for glyphosate, namely the impairment of the microbiome-gut-axis. While further investigations are necessary to determine the relevance of this mechanism in humans, our findings shed light on the potential explanation for the contradictory reports on the safety of glyphosate for consumers. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: B.

We assessed the effects of acute and chronic imidacloprid exposure on the social behavior of adult zebrafish. We assembled simple apparatus to detect 2D locomotion: a single camera capture system and two specially designed water tanks. We then used the tracking and heat maps of the behavior trajectories of zebrafish subjected to sham and imidacloprid exposure and compared their social behavior. Furthermore, histomorphology and immunohistochemistry of their brain tissue sections were performed to clarify possible neurotoxicity due to imidacloprid exposure in our adult zebrafish. Our results showed that imidacloprid exposure significantly reduced the zebrafish’s swimming speed, distance traveled, acceleration, and deceleration. The longer the imidacloprid exposure, the more severe the locomotor behavior disability. Furthermore, imidacloprid exposure significantly reduced heterosexual attractive behavior between the different sexes, as well as defensive alert behavior among males. Our histomorphology and immunohistochemistry evidence showed imidacloprid exposure may lead to neuronal oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and damage in the telencephalon of adult zebrafish.

Concern has been raised against its potential detriment to aquatic ecosystems. It has been shown that exposure to azoxystrobin interfere with the locomotor behavior of zebrafish larvae. This study aims to investigate whether exposure to environmental levels of azoxystrobin (2 μg/L, 20 μg/L, and 200 μg/L) changes the behavior of male adult zebrafish. Herein, we evaluated behavioral response (locomotor, anxiety-like, and exploratory behaviors), histopathology, biochemical indicators, and gene expression in male adult zebrafish upon azoxystrobin exposure. The study showed that exposure to azoxystrobin for 42 days remarkably increased the locomotor ability of male zebrafish, resulted in anxiety-like behavior, and inhibited exploratory behavior. After treatment with 200 μg/L azoxystrobin, vasodilatation, and congestion were observed in male zebrafish brains. Exposure to 200 μg/L azoxystrobin notably elevated ROS level, MDA concentration, CAT activity, and AChE activity, while inhibiting SOD activity, GPx activity, ACh concentration, and DA concentration in male zebrafish brains. Moreover, the expression levels of genes related to the antioxidant, cholinergic, and dopaminergic systems were significantly changed. This suggests that azoxystrobin may interfere with the homeostasis of neurotransmitters by causing oxidative stress in male zebrafish brains, thus affecting the behavioral response of male zebrafish. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

At the neuroendocrine level, dopamine (DA) drives behavioral (locomotion, emotion, feeding, and social interactions, etc.) and reproductive functions of fish. In the current investigation, we examined effects of rotenone toxicity on neurobehavioral and reproductive functions in whole brain and in selected brain regions in an Indian freshwater catfish, locally known as gulsha (Mystus cavasius). After fish were exposed to water containing rotenone at 0, 2.5, 25, and 250 mu g/L for 2 days, significant reductions of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; a DA metabolite), and their ratio (DOPAC/DA) were observed in whole brain at 250 mg/L ambient concentrations of rotenone. When fish were treated with rotenone at 250 mg/L concentration for 2 days, there was a significant reduction of DA, DOPAC and DOPAC/DA in diencephalon, DA and DOPAC in pituitary, and only DA in the telencephalon, compared with control fish. In parallel, numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (THthorn) neurons declined significantly in the diencephalon and pituitary after rotenone treatment. Slowed, spontaneous movement and reduced feeding behavior were observed in rotenone-treated fish. Rotenone treatment resulted in a significantly higher gonadosomatic index with many mature vitellogenic oocytes in ovaries and lowered dopaminergic activity in these fish. These results indicate that rotenone influences neurobehavioral and reproductive functions through dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in gulsha brain. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this, the aim of this study was to examine the dose- and time-dependent effects of low- and high-dose pesticide mixture (metalachlor, linuron, isoproturon, tebucanazole, aclonifen, atrazine, pendimethalin, azinphos-methyl) and heat stress co-exposure (22°C control/32°C treatment for 4-week) on free-swimming behaviors and cumulative actionless time (CAT) of goldfish. Behavioral analysis showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in distance swam, as well as a subsequent increase in CAT. Vertical and horizontal spatial behavioral use were affected under heat and pesticides co-exposure conditions. In 3- and 4-week(s) exposure groups, horizontal spatial behavioral use demonstrated elevated time spent in the lower third of the aquarium. Similarly, during 3- and 4-week(s) exposure (32°C control and 32°C high doses) vertical spatial behavioral use was found to increase time spent in the outermost edges of the aquarium. In all treatment groups, the final condition factor (KM) showed significant attenuation when compared to the initial KM. However, there was an unclear relationship between heat/pesticide co-exposure and growth most notably in 32°C high-dose groups. In addition, the expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A mRNA was significantly higher in pesticide-exposed groups. Taken together, data demonstrated that co-exposure with low- or high-dose pesticide mixture and heat stress significantly impacted natural swimming patterns, which over time might result in the broader population and ecological effects. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: M.S.

Since steroid hormone biosynthesis is regulated through neurotransmission of the central nervous system (CNS), studies were conducted to determine whether neurotransmitters that control hormone biosynthesis could be affected after diuron and diuron metabolites treatment. As the same neurotransmitters and steroid hormones regulate behavioral outcomes, aggression was also evaluated in male Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Male tilapias were exposed for 10 days to waterborne diuron and the metabolites 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA), 3,4-dichlorophenyl-N-methylurea (DCPMU), at nominal concentrations of 100 ng L-1. In contrast to Diuron, DCA and DCPMU significantly diminished plasma testosterone concentrations (39.4% and 36.8%, respectively) and reduced dopamine levels in the brain (47.1% and 44.2%, respectively). In addition, concentrations of the stress steroid, cortisol were increased after DCA (71.0%) and DCPMU (57.8-%) exposure. A significant decrease in aggressive behavior was also observed in animals treated with the metabolites DCA (50.9%) and DCPMU (68.8%). These results indicate that biotransformation of diuron to active metabolites alter signaling pathways of the CNS which may impact androgen and the stress response as well as behavior necessary for social dominance, growth, and reproduction.

Goldfish, Carassius auratus, were exposed during 96 h at two temperatures (22 and 32 A degrees C) to a mixture of common pesticides (S-metolachlor, isoproturon, linuron, atrazine-desethyl, aclonifen, pendimethalin, and tebuconazol) at two environmentally relevant concentrations (total concentrations MIX1 = 8.4 mu g L-1 and MIX2 = 42 mu g L-1). We investigated the sediment reworking behavior, which has a major ecological functional role. We also focused on three physiological traits from the cellular up to the whole individual level showing metabolic status of fish (protein concentration in liver and muscle, hepatosomatic index, and Fulton's condition factor). Individual thermal stress and low concentrations of pesticides decreased the sediment reworking activity of fish and entrained metabolic compensation with global depletion in energy stores. We found that combined chemical and thermal stresses impaired the capacity of fish to set up an efficient adaptive response. Our results strongly suggest that temperature will make fish more sensitive to water contamination by pesticides, raising concerns about wild fish conservation submitted to global changes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  31     Total Times Cited:  32     Cited Reference Count:  78 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on life stage,not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1007/s11356-015-5147-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Global change;Temperature warming;Pesticides;Fish;Bioturbation;EXPOSURE;STRESS,NA,NA

In adults, exposure to the pesticide did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a marked decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion, since baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at all conditions.

At times, these applications tend to be more effective at the onset of fish spawning in spring: however, they can cause conflicts between anglers and lake management personnel assigned to control excessive SAV. We evaluated the direct application of an aquatic herbicide (Aquathol K [dipotassium salt of endothall]) on the nest behavior and fidelity of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and measured the subsequent reproductive success of these fish. Endothall was applied to achieve a shoreline concentration of 5 mg/L of water volume in 0.1-ha ponds (3 mg/L whole-pond concentration). It was applied directly on nests in three ponds in March 2005, 2006, and 2007 when largemouth bass initiated spawning; spawning activity was monitored over 14-15 d. Using similar techniques, we applied water to another three ponds where largemouth bass were nesting. For all 3 years, endothall did not affect nest guarding by largemouth bass, and nest fidelity was similar to that for ponds treated with water. Endothall concentrations declined about sevenfold over 21 d but persisted in the water during spawning. Electrofishing of young largemouth bass 2-3 months after spawning showed that their relative abundance and size were similar among the ponds treated with endothall and the control ponds. Similarly, the density and biomass of age-0 largemouth bass did not vary between treatments for fish killed with rotenone in late August each year. Managers can use these results to address angler concerns about endothall application during largemouth bass spawning and thereby lessen conflicts over efforts to control excessive SAV.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1577/M08-041.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),AQUATIC VEGETATION;LAKE SEMINOLE;POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS;ANGLER ATTITUDES;HYDRILLA;FISHERY;MANAGEMENT;HERBICIDES;REMOVAL;Reproductive Behavior,NA,NA

In this study, common carp were used to assess the individual and combined toxicity of PE-MPs (0, 1.5, or 4.5 mg/L) and GLY (0, 5, or 15 mg/L) on the brain-gut axis. After 60 days of exposure, the developmental toxicity, blood-brain barrier (BBB), locomotor behavior, intestinal barrier (physical barrier, chemical barrier, microbial barrier), and intestinal content metabolism of common carp were evaluated. Results showed that 15 mg/L of GLY exposure significantly reduced the mRNA expression of tight-junction genes (occludin, claudin-2, and ZO-1) in the brain, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was clearly inhibited by high concentrations of GLY. However, different concentrations of PE-MPs had no significant effect on the activity of AChE. Furthermore, the free-swimming behavior of common carp was distinctly inhibited by treatment with a combination of 15 mg/L GLY and 4.5 mg/L PE-MPs. Histological studies indicated that PE-MPs alone and in combination with GLY could disrupt the physical and chemical intestinal barriers of common carp. Additionally, the abundance and diversity of gut microbiota in common carp were significantly changed when exposed to a combination of PE-MPs and GLY. Metabolomics further revealed that PE-MPs combined with GLY triggered metabolic changes and that differential metabolites were related to amino acid and lipid metabolism. These findings illustrate that exposure to PE-MPs or GLY alone is toxic to fish and results in physiological changes to the brain-gut axis. This work offers a robust analysis to understand the mechanisms underlying GLY and MP-induced aquatic toxicity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 40; Correspondence Address: X.

Behavioral analysis showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in distance swam, as well as a subsequent increase in CAT. Vertical and horizontal spatial behavioral use were affected under heat and pesticides co-exposure conditions. In 3- and 4-week(s) exposure groups, horizontal spatial behavioral use demonstrated elevated time spent in the lower third of the aquarium. Similarly, during 3- and 4-week(s) exposure (32 degrees C control and 32 degrees C high doses) vertical spatial behavioral use was found to increase time spent in the outermost edges of the aquarium. In all treatment groups, the final condition factor (KM) showed significant attenuation when compared to the initial KM. However, there was an unclear relationship between heat/pesticide co-exposure and growth most notably in 32 degrees C high-dose groups. In addition, the expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A mRNA was significantly higher in pesticide-exposed groups. Taken together, data demonstrated that co-exposure with low- or high-dose pesticide mixture and heat stress significantly impacted natural swimming patterns, which over time might result in the broader population and ecological effects.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  116 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no behaviour,not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1080/15287394.2023.2174463,Environmental pollutants;global warming;fish behavior;cytochrome P450 1A;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS;SUBLETHAL TOXICITY;WATER TEMPERATURE;GENE-EXPRESSION;CHRONIC STRESS;HEAT-STRESS;FISH;GROWTH;RESPONSES;ATRAZINE;Pesticides;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System,NA,NA

Animals acquire new skills due to conditioned responses resulting from a sequence of neutral and unconditioned stimuli affecting their bodies; there is a constant time interval between the stimuli. Both stimuli become associated after a number of repetitions and animal bodies start to respond to the initially neutral stimulus as to the unconditioned one. The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure of fish to a pyrethroid-deltamethrin (an active ingredient in Decis 2.5 EC pesticide that disturbs the proper operation of the nervous system) affects the ability to learn in common carp.        Materials and Methods. Production of new types of behaviour was triggered in fish by using the unconditioned stimulus (an irritating electric impulse) and the conditioned stimulus (light). The experiment was performed in a tank divided into two compartments where fish could swim freely from one compartment to another. The ability to learn was assessed on the basis of the following types of behaviour evoked in response to the conditioned stimulus: locomotor agitation, preference to occupy or avoid certain areas in the tank, an escape response, etc.        Results. In fish exposed to 0.35 mu g . L-1 deltamethrin (for common carp concentration 10 times lower than lethal) for 35 min the ability to produce and remember the conditioned defence response was reduced and time interval since presenting the conditioned stimulus till occurring the initial signs of the conditioned response was prolonged.        Conclusion. The classical conditioning method revealed that sublethal concentration of deltamethrin restricted ability to learn and retain information in common carp, despite absence of observable intoxication symptoms.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3750/AIP2010.40.2.07     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),common carp;deltamethrin;learning and memory processes;INTERMEDIATE-TERM-MEMORY;LAKE-BALATON;DELTAMETHRIN;AVOIDANCE;GOLDFISH;CONSOLIDATION;TRANSCRIPTION;FIXATION;SENSITIZATION;INVOLVEMENT;Pesticides,NA,NA

Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a Parkinson's disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochondria. Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination with different potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT-2.5 mu g/L, valproic acid (VPA)-0.5 mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)-250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics (PROBIO)-3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti-social profile and mirror tests and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a) CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views, this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05). Four out of eight studied groups-(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA-displayed an impaired, often antithetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.0005). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT + PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the above groups (p > 0.05). Except for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a normalized trend in terms of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental groups exhibited exacerbated levels of aggression (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001) not only near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001). Conclusions: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement compared with (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT-treated zebrafish (e-h). Independently of the aggressive-like reactions and fluctuations among the testing day(s) and groups, ROT disrupted the social behavior, while VPA promoted a specific typology in contrast with LEV/CARB.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  43 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Included""}",10.3390/brainsci12070898     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anti-social;aggressivity;counterclockwise rotation;zebrafish;Danio rerio;Parkinson's disease;rotenone;VALPROIC ACID;TOXICITY;DEFICITS;STRESS;Parkinson Disease;Chronic Disease,NA,NA

A variety of illnesses are initiated or aided by the presence of certain perturbing factors. In the case of autism spectrum disorder, the environmental component plays an important part in determining the overall picture. Moreover, the lack of therapies to relieve existing symptoms complicates the fight against this condition. As a result, animal models have been used to make biomedical research easier and more suited for disease investigations. The current study used zebrafish as an animal model to mimic a real-life scenario: acute exposure to an increased dose of pesticides, followed by prospective intervention-based therapy with vitamin B-12 (vit. B-12). It is known that vit. B-12 is involved in brain function nerve tissue, and red blood cell formation. Aside from this, the role of vit. B-12 in the redox processes is recognized for its help against free radicals. To investigate the effect of vit. B-12, fish were divided into four different groups and exposed to a pesticide mixture (600 mu g L-1 fipronil + 600 mu g L-1 pyriproxyfen) and 0.24 mu g L-1 vit. B-12 for 14 days. The impact of the compounds was assessed daily with EthoVision XT 11.5 software for behavioral observations, especially for sociability, quantified by the social interaction test. In addition, at the end of the study, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. The results showed significant improvements in locomotor activity parameters and a positive influence of the vitamin on sociability. Regarding the state of oxidative stress, high activity was found for SOD and GPx in the case of vit. B-12, while fish exposed to the mixture of pesticides and vit. B-12 had a lower level of MDA. In conclusion, the study provides new data about the effect of vit. B-12 in zebrafish, highlighting the potential use of vitamin supplementation to maintain and support the function of the organism.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  95 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on life stage",10.3390/ani14030405     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Danio rerio;behavior;autism spectrum disorder;pesticide;vitamin B-12;oxidative stress;AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER;OXIDATIVE STRESS;FEEDING PROBLEMS;GENE-EXPRESSION;FIPRONIL;CHILDREN;DEFICIENCY;DYSFUNCTION;EXPOSURE;MODELS;Pesticides;Vitamin D;Vitamin U;Riboflavin;Vitamin A;Biotin;Folic Acid;Vitamin B Complex;Vitamin E;Vitamins;Intervention Studies;Arachidonic Acid;Ascorbic Acid;Tocopherols,NA,NA

Nests were sprayed to achieve a nominal concentration of 4 mg/L of either a dipotassium salt of endothall (Aquathol-K(R)), a dimethylamine salt of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), or water (control). No significant differences in rates of nest abandonment existed among the three treatments (p > 0.10). Abandonment averaged 5.17 min for both species and herbicide treatments, whereas the herbicides persisted in the water column for at least 45 min. When abandonment occurred, congeners nearly always intruded on the nest to feed on eggs or fry. After spraying, the adjusted mean frequency of rim circling, fanning, and agonistic behaviors exhibited by bluegills guarding eggs did not differ among the three treatments (p greater-than-or-equal-to 0.35). These results suggest the two herbicides will not elicit pronounced shifts in reproductive behavior of sunfish when they are properly applied.

At present, very little is known about the effects of azoxystrobin on courtship and aggressive behavior and the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, after exposing adult male and female zebrafish to worst-case scenario concentrations of azoxystrobin (0, 2 μg/L, 20 μg/L, and 200 μg/L) for 42 d, we observed a decrease in courtship behavior and an increase in aggressive behavior in both male and female zebrafish. In addition, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the behavioral effects of azoxystrobin, we quantified the changes in the concentrations of kisspeptin, 5-HT, GnIH, and their corresponding receptor mRNA expression in the brain. The results showed that 200 μg/L azoxystrobin decreased the concentrations of kisspeptin and increased the concentration of GnIH in both male and female zebrafish brain. In addition, azoxystrobin also significantly reduced 5-HT concentration in female zebrafish brain. Further investigation revealed that altered courtship and aggressive behavior were associated with the expression levels of genes (kiss1, kiss2, gnrh3, gnrhr3, 5ht1a, and 5ht2a) involved in kisspeptin-GnIH signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study suggested that azoxystrobin may impair courtship and aggressive behavior in zebrafish by interfering with the kisspeptin-GnIH signaling pathway, which may have more profound effects on natural zebrafish populations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: L.

ATZ is one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and a known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). The behavior of sailfin mollies is well documented in the scientific literature. Moreover, they are ecologically important indicators of environmental health, widely distributed among the mangroves along the Gulf Coast of the Southeastern US where significant amounts of ATZ are introduced via runoff and storm water drainage from coastal households, businesses, and farms. Four sets of experiments designed to assess ATZ's impact on various aspects of male and female reproductive behavior, aggression, anxiety, and boldness were conducted following 12 weeks of exposure to 1 or 15 ppb water-borne ATZ, along with a no-exposure control group. Results indicated that the behavior of ATZ-exposed individuals differed from those of controls: ATZ exposure affected which stimulus fish (a male vs. a female) subject females preferred to associate with while also affecting female strength of preference for males of larger body size and their sexual receptivity to conspecific males in general. ATZ-exposed males also showed reduced overall responsiveness to conspecific stimuli and directed significantly less aggression toward their mirror image compared with controls. Finally, ATZ exposure affected multiple aspects of male and female behavior that are often used as proxies for boldness and anxiety. Overall, ATZ exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behaviors attributed to sexual receptivity, mate choice and motivation to mate, aggression, as well as boldness and anxiety. These ATZ-induced behavioral changes may adversely affect the long-term health of natural populations exposed to similar, environmentally realistic concentrations and add to a growing body of empirical data demonstrating substantial fitness consequences of exposure to sublethal concentrations of this known EDC.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  122 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Included"", ""Kyle ""=>""Included""}",10.3390/w15020306     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioral toxicity;contaminants of emerging concern;reproductive behavior;aggression;anxiety;endocrine disrupting chemicals;Florida Gulf Coast;ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING CHEMICALS;LATERAL PROJECTION AREA;SHORT-TERM EXPOSURE;FEMALE PREFERENCE;BODY-SIZE;TESTOSTERONE PRODUCTION;PREDATION RISK;NONREPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR;MONOAMINERGIC SYSTEMS;AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR,NA,NA
