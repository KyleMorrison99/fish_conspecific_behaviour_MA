Cypermethrin is metabolized and eliminated significantly more slowly by fish than by mammals or birds, which may explain this compound's high toxicity in fish compared to other organisms. The present communication deals with histoanatomical alterations in the gonads of a local fresh water food fish, Channa punctatus exposed to 0.033 ppm (96 hr LC50 X 1/10) concentration of a synthetic pyrethroid, devicyprin (cypermethrin 25%) in aquatic medium of aged tap water for 15, 30 and 45 days respectively. In testis, exposure dependent histological damage has been observedin terms of vacuolization, condensation of spermatogonic cells, distortion of tubular epithelium, shrinkage of interstitial cells and general inflammatory responses, Longest exposure of 45 days has resulted in peculiar starry-sky appearance of the testicular tissue. Gross histoanatomy of ovarian tissue reveals epithelial lesions, inflammatory responses, stromal hemorrhage, increased interstitium and shrinkage of yolk vesicles towards periphery. These findings are quite suggestive of reproductive impairments leading to delayed gonadal maturity and adversely affecting processes of sperm production and ovulation and thus, the fish production.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Marcus""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: maye assess reproductive behaviours","","pyrethroids;cypermethrin;gonadal impairment;Channa punctatus;HISTOPATHOLOGICAL CHANGES;PYRETHROID INSECTICIDES;SUBLETHAL CYANIDE;RAINBOW-TROUT;CYPERMETHRIN;TOXICITY;TESTIS;VITELLOGENIN;REPRODUCTION;EXPOSURE;Gonads",NA,NA

Sixteen naive males were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: methyl parathion (5 mg/L) and control. Males were placed in their respective treatment jars for 24 h, and then, each male was paired with another male of matching size in an 30x25x25 cm aquarium. The aquarium had an opaque divider to keep the two males separate for 10 min of acclimation period. The divider was then removed and behavioural measurements were taken for another 10 min.

Although lufenuron is widely used in agriculture and aquaculture, rare are studies described that relates to possible toxic effects in fish. This work aimed to evaluate acute and chronic toxic effects of benzoylurea pesticide (lufenuron) on biological parameters of Colossoma macropomum (Tambaqui). In the acute test, juveniles of Tambaqui were divided into control group and five experimental groups with exposure from 0.1 to 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron for 96 h. Animals were also submitted to chronic toxicity test for four months in concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/L of lufenuron, the concentration used in the treatment of ectoparasites in fish and 50% of LC50 96 h, respectively. The presence of hemorrhages was observed in eyes, fins and operculum of fish exposed to 0.7 and 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron. Histological analysis showed changes in the morphology of fish gills submitted to acute toxicity test, as lamellar aneurysm and blood congestion inside lamellae. Lufenuron promoted damage in fish retina as in ability to respond to stimuli in photo-receptors and in ON-bipolar cells in acute test. In chronic test, blood glucose analysis and morphometric parameters showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). In general, Tambaqui exhibited behaviors associated with stress when exposed to lufenuron. Thus, lufenuron showed several toxic effects in relation to biological parameters in Tambaqui. This concerns about the use and discard of lufenuron, and indicates the requirement of environmental actions to prevent potential contamination of aquatic biota. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The normally inverse relationship between primary male and female sex hormones, expected in un-impaired fish, was greatly decreased in treatment (r = 0.00) versus control (r = -0.66) female fish. We found a similar, but not as significant, trend between treatment (r = -0.45) and control (r = -0.82) male fish. Measures of fish condition showed no significant differences between male or female fish housed in effluent or clean water. Inter-sex condition did not occur and testicular and ovarian cells appeared normal for the respective developmental stage and we observed no morphological alteration in fish.

The swimming speed increased from 30~60 mm·s-1 to 60~85 mm·s-1 within the first thirty minutes exposure, and then immediately decreased to 20 mm·s-1. The swimming depth decreased after 12 minutes exposure. Under chronic exposure, the communication patterns between fish were changed, and the swimming distance and dispersion increased by 43.5% and 120.0%, respectively. Zebrafish preferred swimming and staying on the water surface with lower toxic concentration. The vision-based real-time zebrafish swimming pattern monitoring method combined the calculation of swimming speed, depth, distance between fish, dispersion and time spend in different areas, therefore is a more comprehensive and effective system than the traditional individual fish and single endpoint monitoring method to give the early warning signal of water contamination.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: J.

Over this period, the widely-used organochlorines were eventually  replaced by organophosphates, with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and  chlorpyrifos (CPF) as the principal prototypes. Considerable research has  characterized the risks of DDT and CPF individually, but little is known about  the toxicology of transitioning from one class of insecticides to another, as has  been commonplace for agricultural and pest control workers. This study used adult  zebrafish to investigate neurobehavioral toxicity following 5-week chronic  exposure to either DDT or CPF, to or their sequential exposure (DDT for 5 weeks  followed by CPF for 5 weeks). At the end of the exposure period, a subset of fish  were analyzed for brain cholinesterase activity. Behavioral effects were  initially assessed one week following the end of the CPF exposure and again at  14 months of age using a behavioral test battery covering sensorimotor responses,  anxiety-like functions, predator avoidance and social attraction. Adult  insecticide exposures, individually or sequentially, were found to modulate  multiple behavioral features, including startle responsivity, social approach,  predator avoidance, locomotor activity and novel location recognition and  avoidance. Locomotor activity and startle responsivity were each impacted to a  greater degree by the sequential exposures than by individual compounds, with the  latter being pronounced at the early (1-week post exposure) time point, but not  3-4 months later in aging. Social approach responses were similarly impaired by  the sequential exposure as by CPF-alone at the aging time point. Fleeing  responses in the predator test showed flee-enhancing effects of both compounds  individually versus controls, and no additive impact of the two following  sequential exposure. Each compound was also associated with changes in  recognition or avoidance patterns in a novel place recognition task in late  adulthood, but sequential exposures did not enhance these phenotypes. The  potential for chemical x chemical interactions did not appear related to changes  in CPF metabolism to the active oxon, as prior DDT exposure did not affect the  cholinesterase inhibition resulting from CPF. This study shows that the effects  of chronic adult insecticide exposures may be relevant to behavioral health  initially and much later in life, and that the effects of sequential exposures  may be unpredictable based on their constituent exposures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Included""}","10.1016/j.ntt.2021.106985","Aging;Animals;Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Brain/drug effects;Chlorpyrifos/*toxicity;Cholinesterase Inhibitors/toxicity;DDT;DDT/metabolism/*toxicity;Insecticides/toxicity;Locomotion/*drug effects;Neurobehavioral toxicology, anxiety-related behavior;Zebrafish;Zebrafish/metabolism",NA,NA

We tested our hypothesis by examining effects of the widely used pyrethroid pesticide, bifenthrin, on the reproductive behaviors of the broadly distributed livebearing western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis. We exposed sexually mature female fish to one of five environmentally relevant concentrations of bifenthrin and conducted behavioral assays to assess reproductive, social, and space use behaviors before and after exposure.

ATZ is one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and a known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). The behavior of sailfin mollies is well documented in the scientific literature. Moreover, they are ecologically important indicators of environmental health, widely distributed among the mangroves along the Gulf Coast of the Southeastern US where significant amounts of ATZ are introduced via runoff and storm water drainage from coastal households, businesses, and farms. Four sets of experiments designed to assess ATZ’s impact on various aspects of male and female reproductive behavior, aggression, anxiety, and boldness were conducted following 12 weeks of exposure to 1 or 15 ppb water-borne ATZ, along with a no-exposure control group. Results indicated that the behavior of ATZ-exposed individuals differed from those of controls: ATZ exposure affected which stimulus fish (a male vs. a female) subject females preferred to associate with while also affecting female strength of preference for males of larger body size and their sexual receptivity to conspecific males in general. ATZ-exposed males also showed reduced overall responsiveness to conspecific stimuli and directed significantly less aggression toward their mirror image compared with controls. Finally, ATZ exposure affected multiple aspects of male and female behavior that are often used as proxies for boldness and anxiety. Overall, ATZ exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behaviors attributed to sexual receptivity, mate choice and motivation to mate, aggression, as well as boldness and anxiety. These ATZ-induced behavioral changes may adversely affect the long-term health of natural populations exposed to similar, environmentally realistic concentrations and add to a growing body of empirical data demonstrating substantial fitness consequences of exposure to sublethal concentrations of this known EDC. © 2023 by the author.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""Adult fish?""]}","10.3390/w15020306","",NA,NA

The presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the aquatic environment may affect fitness by changing morphology or altering behaviors like courtship and exploration. Most research on EDC-generated behavioral effects has focused on estrogen mimics and reproductive endpoints. Far fewer studies have examined the effects of other types of EDCs or measured non-reproductive behaviors. EDCs with antiandrogenic properties are present in waterways yet we know little about their effects on exposed individuals although they may produce effects similar to those caused by estrogen mimics because they act on the same hormonal pathway. To examine the effects of antiandrogens on boldness, this study exposed male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, to a high or low dose of one of two antiandrogens, vinclozolin or flutamide, and observed behavior in three boldness assays, both before and after exposure. Overall, antiandrogen exposure increased boldness behavior, especially following exposure to the higher dose. Whether or not antiandrogen exposure influenced boldness, as well as the nature and intensity of the effect, was assay-dependent. This demonstrates the importance of studying EDC effects in a range of contexts and, at least within this species, suggests that antiandrogenic compounds may generate distinct physiological effects in different situations. How and why the behavioral effects differ from those caused by exposure to an estrogen mimic, as well as the potential consequences of increased activity levels, are discussed. Exposure to an antiandrogen, regardless of dose, produced elevated activity levels and altered shoaling and exploration in male Siamese fighting fish.

We used 36 adult fish, weighing on average 0.496 g ± 0.28 g to calculate the LC50 and 75 adult fish also carry the MN and AC. During exposure to the herbicide was observed fish behavior at all concentrations and controlled chemical and physical changes of water. The erythrocytes were obtained by centrifugation of the gills being added to precipitate fetal calf serum, and then dripped on the slides to make the smear and electrophoresis. For the analysis of plates, 75.000 cells were counted and stipulate the frequency of occurrence of Nuclear Morphological Changes (AMNs) and AC were analyzed for 100 cells per specimen. The LC50; 12, 24, 48, 72 e 96h of R.

These factors may be related to different formulations of herbicides and their respective surfactants. It was found that the mortality rate of fish poisoned by the herbicide increased as exposure concentrations increased. The values of LC50,12-96h show a downward trend over time, suggesting that during periods of reduced exposure will require greater amounts of herbicide to cause mortality of 50% of the population of animals. Animals exposed to the herbicide showed behavioral changes varied, such as aggressiveness, irritability, loss of the escape reflex, darkening of the body surface and banging against the wall of the aquarium. In addition, R. Transorb® hitológicas induced liver changes appreciably impairing the normal functioning of this organ. In MN and EC was possible to detect significant genotoxic and mutagenic effects in erythrocytes and gill cells, occurring gradual increase in the number of cells with AMNs and ADN damage under higher concentrations,indicating concentration-dependent effect. This herbicide has acute toxicity to guppy, promoting behavioral changes, possibly acting in a manner damaging to the liver but also in the nervous system and gill. These results also suggest that the formulation of this herbicide has genotoxic and mutagenic in erythrocytes and gill cells detected by the MN and AC. Therefore, it confirms the high risk of herbicide to the environment, its contamination may present a strong threat to populations of fish and other organisms both vertebrates and invertebrates and human health. ; Os efeitos de substâncias tóxicas, mutagênicas e genotóxica sobre órgãos-alvos e o genoma de peixes tem sido objeto de muitos estudos, sobretudo daqueles que buscam estabelecer respostas destes órgãos e dos genes aos estímulos ambientais.

Os bioensaios de toxicidade foram realizados para calcular a CL50,12-96h, avaliar os efeitos das concentrações subletais do herbicida submetido a tratamento agudo. Utilizou-se 36 peixes adultos, pesando em média 0,496g ± 0,28g para cálculo da CL50 e 75 peixes também adultos para realizar o MN e EC. Durante a exposição ao herbicida observou-se o comportamento dos peixes em todas as concentrações e controlada as variações químicas e físicas da água. Os eritrócitos foram obtidos pela centrifugação das brânquias sendo adicionado soro fetal bovino ao precipitado, e posteriormente gotejado sobre as lâminas para realizar o esfregaço e eletroforese. Para a análise das lâminas, foram contadas 75.000 células e estipulada a frequência de ocorrência de Alterações Morfológicas Nucleares (AMNs), e para EC foram analisadas 100 células por espécime. A CL50; 12, 24, 48, 72 e 96 h do R. Transorb® foram de 11.24; 8.55; 6.5; 6.10 e 5.65μl/L, respectivamente, indicando que esta espécie é bastante sensível ao herbicida estudado em relação às demais espécies tropicais analisadas. Esses fatores podem estar relacionados às diferentes formulações dos herbicidas e seus respectivos surfactantes. Verificou-se que a porcentagem de mortalidade dos peixes intoxicados pelo herbicida aumentou à medida que as concentrações de exposição aumentaram. Os valores da CL50; 12- 96 h apresentam tendência de queda ao longo do tempo, sugerindo que em períodos de menor exposição serão necessárias quantidades maiores de herbicida para causar a mortalidade de 50% da população de animais. Os animais expostos ao herbicida apresentaram alterações comportamentais variadas, tais como: agressividade; irritabilidade; perda do reflexo de fuga; escurecimento da superfície corporal e choque contra a parede do aquário. Além disso, o R. Transorb® induziu alterações hitológicas hepáticas prejudicando de forma sensível o funcionamento normal deste órgão. No MN e EC foi possível detectar efeitos mutagênicos e genotóxicos significativos nos eritrócitos e células da brânquia, ocorrendo aumento gradual no número de células com AMNs e com danos ao DNA de acordo com aumento das concentrações, indicando efeito concentração-dependente. Este herbicida apresenta toxidade aguda para guppy, promovendo alterações comportamentais, agindo possivelmente de forma danosa não só no fígado, mas também no sistema nervoso e branquial. Tais resultados sugerem também que a formulação deste herbicida possui ação genotóxica e mutagênica em eritrócitos e células branquiais detectados através dos MN e EC. Por tanto, se confirma o alto risco deste herbicida ao meio ambiente, sua contaminação pode apresentar forte ameaça para as populações de peixes e outros organismos tanto vertebrados como invertebrados e saúde do homem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}","","Poecilia reticulata;Herbicida;Glifosato;Ensaio cometa;Teste micronúcleo;Pesticides;Glyphosate;Comet assay;Micronucleos test;CNPQ::CIENCIAS BIOLOGICAS",NA,NA

Despite having the genome completely sequenced and the behavior and physiology well reported, there are some issues related to the housing and management of these animals that are still poorly understood. Considering the issues regarding the housing of the zebrafish, we aimed to investigate whether different cues, used alone or together, would interfere in zebrafish behavior. In this study, we detected that the animals have different behaviors when in the presence of isolated cues and together, therefore, we emphasize the importance of the description and detailing of the conditions of housing of these fish. After the development of this first article, we had the idea of working with imidacloprid (IMI). IMI is an insecticidal pesticide used globally in the treatment of seeds and leaves of crops such as vegetables, sugar beet, cotton and tobacco. The use of IMI is mainly due to its high insecticidal potential and low toxic potential in mammals, acting as a specific nicotinic acetylcholine agonist for invertebrate receptors. However, non-target species have been affected by this compound, which can cause from the mortality of these animals to endocrine and physiological changes in sublethal concentrations, mostly based on the LC50/LD50 (concentration/dose capable of killing 50% of the population tested), in chronic or acute exposures, within 96 hours. However, little is known about the effect that concentrations already detected in the environment and in periods shorter than 96 hours can have on non-target organisms. Therefore, our aim was to analyze whether an IBI (imidacloprid-based insecticide) alters behavior, cortisol levels and redox status in zebrafish, in a 30-minute exposure protocol and at environmentally relevant concentrations.

In this aim, we exposed the goldfish to environmental relevant concentrations of herbicide and fungicide mixtures at two temperatures for 96 hours or 16 days. The fish responses were assessed from the molecular level to individual endpoints, including omic approaches (proteomic and metabolomic), biochemical analyses (cortisol, antioxidant defenses, cellular energy allocation), indexes (somatic and condition factors) and behavioral assays (sediment reworking, activity, exploration and feeding). Our results showed that individual chemical or thermal stresses induced a general stress response including biochemical, metabolic, physiological and behavioral compensations. The absence of deleterious effect on the global condition of fish suggested the implementation of an efficient and adaptive stress response, while the hypoactivity of fish exposed to pesticide mixtures could entrain a decreased performance and fitness into the wild. At the opposite, the combined chemical and thermal stresses induced reciprocal inactivation of the stress response, with antagonism effect on cortisol secretion, antioxidant defense induction and metabolic compensation. However, increased effect on behavioral traits and decreased global condition of fish were observed. Our study showed that temperature rising sensitized fish to pesticide exposure.

Indiscriminate application of products has been a serious concern and Brazil is one of the countries that uses the most chemicals to control agricultural pests. Imidacloprid (IMI) is one of the most commonly used insecticides in the world, such as a neonicotinoid. Although already found in several watercourses in the southern region, studies are needed on its toxic potential. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), popularly known as ""paulistinha"", has been the target of a program that can be compared with rodents, we can mention the ease of maintenance, manipulation and a possibility to have their rules of behavior and biochemical. In this context, researches may be performe to avaluete effects of environmental contamination. Present indicator may be related to biochemical and behavioral in zebrafish exposed for 96 h in 3 different concentrations of IMI (0.15, 15 and 45 μg L-1). Effect of S-transferase (GST) activation was increases in zebrafish brains when exposed to IMI in the combinations of 0.15 and 45 μg L-1. Carbonylated protein (CP) levels increased significantly in IMI 15 and 45 μg L-1. Nonprotein protein levels (NPSH) and lipid peroxidation levels measured by the quantification of malondialdehyde (MDA) formation were not alter over time after exposure at the concentrations tested.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rams) are popular freshwater animal models. However, their behavioral use in aquatic toxicology research is generally ham pered by oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are not well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented a comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e.,anxiety-like behavior, novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory). We found that only medaka (d-rR) presented a weak or no response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus. In addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the three species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01% v/v carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and DMSO). In contrast to zebrafish and Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes in spatial memory after subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5 mu g/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead, a hyperactivity response in the open field test and reduced social time were induced by cpf and imidacloprid, respectively. Our results suggest that: (1) behavioral effects are negligible when using <0.01% v/v carrier solvents for behavioral assessment: (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be insufficient for estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other environmental contaminants. In conclusion, these results could have major implications for aquatic toxicology research and water quality monitoring and ecoioxicological risk assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Both compounds are highly neurotoxic to fish, but each with distinct biological target sites and mechanisms of action. We used common biochemical and physiological indicators of toxicity, and correlated these effects with potentially significant behavioral alterations. For chlorpyrifos, the mechanism of toxic action is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) throughout the peripheral and central nervous system. Here, we conducted biochemical assays of AChE activity in brain and muscle tissues after exposing steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (0. kisutch) to chlorpyrifos for 96 hours. We then correlated the AChE inhibition with behavioral impairment in swimming and feeding activities. In juvenile steelhead and coho exposed to 0.6-2.5 μg/L chlorpyrifos, AChE activity was inhibited between ~10-65%. This biochemical indicator was significantly correlated with changes in behavioral patterns. Spontaneous swimming rates were reduced ~30-80% in the exposed fish, and strikes at food items (brine shrimp) were reduced ~10-70%. For copper and some other neurotoxicants, the olfactory nervous system is a sensitive target site in fish. The highly-developed olfactory system in salmonids is particularly susceptible to toxic insult by dissolved chemicals since receptor neurons are in direct contact with the aquatic environment. Here, we used electrophysiological techniques to record odor-evoked responses from the sensory epithelium and the olfactory bulb as direct measures of olfactory function in juvenile coho salmon.

Global climate change, urbanization, habitat fragmentation, and pollutants are all contributing to rapid and extensive environmental change and posing significant challenges to many species. An anthropogenic impact of growing concern is exposure to a class of contaminants known as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). EDCs are natural or synthetic compounds that interfere in some way with endogenous hormones responsible for maintaining and regulating myriad phenotypic traits. These contaminants enter aquatic environments through agricultural runoff, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and sewage overflow. They have been shown to alter morphology, physiology, and behavior in exposed organisms. Mangrove ecosystems are often retrofitted with WWTPs due to their natural ability to cycle nutrients; however, little is known of how EDC exposure impacts the organisms that inhabit mangroves. The mangrove rivulus fish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, is a mangrove specialist and a suitable organism in which to study the effects of EDC exposure. Here, I use environmentally relevant concentrations of two prevalent EDCs - ethinyl estradiol, the main synthetic estrogen in contraceptive, and nonylphenol, a widespread compound used in plastics and pesticides - to assess how exposure can alter morphology, physiology, and behavior in juvenile and adult mangrove rivulus, in compound-, dose-, and route-specific ways. I also measure the extent to which exposure alters phenotypic variance-covariance structure, which can inform us about how EDCs trigger coordinated changes in many phenotypic traits, and allows us to better assess how anthropogenic activities might induce opportunities for natural selection to act and drive evolutionary change.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}","","Biology;Ecology;Toxicology;Phenotype",NA,NA
