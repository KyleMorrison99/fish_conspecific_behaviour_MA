rayyan-707491949,Use of behavioral endpoints to determine protective concentrations of the insecticide fonofos for bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus),1999,NA,NA,ASTM Special Technical Publication,10403094 (ISSN),,1364,387-400,"Fairchild, J.F. and Little, E.E.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033366199&partnerID=40&md5=72803ebb6259285999ade06af976f3ff,English,ASTM,"U.S.Geological Survey, Columbia Environ. Research Center, Columbia, MO 65201, 4200 New Haven Road, United States","This research compared the results of laboratory and mesocosm studies to determine the effectiveness of using behavioral measures of sublethal exposure to define environmental concentration ranges that are protective of free-ranging populations of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) exposed to the organophophate insecticide fonofos. Thirty-day laboratory chronic studies were conducted to determine the relative sensitivity of standard (e.g. survival and growth) and non-standard behavioral (e.g. swimming capacity, feeding efficiency, and aggression) endpoints in predicting concentrations of fonofos protective of bluegill growth and survival. The lowest observable effect concentration (LOECs) for the standard measures of survival and growth was 5.6 μg/L. Two behavioral endpoints were of similar sensitivity to the standard measures: swimming capacity, LOEC of 5.6 μg/L; and prey strike frequency, LOEC of 5.6 μg/L. However, aggressive interactions were ten-fold more sensitive than swimming or feeding behavior with a LOEC occurring at 0.6 μg/L. Lab results were compared to an aquatic mesocosm study which exposed adult and juvenile bluegill to a 9.41 μg/L concentration of fonofos. The dissipation half-life of fonofos was 5 days in 0.1 hectare aquatic mesocosms. Significant mortality among caged bluegill occurred within 4 days of exposure at 9.41 μg/L. However, the 9.41 μg/L concentration of fonofos had no statistically significant effects on survival, growth, reproduction, or total biomass of free-ranging populations of bluegill. We conclude from these studies that laboratory data can accurately estimate concentrations that are lethal in the field and that the use of behavioral endpoints can provide ecologically relevant, yet conservative estimates of concentrations that are protective of field populations.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Conference name: Proceedings of the 1998 8th Symposium on Environmental Toxicology and Risk Assessment: Standardization of Biomarkers for Endocrine Disruption and Environmental Assessment; Conference date: 20 April 1998 through 22 April 1998; Conference code: 55926; CODEN: ASTTA | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Jack""=>""Included""}",,Biomass;Ecology;Fisheries;Insecticides;Marine biology;Pesticide effects;Phosphates;Standards;Statistical methods;Toxicity;Aquatic mesocosms;Fonofos;Organophosphate;Marine pollution;Endpoint Determination,NA,NA

Observations were also made in an olfactometer to assess the effects of 8-h exposures to these two pesticides and to carbofuran (carbamate insecticide) on the behavioral responses to the flow of a solution of four L-amino acids (glycine, alanine, valine, taurine), mixed in the same relative proportions as in the urine of conspecifics. Each pesticide was tested at three sublethal concentrations (25, 50, 100 μg/L), and the behaviors recorded were related to swimming pattern, social interactions, and comfort movements. Static exposures to prochloraz affected horizontal displacements, burst swimming, grouping, and buccal movements. Static exposures to nicosulfuron affected burst swimming and grouping. In pesticide-unexposed fish (control), the flow of the amino acid solution induced attraction, decreased sheltering, and increased horizontal displacements, burst swimming, buccal movements, and antagonistic interactions. Compared to the controls, some of the behavioral responses to the solution of amino acids were significantly different after 8 h of subacute exposure to prochloraz and carbofuran. Both pesticides decreased attraction and increased sheltering. In addition, carbofuran decreased buccal movements and antagonistic interactions. Contrastingly, exposure to nicosulfuron showed no significant effect. This study further confirms the great vulnerability of fish behavior and chemocommunication processes to exposure to waterborne pesticides.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 23; Correspondence Address: P.

Mullet juveniles treated with a subacute concentration, were refused by the control predators, whereas predators treated with a subacute concentration consumed more mullet juveniles. In the present study crescent perch T. jarbua were exposed to subacute and acute concentrations of DDT, and their behaviour was compared with that of the control predators. There were changes in oriented behaviour and co-ordinated movements, and in feeding, aggression and comfort behaviour of the fish. Inflammation in the gills, and caudal fin serration, were noticed in treated fishes. The findings presented here throw light on fundamental pathways by which pollutants interact with the behaviour of fishes. © 1979 Dr. W. Junk b.v.

Although the change, primarily a spreading out of the school over a larger area, was observed after 24 h exposure, placing the fish in clean water did not bring about a return of normal schooling patterns until 72 h.
