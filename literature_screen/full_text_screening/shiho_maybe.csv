The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 mu g/L. of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation.

Despite their widespread use, the impacts of these pesticides on the neurological health of wild salmon are not well understood. Of particular concern are the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides that block synaptic transmission by inhibiting neuronal acetylcholinesterase. Here we assess the effects of diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, on alarm pheromone induced antipredator responses and homing behavior in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Nominal exposure concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mu g.L-1) were chosen to emulate diazinon pulses in the natural environment. In the antipredator study, diazinon had no effect on swimming behavior or visually guided food capture. However, the pesticide significantly inhibited olfactory-mediated alarm responses at concentrations as low as 1.0 mu g.L-1. Similarly, homing behavior was impaired at 10.0 mu g.L-1. Our results suggest that olfactory-mediated behaviors are sensitive to anticholinesterase neurotoxicity in salmonids and that short-term, sublethal exposures to these insecticides may cause significant behavioral deficits. Such deficits may have negative consequences for survival and reproductive success in these fish.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  158     Total Times Cited:  184     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1139/cjfas-57-9-1911     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CHEMICAL ALARM SIGNALS;RAINBOW-TROUT;CYPRINODON-VARIEGATUS;ENDOCRINE FUNCTION;MOLECULAR-FORMS;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE;PESTICIDE;PREDATION;TOXICITY;PARR,NA,NA

Eggs exposed to endosulfan took longer to hatch, and the resulting fry were smaller at 1 week of age and had decreased mobility at 2 weeks of age. Upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals also produced fewer eggs, and these eggs took significantly longer to hatch. Medaka exposed to endosulfan shortly after hatching did not differ in early mobility or foraging ability. Interestingly, upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals produced more eggs than did unexposed females. The observed effects were not dose-dependent, with medaka exposed to intermediate concentrations of endosulfan (0.10 mug/L) exhibiting the greatest response.

The ""smooth"" pattern was typically shown as a normal movement behavior, while the ""shaking"" pattern was frequently observed after treatments of diazinon. These smooth and shaking patterns were selected for training with an artificial neural network. Parameters characterizing the movement tracks, such as speed, degree of backward movements, stop duration, turning rate, meander, and maximum distance movements in the y-axis of 1-min duration, were given as input (six nodes) to a multi-layer perceptron with the backpropagation algorithm. Binary information for the smooth and shaking patterns was separately given as the matching output (one node), while eight nodes were assigned to a single hidden layer. As new input data were given to the trained network, it was possible to recognize the smooth and shaking patterns of the new input data. Average recognition rates of the smooth pattern decreased significantly while those for the shaking pattern increased to a higher degree after treatments of diazinon. The trained network was able to reveal the difference in the shaking pattern in different light phases before treatments of diazinon. This study demonstrated that artificial neural networks could be useful for detecting the presence of toxic chemicals in the environment by serving as in-situ behavioral monitoring tools.

The effects of diuron on fish behaviour are currently poorly understood. Herein, the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was continuously exposed to environmentally realistic levels of diuron from the fertilised egg stage to the adult stage. Behavioural evaluation of adult marine medaka indicated that exposure to diuron increased anxiety in the light-dark test and increased predator avoidance. In addition, diumn exposure significantly reduced aggression, social interaction, shoaling, and learning and memory ability. However, only negligible variations in foraging behaviour and in behaviour in the novel tank test were observed. Marine medaka chronically exposed to diuron also showed decreased levels of dopamine in the brain, and changes were observed in the transcription of genes related to dopamine synthesis, degradation and receptors. Exposure to 5000 ng/L diumn caused significant downregulation of the expression of the genes of tyrosine hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase and significantly upregulated the expression of the genes of the D-5 dopaminergic receptor. The relative expression of the D-4 dopaminergic receptor was significantly upregulated in the 50, 500 and 5000 ng/L diuron-treated groups. These findings highlight the significant neumtoxic effects of diumn and the extent to which this may involve the dopaminergic system of the brain. More broadly, this study reveals the ecological risk associated with environmentally realistic levels of diuron in marine animals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  77 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not adult fish,chronic exposure since embryo but behavioru was measured during adult | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105917,Pesticide;Long-term exposure;Neurotoxicity;Dopamine;Ecotoxicity;ANTIFOULING BOOSTER BIOCIDES;RISK-ASSESSMENT;COASTAL WATERS;ZEBRAFISH;RESPONSES;FISH;DOPAMINE;METABOLITES;PESTICIDES;STRESS;Environmental Exposure;Military Personnel,NA,NA

A comparative numerical analysis of fish residence times between each time point control and the corresponding CPF groups was performed by dividing arenas into 15 proportional areas. The time point 0 control group gradient map showed a noticeably different swim pattern from those of the >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups, which was statistically supported by the differences for residence times seen in >= 12 corresponding areas.

However, burst swimming at 10 microg/L, and  sheltering, nipping and burst swimming at 100 microg/L, were still significantly  increased after a 12-h exposure to carbofuran. Grouping was not consistently  affected by exposure conditions. Chemical attraction to a filtrate of chironomids  was significantly reduced after the 4-h exposure to 1 microg/L carbofuran.  Decreased attraction to the food extract was less apparent after the 12-h  exposure, except at 100 microg/L carbofuran. A significant decrease in attraction  to a flow of uncontaminated water was also observed after a 4-h exposure to 10  and 100 microg/L carbofuran. Unexposed goldfish did not show avoidance reaction  to a flow of carbofuran-contaminated water, even at a concentration (10 mg/L)  exceeding the mean 96-h LC-50 in cyprinids (0.5-1 mg/L). However, at all  concentrations tested (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L), goldfish quickly reacted to the  introduction of the solution of carbofuran by increased burst swimming and  nipping. These results are discussed in the light of the data concerning  behavioral and neurotoxic effects of carbamate and organophosphorous insecticides  in fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on life stage,not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1007/BF00212371,"Animals;Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Carbofuran/metabolism/*toxicity;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Eating/drug effects;Female;Fresh Water;Goldfish/*metabolism;Insecticides/metabolism/*toxicity;Male;Water Pollutants, Chemical/metabolism/*toxicity",NA,NA

Pyrethroids are the fourth major group of insecticides in use worldwide and have extremely negative effects on aquatic fauna. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of an acute 2 h sub-lethal exposure to different levels of the pyrethroid esfenvalerate on the swimming behaviour of two Cypriniformes species: the native Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) and the non-native invasive bleak (Alburnus alburnus). The experimental set-up consisted of previous exposure to three esfenvalerate concentrations (control, 1.2 (low), and 2.0 (high) μg/L) before being stocked in a three-artificial-flume-channel mesocosm for behavioural trials through direct observation. Monitored behaviours included (i) routine activity, (ii) shoal cohesion, and iii) boldness. Significant differences in fish behaviour were detected for the native species (barbel), as individuals spent significantly more time holding position (i.e., resting) in the control (44.9%) than in the high esfenvalerate concentration (25.2%). Concordantly, control barbels were also found to perform more directional changes than the ones exposed to high esfenvalerate concentrations. Behavioural changes were also found for boldness, measured by the proportion of fish attempts to negotiate the upstream ramp, which were significantly higher in the control (37.4%) and in the high concentration (41.5%) compared to the low one (21.1%). Finally, regarding shoal cohesion of the barbel, it was tighter in the control (81.3%) than in the low- (70.5%) and high- (71.1%) esfenvalerate treatments. For the invasive bleak, there were no significant differences in any of the behavioural traits upon previous exposure to an increasing esfenvalerate concentration. This experimental study demonstrated that even short-term exposure to the pyrethroid esfenvalerate was sufficient to alter the behaviour of a native Cypriniformes fish species while not affecting the non-native species. This may confer greater competitive advantages to non-native fish species in the context of global changes. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: T.

Genetic and environmental factors are believed to be responsible for neuronal diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. It is difficult to restore normal nervous function after neurodegeneration; hence, prevention could be the best strategy against these diseases. Ayurved medicines such as Suvarna Bhasma (SB) have enormous potential to treat these neurological diseases. Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the protective effect of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish. Materials and methods: In this study, we induced Parkinson's-like disease model in zebrafish by inducing it with rotenone (7 μg/L). We examined the behavioural, proteomics and dopamine alterations of rotenone induced zebrafish of SB pre-treated group as compared to the control group. Results: The behavioural experiments showed that due to rotenone exposure, Parkinson's-like behavioural abnormality was induced in zebrafish. However, because of SB treatment, this behavioural abnormality was reduced. The proteomics study of zebrafish brains clearly showed that the SB-treated group was not significantly affected due to rotenone exposure. However, in the SB non-treated group, expression of nine proteins that are linked to Parkinson's disease (gene name: sncgb, ywhae1, ywhah, uchl1, ywhaba, psma6a, ywhabl, ywhaqb, and ywhabb) were differentially expressed after rotenone exposure. Finally, prevention of dopamine alteration in SB-treated fish brains confirmed the protective action of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish. Conclusions: This study finds that Suvarna Bhasma has neuroprotective effects against Parkinson's-like disease model. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

This study presents a new approach for the investigation of predator prey interactions between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) impaired by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic insecticide. With a simple experimental design including four different treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed, (3) prey exposed and (4) both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect by visual observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 mu g/l CHP. Previously, a decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid larvae was observed. However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both predators and prey, no significant differences in the feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. This suggests an impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP concentration (1 mu g/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. We therefore propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in higher tier studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk assessment.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: may do other behaviours",10.1007/s10646-010-0516-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Feeding depression;Pesticide;Non-biting midge;Fish;Interspecific interaction;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTION;TENTANS DIPTERA;FISH PREDATION;TOXICITY;BEHAVIOR;FOOD;SEDIMENT;EXPOSURE;ATRAZINE;RIVER,NA,NA

Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are environmental contaminants that mimic or alter the process of hormone signaling. In particular, EDCs that alter estrogen and androgen signaling pathways are of major concern for fishes because these EDCs may alter reproductive physiology, behavior, and ultimately sex ratio. Bifenthrin, a pyrethroid with escalating usage, is confirmed to disrupt estrogen signaling in several species of fish, including Menidia beryllina (inland silverside), an Atherinid recently established as a euryhaline model. Our main objective was to broadly assess the molecular and physiological responses of M. beryllina to the ng/L concentrations of bifenthrin typically found in the environment, with a focus on endocrine-related effects, and to discern links between different tiers of the biological hierarchy. As such, we evaluated the response of juvenile Menidia to bifenthrin using a Menidia-specific microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on specific endocrine-related genes of interest, and a Menidia-specific ELISA to the egg-coat protein choriogenin, to evaluate a multitude of molecular-level responses that would inform mechanisms of toxicity and any underlying causes of change at higher biological levels of organization. The sublethal nominal concentrations tested (0.5, 5 and 50 ng/L) were chosen to represent the range of concentrations observed in the environment and to provide coverage of a variety of potential responses. We then employed a 21-day reproductive assay to evaluate reproductive responses to bifenthrin (at 0.5 ng/L) in a separate group of adult M. beryllina. The microarray analysis indicated that bifenthrin influences a diverse suite of molecular pathways, from baseline metabolic processes to carcinogenesis. A more targeted examination of gene expression via qPCR demonstrated that bifenthrin downregulates a number of estrogen-related transcripts, particularly at the lowest exposure level. Choriogenin protein also decreased with exposure to increasing concentrations of bifenthrin, and adult M. beryllina exposed to 0.5 ng/L had significantly reduced reproductive output (fertilized eggs per female). This reduction in fecundity is consistent with observed changes in endocrine-related gene expression and choriogenin production. Taken together, our results demonstrate that environmental concentrations of bifenthrin have potential to interfere with metabolic processes, endocrine signaling, and to decrease reproductive output.

Olfactory function of juvenile chinook salmon was evaluated in two separate experiments following 2-h immersion exposures to 0, 1, 10, or 100 mu g diazinon/L. In the first test system. groups of 10 salmon were transferred to the prechoice zone of a Y-maze fluviarium with parallel streams of water. A dilute alarm scent composed of either chinook skin extract or L-serine was pumped into the water supply of one arm. Fish were allowed to choose either upstream arm by raising a containment screen for 10 min, then their positions were photographed and the screen lowered. In the second test system the relationship of diazinon exposure to predation susceptibility was directly examined by transferring groups of 20 salmon (10 diazinon-exposed, 10 control) to troughs containing a protective cover. These salmon were given two olfactory warnings by delivering conspecific skin extract to both their transfer container and the predation tank they entered. After a 2-min prey acclimation period, larger predator rainbow trout were allowed access to the downstream section of the tank containing the test salmon. The combined fish were observed until approximately 50% of the prey fish had been consumed. Statistical comparisons indicated that although the salmon did avoid the water streams containing alarm scents. none of the diazinon exposure levels resulted in significantly different outcomes from the controls (alpha = 0.05) in either the two-choice maze study or the predation study.

In the liver, congestion, degenerative foci, hyaline droplets and lipidic vacuolization of the hepatocytes were observed. In the stomach mild hyperplasia of mucous cells was detected, which was also observed in the skin. In this latter tissue, a large increase in the thickness of the epidermis with necrotic lesions, infiltration of leukocytes and melanin pigment were observed. In the brain, degenerative foci of neuronal bodies in the telencephalon associated with gliosis and infiltration of eosinophilic granule cells/mast cells were shown. In conclusion, gills, liver, skin and brain are susceptible to Roundup (R). Moreover, effects on the central nervous system could affect olfaction as well as individual and group behavior, the reproductive performance of the fish and hence have repercussions at the population level.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  29     Total Times Cited:  36     Cited Reference Count:  42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on life stage",10.1590/S0100-736X2008001100002     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Roundup (R);glyphosate;acute toxicity;histopathology;Piaractus brachypomus;TILAPIA OREOCHROMIS-NILOTICUS;CYPRINUS-CARPIO;GLYPHOSATE;FISH;GILLS;RESPONSES;CELLS,NA,NA

Although labeled ""safe"" by the chemical industry, doses tested by industry do not mimic chronic exposures to sublethal doses that organisms in the environment are exposed to over long periods of time. Given the widespread uses of and exposure to glyphosate, studies on developmental toxicity are needed. Here we utilize the zebrafish vertebrate model system to study early effects of glyphosate on the developing heart. Treatment by embryo soaking with 50 mu g/ml glyphosate starting at gastrulation results in structural abnormalities in the atrium and ventricle, irregular heart looping, situs inversus as well as decreased heartbeats by 48 h as determined by live imaging and immunohistochemistry. Vasculature in the body was also affected as determined using fli-1 transgenic embryos. To determine if the effects noted at 48 h post fertilization are due to early stage alterations in myocardial precursors, we also investigate cardiomyocyte development with a Mef2 antibody and by mef2ca in situ hybridization and find alterations in the Mef2/mef2ca staining patterns during early cardiac patterning stages. We conclude that glyphosate is developmentally toxic to the zebrafish heart. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigate the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate on the gut microbiota, neurotransmitter levels, and anxiety in zebrafish. Our findings demonstrate that glyphosate exposure leads to dysbiosis in the zebrafish gut, alterations in central and peripheral serotonin levels, increased dopamine levels in the brain, and notable changes in anxiety and social behavior. While the dysbiosis can be attributed to glyphosate's antimicrobial properties, the observed effects on neurotransmitter levels leading to the reported induction of oxidative stress in the brain indicate a novel and significant mode of action for glyphosate, namely the impairment of the microbiome-gut-axis.

We then used the tracking and heat maps of the behavior trajectories of zebrafish subjected to sham and imidacloprid exposure and compared their social behavior. Furthermore, histomorphology and immunohistochemistry of their brain tissue sections were performed to clarify possible neurotoxicity due to imidacloprid exposure in our adult zebrafish.

Furthermore, imidacloprid exposure significantly reduced heterosexual attractive behavior between the different sexes, as well as defensive alert behavior among males. Our histomorphology and immunohistochemistry evidence showed imidacloprid exposure may lead to neuronal oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and damage in the telencephalon of adult zebrafish.

This study aims to investigate whether exposure to environmental levels of azoxystrobin (2 μg/L, 20 μg/L, and 200 μg/L) changes the behavior of male adult zebrafish. Herein, we evaluated behavioral response (locomotor, anxiety-like, and exploratory behaviors), histopathology, biochemical indicators, and gene expression in male adult zebrafish upon azoxystrobin exposure. The study showed that exposure to azoxystrobin for 42 days remarkably increased the locomotor ability of male zebrafish, resulted in anxiety-like behavior, and inhibited exploratory behavior. After treatment with 200 μg/L azoxystrobin, vasodilatation, and congestion were observed in male zebrafish brains. Exposure to 200 μg/L azoxystrobin notably elevated ROS level, MDA concentration, CAT activity, and AChE activity, while inhibiting SOD activity, GPx activity, ACh concentration, and DA concentration in male zebrafish brains. Moreover, the expression levels of genes related to the antioxidant, cholinergic, and dopaminergic systems were significantly changed.

At the neuroendocrine level, dopamine (DA) drives behavioral (locomotion, emotion, feeding, and social interactions, etc.) and reproductive functions of fish. In the current investigation, we examined effects of rotenone toxicity on neurobehavioral and reproductive functions in whole brain and in selected brain regions in an Indian freshwater catfish, locally known as gulsha (Mystus cavasius). After fish were exposed to water containing rotenone at 0, 2.5, 25, and 250 mu g/L for 2 days, significant reductions of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; a DA metabolite), and their ratio (DOPAC/DA) were observed in whole brain at 250 mg/L ambient concentrations of rotenone. When fish were treated with rotenone at 250 mg/L concentration for 2 days, there was a significant reduction of DA, DOPAC and DOPAC/DA in diencephalon, DA and DOPAC in pituitary, and only DA in the telencephalon, compared with control fish. In parallel, numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (THthorn) neurons declined significantly in the diencephalon and pituitary after rotenone treatment. Slowed, spontaneous movement and reduced feeding behavior were observed in rotenone-treated fish. Rotenone treatment resulted in a significantly higher gonadosomatic index with many mature vitellogenic oocytes in ovaries and lowered dopaminergic activity in these fish. These results indicate that rotenone influences neurobehavioral and reproductive functions through dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in gulsha brain. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Behavioral analysis showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in distance swam, as well as a subsequent increase in CAT. Vertical and horizontal spatial behavioral use were affected under heat and pesticides co-exposure conditions. In 3- and 4-week(s) exposure groups, horizontal spatial behavioral use demonstrated elevated time spent in the lower third of the aquarium. Similarly, during 3- and 4-week(s) exposure (32°C control and 32°C high doses) vertical spatial behavioral use was found to increase time spent in the outermost edges of the aquarium. In all treatment groups, the final condition factor (KM) showed significant attenuation when compared to the initial KM. However, there was an unclear relationship between heat/pesticide co-exposure and growth most notably in 32°C high-dose groups. In addition, the expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A mRNA was significantly higher in pesticide-exposed groups.

Since steroid hormone biosynthesis is regulated through neurotransmission of the central nervous system (CNS), studies were conducted to determine whether neurotransmitters that control hormone biosynthesis could be affected after diuron and diuron metabolites treatment. As the same neurotransmitters and steroid hormones regulate behavioral outcomes, aggression was also evaluated in male Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Male tilapias were exposed for 10 days to waterborne diuron and the metabolites 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA), 3,4-dichlorophenyl-N-methylurea (DCPMU), at nominal concentrations of 100 ng L-1. In contrast to Diuron, DCA and DCPMU significantly diminished plasma testosterone concentrations (39.4% and 36.8%, respectively) and reduced dopamine levels in the brain (47.1% and 44.2%, respectively). In addition, concentrations of the stress steroid, cortisol were increased after DCA (71.0%) and DCPMU (57.8-%) exposure.

Temperature rising affects the toxic properties of pollutants and the sensitiveness of organisms to chemicals stress. Inversely, chemical exposure may decrease the capacity of organisms to respond to environmental changes. The aim of our study was to assess the individual and crossed effects of temperature rising and pesticide contamination on fish. Goldfish, Carassius auratus, were exposed during 96 h at two temperatures (22 and 32 A degrees C) to a mixture of common pesticides (S-metolachlor, isoproturon, linuron, atrazine-desethyl, aclonifen, pendimethalin, and tebuconazol) at two environmentally relevant concentrations (total concentrations MIX1 = 8.4 mu g L-1 and MIX2 = 42 mu g L-1). We investigated the sediment reworking behavior, which has a major ecological functional role. We also focused on three physiological traits from the cellular up to the whole individual level showing metabolic status of fish (protein concentration in liver and muscle, hepatosomatic index, and Fulton's condition factor). Individual thermal stress and low concentrations of pesticides decreased the sediment reworking activity of fish and entrained metabolic compensation with global depletion in energy stores. We found that combined chemical and thermal stresses impaired the capacity of fish to set up an efficient adaptive response. Our results strongly suggest that temperature will make fish more sensitive to water contamination by pesticides, raising concerns about wild fish conservation submitted to global changes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  31     Total Times Cited:  32     Cited Reference Count:  78 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on life stage,not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1007/s11356-015-5147-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Global change;Temperature warming;Pesticides;Fish;Bioturbation;EXPOSURE;STRESS,NA,NA

In adults, exposure to the pesticide did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a marked decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion, since baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at all conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish adults did not show their natural preference for the dark environment. The pesticide likely has anxiolytic effects on zebrafish, as well as a compromising effect on locomotor control, illustrating that behavioural changes, which could affect activities on the natural environment, such as escape and predation, may occur even in environmentally relevant concentrations of this pollutant.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1007/s10646-021-02497-0,Swimming behaviour;FET;Regent;Pesticide;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;JUVENILE ZEBRAFISH;TOXICITY;INSECTICIDE;BIOMARKERS;NEUROTOXICITY;CONTAMINANTS;PREFERENCE;NOTOCHORD;MIXTURE,NA,NA

At times, these applications tend to be more effective at the onset of fish spawning in spring: however, they can cause conflicts between anglers and lake management personnel assigned to control excessive SAV. We evaluated the direct application of an aquatic herbicide (Aquathol K [dipotassium salt of endothall]) on the nest behavior and fidelity of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and measured the subsequent reproductive success of these fish. Endothall was applied to achieve a shoreline concentration of 5 mg/L of water volume in 0.1-ha ponds (3 mg/L whole-pond concentration). It was applied directly on nests in three ponds in March 2005, 2006, and 2007 when largemouth bass initiated spawning; spawning activity was monitored over 14-15 d. Using similar techniques, we applied water to another three ponds where largemouth bass were nesting. For all 3 years, endothall did not affect nest guarding by largemouth bass, and nest fidelity was similar to that for ponds treated with water. Endothall concentrations declined about sevenfold over 21 d but persisted in the water during spawning. Electrofishing of young largemouth bass 2-3 months after spawning showed that their relative abundance and size were similar among the ponds treated with endothall and the control ponds. Similarly, the density and biomass of age-0 largemouth bass did not vary between treatments for fish killed with rotenone in late August each year. Managers can use these results to address angler concerns about endothall application during largemouth bass spawning and thereby lessen conflicts over efforts to control excessive SAV.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1577/M08-041.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),AQUATIC VEGETATION;LAKE SEMINOLE;POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS;ANGLER ATTITUDES;HYDRILLA;FISHERY;MANAGEMENT;HERBICIDES;REMOVAL;Reproductive Behavior,NA,NA

In this study, common carp were used to assess the individual and combined toxicity of PE-MPs (0, 1.5, or 4.5 mg/L) and GLY (0, 5, or 15 mg/L) on the brain-gut axis. After 60 days of exposure, the developmental toxicity, blood-brain barrier (BBB), locomotor behavior, intestinal barrier (physical barrier, chemical barrier, microbial barrier), and intestinal content metabolism of common carp were evaluated. Results showed that 15 mg/L of GLY exposure significantly reduced the mRNA expression of tight-junction genes (occludin, claudin-2, and ZO-1) in the brain, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was clearly inhibited by high concentrations of GLY. However, different concentrations of PE-MPs had no significant effect on the activity of AChE. Furthermore, the free-swimming behavior of common carp was distinctly inhibited by treatment with a combination of 15 mg/L GLY and 4.5 mg/L PE-MPs. Histological studies indicated that PE-MPs alone and in combination with GLY could disrupt the physical and chemical intestinal barriers of common carp. Additionally, the abundance and diversity of gut microbiota in common carp were significantly changed when exposed to a combination of PE-MPs and GLY. Metabolomics further revealed that PE-MPs combined with GLY triggered metabolic changes and that differential metabolites were related to amino acid and lipid metabolism. These findings illustrate that exposure to PE-MPs or GLY alone is toxic to fish and results in physiological changes to the brain-gut axis.

To address this, the aim of this study was to examine the dose- and time-dependent effects of low- and high-dose pesticide mixture (metalachlor, linuron, isoproturon, tebucanazole, aclonifen, atrazine, pendimethalin, azinphos-methyl) and heat stress co-exposure (22 degrees C control/32 degrees C treatment for 4-week) on free-swimming behaviors and cumulative actionless time (CAT) of goldfish. Behavioral analysis showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in distance swam, as well as a subsequent increase in CAT. Vertical and horizontal spatial behavioral use were affected under heat and pesticides co-exposure conditions. In 3- and 4-week(s) exposure groups, horizontal spatial behavioral use demonstrated elevated time spent in the lower third of the aquarium. Similarly, during 3- and 4-week(s) exposure (32 degrees C control and 32 degrees C high doses) vertical spatial behavioral use was found to increase time spent in the outermost edges of the aquarium. In all treatment groups, the final condition factor (KM) showed significant attenuation when compared to the initial KM. However, there was an unclear relationship between heat/pesticide co-exposure and growth most notably in 32 degrees C high-dose groups. In addition, the expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A mRNA was significantly higher in pesticide-exposed groups. Taken together, data demonstrated that co-exposure with low- or high-dose pesticide mixture and heat stress significantly impacted natural swimming patterns, which over time might result in the broader population and ecological effects.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  116 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no behaviour,not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1080/15287394.2023.2174463,Environmental pollutants;global warming;fish behavior;cytochrome P450 1A;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS;SUBLETHAL TOXICITY;WATER TEMPERATURE;GENE-EXPRESSION;CHRONIC STRESS;HEAT-STRESS;FISH;GROWTH;RESPONSES;ATRAZINE;Pesticides;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System,NA,NA

Animals acquire new skills due to conditioned responses resulting from a sequence of neutral and unconditioned stimuli affecting their bodies; there is a constant time interval between the stimuli. Both stimuli become associated after a number of repetitions and animal bodies start to respond to the initially neutral stimulus as to the unconditioned one. The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure of fish to a pyrethroid-deltamethrin (an active ingredient in Decis 2.5 EC pesticide that disturbs the proper operation of the nervous system) affects the ability to learn in common carp.        Materials and Methods. Production of new types of behaviour was triggered in fish by using the unconditioned stimulus (an irritating electric impulse) and the conditioned stimulus (light). The experiment was performed in a tank divided into two compartments where fish could swim freely from one compartment to another. The ability to learn was assessed on the basis of the following types of behaviour evoked in response to the conditioned stimulus: locomotor agitation, preference to occupy or avoid certain areas in the tank, an escape response, etc.        Results. In fish exposed to 0.35 mu g . L-1 deltamethrin (for common carp concentration 10 times lower than lethal) for 35 min the ability to produce and remember the conditioned defence response was reduced and time interval since presenting the conditioned stimulus till occurring the initial signs of the conditioned response was prolonged.        Conclusion. The classical conditioning method revealed that sublethal concentration of deltamethrin restricted ability to learn and retain information in common carp, despite absence of observable intoxication symptoms.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3750/AIP2010.40.2.07     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),common carp;deltamethrin;learning and memory processes;INTERMEDIATE-TERM-MEMORY;LAKE-BALATON;DELTAMETHRIN;AVOIDANCE;GOLDFISH;CONSOLIDATION;TRANSCRIPTION;FIXATION;SENSITIZATION;INVOLVEMENT;Pesticides,NA,NA

Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a Parkinson's disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochondria. Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination with different potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT-2.5 mu g/L, valproic acid (VPA)-0.5 mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)-250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics (PROBIO)-3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti-social profile and mirror tests and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a) CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views, this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05). Four out of eight studied groups-(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA-displayed an impaired, often antithetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.0005). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT + PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the above groups (p > 0.05). Except for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a normalized trend in terms of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental groups exhibited exacerbated levels of aggression (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001) not only near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001). Conclusions: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement compared with (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT-treated zebrafish (e-h). Independently of the aggressive-like reactions and fluctuations among the testing day(s) and groups, ROT disrupted the social behavior, while VPA promoted a specific typology in contrast with LEV/CARB.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  43 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Included""}",10.3390/brainsci12070898     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anti-social;aggressivity;counterclockwise rotation;zebrafish;Danio rerio;Parkinson's disease;rotenone;VALPROIC ACID;TOXICITY;DEFICITS;STRESS;Parkinson Disease;Chronic Disease,NA,NA

Juveniles stage of C. gariepinus were used for the toxicity study. Lethal concentration of 50% mortality of sample (LC50) was determined using semi-static method. From the result of the LC50 determination lower concentrations of endosulfan were prepared for sub-lethal test. Ten fish per test concentration in three replicates were exposed to varying concentrations of endosulfan (0.00, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075 and 0.01) mu g/L. Signs of stress and mortality were monitored during the experimental duration. Cortisol levels, GST and AChE activities were measured spectrophotometrically. No visible changes in behaviour and appearance were observed in the treated fishes and no mortality recorded. Significant (p < 0.05) declined in cortisol secretion was observed and the change in the concentration was dose and time dependent. Glutathione S-transferase activity was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the control and the concentrations increase with increased in concentration and exposure duration. No clear trend was observed in acetylcholinesterase activity. The findings showed that the cortisol levels and GST activity of test organism were affected by the test chemical and therefore could be considered as a suitable marker to evaluate the effect of organochlorine pesticide on fish and other aquatic organisms.

A variety of illnesses are initiated or aided by the presence of certain perturbing factors. In the case of autism spectrum disorder, the environmental component plays an important part in determining the overall picture. Moreover, the lack of therapies to relieve existing symptoms complicates the fight against this condition. As a result, animal models have been used to make biomedical research easier and more suited for disease investigations. The current study used zebrafish as an animal model to mimic a real-life scenario: acute exposure to an increased dose of pesticides, followed by prospective intervention-based therapy with vitamin B-12 (vit. B-12). It is known that vit. B-12 is involved in brain function nerve tissue, and red blood cell formation. Aside from this, the role of vit. B-12 in the redox processes is recognized for its help against free radicals. To investigate the effect of vit. B-12, fish were divided into four different groups and exposed to a pesticide mixture (600 mu g L-1 fipronil + 600 mu g L-1 pyriproxyfen) and 0.24 mu g L-1 vit. B-12 for 14 days. The impact of the compounds was assessed daily with EthoVision XT 11.5 software for behavioral observations, especially for sociability, quantified by the social interaction test. In addition, at the end of the study, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. The results showed significant improvements in locomotor activity parameters and a positive influence of the vitamin on sociability. Regarding the state of oxidative stress, high activity was found for SOD and GPx in the case of vit. B-12, while fish exposed to the mixture of pesticides and vit. B-12 had a lower level of MDA. In conclusion, the study provides new data about the effect of vit. B-12 in zebrafish, highlighting the potential use of vitamin supplementation to maintain and support the function of the organism.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  95 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on life stage",10.3390/ani14030405     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Danio rerio;behavior;autism spectrum disorder;pesticide;vitamin B-12;oxidative stress;AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER;OXIDATIVE STRESS;FEEDING PROBLEMS;GENE-EXPRESSION;FIPRONIL;CHILDREN;DEFICIENCY;DYSFUNCTION;EXPOSURE;MODELS;Pesticides;Vitamin D;Vitamin U;Riboflavin;Vitamin A;Biotin;Folic Acid;Vitamin B Complex;Vitamin E;Vitamins;Intervention Studies;Arachidonic Acid;Ascorbic Acid;Tocopherols,NA,NA
