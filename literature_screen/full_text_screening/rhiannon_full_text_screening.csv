The potential  for FN to act as an anti-androgen (at exposures of 1, 50, and 200 microg FN/l  over a 26-day period) was assessed in male three-spined sticklebacks,  Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring kidney spiggin concentration, nest-building,  and courtship behavior. Spiggin is the glue protein that male sticklebacks use to  build their nests and is directly controlled by androgens. FN exposure  significantly reduced spiggin production as well as nest-building activity. It  also adversely affected courtship--especially the 'zigzag dance' and biting  behavior of the males. FN thus appears to have anti-androgenic effects on both  the physiology and behavior of the male stickleback.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""control?""]}",10.1007/s10646-008-0265-2,"Androgen Antagonists/*toxicity;Animals;Biomarkers/analysis;Female;Fenitrothion/*toxicity;Fish Proteins/biosynthesis;Male;Nesting Behavior/drug effects;Pesticides/*toxicity;Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects;Sexual Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Smegmamorpha/*physiology;Pesticides;Reproductive Behavior",NA,NA

Environmental pollutants, notably endocrine disrupting compounds,  can interfere with the proper functioning of hormones, thereby impacting the  expression of hormonally regulated traits. Atrazine, one of the most widely used  herbicides, can alter sex hormone levels in exposed animals. I tested the effects  of environmentally relevant atrazine exposures on mating signals and behaviors in  male guppies, a sexually dimorphic freshwater fish. Prolonged atrazine exposure  reduced the expression of two honest signals: the area of orange spots  (ornaments) and the number of courtship displays performed. Atrazine exposure  also reduced aggression towards competing males in the context of mate  competition. In the wild, exposure levels vary among individuals because of  differential distribution of the pollutants across habitats; hence, differently  impacted males often compete for the same mates. Disrupted mating signals can  reduce reproductive success as females avoid mating with perceptibly suboptimal  males. Less aggressive males are at a competitive disadvantage and lose access to  females. This study highlights the effects of atrazine on ecologically relevant  mating signals and behaviors in exposed wildlife. Altered reproductive traits  have important implications for population dynamics, evolutionary patterns, and  conservation of wildlife species.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""control?

All tests were run on prochloraz (imidazole  fungicide), bentazone (diazine herbicide), and nicosulfuron (sulfonylurea  herbicide). Behavioral effects were assessed, at four concentrations (10  microg/L, 100 microg/L, 1 mg/L, 10 mg/L), on endpoints related to swimming  pattern (preference-avoidance responses, burst swimming reactions), comfort  activities (buccal movements, feeding attempts), and social relations  (antagonistic acts, grouping). The behavior of the fish appeared particularly  sensitive to prochloraz exposure. As a whole, prochloraz-contaminated flows  showed significant effects on the six behaviors studied; bentazone and  nicosulfuron affected three and five, respectively. At the lowest concentration,  prochloraz also showed more effects than the two other pesticides. Some of the  behavioral endpoints were found particularly sensitive to a given chemical.  Pesticide-contaminated flows also induced significant changes in swimming  orientation of the fish. Attraction was observed in response to flowing solutions  of prochloraz (1 mg/L, 10 mg/L), bentazone (10 microg/L, 10 mg/L), and  nicosulfuron (1 mg/L, 10 mg/L). At a concentration of 1 mg/L, none of the  pesticides induced a noticeable depolarization of the olfactory epithelium,  suggesting that these chemicals are not detected by the olfactory sense of the  fish.

A variety of illnesses are initiated or aided by the presence of  certain perturbing factors. In the case of autism spectrum disorder, the  environmental component plays an important part in determining the overall  picture. Moreover, the lack of therapies to relieve existing symptoms complicates  the fight against this condition. As a result, animal models have been used to  make biomedical research easier and more suited for disease investigations. The  current study used zebrafish as an animal model to mimic a real-life scenario:  acute exposure to an increased dose of pesticides, followed by prospective  intervention-based therapy with vitamin B(12) (vit. B(12)). It is known that vit.  B(12) is involved in brain function nerve tissue, and red blood cell formation.  Aside from this, the role of vit. B(12) in the redox processes is recognized for  its help against free radicals. To investigate the effect of vit. B(12), fish  were divided into four different groups and exposed to a pesticide mixture (600  μg L(-1) fipronil + 600 μg L(-1) pyriproxyfen) and 0.24 μg L(-1) vit. B(12) for  14 days. The impact of the compounds was assessed daily with EthoVision XT 11.5  software for behavioral observations, especially for sociability, quantified by  the social interaction test. In addition, at the end of the study, the activities  of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde  (MDA) were measured. The results showed significant improvements in locomotor  activity parameters and a positive influence of the vitamin on sociability.  Regarding the state of oxidative stress, high activity was found for SOD and GPx  in the case of vit. B(12), while fish exposed to the mixture of pesticides and  vit. B(12) had a lower level of MDA. In conclusion, the study provides new data  about the effect of vit. B(12) in zebrafish, highlighting the potential use of  vitamin supplementation to maintain and support the function of the organism.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""control?""]}",10.3390/ani14030405,autism spectrum disorder;behavior;Danio rerio;oxidative stress;pesticide;vitamin B12;Pesticides;Vitamin D;Vitamin U;Riboflavin;Vitamin A;Biotin;Folic Acid;Vitamin B Complex;Vitamin E;Vitamins;Intervention Studies;Arachidonic Acid;Ascorbic Acid;Tocopherols,NA,NA

Behavioral data was acquired and analyzed  by idTracker and MATLAB. By comparing the effects of all treatments on behavior  parameters, we confirmed that the spatial distribution was more easily altered  rather than general locomotor parameters, e.g. 0.7-70 mg/L PTZ and 5-20 mg/L  paraquat being effective for altering spatial distribution but having little  effects on general locomotor parameters. Based on the heatmap, i.e., the  cumulative proportion of grids and that of frequency in grids, we calculated the  behavioral Gini coefficient (G(b)) for quantitative assessment of fish spatial  distribution. The Gini coefficient ranged from zero to 1, with larger values  meaning poorer evenness of spatial distribution. Of note, G(b) showed smaller  coefficient of variations (CV) with 3%-19% between replicate tanks in all  treatments than the highest frequency (4%-79%), displaying well robustness.  Especially, G(b) addressed the challenge of the complicated heatmap with multiple  hotspots.

The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 mu g/L. of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation.

Here we assess the effects of diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, on alarm pheromone induced antipredator responses and homing behavior in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Nominal exposure concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mu g.L-1) were chosen to emulate diazinon pulses in the natural environment.

Eggs exposed to endosulfan took longer to hatch, and the resulting fry were smaller at 1 week of age and had decreased mobility at 2 weeks of age. Upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals also produced fewer eggs, and these eggs took significantly longer to hatch. Medaka exposed to endosulfan shortly after hatching did not differ in early mobility or foraging ability. Interestingly, upon reaching sexual maturity, these individuals produced more eggs than did unexposed females. The observed effects were not dose-dependent, with medaka exposed to intermediate concentrations of endosulfan (0.10 mug/L) exhibiting the greatest response.

The ""smooth"" pattern was typically shown as a normal movement behavior, while the ""shaking"" pattern was frequently observed after treatments of diazinon. These smooth and shaking patterns were selected for training with an artificial neural network. Parameters characterizing the movement tracks, such as speed, degree of backward movements, stop duration, turning rate, meander, and maximum distance movements in the y-axis of 1-min duration, were given as input (six nodes) to a multi-layer perceptron with the backpropagation algorithm. Binary information for the smooth and shaking patterns was separately given as the matching output (one node), while eight nodes were assigned to a single hidden layer. As new input data were given to the trained network, it was possible to recognize the smooth and shaking patterns of the new input data. Average recognition rates of the smooth pattern decreased significantly while those for the shaking pattern increased to a higher degree after treatments of diazinon. The trained network was able to reveal the difference in the shaking pattern in different light phases before treatments of diazinon.

The effects of diuron on fish behaviour are currently poorly understood. Herein, the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was continuously exposed to environmentally realistic levels of diuron from the fertilised egg stage to the adult stage. Behavioural evaluation of adult marine medaka indicated that exposure to diuron increased anxiety in the light-dark test and increased predator avoidance. In addition, diumn exposure significantly reduced aggression, social interaction, shoaling, and learning and memory ability. However, only negligible variations in foraging behaviour and in behaviour in the novel tank test were observed. Marine medaka chronically exposed to diuron also showed decreased levels of dopamine in the brain, and changes were observed in the transcription of genes related to dopamine synthesis, degradation and receptors. Exposure to 5000 ng/L diumn caused significant downregulation of the expression of the genes of tyrosine hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase and significantly upregulated the expression of the genes of the D-5 dopaminergic receptor. The relative expression of the D-4 dopaminergic receptor was significantly upregulated in the 50, 500 and 5000 ng/L diuron-treated groups. These findings highlight the significant neumtoxic effects of diumn and the extent to which this may involve the dopaminergic system of the brain. More broadly, this study reveals the ecological risk associated with environmentally realistic levels of diuron in marine animals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  77 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not adult fish,chronic exposure since embryo but behavioru was measured during adult | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105917,Pesticide;Long-term exposure;Neurotoxicity;Dopamine;Ecotoxicity;ANTIFOULING BOOSTER BIOCIDES;RISK-ASSESSMENT;COASTAL WATERS;ZEBRAFISH;RESPONSES;FISH;DOPAMINE;METABOLITES;PESTICIDES;STRESS;Environmental Exposure;Military Personnel,NA,NA

We observed significant decreases in social behavior and swimming speed (i.e., hypoactivity) in fish exposed to lethal CPF concentrations for 4 days. At the sublethal concentration, there was increased schooling duration and hyperactivity of fish on day 8 but not on day 4. In contrast, 12 days of sublethal CPF exposure resulted in social behavior responses similar to those after 4 days' lethal exposure, i.e., significant decreases in schooling frequency and duration with a notable increase in duration of solitary behavior.

Medaka in three developmental periods, namely 0, 20 and 40 day-old post-hatch (i.e. time points 0, 20 and 40, respectively), were exposed to CPF (12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mu g/L) for 48 h under semi-static conditions. The CPF half-lives during exposures were evaluated and the swimming patterns in a flume section (arena) were presented on two-dimensional gradient maps of forced movement of fish against water current. A comparative numerical analysis of fish residence times between each time point control and the corresponding CPF groups was performed by dividing arenas into 15 proportional areas. The time point 0 control group gradient map showed a noticeably different swim pattern from those of the >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups, which was statistically supported by the differences for residence times seen in >= 12 corresponding areas. The control group gradient maps for time points 20 and 40 differed from those of the respective >= 12.5 mu g CPF/L groups. The comparative analysis of the residence times in the corresponding 15 areas revealed differences in >= 5 areas for time point 20 and in >= 3 areas for time point 40. The integrative analysis of the gradient maps and the numerical statistics revealed stage-specific effects and a concentration-response relationship between CPF and alterations on forced medaka swimming despite the dissipation of CPF from the water column.

Pyrethroids are the fourth major group of insecticides in use worldwide and have extremely negative effects on aquatic fauna. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of an acute 2 h sub-lethal exposure to different levels of the pyrethroid esfenvalerate on the swimming behaviour of two Cypriniformes species: the native Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) and the non-native invasive bleak (Alburnus alburnus). The experimental set-up consisted of previous exposure to three esfenvalerate concentrations (control, 1.2 (low), and 2.0 (high) μg/L) before being stocked in a three-artificial-flume-channel mesocosm for behavioural trials through direct observation. Monitored behaviours included (i) routine activity, (ii) shoal cohesion, and iii) boldness. Significant differences in fish behaviour were detected for the native species (barbel), as individuals spent significantly more time holding position (i.e., resting) in the control (44.9%) than in the high esfenvalerate concentration (25.2%). Concordantly, control barbels were also found to perform more directional changes than the ones exposed to high esfenvalerate concentrations. Behavioural changes were also found for boldness, measured by the proportion of fish attempts to negotiate the upstream ramp, which were significantly higher in the control (37.4%) and in the high concentration (41.5%) compared to the low one (21.1%). Finally, regarding shoal cohesion of the barbel, it was tighter in the control (81.3%) than in the low- (70.5%) and high- (71.1%) esfenvalerate treatments. For the invasive bleak, there were no significant differences in any of the behavioural traits upon previous exposure to an increasing esfenvalerate concentration. This experimental study demonstrated that even short-term exposure to the pyrethroid esfenvalerate was sufficient to alter the behaviour of a native Cypriniformes fish species while not affecting the non-native species. This may confer greater competitive advantages to non-native fish species in the context of global changes. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: T.

Genetic and environmental factors are believed to be responsible for neuronal diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. It is difficult to restore normal nervous function after neurodegeneration; hence, prevention could be the best strategy against these diseases. Ayurved medicines such as Suvarna Bhasma (SB) have enormous potential to treat these neurological diseases. Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the protective effect of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish. Materials and methods: In this study, we induced Parkinson's-like disease model in zebrafish by inducing it with rotenone (7 μg/L). We examined the behavioural, proteomics and dopamine alterations of rotenone induced zebrafish of SB pre-treated group as compared to the control group. Results: The behavioural experiments showed that due to rotenone exposure, Parkinson's-like behavioural abnormality was induced in zebrafish. However, because of SB treatment, this behavioural abnormality was reduced. The proteomics study of zebrafish brains clearly showed that the SB-treated group was not significantly affected due to rotenone exposure. However, in the SB non-treated group, expression of nine proteins that are linked to Parkinson's disease (gene name: sncgb, ywhae1, ywhah, uchl1, ywhaba, psma6a, ywhabl, ywhaqb, and ywhabb) were differentially expressed after rotenone exposure. Finally, prevention of dopamine alteration in SB-treated fish brains confirmed the protective action of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish. Conclusions: This study finds that Suvarna Bhasma has neuroprotective effects against Parkinson's-like disease model. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

This study presents a new approach for the investigation of predator prey interactions between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) impaired by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic insecticide. With a simple experimental design including four different treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed, (3) prey exposed and (4) both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect by visual observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 mu g/l CHP. Previously, a decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid larvae was observed. However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both predators and prey, no significant differences in the feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. This suggests an impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP concentration (1 mu g/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. We therefore propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in higher tier studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk assessment.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: may do other behaviours",10.1007/s10646-010-0516-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Feeding depression;Pesticide;Non-biting midge;Fish;Interspecific interaction;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTION;TENTANS DIPTERA;FISH PREDATION;TOXICITY;BEHAVIOR;FOOD;SEDIMENT;EXPOSURE;ATRAZINE;RIVER,NA,NA

Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are environmental contaminants that mimic or alter the process of hormone signaling. In particular, EDCs that alter estrogen and androgen signaling pathways are of major concern for fishes because these EDCs may alter reproductive physiology, behavior, and ultimately sex ratio. Bifenthrin, a pyrethroid with escalating usage, is confirmed to disrupt estrogen signaling in several species of fish, including Menidia beryllina (inland silverside), an Atherinid recently established as a euryhaline model. Our main objective was to broadly assess the molecular and physiological responses of M. beryllina to the ng/L concentrations of bifenthrin typically found in the environment, with a focus on endocrine-related effects, and to discern links between different tiers of the biological hierarchy. As such, we evaluated the response of juvenile Menidia to bifenthrin using a Menidia-specific microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on specific endocrine-related genes of interest, and a Menidia-specific ELISA to the egg-coat protein choriogenin, to evaluate a multitude of molecular-level responses that would inform mechanisms of toxicity and any underlying causes of change at higher biological levels of organization. The sublethal nominal concentrations tested (0.5, 5 and 50 ng/L) were chosen to represent the range of concentrations observed in the environment and to provide coverage of a variety of potential responses. We then employed a 21-day reproductive assay to evaluate reproductive responses to bifenthrin (at 0.5 ng/L) in a separate group of adult M. beryllina. The microarray analysis indicated that bifenthrin influences a diverse suite of molecular pathways, from baseline metabolic processes to carcinogenesis. A more targeted examination of gene expression via qPCR demonstrated that bifenthrin downregulates a number of estrogen-related transcripts, particularly at the lowest exposure level. Choriogenin protein also decreased with exposure to increasing concentrations of bifenthrin, and adult M. beryllina exposed to 0.5 ng/L had significantly reduced reproductive output (fertilized eggs per female). This reduction in fecundity is consistent with observed changes in endocrine-related gene expression and choriogenin production. Taken together, our results demonstrate that environmental concentrations of bifenthrin have potential to interfere with metabolic processes, endocrine signaling, and to decrease reproductive output.

Several studies have shown that these formulations are highly toxic to fish, even compared with pure glyphosate. However, mechanisms underlying this toxicity are not fully understood. In this context, this study evaluated the effects of exposure to Roundup Original (R) (RO), Roundup Transorb (R) (RT), and Roundup WG (R) (RWG) on the behavioural patterns of the livebearer Jenynsia multidentata. This fish naturally inhabits agricultural areas in southern Brazil and Argentina where glyphosate is used extensively. In the experiment, animals were exposed to the herbicides for 96 h, at the environmentally relevant concentration of 0.5 mg/L of glyphosate. Swimming performance, anxiety, aggressiveness, long-term memory and male sexual activity were recorded. The formulation RWG negatively affected swimming performance, thigmotaxia and long-term memory consolidation. Conversely, RT reduced the sexual performance of males.

Olfactory function of juvenile chinook salmon was evaluated in two separate experiments following 2-h immersion exposures to 0, 1, 10, or 100 mu g diazinon/L. In the first test system. groups of 10 salmon were transferred to the prechoice zone of a Y-maze fluviarium with parallel streams of water. A dilute alarm scent composed of either chinook skin extract or L-serine was pumped into the water supply of one arm. Fish were allowed to choose either upstream arm by raising a containment screen for 10 min, then their positions were photographed and the screen lowered. In the second test system the relationship of diazinon exposure to predation susceptibility was directly examined by transferring groups of 20 salmon (10 diazinon-exposed, 10 control) to troughs containing a protective cover. These salmon were given two olfactory warnings by delivering conspecific skin extract to both their transfer container and the predation tank they entered. After a 2-min prey acclimation period, larger predator rainbow trout were allowed access to the downstream section of the tank containing the test salmon. The combined fish were observed until approximately 50% of the prey fish had been consumed. Statistical comparisons indicated that although the salmon did avoid the water streams containing alarm scents. none of the diazinon exposure levels resulted in significantly different outcomes from the controls (alpha = 0.05) in either the two-choice maze study or the predation study.
