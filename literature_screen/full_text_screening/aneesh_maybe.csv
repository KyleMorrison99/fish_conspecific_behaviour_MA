The median lethal concentration (96 h-LC50) was determined, and the effects of a sublethal concentration on oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated in the liver, gills, white muscle, and heart. During the acute toxicity test, fish mortality progressively increased with RT concentration along with behavioral abnormalities were detected. The calculated 96 h-LC50 value of RT was found as 1.21 mg/L. Fish exposed to 0.5 mg/L of RT (40% of 96 h-LC50) showed a significant increase in the hepatic somatic index (HSI) with a concomitant decrease in Fulton’s condition factor (K). The sublethal exposure also induced significant increases (p < 0.05) in the hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, reduced glutathione (GSH) content, and catalase (CAT) activity, with a concomitant decrease in the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. In the gills, RT exposure induced significant increases in the GST activity, GSH and LPO levels, whereas CAT activity was inhibited. RT also induced CAT and GST activities together with the content of GSH and LPO levels in the white muscle. On the other hand, significant decreases in the CAT and GST activities were detected in the heart with a marked increase in the GSH content and no changes in LPO levels. Therefore, the exposure to 0.5 mg/L of RT induced oxidative stress in the liver, gills and white muscle with tissue-specific responses related to antioxidant defenses. This study demonstrated that B. amazonicus is sensitive to Roundup Transorb® at sublethal and environmentally relevant concentrations, even at short-term exposures. The use of Roundup Transorb® should be carefully monitored due to its adverse non-target impacts. © The Author(s) 2021.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: D.A.

Considering the availability, success rate, and limitations associated with the current arsenals to fight PD, there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic interventions. Therefore, based on the previously reported beneficial functions of the L1 cell adhesion molecule, we hypothesized that L1 mimetic compounds may serve to neutralize neurotoxicity triggered by the pesticide paraquat (PQ). In this study, we attempt to use PQ for inducing PD-like pathology and the L1 mimetic compounds phenelzine sulfate (PS) and tacrine (TC) as potential candidates for the amelioration of PD symptoms using zebrafish as a model system. Administration of PQ together with the L1 mimetic compounds PS or TC (250 nM) improved survival of zebrafish larvae, protected them from locomotor deficits, and increased their sensorimotor reflexes. Moreover, application of PQ together with PS (500 nM) or TC (1000 nM) in adult zebrafish counteracted PQ-induced toxicity, maintaining normal locomotor functions and spatial memory in an open field and T-maze task, respectively. Both L1 mimetic compounds prevented reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine levels, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, protected against impairment of mitochondrial viability, improved the antioxidant enzyme system, and prevented a decrease in ATP levels. Altogether, our findings highlight the beneficial functions of the agonistic L1 mimetics PS and TC by improving several vital cell functions against PQ-triggered neurotoxicity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  141 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Aneesh""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: unsure on life stage and behaviours",10.3389/fnins.2020.00458     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),pesticide;paraquat;zebrafish;Parkinson's disease-like pathology;L1 cell adhesion molecule;phenelzine sulfate;tacrine;OXYGEN SPECIES PRODUCTION;SPINAL-CORD REGENERATION;PARKINSONS-DISEASE;OXIDATIVE STRESS;MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION;RECOGNITION MOLECULES;ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN;RAT-BRAIN;IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY;FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY;Pesticides,NA,NA

In mammals, it inhibits monoamine uptake through binding to the dopamine transporter, with a mechanism of action similar to cocaine, resulting in higher levels of dopamine at the synapse. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in a broad spectrum of processes such as locomotion, cognition, reward, and mental disorders. In this work we have studied, for the first time, the effects of TDF on behavior of both larval and adult zebrafish and its connection with changes in the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We evaluated the acute exposure of 5 dpf larvae to different concentrations of TDF, ranging from 5 mg/L to 35 mg/L. The lowest concentration does not alter neither locomotor activity nor dopamine levels but produced changes in the expression of two genes, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine transporter (dat). Besides, it induced a reduction in extracellular serotonin and had an anxiolytic-like effect, supported by a decrease in cortisol production. On the other hand, a high concentration of TDF produced a dose-dependent reduction in locomotion, which was reversed or enhanced by D1 (SCH-23390) or D2 (Haloperidol) dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively. Using in vivo electrochemistry, we show that these changes could be associated with higher levels of dopamine in the brain. Thus, in adult zebrafish, though not in larvae, TDF exposure increases locomotor activity, anxiety and aggressiveness, which coincides with the behaviors observed in mammals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: seems to be larvae exposure and adult behaviour but unsure",10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.12.012     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Triadimefon;Dopamine;Serotonin;Zebrafish;Behavior;TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE;DOWN-REGULATION;LARVAL;THIGMOTAXIS;MODULATION;LOCOMOTION;FUNGICIDES;PATTERNS;RELEASE;NEURONS,NA,NA

The agricultural workers were exposed to high concentrations of these pesticides due to unsafe work practices, and also the individual exposed to these pesticides shows alterations in their neurobehavioral. The present study aimed to evaluate the toxic effects of Monocrotophos on the locomotor activity, antioxidant activity, lipid peroxidation, and expression of genes related to apoptosis using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model. The neurotoxic effects of sub-lethal concentration of the Monocrotophos on fish were evaluated. The locomotor activity of the fishes was determined, followed by an antioxidant activity, and lipid peroxidation assays were performed. The expression of genes related to apoptosis in the brain was also determined by qPCR. The Lethal Concentration for 96 hrs. was estimated to be 36.5 mg/L. When exposed to sub-lethal concentration, marked changes were observed in locomotor activity (distance traveled, swimming speed and meandering), acetylcholinesterase activity, oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxidation) and antioxidant defenses in the brain. Expression of apoptotic genes determined by qPCR revealed an increase in Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 expressions. Data from this study suggest that Monocrotophos based pesticides induce cellular toxicity, and has the potential to alter the behavior and health.

The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 μg/L of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: S.N.

Twelve outdoor aquatic mesocosms (0.1 ha each) were randomly assigned to three treatments of diflubenzuron (four mesocosms/treatment): control, monthly (five total 10-mu g/L applications), or biweekly (twice monthly; nine total 10-mu g/L applications). Direct impacts on invertebrates (numbers and species composition of insects and zooplankton) and indirect impacts on fish (mortality, growth, and reproduction of bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass), phytoplankton (biomass and productivity), and water quality were measured over 16 weeks posttreatment. Both monthly and biweekly treatments of diflubenzuron decreased total numbers (fivefold reduction) and species richness (twofold reduction) and increased dominance (twofold increase) of zooplankton within 4 weeks posttreatment; Cladocerans, Copepods, and Rotifers were all sensitive. Diflubenzuron reduced species richness of emergent insects, which resulted in increased dominance by a few species; however, impacts on emergent insects were confounded by a treatment x time interaction. Direct reductions in invertebrate grazers caused indirect increases in algal biomass.

The subchronic study revealed reduction of dissolved oxygen and increased ammonia in aquaria of BF-exposed fish. Clinical signs revealed high degree of discomfort and aggressiveness together with reductions in survival rate and body weight gain.

It was established that the reduction in count, activity of sperm and the average life span of sperm trails were significant (p < 0.05) at the tested concentrations 5 mug/l and 50 mug/l DDT after 1 month of exposure. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that long exposure time and higher DDT tested levels accelerate the occurrence of negative effect on the number and activity of sperm released as well as the life span of their trails.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: may have other behaviours",10.1248/jhs.48.404     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),DDT;zebrafish;sperm;fertilization;insemination;reproductive behaviour;SEMINAL-VESICLES;FISHES;HISTOCHEMISTRY;REPRODUCTION;ALEXANDRIA;TELEOSTEI;TOXICITY;GROWTH;EGYPT;GLAND,NA,NA

However, few studies have evaluated the effects of carbendazim on fish behaviour and our main objective was to evaluate behavioural changes on adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to this fungicide. We studied 177 fishes, divided into control groups (not exposed) and treatment groups, exposed to a concentration of 120 mu g/L for 7, 14, 21 and 28. Behavioural data were collected using the scan sampling, with instantaneous recording every 30 s. We evaluated and compared fish behaviours and aquarium occupancy between treatments and controls using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. The results indicate that carbendazim initially elicited slow swimming and later fast swimming, decreased aggressiveness, and caused behavioural changes indicative of distress, like abnormal swimming and the gulping of air in water surface. In the wild, this behavioural change can result in an increased predation risk and consequent decrease or extinction of populations, revealing important ecological issues for animal communities living in polluted water bodies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  91 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: unclear on behaviours measured",10.1007/s10211-024-00438-8,Behaviour;Benzimidazole;Fish;Pesticide;Water contamination;AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS;FISH;PESTICIDES;BIOMARKERS;METABOLITE;RESPONSES;WELFARE;BENOMYL;STRESS;INDICATORS,NA,NA

In this study, we tested the effects of two reference toxicants, copper (Cu) and the pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate [(S)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylbutyrate], on lethal (mortality) and sublethal endpoints (growth, swimming behavior, transcription levels of stress response genes) in juvenile (81-90-day-old) striped bass (Morone saxatilis). We established cellular stress response markers for proteotoxicity (HSP70, HSP90), phase I detoxification mechanism (CYP1A1), metal-binding (metallothionein), as well as immune-function and pathogen-defense (TGF-beta, Mx-protein, nRAMP). Quantitative real-time TaqMan (R) PCR was used to examine tissue-specific changes in the transcriptome of liver, spleen, white muscle, anterior kidney and gills after 7-day Cu exposures and 24-h esfenvalerate exposures. On the transcriptome level, exposure to Cu showed strongest effects on the transcription of metallothionein in spleen tissue, causing a 4-fold increase of mRNA at 42 ppb total Cu and a 10-fold increase at 160 ppb Cu. Exposure to Cu also caused significant tissue-specific changes in gene transcription for immune-system related genes. Esfenvalerate exposure had tissue-specific effects on the transcription of HSP70, HSP90 and CYP1A1. The most significant effects were detected in liver tissue after exposure to 0.64 mu g/L esfenvalerate.        Our results show that the stress response at the transcriptome level is a more sensitive indicator for Cu and esfenvalerate exposures at low concentrations than swimming behavior, growth or mortality. The accuracy of studies on quantitative changes in the transcriptome can benefit from an initial evaluation or the inclusion of several different tissues and the use of multiple housekeeping genes.

The physiological and biochemical responses of juvenile Nile tilapia were studied after 96 hours of exposure to TCF. The experiment was conducted randomly with two treatments: control and TCF (0.5 mg L-1). No mortality or changes in hematological profile were recorded for the fish. On the other hand, we found that TCF exposure caused behavioral, metabolic and hormonal changes that modified the response patterns of the immune and enzymatic defense system in muscle and liver tissues. Increased plasma cortisol and glucose combined with the reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle and liver tissue after 96-h of TCF exposure indicates chemical stress. In response to this harmful situation, we observed changes in the immune system that lead to an increased number of leukocytes, thrombocytes, monocytes, lysozyme and leukocyte respiratory burst activity. Furthermore, we associate the increased activity of glutathione-S-transferase in liver tissue as a strategy fish use to combat the effects of TCF. Thus, we conclude that TCF affects the physiologic parameters of Nile tilapia, which can generate irreversible situations of recovery of the clinical condition. Such fact highlights the need to search for new compounds that could replace TCF, that have no or few adverse effects on fish species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Aneesh""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: unclear on behaviours measured",10.22034/IAR.2020.1904943.1071     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Aquaculture;Toxicology;Chemotherapy;Trichlorfon;LEUKOCYTES RESPIRATORY BURST;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;OXIDATIVE STRESS;INNATE IMMUNITY;COMMON CARP;FISH;DIAZINON;GLUTATHIONE;LYSOZYME;AQUACULTURE,NA,NA
