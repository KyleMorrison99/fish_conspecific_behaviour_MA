After much observation, behavioral patterns were divided into four basic patterns: active-smooth, active-shaking, inactive-smooth, and inactive-shaking. The ""smooth"" and ""shaking"" patterns were shown as normal movement behavior. However, the ""shaking"" pattern was more frequently observed than the ""smooth"" pattern in medaka specimens that were treated with insecticide. Each pattern was classified using a devised decision tree after the feature choice. It provides a natural way to incorporate prior knowledge from human experts in fish behavior and contains the information in a logical expression tree.

Fourteen-week-old Japanese medaka were exposed for seven days to concentrations of PCZ or KTC from 3.0 to 300 mu g/L.

However, PCZ was more potent than KTC both in modulating transcription and causing lesser fecundity. Exposure to nominal 30 mu g PCZ/L resulted in 50% less fecundity and significant down-regulation of vitellogenin II expression, but KTC did not cause such effects at this concentration.

Despite their widespread use, the impacts of these pesticides on the neurological health of wild salmon are not well understood. Of particular concern are the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides that block synaptic transmission by inhibiting neuronal acetylcholinesterase. Here we assess the effects of diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, on alarm pheromone induced antipredator responses and homing behavior in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Nominal exposure concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 μg·L-1) were chosen to emulate diazinon pulses in the natural environment. In the antipredator study, diazinon had no effect on swimming behavior or visually guided food capture. However, the pesticide significantly inhibited olfactory-mediated alarm responses at concentrations as low as 1.0 μg·L-1. Similarly, homing behavior was impaired at 10.0 μg·L-1. Our results suggest that olfactory-mediated behaviors are sensitive to anticholinesterase neurotoxicity in salmonids and that short-term, sublethal exposures to these insecticides may cause significant behavioral deficits. Such deficits may have negative consequences for survival and reproductive success in these fish.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 184; Correspondence Address: N.L.

Adult males that had been exposed to high concentrations of Acrobat or Tattoo over a 28-day period were less likely to approach females during behavioral trials. The absence of other behavioral effects, particularly those related to reproductive performance, may have been due to females being sexually unreceptive during behavioral trials.

Thus, as androgen receptor antagonists, the fungicide vinclozolin and the principal DDT metabolite p,p'-DDE have been demonstrated to induce demasculinization in rats. Whether this is also the case in fish remains to be demonstrated. For a period of 30 days, groups of adult male guppies were exposed to vinclozolin, p,p'-DDE, or the therapeutic antiandrogen flutamide (used as positive control) applied to the fodder at concentrations between 0.1 and 100 μg/g fodder. Subsequently, sexual characteristics of relevance to the male reproductive capacity were measured and compared with untreated control fish. All three chemicals caused profound alterations at increasing levels of biological organization, even in these fully matured males. At the cellular level, the three compounds induced a significant reduction in the number of ejaculated sperm cells. At the organ level, the sexually attractive orange-yellow coloration was reduced in area and discolored, and treated fish also had smaller testes. Further, at the organismal level, computer-aided behavior analyses demonstrated a severe disruption in male courtship behavior. We conclude that this demasculinization is consistent with an antiandrogenic action of vinclozolin and p,p'-DDE and is likely to compromise reproductive capability in this fish.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 166; Correspondence Address: E.

These chemicals can be continually released, persist, or even accumulate over time, with adverse effects on the physiology and behavior of aquatic species. Most studies aimed at evaluating the intergenerational effects of CECs have focused exclusively on single chemicals. By comparison, little is known about the effects of complex CEC mixtures on the behavior of organisms, or how these effects might manifest in subsequent generations. In this study, we exposed three generations of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to environmentally relevant concentrations of a complex CEC mixture representative of urban-impacted waterways and assessed the growth and behavior of larval and adult fish in life-stage-relevant fitness contexts (foraging, boldness, courtship). We found that (i) multigenerational exposure to a complex mixture of CECs altered the behavior of both larvae and adults in different fitness contexts; (ii) concentration-dependent patterns of behavioral impairment were consistent across fitness contexts and life stages; and (iii) the effects of exposure were magnified in the F1 and F2 generations. These results highlight the need for long-term, multigenerational assessments of CECs in affected waterways to robustly inform conservation practices aimed at managing aquatic systems.

We investigated the effects of the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos and the trematode parasite Euhaplorchis californiensis on three important traits of California killifish (Fundulus parvipinnis): neurotransmitter activity, release of the stress hormone cortisol, and behavior. Killifish were collected from a population without E. californiensis, and then half of the fish were experimentally infected. Following a 30 day period for parasite maturation, infected and uninfected groups were exposed to four concentrations of chlorpyrifos (solvent control, 1-3 ppb) prior to behavior trials to quantify activity, feeding behavior, and anti-predator responses. Water-borne cortisol release rates were measured non-invasively from each fish prior to infection, one-month post-infection, and following pesticide exposure. Killifish exposed to 3 ppb chlorpyrifos exhibited a 74.6 +/- 6.8% and 60.5 +/- 8.3% reduction in brain and muscle acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity relative to controls. The rate of cortisol release was suppressed by each chlorpyrifos level relative to controls. Killifish exposed to the medium (2 ppb) and high (3 ppb) pesticide concentrations exhibited reduced activity and a decrease in mean swimming speed following a simulated predator attack. Muscle AChE was positively related to swimming activity while brain AChE was positively related to foraging behavior. No effects of the parasite were observed, possibly because of low metacercariae densities achieved through controlled infections. We found that sublethal pesticide exposure has the potential to modify several organismal endpoints with consequences for reduced fitness, including neurological, endocrine, and behavioral responses in an ecologically abundant fish.

In a bioassay, sea bass juveniles were individually exposed to different doses of carbofuran (31, 63, 125 and 250 mu g/L) for 96 h. At the end of the bioassay, the swimming performance and 11 biomarkers were determined. Biomarkers were: hepatosomatic index (HSI), lipid peroxidation (LPO), reduced glutathione and the activities of the enzymes ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferases, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and muscle cholinesterases (ChE). After 96 h of exposure, carbofuran induced a decrease of the swimming velocity and inhibition of EROD activity at all concentrations tested, and inhibition of muscle ChE and brain AChE activities at 250 mu g/L. No relevant alterations in any of the other tested parameters were found. These results show that carbofuran induced adverse effects on fish by interfering with neurofunction, capability of detoxication and swimming velocity. In addition, positive and significant correlations between the swimming velocity and (i) brain AChE activity, (ii) muscle ChE activity and (iii) EROD activity suggest that the inhibition of these enzymes may somehow be related to the behavioural changes observed. Since these functions are determinant for the survival and performance of the fish in the wild, the findings of the present study suggest that adverse effects may occur in populations exposed to carbofuran if a sufficient number of animals is affected.

Following application, endosulfan can get to watercourses through surface runoff from agricultural fields and disturb the non-target aquatic animals including freshwater fish species. Given that the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the most recurrently used biomarkers of exposure to pesticides and there are controversial results concerning the effects of endosulfan exposure and AChE activity in fish, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of endosulfan in brain AChE activity and its gene expression pattern using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an animal model. Moreover, we have analyzed the effects of endosulfan exposure in different parameters of zebrafish swimming activity and in long-term memory formation. After 96 h of exposition, fish in the 2.4 mu g endosulfan/L group presented a significant decrease in AChE activity (9.44 +/- 1.038 mu mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1): p = 0.0205) when compared to the control group (15.87 +/- 1.768 mu mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1); p = 0.0205) which corresponds to approximately 40%. The down-regulation of brain AChE activity is not directly related with the transcriptional control as demonstrated by the RT-qPCR analysis. Our results reinforce AChE activity inhibition as a pathway of endosulfan-induced toxicity in brain of fish species. In addition, exposure to 2.4 mu g endosulfan/L during 96 h impaired all exploratory parameters evaluated: decreased line crossings (approximate to 21%, 273.7 +/- 28.12 number of line crossings compared to the control group 344.6 +/- 21.30, p = 0.0483), traveled distance (approximate to 20%, 23.44 +/- 2.127 m compared to the control group 29.39 +/- 1.585, p = 0.0281), mean speed (approximate to 25%, 0.03 +/- 0.003 m/s compared to the control group 0.04 +/- 0.002, p = 0.0275) and body turn angle (approximate to 21%, 69.940 +/- 4871 absolute turn angle compared to the control group 88.010 +/- 4560, p = 0.0114). These results suggest that endosulfan exposure significantly impairs animals' exploratory performance, and potentially compromises their ecological and interspecific interaction. Our results also showed that the same endosulfan exposure did not compromise animals' performance in the inhibitory avoidance apparatus. These findings provide further evidence of the deleterious effects of endosulfan exposure in the nervous system. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The alteration in locomotor behavior of fish may be due to an accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter at synaptic junctions, due to the inhibition of AChE enzyme activity (40 to 55%) in brain and also bioaccumulation of the toxicant in different parts of fish. The bioaccumulation values indicated that the accumulation of chlorpyrifos was maximum in viscera followed by head and body.

It has resulted in a series of toxicological and environmental problems, such as impacts on many non-target aquatic species, including fish. The spleen and head kidney in the bony fish are the major hematopoietic organs, and play a crucial part in immune responses. This study evaluated the subchronic effects of ATR and CPF on the mRNA and protein levels of HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 in the immune organs of common carp and compared the acute and subchronic effects of ATR and CPF on the swimming speed (SS) of common carp. The results of acute toxicity tests showed that the 96 h-LC50 of AIR and CPF for common carp was determined to be 2.142 and 0.582 mg/L, respectively. Meanwhile, acute and subacute toxicity of ATR and CPF in common carp resulted in hypoactivity. We also found that the mRNA and protein levels of HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 genes were induced in the spleen and head kidney of common carp exposed to ATR and CPF in the subchronic toxicity test. Our results indicate that ATR and CPF are highly toxic to common carp, and hypoactivity in common carp by acute and subchronic toxicity of ATR and CPF may provide a useful tool for assessing the toxicity of triazine herbicide and organophosphorous pesticides to aquatic organisms. In addition, the results from the subchronic toxicity test exhibited that increasing concentration of AIR and CPF in the environment causes considerable stress for common carp, suggesting that AIR and CPF exposure cause immunotoxicity to common carp.

Traditionally, female ornaments have been considered nonfunctional, being merely a genetically correlated response to selection for male ornamentation. However, this hypothesis is only relevant to species in which the ornament is basically the same in the two sexes. Alternatively, female ornaments may be influenced by selection acting directly on the females, either through female-female competition or male choice. We tested the latter hypothesis in mate-choice experiments with two-spotted gobies (Gobiusculus flavescens). In this small marine fish, females have bright yellow-orange bellies during the breeding season, a conspicuous trait that is not present in males. We conducted two aquarium experiments to test whether males preferred to mate with more colorful females. In the first experiment, males had a choice between two females that varied in natural coloration (and belly roundness). In the second experiment, we manipulated belly coloration and kept roundness constant. Males spent more time with colorful than with drab females in both experiments and also performed far more courtship displays toward colorful females. our study provides experimental evidence that males prefer ornamented females in a fish that is not sex-role reversed, supporting the hypothesis that female ornamentation is sexually selected.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  302     Total Times Cited:  352     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Jack""=>""Included""}","10.1073/pnas.211439298     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","SEXUAL SELECTION;PARENTAL INVESTMENT;DICHROMATISM;EVOLUTION;IMMUNOCOMPETENCE;STICKLEBACKS;ASTAXANTHIN;COMPETITION;DIMORPHISM;DIRECTION;Color",NA,NA

This potential threat to animal populations posed by xenoestrogens has, hardly surprisingly, been met by an intensive global effort to identify and develop biomarkers suitable for screening chemicals for estrogen mimicking capacity. Despite this effort, there are few biomarkers capable of linking exposure to xenoestrogens to impaired reproductive capability. The reproductive success of most animals depends strongly on the ability to perform the appropriate sexual behavior. The sexual display of the male guppy is strongly linked to reproductive success and is readily quantified under laboratory conditions. This preliminary study demonstrates that exposure of adult male guppies to water weakly contaminated with either natural estrogen (17 beta-estradiol) or the xenoestrogen (4-tert-octylphenol) causes a dramatic decrease in the rate and intensity of sexual display, It is concluded that quantitative analysis of the sexual display of male guppies holds great promise as a biomarker at the organismal level for the effects of estrogen mimicking xenobiotics.

In this study, we examined the ability of NP to alter reproductive competence in male fathead minnows after a 28 day flow-through exposure in a range of environmentally relevant concentrations bracketing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency toxicity-based NP chronic exposure criterion of 6.1 mu g NP/L. Exposure to NP at and above the EPA chronic exposure criterion resulted in an induction of plasma vitellogenin (VTG) within 14 days. However, 7 days after the cessation of exposure, VTG concentrations had dropped more than 50% and few males expressed VTG above the detection threshold. All of the morphological endpoints, including gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, secondary sexual characters, and histopathology, were unaltered by all NP treatments. However, when NP-exposed male fish were allowed to compete with control males for access to nest sites and females, most treatments altered the reproductive competence of exposed males. At lower NP concentrations, exposed males out-competed control males, possibly by being primed through the estrogenic NP exposure in a fashion similar to priming by pheromones released from female fathead minnows. At higher NP exposure concentrations, this priming effect was negated by the adverse effects of the exposure and control males out-competed treated males.

Thirty-day laboratory chronic studies were conducted to determine the relative sensitivity of standard (e.g. survival and growth) and non-standard behavioral (e.g. swimming capacity, feeding efficiency, and aggression) endpoints in predicting concentrations of fonofos protective of bluegill growth and survival. The lowest observable effect concentration (LOECs) for the standard measures of survival and growth was 5.6 μg/L. Two behavioral endpoints were of similar sensitivity to the standard measures: swimming capacity, LOEC of 5.6 μg/L; and prey strike frequency, LOEC of 5.6 μg/L. However, aggressive interactions were ten-fold more sensitive than swimming or feeding behavior with a LOEC occurring at 0.6 μg/L. Lab results were compared to an aquatic mesocosm study which exposed adult and juvenile bluegill to a 9.41 μg/L concentration of fonofos. The dissipation half-life of fonofos was 5 days in 0.1 hectare aquatic mesocosms. Significant mortality among caged bluegill occurred within 4 days of exposure at 9.41 μg/L. However, the 9.41 μg/L concentration of fonofos had no statistically significant effects on survival, growth, reproduction, or total biomass of free-ranging populations of bluegill.

In our previous study, we found that neburon has strong aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist activity, but whether it causes reproductive toxicity is not clear. In the present study, zebrafish were conducted as a model organism to evaluate whether environmental concentrations of neburon (0.1, 1 and 10 pg/L) induce reproductive disorder in males. After exposure to neburon for 150 days from embryo to adult, that the average spawning egg number in high concentration group was 106.40, which was significantly lower than 193.00 in control group. This result was mainly due to the abnormal male reproductive behavior caused by abnormal transcription of genes associated with reproductive behavior in the brain, such as secretogranin-2a. The proportions of spermatozoa in the medium and high concentration groups were 82.40% and 83.84%, respectively, which were significantly lower than 89.45% in control group. This result was mainly caused by hormonal disturbances and an increased proportion of apoptotic cells. The hormonal disruption was due to the significant changes in the transcription levels of key genes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis following neburon treatment. Neburon treatment also significantly activated the AhR signaling pathway, causing oxidative stress damage and eventually leading to a significant increase in apoptosis in the exposed group. Together, these data filled the currently more vacant profile of neburon toxicity and might provide information to assess the ecotoxicity of neburon on male reproduction at environmentally relevant concentrations.
