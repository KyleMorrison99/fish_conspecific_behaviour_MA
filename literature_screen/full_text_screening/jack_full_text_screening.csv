The potential for FN to act as an anti-androgen (at exposures of 1, 50, and 200 mu g FN/l over a 26-day period) was assessed in male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring kidney spiggin concentration, nest-building, and courtship behavior. Spiggin is the glue protein that male sticklebacks use to build their nests and is directly controlled by androgens. FN exposure significantly reduced spiggin production as well as nest-building activity. It also adversely affected courtship-especially the 'zigzag dance' and biting behavior of the males. FN thus appears to have anti-androgenic effects on both the physiology and behavior of the male stickleback.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  36     Total Times Cited:  40     Cited Reference Count:  83 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10646-008-0265-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Fenitrothion;Anti-androgen;Stickleback;Spiggin;Nest-building behavior;Courtship behavior;BRAIN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;SECONDARY SEX CHARACTERS;ENVIRONMENTAL ANTIANDROGENS;ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION;MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS;ESTROGENIC CHEMICALS;KIDNEY HYPERTROPHY;MALE-PREFERENCE;SPERM COUNT;ANDROGEN;Pesticides;Reproductive Behavior,NA,NA

While fenpropathrin was found to have neurotoxic effects in mammals, it remains unclear whether it has similar effects on fish. Here, we used adult zebrafish to investigate the impacts of fenpropathrin on fish social behaviors and neural activity. Exposure of adult zebrafish to 500 ppb of fenpropathrin for 72 h increased anxiety levels but decreased physical fitness, as measured by a novel tank diving test and swimming tunnel test. Fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to spend more time in the conspecific zone of the tank, possibly seeking greater comfort from their companions. Although learning, memory, and aggressive behavior did not change, fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to have shorter fighting durations. The immunocytochemical results showed the tyrosine hydroxylase antibody-labeled dopaminergic neurons in the teleost posterior tuberculum decreased in the zebrafish brain. According to a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of the brain, exposure to fenpropathrin resulted in a decrease in the messenger (m)RNA expression of monoamine oxidase (mao), an enzyme that facilitates the deamination of dopamine. In contrast, the mRNA expression of the sncga gene, which may trigger Parkinson's disease, was found to have increased. There were no changes observed in expressions of genes related to antioxidants and apoptosis between the control and fenpropathrin-exposed groups. We provide evidence to demonstrate the defect of the neurotoxicity of fenpropathrin toward dopaminergic neurons in adult zebrafish.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106756,Fenpropathrin;Locomotion;Zebrafish;Dopaminergic neurons;MONOAMINE-OXIDASE;INSECTICIDES;CALIFORNIA;DOPAMINE;TOXICITY;WATER;PESTICIDE;SEDIMENT;EXPOSURE;VALLEY;Social Behavior,NA,NA

Four adult males and two ovulated females were placed in the aquarium together with eight mature male parr. Four of the parr were exposed during the previous 4 days to two concentrations (0.1 or 1.0 mu g l(-1)) of the pyrethroid pesticide cypermethrin (a disrupter of olfactory receptor function) and four of the parr to the solvent ethanol. The behaviour of all fish was followed for 24 h and then blood and milt was collected. Exposure to the higher concentration of cypermethrin disturbed the reproductive behaviour of the parr. They displayed fewer courting events, spent less time near the nesting females and had lower volumes of strippable milt. They also had significantly lower amounts of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) in the blood plasma than the control roup. The higher cypermethrin group also had significantly lower levels of all these variables than the 9 lower cypermethrin group, apart from strippable milt that showed no significant differences between two groups. No significant differences in non-reproductive behaviours were observed between any of the groups. In the control fish, there were significant positive Correlations between (a) the number of courting events and the amount of time spent near the female, (b) blood plasma levels of 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta-P) and time spent near the female and (c) plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P and the number of courting events. Further, in control fish, higher plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P were observed in part-interacting with a female compared to those with no female contacts. A priming experiment confirmed a previous study that cypermethrin damages olfactory reception. Parr exposed to cypermethrin had significantly lower blood plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P and 11-KT than control males after exposure to ovarian fluid and urine (known to contain reproductive priming pheromones). When ethanol-exposed males were exposed to ovarian fluid and urine they had significantly higher plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P compared to those exposed to water only. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Thirty-day laboratory chronic studies were conducted to determine the relative sensitivity of standard (e.g. survival and growth) and non-standard behavioral (e.g. swimming capacity, feeding efficiency, and aggression) endpoints in predicting concentrations of fonofos protective of bluegill growth and survival. The lowest observable effect concentration (LOECs) for the standard measures of survival and growth was 5.6 mu g/L. Two behavioral endpoints were of similar sensitivity to the standard measures: swimming capacity, LOEC of 5.6 mu g/L; and prey strike frequency, LOEC of 5.6 mu g/L. However, aggressive interactions were ten-fold more sensitive than swimming or feeding behavior with a LOEC occurring at 0.6 mu g/L. Lab results were compared to an aquatic mesocosm study which exposed adult and juvenile bluegill to a 9.41 mu g/L concentration of fonofos. The dissipation half-life of fonofos was 5 days in 0.1 hectare aquatic mesocosms. Significant mortality among caged bluegill occurred within 4 days of exposure at 9.41 mu g/L. However, the 9.41 mu g/L concentration of fonofos had no statistically significant effects on survival, growth, reproduction, or total biomass of free-ranging populations of bluegill. We conclude from these studies that laboratory data can accurately estimate concentrations that are Lethal in the field and that the use of behavioral endpoints can provide ecologically relevant, yet conservative estimates of concentrations that are protective of field populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""}",10.1520/STP15817S     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),bluegill;fonofos;insecticide;behavior;sublethal toxicity;mesocosm;ORGANOPHOSPHATE INSECTICIDE;TOXICITY TESTS;RESPONSES;EXPOSURES;HAZARD;FIELD;Endpoint Determination,NA,NA

These compounds have household and agricultural applications with different formulations. Two important compounds used as household insecticides are prallethrin and transfluthrin, both from the pyrethroid chemical group. With the mode of action centered on sodium channels, pyrethroids keep the ionic sodium channels open for a long time causing the death of the insect by nervous hyperexcitability. Given the increased use of household insecticides by humans and the incidence of disease outbreaks with unknown etiology such as autism spectrum disease, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease we investigate some physiological inputs of these compounds on zebrafish. In this study, we evaluated the social interaction, shoaling formation, and anxiety-like behavior of zebrafish exposed chronically to trans- fluthrin-and prallthrin-based insecticides (T-BI and P-BI). In addition, we quantified the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in different brain regions. We observed that both compounds caused anxiolytic behavior and reduced shoaling formation and social interaction. Their behavioral biomarkers indicated a harmful ecological effect on the specie as well as a possible impact of these compounds on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZP). In addition, the AChE activity would change its activity in different brain regions modulating the anxiety-like behavior and social behavior in zebrafish.

The median lethal concentration (96 h-LC50) was determined, and the effects of a sublethal concentration on oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated in the liver, gills, white muscle, and heart. During the acute toxicity test, fish mortality progressively increased with RT concentration along with behavioral abnormalities were detected. The calculated 96 h-LC50 value of RT was found as 1.21 mg/L. Fish exposed to 0.5 mg/L of RT (40% of 96 h-LC50) showed a significant increase in the hepatic somatic index (HSI) with a concomitant decrease in Fulton’s condition factor (K). The sublethal exposure also induced significant increases (p < 0.05) in the hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, reduced glutathione (GSH) content, and catalase (CAT) activity, with a concomitant decrease in the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. In the gills, RT exposure induced significant increases in the GST activity, GSH and LPO levels, whereas CAT activity was inhibited. RT also induced CAT and GST activities together with the content of GSH and LPO levels in the white muscle. On the other hand, significant decreases in the CAT and GST activities were detected in the heart with a marked increase in the GSH content and no changes in LPO levels. Therefore, the exposure to 0.5 mg/L of RT induced oxidative stress in the liver, gills and white muscle with tissue-specific responses related to antioxidant defenses.

Therefore, based on the previously reported beneficial functions of the L1 cell adhesion molecule, we hypothesized that L1 mimetic compounds may serve to neutralize neurotoxicity triggered by the pesticide paraquat (PQ). In this study, we attempt to use PQ for inducing PD-like pathology and the L1 mimetic compounds phenelzine sulfate (PS) and tacrine (TC) as potential candidates for the amelioration of PD symptoms using zebrafish as a model system. Administration of PQ together with the L1 mimetic compounds PS or TC (250 nM) improved survival of zebrafish larvae, protected them from locomotor deficits, and increased their sensorimotor reflexes. Moreover, application of PQ together with PS (500 nM) or TC (1000 nM) in adult zebrafish counteracted PQ-induced toxicity, maintaining normal locomotor functions and spatial memory in an open field and T-maze task, respectively. Both L1 mimetic compounds prevented reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine levels, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, protected against impairment of mitochondrial viability, improved the antioxidant enzyme system, and prevented a decrease in ATP levels. Altogether, our findings highlight the beneficial functions of the agonistic L1 mimetics PS and TC by improving several vital cell functions against PQ-triggered neurotoxicity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  141 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Aneesh""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: unsure on life stage and behaviours",10.3389/fnins.2020.00458     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),pesticide;paraquat;zebrafish;Parkinson's disease-like pathology;L1 cell adhesion molecule;phenelzine sulfate;tacrine;OXYGEN SPECIES PRODUCTION;SPINAL-CORD REGENERATION;PARKINSONS-DISEASE;OXIDATIVE STRESS;MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION;RECOGNITION MOLECULES;ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN;RAT-BRAIN;IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY;FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY;Pesticides,NA,NA

In mammals, it inhibits monoamine uptake through binding to the dopamine transporter, with a mechanism of action similar to cocaine, resulting in higher levels of dopamine at the synapse. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in a broad spectrum of processes such as locomotion, cognition, reward, and mental disorders. In this work we have studied, for the first time, the effects of TDF on behavior of both larval and adult zebrafish and its connection with changes in the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We evaluated the acute exposure of 5 dpf larvae to different concentrations of TDF, ranging from 5 mg/L to 35 mg/L. The lowest concentration does not alter neither locomotor activity nor dopamine levels but produced changes in the expression of two genes, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine transporter (dat). Besides, it induced a reduction in extracellular serotonin and had an anxiolytic-like effect, supported by a decrease in cortisol production. On the other hand, a high concentration of TDF produced a dose-dependent reduction in locomotion, which was reversed or enhanced by D1 (SCH-23390) or D2 (Haloperidol) dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively. Using in vivo electrochemistry, we show that these changes could be associated with higher levels of dopamine in the brain. Thus, in adult zebrafish, though not in larvae, TDF exposure increases locomotor activity, anxiety and aggressiveness, which coincides with the behaviors observed in mammals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: seems to be larvae exposure and adult behaviour but unsure",10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.12.012     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Triadimefon;Dopamine;Serotonin;Zebrafish;Behavior;TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE;DOWN-REGULATION;LARVAL;THIGMOTAXIS;MODULATION;LOCOMOTION;FUNGICIDES;PATTERNS;RELEASE;NEURONS,NA,NA

The agricultural workers were exposed to high concentrations of these pesticides due to unsafe work practices, and also the individual exposed to these pesticides shows alterations in their neurobehavioral. The present study aimed to evaluate the toxic effects of Monocrotophos on the locomotor activity, antioxidant activity, lipid peroxidation, and expression of genes related to apoptosis using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model. The neurotoxic effects of sub-lethal concentration of the Monocrotophos on fish were evaluated. The locomotor activity of the fishes was determined, followed by an antioxidant activity, and lipid peroxidation assays were performed. The expression of genes related to apoptosis in the brain was also determined by qPCR. The Lethal Concentration for 96 hrs. was estimated to be 36.5 mg/L. When exposed to sub-lethal concentration, marked changes were observed in locomotor activity (distance traveled, swimming speed and meandering), acetylcholinesterase activity, oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxidation) and antioxidant defenses in the brain. Expression of apoptotic genes determined by qPCR revealed an increase in Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 expressions. Data from this study suggest that Monocrotophos based pesticides induce cellular toxicity, and has the potential to alter the behavior and health.

The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 μg/L of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: S.N.

The selective mode of action of diflubenzuron provided us with a unique tool for examining the indirect responses of an experimental aquatic ecosystem following direct impacts at the primary consumer (invertebrate) trophic level. Twelve outdoor aquatic mesocosms (0.1 ha each) were randomly assigned to three treatments of diflubenzuron (four mesocosms/treatment): control, monthly (five total 10-mu g/L applications), or biweekly (twice monthly; nine total 10-mu g/L applications). Direct impacts on invertebrates (numbers and species composition of insects and zooplankton) and indirect impacts on fish (mortality, growth, and reproduction of bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass), phytoplankton (biomass and productivity), and water quality were measured over 16 weeks posttreatment. Both monthly and biweekly treatments of diflubenzuron decreased total numbers (fivefold reduction) and species richness (twofold reduction) and increased dominance (twofold increase) of zooplankton within 4 weeks posttreatment; Cladocerans, Copepods, and Rotifers were all sensitive. Diflubenzuron reduced species richness of emergent insects, which resulted in increased dominance by a few species; however, impacts on emergent insects were confounded by a treatment x time interaction. Direct reductions in invertebrate grazers caused indirect increases in algal biomass. Indirect effects on biomass (50% reduction) and individual weight (50% reduction) of juvenile bluegill occurred because of apparent decreases in invertebrate food resources. No statistically significant impacts were observed on adult bluegill or largemouth bass for the duration of the experiment.

The acute toxicity study revealed that the 96-h LC50 of BF is 6.81 mu g/L, and varying degrees of behavioral changes were recorded in a dose-dependent manner. The subchronic study revealed reduction of dissolved oxygen and increased ammonia in aquaria of BF-exposed fish. Clinical signs revealed high degree of discomfort and aggressiveness together with reductions in survival rate and body weight gain. The levels of monoamines in brain, and GABA and amino acids in serum were reduced, together with decreased activities of Na+/K+-ATPase and acetylcholine esterases (AchE). The activities of antioxidant enzymes were also diminshed in the brain while oxdative damage and DNA breaks were elevated. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in serum increased with overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain tissue. BF also upregulated the expression of brain-stress related genes HSP70, Caspase-3 and P53. Supplemention of PEO to BF markedly abrogated the toxic impacts of the insecticide, specially at the high level. These findings demonstrate neuroprotective, antioxidant, genoprotective, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptic effects of PEO in BF-intoxicated fish.

Both compounds are nonionic surfactants produced by the alkoxylation of ethylene oxide with tallow amine, and they are used in variety of industries such as textiles, paints, metal working, agriculture, and polish manufacture. Fish were exposed to six concentrations of TA15 (0.2–4.0 mg/L) or TH30 (8–140 mg/L) for 96 h. The LC50 for TA15 was 2.08 mg/L and for TH30 47.32 mg/L. The main clinical signs observed in fish exposed to 4 mg/L of TA15 and 32 to 140 mg/L of TH30, were lethargy, loss of shoaling behavior, respiratory distress, changes in swimming pattern, such as, loss of balance and abnormal buoyancy, prolapse of the lower lip and superior location in the water column. The highest concentrations of these compounds induced nervous signs and collapse. The relevant macroscopic lesions were skin and fins erosions with necrotic lysis of the caudal peduncle. In addition, hemorrhages in mouth, branchial arches, and petechial hemorrhages in skin were observed. An increased fluid in the celomic cavity and meningeal hemorrhages were also evident. Organs as gills, liver, brain, and anterior kidney presented severe lesions at the highest concentrations of each compound. For the first time, it is reported lesions in interrenal tissues and choroidal bodies, as well as severe telencephalic lesions associated with the POEA toxicity. These last lesions were more severe in fish exposed to TA15 than to TH30, although the pattern of injuries was similar with both substances. According to the Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemical (GHS) by the United Nations, we reported that TA15 is classified as Acute Category 2 and TH30 is Acute Category 3 for white cachama.

In this study, we tested the effects of two reference toxicants, copper (Cu) and the pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate [(S)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylbutyrate], on lethal (mortality) and sublethal endpoints (growth, swimming behavior, transcription levels of stress response genes) in juvenile (81-90-day-old) striped bass (Morone saxatilis). We established cellular stress response markers for proteotoxicity (HSP70, HSP90), phase I detoxification mechanism (CYP1A1), metal-binding (metallothionein), as well as immune-function and pathogen-defense (TGF-beta, Mx-protein, nRAMP). Quantitative real-time TaqMan (R) PCR was used to examine tissue-specific changes in the transcriptome of liver, spleen, white muscle, anterior kidney and gills after 7-day Cu exposures and 24-h esfenvalerate exposures. On the transcriptome level, exposure to Cu showed strongest effects on the transcription of metallothionein in spleen tissue, causing a 4-fold increase of mRNA at 42 ppb total Cu and a 10-fold increase at 160 ppb Cu. Exposure to Cu also caused significant tissue-specific changes in gene transcription for immune-system related genes. Esfenvalerate exposure had tissue-specific effects on the transcription of HSP70, HSP90 and CYP1A1. The most significant effects were detected in liver tissue after exposure to 0.64 mu g/L esfenvalerate.        Our results show that the stress response at the transcriptome level is a more sensitive indicator for Cu and esfenvalerate exposures at low concentrations than swimming behavior, growth or mortality. The accuracy of studies on quantitative changes in the transcriptome can benefit from an initial evaluation or the inclusion of several different tissues and the use of multiple housekeeping genes.

The physiological and biochemical responses of juvenile Nile tilapia were studied after 96 hours of exposure to TCF. The experiment was conducted randomly with two treatments: control and TCF (0.5 mg L-1). No mortality or changes in hematological profile were recorded for the fish. On the other hand, we found that TCF exposure caused behavioral, metabolic and hormonal changes that modified the response patterns of the immune and enzymatic defense system in muscle and liver tissues. Increased plasma cortisol and glucose combined with the reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle and liver tissue after 96-h of TCF exposure indicates chemical stress. In response to this harmful situation, we observed changes in the immune system that lead to an increased number of leukocytes, thrombocytes, monocytes, lysozyme and leukocyte respiratory burst activity. Furthermore, we associate the increased activity of glutathione-S-transferase in liver tissue as a strategy fish use to combat the effects of TCF. Thus, we conclude that TCF affects the physiologic parameters of Nile tilapia, which can generate irreversible situations of recovery of the clinical condition. Such fact highlights the need to search for new compounds that could replace TCF, that have no or few adverse effects on fish species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Aneesh""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: unclear on behaviours measured",10.22034/IAR.2020.1904943.1071     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Aquaculture;Toxicology;Chemotherapy;Trichlorfon;LEUKOCYTES RESPIRATORY BURST;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;OXIDATIVE STRESS;INNATE IMMUNITY;COMMON CARP;FISH;DIAZINON;GLUTATHIONE;LYSOZYME;AQUACULTURE,NA,NA

Therefore, it is of great practical importance to evaluate the combined toxic effects of pesticides. In this study, the mixture acute toxicities of fenvalerate with tebuconazole on zebrafish larvae and adults were investigated. The effects of mixture toxicity on swimming behavior of larvae were also analyzed. The mixture acute toxicity of the systems showed antagonistic effects on adult zebrafish when the mixing ratios of fenvalerate and tebuconazole were equal, but the other two ratios of the mixes both showed synergistic effects. The strongest synergistic effect was observed when fenvalerate was mixed with tebuconazole in the ratio of 8:2. The swimming behavior of zebrafish larvae was significantly inhibited after exposure to single or mixed systems for 2 days. However, significant up-regulation of behavioral indicators in zebrafish larvae was observed at the beginning of exposure in the mixture exposure groups. The results showed that fenvalerate and tebuconazole had the risk of synergistic toxic effect on zebrafish.

The effects of different concentrations of the antifoulant Mexel®432 (0.5, 1 and 2 mg L-1) on osmoregulation (osmolality and Na+/K+-ATPase activity) and stress parameters (cortisol, glucose, and lactate) were assessed in juveniles of the flatfish Solea senegalensis. Gill histopathology and alterations due to oxidative stress (increased lipid peroxidation, LPO, levels) at branchial and hepatic levels were also considered. Other parameters tested were the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, CAT; glutathione peroxidase, GPX; and glutathione reductase, GR), xenobiotic metabolism defenses involved in detoxification (carboxylesterase, CbE; 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, EROD; and glutathione S-transferase, GST) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Significant variations in osmoregulatory parameters, histological lesions and decreased branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity were observed in exposed fish. Other gill biomarkers presented little or no significant variations in relation to controls. In contrast, hepatic parameters, such as CAT activity, were inhibited while EROD activity was initially elevated but after longer exposures it recovered basal values. These results suggested that under our experimental protocol exists toxic associated to Mexel®432 exposures. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which dieldrin and p,p′-DDE cause endocrine disruption in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), fish were exposed subchronically through the diet to both contaminants. Following 120 days of exposure, p,p′-DDE decreased estradiol in females, but increased 11-ketotestosterone in both sexes. Dieldrin on the other hand, decreased estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone in both sexes. Both pesticides also altered steady state mRNA expression levels of a set of genes chosen to represent three possible mechanisms of endocrine disruption: (1) direct interaction with soluble sex steroid receptors, (2) biosynthesis of endogenous sex hormones, and (3) metabolism of endogenous hormones. p,p′-DDE acted as a weak estrogen, increasing the expression of vitellogenin and estrogen receptor α in the liver. p,p′-DDE also altered the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of endogenous hormones as well as their metabolism. Dieldrin, on the other hand, only altered expression of vitellogenin and not estrogen receptor α. Dieldrin also altered the expression of genes involved in hormone synthesis and metabolism, and it dramatically lowered plasma hormone levels. Both pesticides targeted expression of genes involved in all three modes of action, suggesting that they each have multiple modes of action. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Male and female guppy with proven fertility were selected from our own colony and the groups of fish (n = 72/group) were exposed to pre-determined chlorpyrifos concentrations (0.002 μg/l, 2 μg/l) based on the 96-h LC50 for guppy. Mating behavior of males was recorded on the 2nd day of exposure. Offspring were counted and survival recorded on the 14th day. Gonopodial thrusts (8/15 min) in 0.002 μg/l and (4/15 min) in 2 μg/l were significantly different from the control group (11/15 min). Similarly, live birth reduced significantly to 8/female in 2 μg/l compared to 27/female in the control group. Survival of offspring after 14 days was reduced to 47% in the 2 μg/l group compared to 94% of survival in the control. Our findings demonstrate that low soluble concentrations of chlorpyrifos affect mating behavior, number of offspring and offspring survival of guppy. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

By collecting and counting the number of sperm released during separate mating events we observed that gametes are released asynchronously. Sperms are released in the form of sperm trails laid on the nest surface; subsequently active spermatozoa leave the trails and move in the water for several minutes. Sperm trails consist of bands of viscous material in which sperm are embedded. The water samples for the estimation of sperm presence were collected gradually within 180min after 24h, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months of exposure. It was established that the reductions in count, activity of sperm, and average life span of sperm trails were significant (P<0.05) at the tested concentrations, 5 and 50μg/L after 1 month and 2 weeks of exposure to each chemical tested and to their mixture, respectively. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that DDT and A54 could react synergically and increase the alteration in sperm release and activity as well as the life span of their trails. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.
