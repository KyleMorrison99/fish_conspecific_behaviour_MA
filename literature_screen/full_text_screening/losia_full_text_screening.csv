The 96 h lethal concentration 50 was 97.47mg.L-1 (P < 0.05). In the gill, necrotic and proliferative lesions were detected. In the liver, congestion, degenerative foci, hyaline droplets and lipidic vacuolization of the hepatocytes were observed. In the stomach mild hyperplasia of mucous cells was detected, which was also observed in the skin. In this latter tissue, a large increase in the thickness of the epidermis with necrotic lesions, infiltration of leukocytes and melanin pigment were observed. In the brain, degenerative foci of neuronal bodies in the telencephalon associated with gliosis and infiltration of eosinophilic granule cells/mast cells were shown. In conclusion, gills, liver, skin and brain are susceptible to Roundup (R). Moreover, effects on the central nervous system could affect olfaction as well as individual and group behavior, the reproductive performance of the fish and hence have repercussions at the population level.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  29     Total Times Cited:  36     Cited Reference Count:  42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on life stage",10.1590/S0100-736X2008001100002     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Roundup (R);glyphosate;acute toxicity;histopathology;Piaractus brachypomus;TILAPIA OREOCHROMIS-NILOTICUS;CYPRINUS-CARPIO;GLYPHOSATE;FISH;GILLS;RESPONSES;CELLS,NA,NA

Although labeled ""safe"" by the chemical industry, doses tested by industry do not mimic chronic exposures to sublethal doses that organisms in the environment are exposed to over long periods of time. Given the widespread uses of and exposure to glyphosate, studies on developmental toxicity are needed. Here we utilize the zebrafish vertebrate model system to study early effects of glyphosate on the developing heart. Treatment by embryo soaking with 50 mu g/ml glyphosate starting at gastrulation results in structural abnormalities in the atrium and ventricle, irregular heart looping, situs inversus as well as decreased heartbeats by 48 h as determined by live imaging and immunohistochemistry. Vasculature in the body was also affected as determined using fli-1 transgenic embryos. To determine if the effects noted at 48 h post fertilization are due to early stage alterations in myocardial precursors, we also investigate cardiomyocyte development with a Mef2 antibody and by mef2ca in situ hybridization and find alterations in the Mef2/mef2ca staining patterns during early cardiac patterning stages. We conclude that glyphosate is developmentally toxic to the zebrafish heart. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigate the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate on the gut microbiota, neurotransmitter levels, and anxiety in zebrafish. Our findings demonstrate that glyphosate exposure leads to dysbiosis in the zebrafish gut, alterations in central and peripheral serotonin levels, increased dopamine levels in the brain, and notable changes in anxiety and social behavior. While the dysbiosis can be attributed to glyphosate's antimicrobial properties, the observed effects on neurotransmitter levels leading to the reported induction of oxidative stress in the brain indicate a novel and significant mode of action for glyphosate, namely the impairment of the microbiome-gut-axis. While further investigations are necessary to determine the relevance of this mechanism in humans, our findings shed light on the potential explanation for the contradictory reports on the safety of glyphosate for consumers. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: B.

We assessed the effects of acute and chronic imidacloprid exposure on the social behavior of adult zebrafish. We assembled simple apparatus to detect 2D locomotion: a single camera capture system and two specially designed water tanks. We then used the tracking and heat maps of the behavior trajectories of zebrafish subjected to sham and imidacloprid exposure and compared their social behavior. Furthermore, histomorphology and immunohistochemistry of their brain tissue sections were performed to clarify possible neurotoxicity due to imidacloprid exposure in our adult zebrafish. Our results showed that imidacloprid exposure significantly reduced the zebrafish’s swimming speed, distance traveled, acceleration, and deceleration. The longer the imidacloprid exposure, the more severe the locomotor behavior disability. Furthermore, imidacloprid exposure significantly reduced heterosexual attractive behavior between the different sexes, as well as defensive alert behavior among males. Our histomorphology and immunohistochemistry evidence showed imidacloprid exposure may lead to neuronal oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and damage in the telencephalon of adult zebrafish. Thus, we suggested that neonicotinoid imidacloprid exposure can damage the telencephalon neurons of adult zebrafish through oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis and then affect the social behavior of adult zebrafish. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: C.-H.

Concern has been raised against its potential detriment to aquatic ecosystems. It has been shown that exposure to azoxystrobin interfere with the locomotor behavior of zebrafish larvae. This study aims to investigate whether exposure to environmental levels of azoxystrobin (2 μg/L, 20 μg/L, and 200 μg/L) changes the behavior of male adult zebrafish. Herein, we evaluated behavioral response (locomotor, anxiety-like, and exploratory behaviors), histopathology, biochemical indicators, and gene expression in male adult zebrafish upon azoxystrobin exposure. The study showed that exposure to azoxystrobin for 42 days remarkably increased the locomotor ability of male zebrafish, resulted in anxiety-like behavior, and inhibited exploratory behavior. After treatment with 200 μg/L azoxystrobin, vasodilatation, and congestion were observed in male zebrafish brains. Exposure to 200 μg/L azoxystrobin notably elevated ROS level, MDA concentration, CAT activity, and AChE activity, while inhibiting SOD activity, GPx activity, ACh concentration, and DA concentration in male zebrafish brains. Moreover, the expression levels of genes related to the antioxidant, cholinergic, and dopaminergic systems were significantly changed. This suggests that azoxystrobin may interfere with the homeostasis of neurotransmitters by causing oxidative stress in male zebrafish brains, thus affecting the behavioral response of male zebrafish. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

At the neuroendocrine level, dopamine (DA) drives behavioral (locomotion, emotion, feeding, and social interactions, etc.) and reproductive functions of fish. In the current investigation, we examined effects of rotenone toxicity on neurobehavioral and reproductive functions in whole brain and in selected brain regions in an Indian freshwater catfish, locally known as gulsha (Mystus cavasius). After fish were exposed to water containing rotenone at 0, 2.5, 25, and 250 mu g/L for 2 days, significant reductions of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; a DA metabolite), and their ratio (DOPAC/DA) were observed in whole brain at 250 mg/L ambient concentrations of rotenone. When fish were treated with rotenone at 250 mg/L concentration for 2 days, there was a significant reduction of DA, DOPAC and DOPAC/DA in diencephalon, DA and DOPAC in pituitary, and only DA in the telencephalon, compared with control fish. In parallel, numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (THthorn) neurons declined significantly in the diencephalon and pituitary after rotenone treatment. Slowed, spontaneous movement and reduced feeding behavior were observed in rotenone-treated fish. Rotenone treatment resulted in a significantly higher gonadosomatic index with many mature vitellogenic oocytes in ovaries and lowered dopaminergic activity in these fish. These results indicate that rotenone influences neurobehavioral and reproductive functions through dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in gulsha brain. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this, the aim of this study was to examine the dose- and time-dependent effects of low- and high-dose pesticide mixture (metalachlor, linuron, isoproturon, tebucanazole, aclonifen, atrazine, pendimethalin, azinphos-methyl) and heat stress co-exposure (22°C control/32°C treatment for 4-week) on free-swimming behaviors and cumulative actionless time (CAT) of goldfish. Behavioral analysis showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in distance swam, as well as a subsequent increase in CAT. Vertical and horizontal spatial behavioral use were affected under heat and pesticides co-exposure conditions. In 3- and 4-week(s) exposure groups, horizontal spatial behavioral use demonstrated elevated time spent in the lower third of the aquarium. Similarly, during 3- and 4-week(s) exposure (32°C control and 32°C high doses) vertical spatial behavioral use was found to increase time spent in the outermost edges of the aquarium. In all treatment groups, the final condition factor (KM) showed significant attenuation when compared to the initial KM. However, there was an unclear relationship between heat/pesticide co-exposure and growth most notably in 32°C high-dose groups. In addition, the expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A mRNA was significantly higher in pesticide-exposed groups.

Since steroid hormone biosynthesis is regulated through neurotransmission of the central nervous system (CNS), studies were conducted to determine whether neurotransmitters that control hormone biosynthesis could be affected after diuron and diuron metabolites treatment. As the same neurotransmitters and steroid hormones regulate behavioral outcomes, aggression was also evaluated in male Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Male tilapias were exposed for 10 days to waterborne diuron and the metabolites 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA), 3,4-dichlorophenyl-N-methylurea (DCPMU), at nominal concentrations of 100 ng L-1. In contrast to Diuron, DCA and DCPMU significantly diminished plasma testosterone concentrations (39.4% and 36.8%, respectively) and reduced dopamine levels in the brain (47.1% and 44.2%, respectively). In addition, concentrations of the stress steroid, cortisol were increased after DCA (71.0%) and DCPMU (57.8-%) exposure. A significant decrease in aggressive behavior was also observed in animals treated with the metabolites DCA (50.9%) and DCPMU (68.8%). These results indicate that biotransformation of diuron to active metabolites alter signaling pathways of the CNS which may impact androgen and the stress response as well as behavior necessary for social dominance, growth, and reproduction.

Inversely, chemical exposure may decrease the capacity of organisms to respond to environmental changes. The aim of our study was to assess the individual and crossed effects of temperature rising and pesticide contamination on fish. Goldfish, Carassius auratus, were exposed during 96 h at two temperatures (22 and 32 A degrees C) to a mixture of common pesticides (S-metolachlor, isoproturon, linuron, atrazine-desethyl, aclonifen, pendimethalin, and tebuconazol) at two environmentally relevant concentrations (total concentrations MIX1 = 8.4 mu g L-1 and MIX2 = 42 mu g L-1). We investigated the sediment reworking behavior, which has a major ecological functional role. We also focused on three physiological traits from the cellular up to the whole individual level showing metabolic status of fish (protein concentration in liver and muscle, hepatosomatic index, and Fulton's condition factor). Individual thermal stress and low concentrations of pesticides decreased the sediment reworking activity of fish and entrained metabolic compensation with global depletion in energy stores. We found that combined chemical and thermal stresses impaired the capacity of fish to set up an efficient adaptive response. Our results strongly suggest that temperature will make fish more sensitive to water contamination by pesticides, raising concerns about wild fish conservation submitted to global changes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  31     Total Times Cited:  32     Cited Reference Count:  78 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on life stage,not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1007/s11356-015-5147-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Global change;Temperature warming;Pesticides;Fish;Bioturbation;EXPOSURE;STRESS,NA,NA

In adults, exposure to the pesticide did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a marked decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion, since baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at all conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish adults did not show their natural preference for the dark environment. The pesticide likely has anxiolytic effects on zebrafish, as well as a compromising effect on locomotor control, illustrating that behavioural changes, which could affect activities on the natural environment, such as escape and predation, may occur even in environmentally relevant concentrations of this pollutant.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1007/s10646-021-02497-0,Swimming behaviour;FET;Regent;Pesticide;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;JUVENILE ZEBRAFISH;TOXICITY;INSECTICIDE;BIOMARKERS;NEUROTOXICITY;CONTAMINANTS;PREFERENCE;NOTOCHORD;MIXTURE,NA,NA

At times, these applications tend to be more effective at the onset of fish spawning in spring: however, they can cause conflicts between anglers and lake management personnel assigned to control excessive SAV. We evaluated the direct application of an aquatic herbicide (Aquathol K [dipotassium salt of endothall]) on the nest behavior and fidelity of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and measured the subsequent reproductive success of these fish. Endothall was applied to achieve a shoreline concentration of 5 mg/L of water volume in 0.1-ha ponds (3 mg/L whole-pond concentration). It was applied directly on nests in three ponds in March 2005, 2006, and 2007 when largemouth bass initiated spawning; spawning activity was monitored over 14-15 d. Using similar techniques, we applied water to another three ponds where largemouth bass were nesting. For all 3 years, endothall did not affect nest guarding by largemouth bass, and nest fidelity was similar to that for ponds treated with water. Endothall concentrations declined about sevenfold over 21 d but persisted in the water during spawning. Electrofishing of young largemouth bass 2-3 months after spawning showed that their relative abundance and size were similar among the ponds treated with endothall and the control ponds. Similarly, the density and biomass of age-0 largemouth bass did not vary between treatments for fish killed with rotenone in late August each year. Managers can use these results to address angler concerns about endothall application during largemouth bass spawning and thereby lessen conflicts over efforts to control excessive SAV.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1577/M08-041.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),AQUATIC VEGETATION;LAKE SEMINOLE;POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS;ANGLER ATTITUDES;HYDRILLA;FISHERY;MANAGEMENT;HERBICIDES;REMOVAL;Reproductive Behavior,NA,NA

In this study, common carp were used to assess the individual and combined toxicity of PE-MPs (0, 1.5, or 4.5 mg/L) and GLY (0, 5, or 15 mg/L) on the brain-gut axis. After 60 days of exposure, the developmental toxicity, blood-brain barrier (BBB), locomotor behavior, intestinal barrier (physical barrier, chemical barrier, microbial barrier), and intestinal content metabolism of common carp were evaluated. Results showed that 15 mg/L of GLY exposure significantly reduced the mRNA expression of tight-junction genes (occludin, claudin-2, and ZO-1) in the brain, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was clearly inhibited by high concentrations of GLY. However, different concentrations of PE-MPs had no significant effect on the activity of AChE. Furthermore, the free-swimming behavior of common carp was distinctly inhibited by treatment with a combination of 15 mg/L GLY and 4.5 mg/L PE-MPs. Histological studies indicated that PE-MPs alone and in combination with GLY could disrupt the physical and chemical intestinal barriers of common carp. Additionally, the abundance and diversity of gut microbiota in common carp were significantly changed when exposed to a combination of PE-MPs and GLY. Metabolomics further revealed that PE-MPs combined with GLY triggered metabolic changes and that differential metabolites were related to amino acid and lipid metabolism. These findings illustrate that exposure to PE-MPs or GLY alone is toxic to fish and results in physiological changes to the brain-gut axis.

The goal of the present study was to assess the impacts of DMN toxicity on blood biochemistry, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, catalase (CAT) levels, behavior disorder, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, histopathology and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8 OHdG) of brown trout (Salmo trutta fario). Acute concentrations (1.0 and 2.0 mu g/L) of DMN caused behavioral disorder such as rapid swimming, loss of balance, aggressiveness and increasing in the surface activity and inactivity in brown trout. A significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and a significant decrease in CAT, AChE, blood albumin, and blood total protein content were observed. Histopathologically, both doses of DMN have caused steatosis, necrosis, and degeneration in hepatocytes and hyperemia in the liver. Also, they led to inflammation, adhesion and fusion depending on severe hyperplasia in secondary lamellae, hyperemia and lamellar edema in gill tissues when compared to control group. Additionally, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8 OHdG) levels at 2.0 mu g/L dose of DMN in liver tissues were more severe according to 1.0 mu g/L dose of DMN. Finally, different concentrations of DMN led to changes of the histopathology, 8 OHdG, the CAT levels, plasma AChE activity, and the serum metabolites, as well as behavioral disorder in brown trout.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  66 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1016/j.cbpc.2019.108606     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Brown trout;Deltamethrin;Oxidative stress;Behavioral;Histopathology and DNA damage;Blood biochemistry;OXIDATIVE STRESS BIOMARKERS;FRESH-WATER FISH;INDIAN MAJOR CARP;RAINBOW-TROUT;HISTOPATHOLOGICAL CHANGES;BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS;ACUTE TOXICITY;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;PYRETHROID INSECTICIDES;ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS,NA,NA

To address this, the aim of this study was to examine the dose- and time-dependent effects of low- and high-dose pesticide mixture (metalachlor, linuron, isoproturon, tebucanazole, aclonifen, atrazine, pendimethalin, azinphos-methyl) and heat stress co-exposure (22 degrees C control/32 degrees C treatment for 4-week) on free-swimming behaviors and cumulative actionless time (CAT) of goldfish. Behavioral analysis showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in distance swam, as well as a subsequent increase in CAT. Vertical and horizontal spatial behavioral use were affected under heat and pesticides co-exposure conditions. In 3- and 4-week(s) exposure groups, horizontal spatial behavioral use demonstrated elevated time spent in the lower third of the aquarium. Similarly, during 3- and 4-week(s) exposure (32 degrees C control and 32 degrees C high doses) vertical spatial behavioral use was found to increase time spent in the outermost edges of the aquarium. In all treatment groups, the final condition factor (KM) showed significant attenuation when compared to the initial KM. However, there was an unclear relationship between heat/pesticide co-exposure and growth most notably in 32 degrees C high-dose groups. In addition, the expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A mRNA was significantly higher in pesticide-exposed groups. Taken together, data demonstrated that co-exposure with low- or high-dose pesticide mixture and heat stress significantly impacted natural swimming patterns, which over time might result in the broader population and ecological effects.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  116 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no behaviour,not sure on behaviours assessed",10.1080/15287394.2023.2174463,Environmental pollutants;global warming;fish behavior;cytochrome P450 1A;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS;SUBLETHAL TOXICITY;WATER TEMPERATURE;GENE-EXPRESSION;CHRONIC STRESS;HEAT-STRESS;FISH;GROWTH;RESPONSES;ATRAZINE;Pesticides;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System,NA,NA

Animals acquire new skills due to conditioned responses resulting from a sequence of neutral and unconditioned stimuli affecting their bodies; there is a constant time interval between the stimuli. Both stimuli become associated after a number of repetitions and animal bodies start to respond to the initially neutral stimulus as to the unconditioned one. The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure of fish to a pyrethroid-deltamethrin (an active ingredient in Decis 2.5 EC pesticide that disturbs the proper operation of the nervous system) affects the ability to learn in common carp.        Materials and Methods. Production of new types of behaviour was triggered in fish by using the unconditioned stimulus (an irritating electric impulse) and the conditioned stimulus (light). The experiment was performed in a tank divided into two compartments where fish could swim freely from one compartment to another. The ability to learn was assessed on the basis of the following types of behaviour evoked in response to the conditioned stimulus: locomotor agitation, preference to occupy or avoid certain areas in the tank, an escape response, etc.        Results. In fish exposed to 0.35 mu g . L-1 deltamethrin (for common carp concentration 10 times lower than lethal) for 35 min the ability to produce and remember the conditioned defence response was reduced and time interval since presenting the conditioned stimulus till occurring the initial signs of the conditioned response was prolonged.        Conclusion. The classical conditioning method revealed that sublethal concentration of deltamethrin restricted ability to learn and retain information in common carp, despite absence of observable intoxication symptoms.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3750/AIP2010.40.2.07     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),common carp;deltamethrin;learning and memory processes;INTERMEDIATE-TERM-MEMORY;LAKE-BALATON;DELTAMETHRIN;AVOIDANCE;GOLDFISH;CONSOLIDATION;TRANSCRIPTION;FIXATION;SENSITIZATION;INVOLVEMENT;Pesticides,NA,NA

Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a Parkinson's disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochondria. Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination with different potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT-2.5 mu g/L, valproic acid (VPA)-0.5 mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)-250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics (PROBIO)-3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti-social profile and mirror tests and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a) CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views, this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05). Four out of eight studied groups-(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA-displayed an impaired, often antithetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.0005). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT + PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the above groups (p > 0.05). Except for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a normalized trend in terms of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental groups exhibited exacerbated levels of aggression (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001) not only near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001). Conclusions: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement compared with (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT-treated zebrafish (e-h). Independently of the aggressive-like reactions and fluctuations among the testing day(s) and groups, ROT disrupted the social behavior, while VPA promoted a specific typology in contrast with LEV/CARB.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  43 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Included""}",10.3390/brainsci12070898     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anti-social;aggressivity;counterclockwise rotation;zebrafish;Danio rerio;Parkinson's disease;rotenone;VALPROIC ACID;TOXICITY;DEFICITS;STRESS;Parkinson Disease;Chronic Disease,NA,NA

Juveniles stage of C. gariepinus were used for the toxicity study. Lethal concentration of 50% mortality of sample (LC50) was determined using semi-static method. From the result of the LC50 determination lower concentrations of endosulfan were prepared for sub-lethal test. Ten fish per test concentration in three replicates were exposed to varying concentrations of endosulfan (0.00, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075 and 0.01) mu g/L. Signs of stress and mortality were monitored during the experimental duration. Cortisol levels, GST and AChE activities were measured spectrophotometrically. No visible changes in behaviour and appearance were observed in the treated fishes and no mortality recorded. Significant (p < 0.05) declined in cortisol secretion was observed and the change in the concentration was dose and time dependent. Glutathione S-transferase activity was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the control and the concentrations increase with increased in concentration and exposure duration. No clear trend was observed in acetylcholinesterase activity. The findings showed that the cortisol levels and GST activity of test organism were affected by the test chemical and therefore could be considered as a suitable marker to evaluate the effect of organochlorine pesticide on fish and other aquatic organisms.

A variety of illnesses are initiated or aided by the presence of certain perturbing factors. In the case of autism spectrum disorder, the environmental component plays an important part in determining the overall picture. Moreover, the lack of therapies to relieve existing symptoms complicates the fight against this condition. As a result, animal models have been used to make biomedical research easier and more suited for disease investigations. The current study used zebrafish as an animal model to mimic a real-life scenario: acute exposure to an increased dose of pesticides, followed by prospective intervention-based therapy with vitamin B-12 (vit. B-12). It is known that vit. B-12 is involved in brain function nerve tissue, and red blood cell formation. Aside from this, the role of vit. B-12 in the redox processes is recognized for its help against free radicals. To investigate the effect of vit. B-12, fish were divided into four different groups and exposed to a pesticide mixture (600 mu g L-1 fipronil + 600 mu g L-1 pyriproxyfen) and 0.24 mu g L-1 vit. B-12 for 14 days. The impact of the compounds was assessed daily with EthoVision XT 11.5 software for behavioral observations, especially for sociability, quantified by the social interaction test. In addition, at the end of the study, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. The results showed significant improvements in locomotor activity parameters and a positive influence of the vitamin on sociability. Regarding the state of oxidative stress, high activity was found for SOD and GPx in the case of vit. B-12, while fish exposed to the mixture of pesticides and vit. B-12 had a lower level of MDA. In conclusion, the study provides new data about the effect of vit. B-12 in zebrafish, highlighting the potential use of vitamin supplementation to maintain and support the function of the organism.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  95 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Maybe"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not sure on life stage",10.3390/ani14030405     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Danio rerio;behavior;autism spectrum disorder;pesticide;vitamin B-12;oxidative stress;AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER;OXIDATIVE STRESS;FEEDING PROBLEMS;GENE-EXPRESSION;FIPRONIL;CHILDREN;DEFICIENCY;DYSFUNCTION;EXPOSURE;MODELS;Pesticides;Vitamin D;Vitamin U;Riboflavin;Vitamin A;Biotin;Folic Acid;Vitamin B Complex;Vitamin E;Vitamins;Intervention Studies;Arachidonic Acid;Ascorbic Acid;Tocopherols,NA,NA

Nests were sprayed to achieve a nominal concentration of 4 mg/L of either a dipotassium salt of endothall (Aquathol-K(R)), a dimethylamine salt of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), or water (control). No significant differences in rates of nest abandonment existed among the three treatments (p > 0.10). Abandonment averaged 5.17 min for both species and herbicide treatments, whereas the herbicides persisted in the water column for at least 45 min. When abandonment occurred, congeners nearly always intruded on the nest to feed on eggs or fry. After spraying, the adjusted mean frequency of rim circling, fanning, and agonistic behaviors exhibited by bluegills guarding eggs did not differ among the three treatments (p greater-than-or-equal-to 0.35). These results suggest the two herbicides will not elicit pronounced shifts in reproductive behavior of sunfish when they are properly applied.

At present, very little is known about the effects of azoxystrobin on courtship and aggressive behavior and the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, after exposing adult male and female zebrafish to worst-case scenario concentrations of azoxystrobin (0, 2 μg/L, 20 μg/L, and 200 μg/L) for 42 d, we observed a decrease in courtship behavior and an increase in aggressive behavior in both male and female zebrafish. In addition, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the behavioral effects of azoxystrobin, we quantified the changes in the concentrations of kisspeptin, 5-HT, GnIH, and their corresponding receptor mRNA expression in the brain. The results showed that 200 μg/L azoxystrobin decreased the concentrations of kisspeptin and increased the concentration of GnIH in both male and female zebrafish brain. In addition, azoxystrobin also significantly reduced 5-HT concentration in female zebrafish brain. Further investigation revealed that altered courtship and aggressive behavior were associated with the expression levels of genes (kiss1, kiss2, gnrh3, gnrhr3, 5ht1a, and 5ht2a) involved in kisspeptin-GnIH signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study suggested that azoxystrobin may impair courtship and aggressive behavior in zebrafish by interfering with the kisspeptin-GnIH signaling pathway, which may have more profound effects on natural zebrafish populations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: L.

ATZ is one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and a known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). The behavior of sailfin mollies is well documented in the scientific literature. Moreover, they are ecologically important indicators of environmental health, widely distributed among the mangroves along the Gulf Coast of the Southeastern US where significant amounts of ATZ are introduced via runoff and storm water drainage from coastal households, businesses, and farms. Four sets of experiments designed to assess ATZ's impact on various aspects of male and female reproductive behavior, aggression, anxiety, and boldness were conducted following 12 weeks of exposure to 1 or 15 ppb water-borne ATZ, along with a no-exposure control group. Results indicated that the behavior of ATZ-exposed individuals differed from those of controls: ATZ exposure affected which stimulus fish (a male vs. a female) subject females preferred to associate with while also affecting female strength of preference for males of larger body size and their sexual receptivity to conspecific males in general. ATZ-exposed males also showed reduced overall responsiveness to conspecific stimuli and directed significantly less aggression toward their mirror image compared with controls. Finally, ATZ exposure affected multiple aspects of male and female behavior that are often used as proxies for boldness and anxiety. Overall, ATZ exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behaviors attributed to sexual receptivity, mate choice and motivation to mate, aggression, as well as boldness and anxiety. These ATZ-induced behavioral changes may adversely affect the long-term health of natural populations exposed to similar, environmentally realistic concentrations and add to a growing body of empirical data demonstrating substantial fitness consequences of exposure to sublethal concentrations of this known EDC.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  122 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Included"", ""Kyle ""=>""Included""}",10.3390/w15020306     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioral toxicity;contaminants of emerging concern;reproductive behavior;aggression;anxiety;endocrine disrupting chemicals;Florida Gulf Coast;ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING CHEMICALS;LATERAL PROJECTION AREA;SHORT-TERM EXPOSURE;FEMALE PREFERENCE;BODY-SIZE;TESTOSTERONE PRODUCTION;PREDATION RISK;NONREPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR;MONOAMINERGIC SYSTEMS;AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR,NA,NA
