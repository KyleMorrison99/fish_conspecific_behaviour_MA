These functions are often disturbed by anthropogenic influences, such as urbanization and habitat fragmentation, yet the effects of long-term exposures to environmental contaminants on movement have yet to be examined. The long lifespans and broad diets of crocodilians often lead to bioaccumulation of persistent contaminants and confer a marked vulnerability to consequent physiological effects. In this study, we investigate the relationships between blood concentrations of mercury (Hg), a widespread contaminant with well characterized neurotoxicity, and movement patterns in free living, naturally exposed American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). We sampled adult male alligators from two former nuclear cooling reservoirs with different Hg contamination histories and placed GPS transmitters on a subset of individuals from each reservoir (13 total). Data collected over the ensuing two years were analyzed using a linear mixed effects framework combined with AICc model selection to resolve the relationships linking seasonal alligator movement (daily activity (s) and daily distance (m)) and home range to climate conditions, individual traits, and blood Hg concentrations (mg/kg; wet weight). We found that climate conditions, alligator size (snout-vent-length), and blood Hg concentrations all influence alligator daily activity but do not contribute to alligator daily movement (distance). Furthermore, we found that blood Hg concentrations were strongly correlated with seasonal home range size where individuals with elevated Hg had larger home ranges in spring, fall, and winter. These findings provide insight into how climate, anthropogenic contaminants, and individual traits relate to alligator movement patterns across seasons. © 2024 The Authors",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170859,,38365032,NA,association of size climatic factors and mercury body burdens with movement behavior in american alligators

Among these additives, N-butyl benzenesulfonamide (NBBS) and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) are under international watchlist for evaluation, with limited studies on amphipods. Di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) are banned in some countries and categorised as substances of very high concern. This study aimed to investigate the effects of NBBS, TPHP, DEHP and DBP on the swimming activity of a coastal intertidal marine amphipod, Echinogammarus marinus. Furthermore, this study is the first to quantify startle response in E. marinus in response to light stimuli. Amphipods were exposed to 0, 0.5, 5, 50 and 500 μg/l concentrations of all test compounds. Swimming activity and startle responses were assessed by video tracking and analysis using an 8-min alternating dark and light protocol after exposure on days 7 and 14. We observed an overall compound and light effect on the swimming activity of E. marinus. A significant decrease in swimming distance was found in 500 μg/l NBBS and TPHP. We observed that the startle response in E. marinus had a latency period of >2 s and animals were assessed at 1 s and the sum of the first 5 s. There was a clear startle response in E. marinus during dark to light transition, evident with increased swimming distance. NBBS exposure significantly increased startle response at environmental concentrations, while significant effects were only seen in 500 μg/l TPHP at 5 s. We found no significant effects of DEHP and DBP on swimming behaviour at the concentrations assessed. The findings of this study affirm the necessity for a continuous review of plastic additives to combat adverse behavioural effects that may be transferable to the population levels. © 2024",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170793,Military Personnel,38336051,NA,the effects of plastic additives on swimming activity and startle response in marine amphipod echinogammarus marinus

Although the environmental levels of SSRIs like paroxetine (PAR) have risen, the knowledge regarding the effects of long-term exposure to PAR is limited. This study investigated the impact of sub-chronic exposure (21 days) to two sub-lethal concentrations of PAR (40 and 400 μg/L) on the behaviour of adult zebrafish in different scenarios: basal activity (under dark and light conditions), stress response (evoked by sudden light transitions) and stress response recovery. A new framework was employed for the integrative study of fish's swimming performance based on their innate ability to respond to light shifts. Several swimming-associated parameters (e.g., total swimming distance, time of inactivity, swimming angles) and thigmotaxis were monitored for an integrated analysis in each scenario. Data revealed reduced swimming activity, impaired behavioural response to stress and alterations in stress recovery of PAR-exposed fish. An anxiolytic effect was particularly noticeable in fish basal swimming activity in the dark at 400 μg/L and in the behavioural response to stress (from dark to light) and stress recovery (from light to dark) for organisms exposed to 40 μg/L. The detected PAR-induced behavioural modifications suggest a disruption of brain glucocorticoid signalling that may have implications at the individual level (e.g., changing behavioural responses to predators), with potential repercussions on the population and community levels. Therefore, the applied protocol proved sensitive in detecting behavioural changes induced by PAR. © 2024 The Authors",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170405,Paroxetine,38280602,NA,subchronic exposure to paroxetine disrupts ecologically relevant behaviours in fish

In this context, comparative biology considerations are applied with the goal of understanding human disease and guiding the development of effective and safe medicines. However, the widespread occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment and the need to assess the risk posed to wildlife have prompted a renewed interest in the extrapolation of pharmacological and toxicological data across the entire tree of life. To address this challenge, a biological “read-across” approach, based on the use of mammalian data to inform toxicity predictions in wildlife species, has been proposed as an effective way to streamline the environmental safety assessment of pharmaceuticals. Yet, how effective has this approach been, and are we any closer to being able to accurately predict environmental risk based on known human risk? We discuss the main theoretical and experimental advancements achieved in the last 10 years of research in this field. We propose that a better understanding of the functional conservation of drug targets across species and of the quantitative relationship between target modulation and adverse effects should be considered as future research priorities. This pharmacodynamic focus should be complemented with the application of higher-throughput experimental and computational approaches to accelerate the prediction of internal exposure dynamics. The translation of comparative (eco)toxicology research into real-world applications, however, relies on the (limited) availability of experts with the skill set needed to navigate the complexity of the problem; hence, we also call for synergistic multistakeholder efforts to support and strengthen comparative toxicology research and education at a global level.

Many chemicals, including most pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), are ionizable across environmentally relevant pH gradients, which can affect their fate in aquatic and terrestrial systems. Existing mathematical models describe the accumulation of neutral organic chemicals and weak acids and bases in both fish and plants. Further model development is hampered, however, by a lack of mechanistic insights for PPCPs that are predominantly or permanently ionized. Targeted experiments across environmentally realistic conditions are needed to address the following questions: (1) What are the partitioning and sorption behaviors of strongly ionizing chemicals among species? (2) How does membrane permeability of ions influence bioaccumulation of PPCPs? (3) To what extent are salts and associated complexes with PPCPs influencing bioaccumulation?

Wildlife species are more at risk to harmful exposures to the pesticides in their natural habitat through diet and several other means. Species at a higher tropic level in the food chain are more susceptible to the deleterious effects due to sequential biomagnifications of the pesticides/metabolites. Pesticides directly affect fitness of the species in the wild causing reproductive endocrine disruption impairing the hormones of the gonads and thyroid glands as reproduction is under the influence of cross regulations of these hormones. This review presents a comprehensive compilation of important literatures on the impact of the current use pesticides in disruption of both the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axes particularly in birds addressing impacts on the reproductive impairments and overall fitness. In addition to the epidemiological studies, laboratory investigations those provide supportive evidences of the probable mechanisms of disruption in the wild also have been incorporated in this review. To accurately predict the endocrine-disruption of the pesticides as well as to delineate the risk associated with potential cumulative effects, studies are to be more focused on the environmentally realistic exposure dose, mixture pesticide exposures and transgenerational effects. In addition, strategic screening/appropriate methodologies have to be developed to reveal the endocrine disruption potential of the contemporary use pesticides.

This study investigated the pharmaceutical burden in bonefish (Albula vulpes), an important recreational and artisanal fishery, to quantify pharmaceutical exposure throughout the Caribbean Basin. We sampled 74 bonefish from five regions, and analyzed them for 102 pharmaceuticals. We assessed the influence of sampling region on the number of pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical assemblage, and risk of pharmacological effects. To evaluate the risk of pharmacological effects at the scale of the individual, we proposed a metric based on the human therapeutic plasma concentration (HTPC), comparing measured concentrations to a threshold of 1/3 the HTPC for each pharmaceutical. Every bonefish had at least one pharmaceutical, with an average of 4.9 and a maximum of 16 pharmaceuticals in one individual. At least one pharmaceutical was detected in exceedance of the 1/3 HTPC threshold in 39% of bonefish, with an average of 0.6 and a maximum of 11 pharmaceuticals exceeding in a Key West individual. The number of pharmaceuticals (49 detected in total) differed across regions, but the risk of pharmacological effects did not (23 pharmaceuticals exceeded the 1/3 HTPC threshold). The most common pharmaceuticals were venlafaxine (43 bonefish), atenolol (36), naloxone (27), codeine (27), and trimethoprim (24). Findings suggest that pharmaceutical detections and concentration may be independent, emphasizing the need to monitor risk to biota regardless of exposure diversity, and to focus on risk quantified at the individual level. This study supports the widespread presence of pharmaceuticals in marine systems and shows the utility of applying the HTPC to assess the potential for pharmacological effects, and thus quantify impact of exposure at large spatial scales. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140949,Caribbean Region;Military Personnel,38096990,NA,understanding pharmaceutical exposure and the potential for effects in marine biota a survey of bonefish albula vulpes across the caribbean basin

Therefore the aim of this study is to assess the effects of the long-term application of fluoxetine on key components of aquatic ecosystems including macroinvertebrate-, zooplankton-, phytoplankton- and microbial communities and organic matter decomposition by using traditional and non-traditional assessment methods. For this, we exposed 18 outdoor mesocosms (water volume of 1530 L and 10 cm of sediment) to five different concentrations of fluoxetine (0.2, 2, 20 and 200 μg/L) for eight weeks, followed by an eight-week recovery period. We quantified population and community effects by morphological identification, environmental DNA metabarcoding, in vitro and in vivo bioassays and measured organic matter decomposition as a measure of ecosystem functioning. We found effects of fluoxetine on bacterial, algal, zooplankton and macroinvertebrate communities and decomposition rates, mainly for the highest (200 μg/L) treatment. Treatment-related decreases in abundances were found for damselfly larvae (NOEC of 0.2 μg/L) and Sphaeriidae bivalves (NOEC of 20 μg/L), whereas Asellus aquaticus increased in abundance (NOEC <0.2 μg/L). Fluoxetine decreased photosynthetic activity and primary production of the suspended algae community. eDNA assessment provided additional insights by revealing that the algae belonging to the class Cryptophyceae and certain cyanobacteria taxa were the most negatively responding taxa to fluoxetine. Our results, together with results of others, suggest that fluoxetine can alter community structure and ecosystem functioning and that some impacts of fluoxetine on certain taxa can already be observed at environmentally realistic concentrations. © 2023 The Authors",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140706,DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Biological Assay;Antidepressive Agents,37992907,NA,effects of antidepressant exposure on aquatic communities assessed by a combination of morphological identification functional measurements environmental dna metabarcoding and bioassays

However, due to the proximity of human activities along the coasts and open ocean, light is a pervasive yet commonly overlooked pollutant in many marine habitats. There is a well-developed body of literature on the visual physiology, behaviour and ecology of many marine taxa, and a re-evaluation of these data can help inform risks of light pollution to impact marine organisms and ecosystems. This paper identifies key knowledge gaps in the study of marine light pollution ecology and recommends research and management foci for future study. Most work on this pollutant has focused on terrestrial ecosystems and taxa, where experts have learned how anthropogenic light influences behaviour, reproduction cycles and population dynamics. However, light pollution bleeds far beyond the shores, affecting many sensitive ecosystems with light available at unnatural times with varied makeup, such as varying intensities or spectra. This review discusses the current understanding of light dynamics underwater, photoreceptive systems of marine taxa and the documented ecological impacts. This lends a critical basis of understanding for the many gaps in marine light pollution biology. For example, little is known about effects of light on broad groups of marine taxa such as cetaceans, ecosystem-level effects, or interactive impacts of light and other anthropogenic stressors. Light is a key structuring factor of the marine environment and can therefore elicit immense downstream effects on marine organisms individually, at the population- or ecosystem-level. Light pollution is an urgent concern for marine ecosystems because marine organisms have tight relationships with their natural light environment. As the world moves deeper into the Anthropocene, assessing and mitigating the risks of this pollutant to key environmental and economic marine systems is critical to maintaining a healthy ocean. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,10.1002/aqc.4011,Military Personnel,NA,NA,a synthesis of the risks of marine light pollution across organismal and ecological scales

Fish were exposed to fluoxetine (Prozac) for 2 years across multiple generations before their activity and stress-related behavior were repeatedly assayed. Using a Bayesian statistical approach that partitions the effects among and within individuals, we found that males - but not females - in fluoxetine-exposed populations differed less from each other in their behavior (lower behavioral individuality) than unexposed males. In sharp contrast, effects on behavioral plasticity were observed in females - but not in males - whereby exposure to even low levels of fluoxetine resulted in a substantial decrease (activity) and increase (freezing behavior) in the behavioral plasticity of females. Our evidence reveals that psychoactive pollution has sex-specific effects on the individual behavior of fish, suggesting that males and females might not be equally vulnerable to global pollutants. © 2023 The Author(s).",,10.1093/beheco/arad065,,NA,NA,sexspecific effects of psychoactive pollution on behavioral individuality and plasticity in fish

In the Peek-A-Boo test, we investigated the response of medaka to an image of a predator fish (donko fish, Odontobutis obscura). The test revealed that the time taken for test medaka exposed to diazepam (0.8, 4, 20, or 100 µg/L) to approach the image was shorter by a factor of 0.22 to 0.65, and the time spent in the area close to the image was longer by a factor of 1.8 to 2.7 than in the solvent control group for all diazepam exposure groups (p < 0.05).

Such a promising sublethal endpoint is the movement behavior of invertebrates which is associated with the direct maintenance of various ecosystem processes, hence being of special interest for ecotoxicology. Disturbed movement behavior is often related to neurotoxicity and can affect drift, mate-finding, predator avoidance, and therefore population dynamics. We show the practical implementation of the ToxmateLab, a new device that allows monitoring the movement behavior of up to 48 organisms simultaneously, for behavioral ecotoxicology. We quantified behavioral reactions of Gammarus pulex (Amphipoda, Crustacea) after exposure to two pesticides (dichlorvos and methiocarb) and two pharmaceuticals (diazepam and ibuprofen) at sublethal, environmentally relevant concentrations. We simulated a short-term pulse contamination event that lasted 90 min. Within this short test period, we successfully identified behavioral patterns that were most pronounced upon exposure to the two pesticides: Methiocarb initially triggered hyperactivity, after which baseline behavior was restored. On the other hand, dichlorvos induced hypoactivity starting at a moderate concentration of 5 μg/L – a pattern we also found at the highest concentration of ibuprofen (10 μg/L). An additional acetylcholine esterase inhibition assay revealed no significant impact of the enzyme activity that would explain the altered movement behavior. This suggests that in environmentally realistic scenarios chemicals can induce stress – apart from mode-of-action – that affects non-target organisms' behavior.

As a result of the significant negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population's mental health, its consumption is expected to increase even more. The high consumption of these substances leads to their environmental dissemination, with evidence of their ability to compromise molecular, biochemical, physiological, and behavioural endpoints in non-target organisms. This study aimed to provide a critical review of the current knowledge regarding the effects of SSRI antidepressants on fish ecologically relevant behaviours and personality-dependent traits. A literature review shows limited data concerning the impact of fish personality on their responses to contaminants and how such responses could be influenced by SSRIs. This lack of information may be attributable to a lack of widely adopted standardized protocols for evaluating behavioural responses in fish. The existing studies examining the effects of SSRIs across various biological levels overlook the intra-specific variations in behaviour and physiology associated with different personality patterns or coping styles. Consequently, some effects may remain undetected, such as variations in coping styles and the capacity to handle environmental stressors. This oversight could potentially result in long-term effects with ecological implications.

Multiple experimental arena sizes have been used to measure photolocomotion in zebrafish depending on age, endpoints observed, and instrumentation, among other factors. However, the extent to which methodological parameters may influence naïve behavioral performance and detection of behavioral changes is poorly understood. Here we measured photolocomotion and behavioral profiles of naïve larval zebrafish across arena sizes. We then performed concentration response studies with the model neurostimulant caffeine, again across various arena dimensions. We found total swimming distance of unexposed fish to increase logarithmically with arena size, which as related to circumference, area, and volume. Photomotor response during light/dark transitions also increased with arena size. Following caffeine exposure, total distance travelled was significantly (p < 0.001) affected by well size, caffeine treatment (p < 0.001), and the interaction of these two experimental factors (p < 0.001). In addition, behavioral response profiles showed differences between 96 well plates and larger well sizes. Biphasic response, with stimulation at lower concentrations and refraction at the highest concentration, was observed in dark conditions for the 96 well size only, though almost no effects were identified in the light. However, swimming behavior was significantly (p < 0.1) altered in the highest studied caffeine treatment level in larger well sizes during both light and dark periods. Our results indicate zebrafish swim more in larger arenas and arena size influences behavioral response profiles to caffeine, though differences were mostly observed between very small and large arenas. Further, careful consideration should be given when choosing arena size, because small wells may lead to restriction, while larger wells may differentially reflect biologically relevant effects. These findings can improve comparability among experimental designs and demonstrates the importance of understanding confounding methodological variables. © 2023 The Author(s)",,10.1016/j.envint.2023.107995,,37329757,NA,experimental arena size alters larval zebrafish photolocomotor behaviors and influences bioactivity responses to a model neurostimulant

However, the potential of endocrine-disrupting chemicals to disrupt animal behaviour has received far less attention, despite the important links between behavioural processes and population-level fitness. Accordingly, we investigated the impacts of 14 and 21-day exposure to two environmentally realistic levels of 17β-trenbolone (4.6 and 11.2 ng/L), a potent endocrine-disrupting steroid and agricultural pollutant, on growth and behaviour in tadpoles of an anuran amphibian, the southern brown tree frog (Litoria ewingii). We found that 17β-trenbolone altered morphology, baseline activity and responses to a predatory threat, but did not affect anxiety-like behaviours in a scototaxis assay. Specifically, we found that tadpoles exposed to our high-17β-trenbolone treatment were significantly longer and heavier at 14 and 21 days. We also found that tadpoles exposed to 17β-trenbolone showed higher levels of baseline activity, and significantly reduced their activity following a simulated predator strike.

We systematically reviewed the avian literature to evaluate evidence for contaminant-by-environment interactive effects on animal behavior, as birds are prominent models in behavioral ecotoxicology and global change research. We found that only 17 of 156 (10.9 %) avian behavioral ecotoxicological studies have explored contaminant-by-environment interactions. However, 13 (76.5 %) have found evidence for interactive effects, suggesting that contaminant-by-environment interactive effects on behavior are understudied but important. We draw on our review to develop a conceptual framework to understand such interactive effects from a behavioral reaction norm perspective. Our framework highlights four patterns in reaction norm shapes that can underlie contaminant-by-environment interactive effects on behavior, termed exacerbation, inhibition, mitigation and convergence. First, contamination can render individuals unable to maintain critical behaviors across gradients in additional stressors, exacerbating behavioral change (reaction norms steeper) and generating synergy. Second, contamination can inhibit behavioral adjustment to other stressors, antagonizing behavioral plasticity (reaction norms shallower). Third, a second stressor can mitigate (antagonize) toxicological effects of contamination, causing steeper reaction norms in highly contaminated individuals, with improvement of performance upon exposure to additional stress. Fourth, contamination can limit behavioral plasticity in response to permissive conditions, such that performance of more and less contaminated individuals converges under more stressful conditions. Diverse mechanisms might underlie such shape differences in reaction norms, including combined effects of contaminants and other stressors on endocrinology, energy balance, sensory systems, and physiological and cognitive limits. To encourage more research, we outline how the types of contaminant-by-environment interactive effects proposed in our framework might operate across multiple behavioral domains. We conclude by leveraging our review and framework to suggest priorities for future research. © 2023",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163169,"Behavior, Animal;Animals;Animal Shells",37003321,NA,contaminantbyenvironment interactive effects on animal behavior in the context of global change evidence from avian behavioral ecotoxicology

The use of this substance, along with the insufficient removal in the sewage treatment plants, leads to its occurrence in the environment at low concentrations. In this study, brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) were exposed to 1 μg/L of METH as environmental relevant concentration for 28 days in order to elucidate the complex effects resulting from the drug, including behaviour, energetics, brain and gonad histology, brain metabolomics, and their relations. Trout exposed to METH displayed lowered activity as well as metabolic rate (MR), an altered morphology of brain and gonads as well as changes in brain metabolome when compared to controls. Increased activity and MR were correlated to an increased incidence of histopathology in gonads (females - vascular fluid and gonad staging; males - apoptotic spermatozoa and peritubular cells) in exposed trout compared to controls. Higher amounts of melatonin in brain were detected in exposed fish compared to controls. Tyrosine hydroxylase expression in locus coeruleus was related to the MR in exposed fish, but not in the control. Brain metabolomics indicated significant differences in 115 brain signals between control and METH exposed individuals, described by the coordinates within the principal component analyses (PCA) axes. These coordinates were subsequently used as indicators of a direct link between brain metabolomics, physiology, and behaviour - as activity and MR varied according to their values. Exposed fish showed an increased MR correlated with the metabolite position in PC1 axes, whereas the control had proportionately lower MR and PC1 coordinates.

Because many pharmaceuticals are continuously present in the aquatic environment, animals are often exposed to them across several life stages or even their entire life. Despite a large body of literature showing various impacts of exposure to pharmaceuticals on fish, hardly any long-term studies across different life stages have been conducted which makes it hard to accurately estimate the ecological outcomes of pharmaceutical pollution. Here, we performed a laboratory experiment in which we exposed hatchlings of the fish model Nothobranchius furzeri to an environmentally relevant concentration (0.5 μg/L) of the antidepressant fluoxetine until well into adulthood. We monitored total body length and geotaxic behaviour (i.e. gravity-mediated activity) of each fish as two traits that are ecologically relevant and naturally differ between juvenile and adult killifish. Fish exposed to fluoxetine were smaller compared to control fish, an effect that became more apparent as fish aged. Even though fluoxetine did not affect average swimming depth of either juveniles or adults, nor the time spent at the surface or bottom of the water column, exposed fish changed their position in the water column (depth) more frequently in the adult but not juvenile phase. These results suggest that important morphological and behavioural responses to pharmaceutical exposure–and their potential ecological consequences–may only emerge later in time and/or during specific life stages. Therefore, our results highlight the importance of considering ecologically relevant timescales across developmental stages when studying the ecotoxicology of pharmaceuticals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162746,,36907389,NA,longterm exposure to a pharmaceutical pollutant affects geotaxic behaviour in the adult but not juvenile life stage of killifish

Slow-release implants involve dissolving a compound in a lipid-based carrier, which is inserted into the body of an organism. However, the release kinetics of the compound from the implant to body tissues also requires careful validation. We tested and validated a slow-release implant methodology for exposing fish to a pharmaceutical pollutant, fluoxetine. We tested two lipid-based carriers (coconut oil or vegetable shortening) in the common roach (Rutilus rutilus). The implants contained either a high (50 μg/g), low (25 μg/g), or control (0 μg/g) concentration of fluoxetine, and we measured tissue uptake in the brain, muscle, and plasma of implanted fish over 25 days. The two carriers released fluoxetine differently over time: coconut oil released fluoxetine in an accelerating manner (tissue uptake displayed a positive quadratic curvature), whereas vegetable shortening released fluoxetine in a decelerating manner (a negative quadratic curvature). For both carrier types, fluoxetine was measured at the highest concentration in the brain, followed by muscle and plasma. By comparing the implant exposures with waterborne exposures in the published literature, we showed that the implants delivered an internal exposure that would be similar if fish were exposed in surface waters containing effluents. Overall, we showed that slow-release internal implants are an effective method for delivering chronic exposures of fluoxetine over at least 1-month time scales. Internal exposures can be an especially powerful experimental tool when coupled with field-based study designs to assess the impacts of pharmaceutical pollutants in complex natural environments.

Oxidative stress is a multi-faceted concept that dictates key survival and fitness parameters in any organism. Fipronil and fenitrothion are two pesticides widely used globally for agricultural pest management. Using a field-based, BACI designed experiment we investigated the impact of sublethal pesticide exposure on oxidative stress biomarkers protein carbonyl and DNA damage (8-OHdG), in an arid-zone lizard species, Pogona vitticeps. A single ecologically relevant dose of pesticide was applied via oral gavage to treatment animals. Lizard condition, activity measures, and blood biomarkers were measured at relevant sampling intervals. Cholinesterase (ChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymatic biomarkers were measured in response to fenitrothion, and fipronil blood residues were measured for fipronil-treated lizards. Results suggested no significant treatment effect of either pesticide on parameters measured, however, 8-OHdG levels decreased by ≥ 45% for both pesticide treatment groups and not controls. Protein carbonyl levels showed a high degree of individual variation that proved more influential than pesticide exposure.

Here, we critically examined available refereed information on the occurrence of 67 antipsychotics in wastewater effluent and surface waters. Because the majority of sewage remains untreated around the world, we also examined occurrence in sewage influents. When sufficient information was available, we developed probabilistic environmental exposure distributions (EEDs) for each compound in each matrix by geographic region. We then performed probabilistic environmental hazard assessments (PEHAs) using therapeutic hazard values (THVs) of each compound, due to limited sublethal aquatic toxicology information for this class of pharmaceuticals. From these PEHAs, we determined predicted exceedances of the respective THVs for each chemical among matrices and regions, noting that THV values of antipsychotic contaminants are typically lower than other classes of human pharmaceuticals. Diverse exceedances were observed, and these aquatic hazards varied by compound, matrix and geographic region. In wastewater effluent discharges and surface waters, sulpiride was the most detected antipsychotic; however, percent exceedances of the THV were minimal (0.6%) for this medication. In contrast, we observed elevated aquatic hazards for chlorpromazine (30.5%), aripiprazole (37.5%), and perphenazine (68.7%) in effluent discharges, and for chlorprothixene (35.4%) and flupentixol (98.8%) in surface waters.

Our results revealed significant seasonal variations in the gut microbiota of white-headed black langurs. In particular, the alpha diversity was higher in the rainy season than in the dry season, and the beta diversity was significantly different between the two seasons. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota, and Proteobacteria was higher in the dry season than that in the rainy season, whereas that of Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetota, and Cyanobacteria was significantly higher in the rainy season than that in the dry season. At the family level, Oscillospiraceae and Eggerthellaceae were more abundant in the dry season than in the rainy season, whereas Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Monoglobaceae were more abundant in the rainy season than in the dry season. These results could have been obtained due to seasonal changes in the diet of langurs in response to food plant phenology.

Advanced effluent treatment by ozonation has been proven to eliminate most micropollutants. The present study characterizes sediments' toxic potential regarding zebrafish embryo development, which highly complex nervous system is vulnerable to exposure to neurotoxic substances. Furthermore, behavioral changes can be induced even at low pollutant concentrations and do not cause acute toxicity. The study area includes stretches of the main waterbody, the Wurm River (sampling sites W1-W5), and its tributary the Haarbach River (sampling sites H1, and H2) in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany. Both waterbodies serve as recipients of WWTPs' effluents. The effluent entering the Haarbach River is conventionally treated, while the Wurm River receives ozonated effluent from the Aachen-Soers WWTP. Seven sampling sites up- and downstream of the WWTPs were investigated in June of two subsequent years. The first sampling campaign in 2017 was characterized by prolonged dry weather. The second sampling campaign in 2018 occurred after prolonged rain events and the release of the rainwater overflow basin. Direct exposure of zebrafish embryos to native sediments using the sediment contact test represented an ecologically realistic scenario and showed no acute sublethal effects. Exposure of the zebrafish embryo to freeze-dried sediments representing the ecotoxicological status of sediments during flood events unfolded acute sublethal toxicity. Behavioral studies with zebrafish larvae were an essential part of environmental neurotoxicity testing. Zebrafish larvae exposed to sediments' concentrations causing no acute effects led to behavioral changes signalizing neurotoxic substances in sediments. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and nitroaromatic compounds were identified as potential toxicity drivers, whereby the rainwater overflow basin served as a possible source of pollution.

The mean larval swimming velocity on control tiles of 93.1 ± 5.6 mm min-1 (and activity of 62.8 ± 5.2%) was nearly 2-fold faster (higher) than on the antiadhesive, (CeO2-x) nanoparticle and DCOIT coatings, respectively. Larvae exposed to the DCOIT-coated tiles remained almost stationary. Although the underlying cause and consequence of these results require further investigation, tracking of coral larval swimming behavior was identified as a reliable and feasible method for assessing potential non-lethal responses to AF coatings. As changes in behavior could have significant consequences for larval survival and settlement, they are important endpoints to consider, and the quantification of behavioral responses may be a meaningful and sensitive tool. Therefore, we recommend the use of behavioral studies for coral larval assessments in ecotoxicology as a valuable endpoint. For methodological standardization and implementation, our study also features a detailed guide for video-processing and track analysis of A. millepora coral larvae in EthoVision.

Yet, human activities are globally changing its structure and major components, including marine biodiversity. In this context, the United Nations has proclaimed a Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development to tackle the scientific challenges necessary for a sustainable use of the ocean by means of the Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG14). Here, we review how Acoustic animal Tracking, a widely distributed methodology of tracking marine biodiversity with electronic devices, can provide a roadmap for implementing the major Actions to achieve the SDG14. We show that acoustic tracking can be used to reduce and monitor the effects of marine pollution including noise, light, and plastic pollution. Acoustic tracking can be effectively used to monitor the responses of marine biodiversity to human-made infrastructures and habitat restoration, as well as to determine the effects of hypoxia, ocean warming, and acidification. Acoustic tracking has been historically used to inform fisheries management, the design of marine protected areas, and the detection of essential habitats, rendering this technique particularly attractive to achieve the sustainable fishing and spatial protection target goals of the SDG14. Finally, acoustic tracking can contribute to end illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing by providing tools to monitor marine biodiversity against poachers and promote the development of Small Islands Developing States and developing countries. To fully benefit from acoustic tracking supporting the SDG14 Targets, trans-boundary collaborative efforts through tracking networks are required to promote ocean information sharing and ocean literacy. We therefore propose acoustic tracking and tracking networks as relevant contributors to tackle the scientific challenges that are necessary for a sustainable use of the ocean promoted by the United Nations. © 2022 The Authors.

Among these chemicals, pharmaceuticals such as antidepressants and anxiolytics have been receiving increasing attention, as they are specifically prescribed to modify behavioural responses. Many laboratory studies have demonstrated that some of these compounds can affect various aspects of the behaviour of a range of aquatic organisms; however, these inves-tigations are focused on a very small set of neuroactive pharmaceuticals, and they often consider one compound at a time. In this study, to better understand the environmental and toxicological dimension of the problem, we considered all pharmaceuticals explicitly intended to modulate the central nervous system (CNS), and we hypothesised that these compounds have higher probability of perturbing animal behaviour. Based on this hypothesis, we used the classification of pharmaceuticals provided by the British National Formulary (based on their clinical applications) and identified 210 different CNS-acting pharmaceuticals prescribed in the UK to treat a variety of CNS-related conditions, including mental health and sleep disorders, dementia, epilepsy, nausea, and pain. The analysis of existing databases revealed that 84 of these compounds were already detected in surface waters worldwide. Using a biological read-across approach based on the extrapolation of clinical data, we predicted that the concentration of 32 of these neuroactive pharmaceuticals in surface waters in England may be high enough to elicit pharmacological effects in wild fish. The ecotoxicological effects of the vast majority of these compounds are currently uncharacterised. Overall, these results highlight the importance of addressing this environmental challenge from a mixture toxicology and systems perspective. The knowledge platform developed in the present study can guide future region-specific prioritisation efforts, inform the design of mixture studies, and foster interdisciplinary efforts aimed at identifying novel approaches to predict and interpret the ecological implications of chemical-induced behaviour disruption. © 2022 by the authors.

Against this background, the aim of this work was to investigate the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of 2,4-D-based herbicides on survival, malformations, swimming activity, presence of micronuclei and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities in Physalaemus cuvieri tadpoles. The amphibians were exposed to six concentrations of 2,4-D-based herbicides: 0.0, 4.0, 30.0, 52.5, 75.0, and 100 μg L−1, for 168 h. At concentrations higher than 52.5 μg L−1, significantly increased mortality was observed from 24 h after exposure. At the highest concentration (100 μg L−1), the occurrence of mouth and intestinal malformations was also observed. The occurrence of erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities at concentrations of 30.0, 52.5, 75.0 and 100 μg L−1 and the presence of micronuclei at concentrations of 52.5, 75.0, and 100 μg L−1 were also recorded.

We evaluated the sublethal toxicity of IM to fathead minnow larvae following chronic exposure beginning just after fertilization. Our in silico analysis and in vivo bioassays suggest that IM has a low binding affinity for the vertebrate nicotinate acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), as expected. However, chronic exposure to ≥0.16 µg IM/L reduced survival by 10%, and exposure to ≥18 µg IM/L reduced survival by approximately 20%–40%. Surviving fish exposed to ≥0.16 µg IM/L showed reduced growth, altered embryonic motor activity, and premature hatching. Furthermore, a significant proportion of fish exposed to ≥0.16 µg IM/L were slower to respond to vibrational stimuli and slower to swim away, indicating that chronic exposure to IM has the potential to impair the ability of larvae to escape predation. The adverse health effects we observed indicate that chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of IM may elicit sublethal responses that culminate in a significant increase in mortality during early life stages, ultimately translating to reduced recruitment in wild fish populations.

Amphibians are an ecologically diverse class with a wide range of social and sexual behaviours, making them a compelling model to understand the potential adaptations of animals faced with the effects of human-induced rapid environmental changes (HIREC). Poison frogs (Dendrobatoidea) are a particularly interesting system, as they display diverse social behaviours that are shaped by conspecific and environmental interactions, thus offering a tractable system to investigate how closely related species may respond to the impacts of HIREC. Here, we discuss the potential impacts of global change on poison frog behaviour, and the future challenges this group may face in response to such change. We pay special attention to parental care and territoriality, which are emblematic of this clade, and consider how different species may flexibly respond and adapt to increasingly frequent and diverse anthropogenic stress. More specifically, we hypothesise that some parents may increase care (i.e. clutch attendance and distance travelled for tadpole transport) in HIREC scenarios and that species with more generalist oviposition and tadpole deposition behaviours may fare more positively than their less flexible counterparts; we predict that the latter may either face increased competition for resources limited by HIREC or will be forced to adapt and expand their natural preferences. Likewise, we hypothesise that human-driven habitat alteration will disrupt the acoustic and visual communication systems due to increased noise pollution and/or changes in the surrounding light environment.

Many biochemical and cell-based solutions have been developed for testing insecticide neurotoxicity. Nevertheless, such solutions provide a partial assessment of the impact of neurotoxicity, neglecting important phenotypic components such as behavior. Behavior is the apical endpoint altered by neurotoxicity, and scientists are increasingly recommending including behavioral endpoints in available tests or developing new methods for assessing contaminant-induced behavioral changes. In the present study, we extended an existing protocol (the amphibian short-term assay) with a behavioral test. To this purpose, we developed a homemade device along with an open-source computing solution for tracking trajectories of Xenopus laevis tadpoles exposed to two organophosphates insecticides (OPIs), diazinon (DZN) and chlorpyrifos (CPF). The data resulting from the tracking were then analyzed, and the impact of exposure to DZN and CPF was tested on speed- and direction-related components. Our results demonstrate weak impacts of DZN on the behavioral components, while CPF demonstrated strong effects, notably on speed-related components. Our results also suggest a time-dependent alteration of behavior by CPF, with the highest impacts at day 6 and an absence of impact at day 8.

Understanding the relationships between chemical reactivity in the water and in organisms, and assessing the consequences at higher levels, allows conservation physiologists and managers to take the right restoration measures for an optimal improvement of the aquatic habitats of concern. In this chapter we discuss the role which the promising approach of mechanistic-based Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) can play in ecotoxicological research. It studies a pathway of events, from the direct interaction of a chemical with a molecular target, through subsequent intermediate events at cellular, tissue, organ and individual organism levels which then result in an Adverse Outcome (AO) relevant to ecotoxicological risk assessment and regulatory decision-making. In this context, we also discuss the importance of modeling, including bioavailability based and effect based models. Finally, we reflect on the possibilities that meta-analysis has to offer to detect unifying physiological processes, as well as interesting outliers. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/bs.fp.2022.06.002,Biological Markers,NA,NA,using ecotoxicology for conservation from biomarkers to modeling

Many developing countries lack the capacity to quantify agro-pollution, especially in the case of chemical inputs such as pesticides, preventing them from formulating action plans to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of agro-chemicals. This study aims to address the knowledge gap in Sri Lanka by assessing water quality at a temporal and geospatial scale, focusing on areas with significant agricultural inputs in the Deduru Oya river basin of Sri Lanka. To assess water quality, 183 samples were collected biweekly in the 2019 dry season (Yala) and 2019/2020 wet season (Maha) and analyzed for 39 parameters, including pesticides, heavy metals, minerals and physico-chemical properties. Of the twenty pesticides tested, ten were detected in the water samples (pretilachlor, oxyfluorfen, thiamethoxam, chlorantraniliprole, fenobucarb, fipronil, diazinon, etofenprox, tebuconazole, and captan) and concentrations of all detected pesticides exceeded national regulatory threshold limits. Heavy metal residues were not detected in the water. Pesticide and mineral levels varied widely and exhibited lack of evenness across seasons and locations. Pesticide contamination was higher in the wet season than the dry season. Temporal variation was more pronounced than spatial variation for many of contaminants. No clear trend in contaminant accumulation was observed as sampling progressed downstream from the main reservoir. In both seasons, natural or inorganic fertilizer mineralization and pesticide inputs into the agricultural systems were identified as the main factors underlying water pollution in the study area. © 2021 The Authors",,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129897,Sri Lanka;Pesticides,NA,NA,spatiotemporal analysis of water quality for pesticides and other agricultural pollutants in deduru oya river basin of sri lanka

Major drivers of these global declines are known. However, the contribution of these major drivers to population declines varies by the presence or absence and the interactive effect of drivers, thus creating local challenges for conservation of populations. Studies have determined that environmental contaminants contribute to amphibian population declines. However, there is a disagreement over the use of amphibians as sentinel species in ecotoxicological testing rather than the traditional taxa used, fish and invertebrates. Reviews of ecotoxicological studies have demonstrated that amphibians are generally less sensitive than fish and invertebrates to different groups of contaminants. Nonetheless, because of the distinct nature and mechanism of toxicity of various contaminants, it is necessary to study contaminants individually to be able to come to any conclusion on the relative sensitivity of amphibians. Copper is one of the most studied environmental contaminants. We conducted a literature review of Cu toxicity to amphibians and the relative sensitivity of amphibians to other aquatic animals. The available data suggest that although amphibians may be tolerant of acute Cu exposure, they are relatively sensitive to chronic exposure (i.e., 100-fold greater sensitivity to chronic compared to acute exposure). In addition, ecologically relevant endpoints specific to amphibians (e.g., duration of metamorphosis and behavior) are shown to provide a better understanding of their sensitivity compared to traditional endpoints (e.g., survival and growth). Our current knowledge on amphibian sensitivity is far from complete. Considering the current status of this globally threatened class of animals, it is necessary to fill the knowledge gaps regarding their sensitivity to individual contaminants, beginning with Cu.

Within rice ecosystems, amphibians are valuable indicators because pesticide applications coincide with sensitive reproductive and developmental life stages. We conducted two experiments using wild cane toads (Rhinella marina) to test 1) whether environmentally relevant exposure to a commercial formulation of butachlor, an acetanilide herbicide used extensively in rice, affects amphibian development and 2) whether cane toad tadpoles are capable of acclimatizing to sub-lethal exposure. First, we exposed wild cane toads to 0.002, 0.02, or 0.2 mg/L of butachlor (Machete EC), during distinct development stages (as eggs and hatchlings, as tadpoles, or continuously) for 12 days. Next, we exposed a subset of animals from the first experiment to a second, lethal concentration and examined survivorship. We found that cane toads exposed to butachlor developed slower and weighed less than controls, and that development of the thyroid gland was affected: exposed individuals had smaller thyroid glands and thyrocyte cells, and more individual follicles. Analyses of the transcriptome revealed that butachlor exposure resulted in downregulation of transcripts related to metabolic processes, anatomic structure development, immune system function, and response to stress. Last, we observed evidence of acclimatization, where animals exposed to butachlor early in life performed better than naïve animals during a second exposure. Our findings indicate that the commercial formulation of butachlor, Machete EC, causes thyroid endocrine disruption in vertebrates, and suggest that exposure in lowland irrigated rice fields presents a concern for wildlife and human health. Furthermore, we establish that developmental assays with cane toads can be used to screen for adverse effects of pesticides in rice fields. Environmentally relevant exposures to a commercial formulation of butachlor, an herbicide used extensively in rice, affect development, morphology, and gene expression of cane toad tadpoles.

As the exposure to pesticides can have adverse effects on non-target organisms, avoiding contaminated areas would be advantageous on an individual level, but could lead to a chemical landscape fragmentation with disadvantages on the metapopulation level. We investigated the avoidance behavior of juvenile common toads (Bufo bufo) in response to seven pesticide formulations commonly used in German vineyards. We used test arenas filled with silica sand and oversprayed half of each with different pesticide formulations. We placed a toad in the middle of an arena, filmed its behavior over 24 hours, calculated the proportion of time a toad spent on the contaminated side and compared it to a random side choice. We found evidence for the avoidance of the folpet formulation Folpan® 500 SC, the metrafenone formulation Vivando® and the glyphosate formulation Taifun® forte at maximum recommended field rates for vine and a trend for avoidance of Wettable Sulphur Stulln (sulphur). No avoidance was observed when testing Folpan® 80 WDG (folpet), Funguran® progress (copper hydroxide), SpinTorTM (spinosad), or 10% of the maximum field rate of any formulation tested. In the choice-tests in which we observed an avoidance, toads also showed higher activity on the contaminated side of the arena. As video analysis with tracking software is not always feasible, we further tested the effect of reducing the sampling interval for manual data analyses. We showed that one data point every 15 or 60 minutes results in a risk of overlooking a weak avoidance behavior, but still allows to verify the absence/presence of an avoidance for six out of seven formulations. Our findings are important for an upcoming pesticide risk assessment for amphibians and could be a template for future standardized tests. © 2020 Leeb et al.

Water bodies are frequently contaminated by the presence of conventional pollutants such as dyes and heavy metals, as well as microorganisms that are responsible for various diseases. A sharp rise has also been observed in the presence of new compounds heretofore excluded from the design and evaluation of wastewater treatment processes, categorized as “emerging pollutants”. While some are harmless, certain emerging pollutants possess the ability to cause debilitating effects on a wide spectrum of living organisms. Photocatalytic degradation has emerged as an increasingly popular solution to the problem of water pollution due to its effectiveness and versatility. The primary objective of this study is to thoroughly scrutinize recent applications of titanium dioxide and its modified forms as photocatalytic materials in the removal and control of several classes of water pollutants as reported in literature. Different structural modifications are used to enhance the performance of the photocatalyst such as doping and formation of composites. The principles of these modifications have been scrutinized and evaluated in this review in order to present their advantages and drawbacks. The mechanisms involved in the removal of different pollutants through photocatalysis performed by TiO2 have been highlighted. The factors affecting the mechanism of photocatalysis and those affecting the performance of different TiO2-based photocatalysts have also been thoroughly discussed, thereby presenting a comprehensive view of all aspects involved in the application of TiO2 to remediate and control water pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110906,Titanium,32721341,NA,present applications of titanium dioxide for the photocatalytic removal of pollutants from water a review

Fejervarya limnocharis is a common frog occurring in rice paddy fields. The timings of pesticide application generally coincide with the tenure of the occurrence of tadpoles in shallow waters of paddy fields. Malathion and carbaryl are frequently used in rice paddy fields to control leafhoppers and rice bugs, respectively. Therefore, effects of mixtures of malathion and carbaryl insecticides on the survival of tadpoles and emergence of froglets of Fejervarya limnocharis were studied in the laboratory using combinations of three concentrations of carbaryl (0, 25, 50 µg l−1) with four concentrations of malathion (0, 100, 250, 500 µg l−1). Both malathion and carbaryl were found to be toxic to tadpoles. A reduction in tadpole survival and froglet emergence was recorded with increasing concentrations of carbaryl and malathion. We found significant interaction between carbaryl and malathion on tadpole survival and froglet emergence. Tadpoles exposed to combination of pesticides showed early emergence as froglets compared to control. The extent of toxicity and pesticide interactions are varied when mixed in different concentrations. The reduction in survival, froglet emergence and delay in emergence of metamorphs can occur in rice paddy field as both pesticides are used simultaneously. Therefore, combinations of pesticides may have significant negative effects on the frog population of agro-ecosystems, which requires further confirmation through appropriate field experiments. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,10.1007/s10653-019-00418-z,Pesticides;Carbamates;Organophosphates,31520318,NA,individual and combined effects of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides on the cricket frog fejervarya limnocharis

The increased use of pesticides poses a serious threat to the freshwater ecosystem, which urgently calls for an improved knowledge about the impact of pesticide practices in this study area. Several studies have shown that models can be appropriate tools to simulate pesticide dynamics in order to obtain this knowledge. This study tested the suitability of the Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate the dynamics of two different pesticides in the data scarce Guayas River basin. First, we set up, calibrated and validated the model using the streamflow data. Subsequently, we set up the model for the simulation of the selected pesticides (i.e., pendimethalin and fenpropimorph). While the hydrology was represented soundly by the model considering the data scare conditions, the simulation of the pesticides should be taken with care due to uncertainties behind essential drivers, e.g., application rates. Among the insights obtained from the pesticide simulations are the identification of critical zones for prioritisation, the dominant areas of pesticide sources and the impact of the different land uses. SWAT has been evaluated to be a suitable tool to investigate the impact of pesticide use under data scarcity in the Guayas River basin. The strengths of SWAT are its semi-distributed structure, availability of extensive online documentation, internal pesticide databases and user support while the limitations are high data requirements, time-intensive model development and challenging streamflow calibration. The results can also be helpful to design future water quality monitoring strategies. However, for future studies, we highly recommend extended monitoring of pesticide concentrations and sediment loads. Moreover, to substantially improve the model performance, the availability of better input data is needed such as higher resolution soil maps, more accurate pesticide application rate and actual land management programs. Provided that key suggestions for further improvement are considered, the model is valuable for applications in river ecosystem management of the Guayas River basin. © 2020 by the authors.",,10.3390/w12030696,Pesticides,NA,NA,using the soil and water assessment tool to simulate the pesticide dynamics in the data scarce guayas river basin ecuador

Understanding farmer knowledge and perceptions of the ecosystem services provided by wildlife in their fields, along with their understanding of the risks to wildlife associated with agrochemical exposure, can inform biodiversity preservation efforts. In June and July 2014, we used focus groups and structured and semi-structured interviews that engaged 22 individuals involved in rice agriculture operations in Laguna, Philippines, a village close to the International Rice Research Institute in Los Baños, Philippines, to learn more about farmer perceptions and knowledge of amphibians in their rice fields. We found that many, though not all farm workers (managers, tenants, and laborers) noted declines in amphibian populations over time, expressed how they incorporated frogs and toads (Anura) into their daily lives, and recognized the value of amphibians as ecosystem service providers. Specifically, farmers noted that amphibians provide pest-management through consumption of rice pests, act as biomonitors for pesticide-related health outcomes, and provide a local food and economic resource. Some farmers and farm workers noted the general cultural value of listening to the ""frogs sing when it rains."" Overall, our findings demonstrate that farmers have an understanding of the value of amphibians in their fields.

The African mound building termite, Macrotermes bellicosus, is an important beneficial insect that functions as an ecosystem engineer due to its role in the breakdown of dead and decaying materials. Here, we examined the effects of 2,4-D amine salt (2,4-D) and atrazine based herbicides viz. Vestamine ® and Ultrazine® on the survival and locomotion response of M. bellicosus. Worker termites were treated with a range of concentrations of Vestamine® (the recommended concentration: 6.25 ml per 500 ml of water, 0.25- and 0.5-fold below the recommended concentration and distilled water as control) and Ultrazine® (the recommended concentration: 3.75 ml per 500 ml of water, 0.25-, 0.5-, 2.0- and 4-fold of the recommended concentration and distilled water as control) for 24 hours for the mortality test, and allowed to run for 15 seconds for the locomotion trial. All concentrations of both Vestamine® and Ultrazine® were highly toxic to worker termites and mortality increased as the concentration and time after treatment increased. For both herbicides, concentrations far less than the recommended rates caused 100% mortality. The speed of termites was significantly influenced by both Vestamine® and Ultrazine® as termites exposed to all tested concentrations of the herbicides exhibited reduced running speed than the control. These findings suggest that beneficial insects, especially M. bellicosus may experience high mortality (up to 100%) and reduced mobility if they are sprayed upon or come in contact with plant materials that have been freshly sprayed with (less or more than) the recommended concentrations of Vestamine ® and Ultrazine®.

Laboratory and mesocosm studies have addressed several questions to understand the mechanism by which pesticides cause detrimental effects on amphibians. However, the extrapolation of those results to natural populations may not be adequate to predict environmental impacts or to understand the role of pesticides in the amphibian decline. By using in situ enclosures, we evaluated the effects (survival and mobility) of common pesticides applied by farmers (cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, glyphosate, and 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) on tadpoles. We assessed these effects in four common amphibian species from South America across 91 ponds located in the Pampas of central Argentina. We found that survival decreased in 13 out of 20 pesticides applications concomitantly with detection of pesticides in water ponds. 48 h after applications, mixtures containing endosulfan or chlorpyrifos reduced tadpole survival to <1% while the cypermethrin mixtures reduced survival to 10%. In addition, we found impairment of mobility in all combination of pesticides, including glyphosate. The ecological context involved in our study represents the common exposure scenarios related to GMO-based agriculture practices in South America, with relevance at regional levels. We emphasize that multifaceted approaches developed to understand the role of pesticides in the amphibian decline need a conservation perspective.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating behavioural changes following exposure to contaminants. Most studies were conducted in North America and Europe on larval stages, and 64% of the 116 studies focussed on the effects of insecticides. We found that a suite of contaminants influence a wide range of behaviours in amphibians, with insecticides typically invoking the strongest responses. In particular, insecticides increased rates of abnormal swimming, and reduced escape responses to simulated predator attacks.

Transmission electron microscographs of the control fish depicted neurons surrounded by supporting neuroglial tissue. Mild to moderate cellular changes such as shrinkage of axoplasm, irregular nucleus and fragmented rough endoplasmic reticulum was observed after 15 days of exposure to the pesticide. Most severe cytological alterations noticed after prolonged exposure to the toxicant at higher concentration were degeneration and decompaction of myelin sheath, swollen, vacuolated mitochondria with fragmented cristae, and neuroglia featuring degenerated cells. Necrotic changes such as neuronal shrinkage, disintegration of plasma membrane and condensed chromatin, suggested apoptosis induction. The prevalence of partial or complete cristolysis in mitochondria indicates that oxidative phosphorylation was severely compromised.

Behavior activity (BA) effectively differentiated behavior modes according to organic compounds comparing with CdCl2. Circadian rhythm most consistently appeared after in ATZ exposure, by showing clear peaks during the light periods, being followed by CdCl2 and DM. DBP, in contrast, had no clear biorhythm with minimum fluctuation in BS curves. Totally, circadian rhythms were overall affected greatly until the second day. Auto-correlation analyses demonstrated that the affectedness by toxins would be addressed in an extra dimension in circadian rhythm.

However, current ecological studies focus on the effects of individual psychiatric pharmaceuticals, with little attention being given to their combined effects. In this study, the interactive effects of two psychiatric pharmaceuticals, sertraline (SER) and diphenhydramine (DPH), on bioconcentration and biochemical and behavioral responses were investigated in crucian carp (Carassius auratus) after seven days of exposure. DPH was found to increase the accumulation of SER in fish tissues relative to SER-alone exposure. In addition, the mixture of SER and DPH significantly changed the activities of antioxidant enzymes and led to significant increases in malondialdehyde content, relative to SER alone. Concerning the neurotoxicity, relative to SER-alone exposure, brain AChE activity was significantly enhanced in fish following the combined exposure. Regarding behavioral responses, swimming activity and shoaling behavior were significantly altered in co-exposure treatments compared with the SER alone. Moreover, the inhibition effects on the feeding rates were increased in co-exposure treatments compared to SER alone. Collectively, our results suggest that the mixtures of psychiatric pharmaceuticals may pose more severe ecological risks to aquatic organisms compared to these compounds individually. © 2019 by the authors.

This study aimed to determine the sensitivity of the freshwater planarian Girardia tigrina to acute and chronic exposures of Roundup®. Planarians were exposed to a range of lethal and sub-lethal concentrations of Roundup® to determine the median lethal concentration (LC50) concerning its active ingredient glyphosate and also effects on locomotor velocity (pLMV), feeding rate, regeneration, reproductive parameters and morphological abnormalities. Regeneration endpoints included length of blastema and time for photoreceptors and auricles regeneration after decapitation, while effects on reproduction were assessed measuring fecundity (number of deposited cocoons) and fertility (number of hatchlings) over five weeks of exposure to glyphosate. The estimated 48 h LC50 of was 35.94 mg glyphosate/L. Dose dependent effects were observed for feeding, locomotion and regeneration endpoints with Lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) values as low as 3.75 mg glyphosate/L. Chronic exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate significantly impaired fecundity and fertility rates of exposed planarians (median effective concentration, EC50 = 1.6 mg glyphosate/L for fecundity and fertility rates).

The synthesis was based in an H-bonding interaction assembling (I0N0) between two non-ionic components (the inorganic silica surface, I0 and the polyethylene oxide template, N0) by adding tetraethoxysilane to the non-ionic surfactant Brij®100, the latter previously dissolved in HCl 1 M. 50 mL water samples adjusted at pH= 3.5 were passed, at a flow rate of 5 mL/min, through a home-made cartridge containing 50 mg of MSU-1 sorbent, pre-conditioned with 5 mL of ultrapure water; then, the cartridge was washed with 5 mL of ultrapure water. Following elution with 5 mL of acetonitrile, the pesticides were determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry. Two selected reaction monitoring transitions were monitored per compound, the most intense one being used for quantification and the second one for confirmation. Three points were used for identification, as established in the Directive 96/23/EC for LC-MS/MS analysis, which deals with confirmatory methods for organic residues and contaminants listed in the Group B (veterinary drugs and contaminants). Medium matrix effect (|20%|&lt;ME&lt;|50%|) was found for methiocarb and malathion, whereas diazinon and phosalone showed strong matrix effect (ME≥ &gt; |50%|). Therefore, the standard addition methodology was applied by adding an adequate amount of the pesticide standard mixture to the final sample extract. All pesticides were quantified using this approach for practical reasons, thus avoiding two different calibrations. The method quantification limit (MQL) of pesticides was 0.01 μg/L for all of them, except for diazinon (0.1 μg/L). Recoveries of the target pesticides at MQL and 0.25 µg/L concentration levels in blank river water were in the range 70.1–113.5% and 86.7–107.3%, respectively, with RSDs lower than 16.3% and 15.7%, respectively.

However, contaminants, such as heavy metals and pesticides, in stormwater adversely affect the survival, growth, and reproduction of animals inhabiting these wetlands. A key question is whether wildlife can identify and avoid highly polluted wetlands. We investigated whether pond-breeding frogs are attempting to breed in wetlands that affect the fitness of their offspring across 67 urban wetlands in Melbourne, Australia. Frog species richness and the concentration of contaminants (heavy metals and pesticides) were not significantly related, even in the most polluted wetlands. The proportion of fringing vegetation at a wetland had the greatest positive influence on the number of frog species present and the probability of occurrence of individual species, indicating that frogs inhabited wetlands with abundant vegetation, regardless of their pollution status. These wetlands contained contaminant levels similar to urban wetlands around the world at levels that reduce larval amphibian survival. These results are, thus, likely generalizable to other areas, suggesting that urban managers could inadvertently be creating ecological traps in countless cities.

We conducted two laboratory experiments to quantify whether predator–prey interactions between California killifish, Fundulus parvipinnis, and the polychaete Polydora cornuta vary with flow speed and chlorpyrifos exposure. In one experiment, only F. parvipinnis was exposed to chlorpyrifos; in the other, only P. cornuta was exposed. The flume included a 300-cm 2 area of sediment with 24 P. cornuta in a central patch (98 cm 2 ). We videotaped groups of three killifish for 50 min at one of four flow speeds (6, 9, 12, or 15 cm/s) and recorded the proportion of bites directed at the prey patch. Unexposed killifish directed 70% of their bites at the prey patch at 6 cm/s, and prey-patch selection decreased as flow increased. Killifish exposed to chlorpyrifos directed 41% of their bites at the prey patch at 6 cm/s with reduced prey-patch selection relative to unexposed fish at 9 and 12 cm/s. At 15 cm/s, both exposed and unexposed fish displayed non-selective biting. Worms were videotaped to quantify their deposit- and suspension-feeding activities. Exposing worms to chlorpyrifos reduced total feeding activity by ~30%. Suspension feeding was more common at faster flow speeds, but the time worms spent suspension feeding relative to deposit feeding was unaffected by chlorpyrifos.

Dissecting such complexity could benefit from strategies that integrate multiple disciplines and address the mechanistic underpinnings of population declines and extirpations. We examine how the disciplines of behavior and physiology could be used to develop conservation strategies for amphibians and identify eight research gaps that provide future directions for the emerging fields of conservation behavior and conservation physiology. We present two case studies on imperiled salamanders that show how studies of behavior and physiology may support amphibian conservation efforts. We found several applications of stress physiology to amphibian conservation, but long-term studies are needed to understand how stress ultimately affects individual fitness and population resilience. Additionally, multiple measures of physiological health are needed to provide a more holistic assessment of an individual's overall condition. Previous behavioral and physiological studies have been instrumental for understanding how amphibians respond to habitat modification, pathogens and parasites, contaminants, and invasive species. Some behavior-based approaches to mitigating invasive species issues have been successful in short-term studies with individual species. However, widespread application of these tactics has not yet been integrated into conservation and management strategies for ecologically similar species. A diversity of modeling approaches has enhanced understanding of how climate variability may impact amphibian populations, but model predictions need empirical tests to provide conservation managers with workable approaches to multiple perturbations associated with global environmental change. We illustrate that behavior and physiology can have broad utility for amphibian conservation, but evidence is scant that such studies have actually been used to inform strategies for amphibian conservation and management. © 2019 Walls and Gabor.",,10.3389/fevo.2019.00234,,NA,NA,integrating behavior and physiology into strategies for amphibian conservation

Larval sturgeon (1–2, 28, or 35 d posthatch [dph]) were exposed to Cu (0.5–8 μg/L) for 4 to 14 d. Abnormal behavioral changes were observed within the first few days of exposure including loss of equilibrium and immobilization. Digital video tracking software revealed decreased swimming activity with increasing Cu concentration. Significant changes in behavior and mortality occurred at concentrations of Cu between 1 and 8 μg/L. Juvenile white sturgeon, 58 dph, exposed to 12 μg/L Cu consumed 37 to 60% less food than controls after 3 d of exposure.

To address this knowledge gap, we exposed the euryhaline model species Menidia beryllina (inland silversides) to the insecticide bifenthrin, a known modulator of calcium signaling. The main objectives of this study were to determine: (1) whether exposure of developing silversides to environmentally relevant concentrations of bifenthrin alters their behavior; and (2) whether behavioral changes correlate with altered expression of genes involved in RyR and mTOR-dependent signaling pathways. At six hours post fertilization (hpf), inland silversides were exposed to bifenthrin at 3, 27 and 122 ng/L until 7 days post fertilization (dpf, larvae hatched at 6dpf), followed by a 14-day recovery period in uncontaminated water. Transcriptional responses were measured at 5, 7 and 21 dpf; locomotor behavior following external stimuli and response to an olfactory predator cue were assessed at 7 and 21 dpf. Bifenthrin elicited significant non-monotonic transcriptional responses in the majority of genes examined at 5 dpf and at 21 dpf. Bifenthrin also significantly altered predator avoidance behavior via olfactory mechanisms with main effects identified for animals exposed to 3 and 27 ng/L. Behavioral effects were not detected in response to visual stimuli during acute exposure, but were significant in the predator-cue assessment following the recovery period, suggesting delayed and long-term effects of early developmental exposures to bifenthrin. Our findings demonstrate that at picomolar (pM) concentrations, which are often not represented in ecotoxicological studies, bifenthrin perturbs early development of inland silversides. These developmental impacts are manifested behaviorally at later life stages, specifically as altered patterns of predator avoidance behavior, which have been correlated with population decline.

Although direct toxicity may be partly responsible, contaminants are often present at sub-lethal concentrations in the wild. Behavioural end-points are becoming an increasingly useful method to estimate the impact of contaminants, particularly if the behavioural responses manifest to affect individual fitness (i.e. survival, growth, or reproduction). In the wild, most animals are affected by multiple stressors, and determining how these interact to affect behaviour is critical for understanding the ecological implications of contaminant exposure. Here, we examined the individual and interactive effect of the heavy metal copper and the insecticide imidacloprid on mortality rates and anti-predator behaviours of spotted marsh frog (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis) tadpoles. This common species frequently occupies and breeds in contaminated stormwater and agricultural wetlands, where copper and imidacloprid are often present. These contaminants may alter behaviour via physiological and neurological pathways, as well as affecting how tadpoles respond to chemical cues. Tadpoles suffered unexpectedly high mortality rates when exposed to imidacloprid concentrations well below published LC50 concentrations. Only unexposed tadpoles significantly avoided predator cues. Copper and imidacloprid reduced swimming speed and distance, and escape responses, while increasing erratic swimming. We observed an interactive effect of imidacloprid and copper on erratic swimming, but in general imidacloprid and copper did not act synergistically. Our results suggest that as contaminants enter waterbodies, tadpoles will suffer considerable direct mortality, reduced foraging capacity, and increased susceptibility to predation. Our results provide the first evidence of imidacloprid affecting amphibian behaviour, and highlight both the adverse effects of copper and imidacloprid, and the importance of exploring the effect of multiple contaminants simultaneously. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.06.028,Prednisolone,29913416,NA,contaminant mixtures interact to impair predatoravoidance behaviours and survival in a larval amphibian

Even low levels of pesticides can affect aquatic communities both directly and indirectly. Previous work has shown that trace amounts of the pesticide chlorpyrifos altered tadpole morphology and neurodevelopment in artificial ponds (mesocosms). To determine whether effects resulted from direct chlorpyrifos exposure or from disruption of the food web due to a pesticide-induced decline in zooplankton, we examined the impacts of chlorpyrifos on amphibian development in the presence of chlorpyrifos-resistant zooplankton, a key component of the aquatic trophic community. Northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens) tadpoles were reared through metamorphosis in mesocosms containing either 0 or 1 µg/L chlorpyrifos and either chlorpyrifos-resistant or chlorpyrifos-sensitive Daphnia pulex zooplankton. Developmental exposure to chlorpyrifos resulted in metamorphs with a relatively wider optic tectum, medulla, and diencephalon compared with controls, and this result was found regardless of the zooplankton population within the mesocosm. Thus, chlorpyrifos directly impacted brain development, independent of the effects on the trophic community. With respect to body shape, chlorpyrifos had no effect on body shape of metamorphs reared in mesocosms with chlorpyrifos-sensitive zooplankton, but body shape was sensitive to zooplankton population in the absence of chlorpyrifos.

It is already known that food-seeking performances, which are crucially controlled by orexins (ORXs), may be under the influence of environmental factors including pollutants. Among these, mancozeb (mz) is becoming an environmental risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Due to few studies on marine fish exposed to mz, it was our intention to correlate feeding latency, food intake and feeding duration to potential neurodegenerative processes in key diencephalic sites and expression changes of the ORX neuroreceptor (ORXR) in the ornate wrasses (Thalassoma pavo). Hence, fish exposed for 4 days (d) to mz 0.2 mg/l (deriving from a 0.07, 0.14, 0.2, 0.3 mg/l screening test) displayed a significant reduction (p < 0.05) of food intake compared to controls as early as 1d that became more evident (p < 0.01) after 3d. Moreover, significant enhancements of feeding latency were reported after 1d up to 3d (p < 0.001) and even feeding duration was enhanced up to 3d (p < 0.001), which instead moderately increased after 4d (p < 0.05). A reduction (−120%; p < 0.001) of mean body weight was also detected at the end of exposure. Likewise, a notable (p < 0.001) activation of ORXR protein occurred together with mRNA up-regulations in diencephalic areas such as the diffuse nucleus of the inferior lobe (+48%) that also exhibited evident degenerative neuronal fields.

Despite the widespread occurrence of morphological antipredator mechanisms, no studies have tested how these can affect the sensitivity of prey to pesticides. Sensitivity to pesticides is typically measured via reductions in growth rates and survival, but also reductions in heat tolerance are to be expected and are becoming increasingly important in a warming world. We investigated how autotomy, a widespread morphological antipredator mechanism where animals sacrifice a body part (here the caudal lamellae) to escape when attacked by a predator, modified the sensitivity to the insecticide chlorpyrifos in larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella. Exposure to chlorpyrifos reduced the growth rate and heat tolerance (measured as CTmax). A key finding was that the pesticide had a greater impact on growth rates of intact animals, i.e. those that retained their lamellae. This reduced sensitivity to chlorpyrifos in animals without lamellae can be explained by the reduced outer surface area which is expected to result in a lower uptake of the pesticide. Larvae that underwent autotomy exhibited a lower heat tolerance, which may also be explained by the reduced surface area and the associated reduction in oxygen uptake. There is a wide diversity of morphological antipredator mechanisms, suggesting that there will be more examples where these mechanisms affect the vulnerability to pollutants. Given the importance of pollution and predation as structuring forces in aquatic food webs, exploring the potential interactions between morphological antipredator mechanisms and sensitivity to pollutants will be crucial for risk assessment of pollutants in aquatic systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.01.179,Pesticides,29898530,NA,a widespread morphological antipredator mechanism reduces the sensitivity to pesticides and increases the susceptibility to warming

Various in practice and emerging pesticides adversely affect the survival, development and biological systems stability. Several research efforts have been made to highlight the bio-safety and toxicological features of toxicants through risk assessment studies using different animal models, e.g., different fish species. Among several pesticides, cypermethrin is extensively used in agriculture and households, and the reported concentrations of this pesticide in different water bodies including rivers and streams, soil and even in rainwater are threatening. Consequently, cypermethrin is considered for risk assessment studies to know about its deep and different level of toxicological effects subject to its dose, exposure time and route. The cypermethrin existence/persistence in the environment is posing a severe threat to humans as well as another non-target terrestrial and aquatic organism.

However, the effects of TE on amphibians are still unknown. Thus, we evaluated whether the TE, even at low concentrations (0.2%), could cause asymmetric development (inferred through the fluctuating asymmetry indices (FA)) and changes in morphological characteristics of Physalaemus cuvieri larvae. Accordingly, the tadpoles were distributed in groups non-exposed (n = 160) and exposed (n = 160) to this TE, for 15 days. The TE used presented a complex chemical composition (especially high concentrations of Cr, Cd and Ni and a diverse array of toxic organic compounds). We used three individual FA indices: FA1: = | R-L |, ii) FA2 = | R-L | ÷ [(R + L) ÷ 2] and FA3 = (R-L)2, where “R” are “L” are the right and left sides, respectively. The larvae exposed to the TE had higher FA indexes (FA1, FA2 and FA3) for nostril-snout distance, relative to the control group larvae. Regarding eye-snout distance, asymmetry values were higher for the FA1 and FA2 indices (with no difference for the FA3 index), which were similar to those observed for the eye-width character. For eye length, FA2 was higher in animals of the effluent group. Tadpoles exposed to TE had significantly lower body masses than those in the control group, when controlling for body length and larval development stage. Furthermore, tadpoles in the effluent group had smaller body size and lower interocular distance. The frequency of tadpoles that showed any alteration in tail morphology as well as tail attachment position (dorsal and ventral) was significantly higher in the effluent group than in animals not exposed to the TE. Finally, our data show that exposure to TE delayed larval development of tadpoles. Thus, our pioneering study confirms the hypothesis that exposure of P. cuvieri to TE, at low concentrations, impacts development and morphological characters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.06.134,,28648371,NA,impacts of tannery effluent on development and morphological characters in a neotropical tadpole

Embryos were exposed to waterborne WSMoL (0.0125–0.2 mg mL−1) for 96 h and lethal and sub-lethal effects were observed every 24 h. In the bioassays with larvae, the individuals were exposed to the WSMoL (0.025–0.2 mg mL−1), mortality was recorded daily, and larval swimming velocities were analyzed after 72 h and 168 h of exposure. Additionally, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of larvae was determined after 168 h of exposure. WSMoL LC50 values to embryos were 0.190, 0.133 and 0.049 mg mL−1 after 48, 72 and 96 h, respectively. No toxic endpoint was observed after exposure for 24 h.

Contaminated runoff from AMLs can negatively affect the physiology and ecology of surrounding terrestrial and aquatic habitats and species and can be detrimental to human health. As a response, several U.S. federal and state agencies have launched programs to assess health risks associated with AMLs. In some cases, however, AMLs may be beneficial to specific wildlife taxa. There is a relative paucity of studies investigating the physiological and ecological impacts of AMLs on wildlife. We conducted a systematic review examining published scientific articles that assessed the negative and positive impacts of AMLs across invertebrate and vertebrate taxa. We also offer suggestions on evaluating AMLs to develop effective mitigation strategies that reduce their negative tole on human and wildlife communities. Peer-reviewed publications were screened across WebofScience, PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Abandoned mine lands were generally detrimental to wildlife, with adverse effects ranging from bioaccumulation of heavy metals to decreased ecological fitness. Conversely, AMLs were an overall benefit to imperiled bat populations and could serve as tools for conservation. Studies were unevenly distributed across different wildlife taxa groups, echoing the necessity for additional taxonomically diverse research. We suggest that standardized wildlife survey methods be used to assess how different species utilize AMLs.

Behavioural plasticity can not only drive organism-level responses to stressors directly but can also mediate physiological responses. Here, we provide a conceptual framework incorporating four fundamental trade-offs that explicitly link animal behaviour to life-history-based pathways for energy allocation, shaping the impact of multiple stressors on fitness. We first address how small-scale behavioural changes can either mediate or drive conflicts between the effects of multiple stressors and alternative physiological responses. We then discuss how animal behaviour gives rise to three additional understudied and interrelated trade-offs: balancing the benefits and risks of obtaining the energy needed to cope with stressors, allocation of energy between life-history traits and stressor responses, and larger-scale escape from stressors in space or time via large-scale movement or dormancy. Finally, we outline how these trade-offs interactively affect fitness and qualitative ecological outcomes resulting from multiple stressors. Our framework suggests that explicitly considering animal behaviour should enrich our mechanistic understanding of stressor effects, help explain extensive context dependence observed in these effects, and highlight promising avenues for future empirical and theoretical research. © 2023 Cambridge Philosophical Society.",,10.1111/brv.12956,Animals;Animal Shells,NA,NA,integrating animal behaviour into research on multiple environmental stressors a conceptual framework

Colony size is a key ecological trait predicted to drive sensitivity to environmental stressors and may be especially important for species with annual cycles of sociality, such as bumblebees. However, there is limited empirical evidence assessing the effect of colony size on sensitivity to environmental stressors or the mechanisms underlying these effects. Here, we examine the relationship between colony size and sensitivity to environmental stressors in bumblebees. We exposed colonies at different developmental stages briefly (2 days) to a common neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and cold stress, while quantifying behaviour of individuals. Combined imidacloprid and cold exposure had stronger effects on both thermoregulatory behaviour and long-term colony growth in small colonies. We find that imidacloprid's effects on behaviour are mediated by body temperature and spatial location within the nest, suggesting that social thermoregulation provides a buffering effect in large colonies. Finally, we demonstrate qualitatively similar effects in size-manipulated microcolonies, suggesting that group size per se, rather than colony age, drives these patterns. Our results provide evidence that colony size is critical in driving sensitivity to stressors and may help elucidate mechanisms underlying the complex and context-specific impacts of pesticide exposure. © 2023 The Authors.",,10.1098/rspb.2023.0555,Cold Temperature;Buffers,37464757,NA,colony size buffers interactions between neonicotinoid exposure and cold stress in bumblebees

After exposure to neburon for 150 days from embryo to adult, that the average spawning egg number in high concentration group was 106.40, which was significantly lower than 193.00 in control group. This result was mainly due to the abnormal male reproductive behavior caused by abnormal transcription of genes associated with reproductive behavior in the brain, such as secretogranin-2a. The proportions of spermatozoa in the medium and high concentration groups were 82.40% and 83.84%, respectively, which were significantly lower than 89.45% in control group. This result was mainly caused by hormonal disturbances and an increased proportion of apoptotic cells. The hormonal disruption was due to the significant changes in the transcription levels of key genes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis following neburon treatment. Neburon treatment also significantly activated the AhR signaling pathway, causing oxidative stress damage and eventually leading to a significant increase in apoptosis in the exposed group.

The luminescence properties of 1 were exploited as a multi-responsive luminescence sensor for nitrofuran antibiotics (nitrofurazone, nitrofurantoin) and triazine pesticides (metamitron) with a low detection limit and high selectivity via dual emission “turn-off” luminescence quenching. 1 has also been successfully applied to the construction of portable test strips for the detection of antibiotics and pesticides. In addition, the mechanism of fluorescence quenching has also been further discussed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.ica.2024.121958,Anti-Bacterial Agents;Pesticides,NA,NA,dualemission lanthanide metalorganic framework as a luminescence sensor for nitrofuran antibiotics and pesticide detection

However, although many studies explored the impacts of ARs on small and mesocarnivores, none assessed the extent to which they could contaminate large carnivores in anthropized landscapes. We filled this gap by exploring spatiotemporal trends in grey wolf (Canis lupus) exposure to ARs in central and northern Italy, by subjecting a large sample of dead wolves (n = 186) to the LC-MS/MS method. Most wolves (n = 115/186, 61.8 %) tested positive for ARs (1 compound, n = 36; 2 compounds, n = 47; 3 compounds, n = 16; 4 or more compounds, n = 16). Bromadiolone, brodifacoum and difenacoum, were the most common compounds, with brodifacoum and bromadiolone being the ARs that co-occurred the most (n = 61). Both the probability of testing positive for multiple ARs and the concentration of brodifacoum, and bromadiolone in the liver, systematically increased in wolves that were found at more anthropized sites. Moreover, wolves became more likely to test positive for ARs through time, particularly after 2020. Our results underline that rodent control, based on ARs, increases the risks of unintentional poisoning of non-target wildlife. However, this risk does not only involve small and mesocarnivores, but also large carnivores at the top of the food chain, such as wolves. Therefore, rodent control is adding one further conservation threat to endangered large carnivores in anthropized landscapes of Europe, whose severity could increase over time and be far higher than previously thought. Large-scale monitoring schemes for ARs in European large carnivores should be devised as soon as possible. © 2024 The Authors",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.169990,Anticoagulants,38232835,NA,first evidence of widespread positivity to anticoagulant rodenticides in grey wolves canis lupus

Herein, a method was developed to test the extraction of 210 pesticides and their transformation products in small volume plasma samples (100 μL). Plasma samples were protein precipitated with 0.5 % formic acid in acetonitrile added to the sample (ratio of 3.5:1). Pass-through solid phase extraction was used for sample matrix and lipid removal and samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography and gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Recoveries of 70.0–129.8 % were achieved for 182 pesticides and degradates across the low (25 ng mL−1), medium (100 ng mL−1), and high (250 ng mL−1) spike levels. Method detection levels ranged 0.4–13.0 ng mL−1. Following development, the method was applied to smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) plasma samples (n = 10) collected from adults in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

The impacts of this pest are increasingly exacerbated by climate change. Traditional control strategies involving pesticides have had negative effects on public health and the environment. Instead, forest managers seek a more ecological and sustainable approach to management that promotes the natural actions of pest control agents. This study aims to evaluate the role of bats in suppressing pine processionary moths in pine forests and examine how the bat community composition and abundance influence pest consumption. Bats were sampled in the mountainous environment of the Serra da Estrela in central Portugal to collect faecal samples for DNA meta-barcoding analysis. We assessed the relationship between a) bat richness, b) bat relative abundance, c) bat diet richness, and the frequency of pine processionary moth consumption. Our findings indicate that sites with the highest bat species richness and abundance exhibit the highest levels of pine processionary moth consumption. The intensity of pine processionary moth consumption is independent of insect diversity within the site. The highest occurrence of pine processionary moth presence in bat diets is primarily observed in species that forage in cluttered habitats. A typical predator of pine processionary moths among bats is likely to be a forest-dwelling species that specialises in consuming Lepidoptera. These species primarily use short-range echolocation calls, which are relatively inaudible to tympanate moths, suitable for locating prey in cluttered environments, employing a gleaning hunting strategy. Examples include species from the genera Plecotus, Myotis, and Rhinolophus. This study enhances our understanding of the potential pest consumption services provided by bats in pine forests.

Drastic losses coincided with intense agriculture in sandy sub-catchments and precipitation. All lines of evidence pointed to a causal connection with subsurface discharge indicating that herbicide application might have caused the effects. Passive sampling was applied in 2022 to elucidate, whether herbicides were really present at sites of losses and if so, in ecotoxicological relevant concentrations. Samplers were exposed on top of lake sediments in 2 m depth and under worst case conditions, i.e., at sites, known for losses of the whole functional group of SUM and at the beginning of the vegetation period. At this time, SUM diaspores were most vulnerable to repression of development and the subsurface discharge was high in the same instance. The potential ecotoxicological relevance of detected herbicide concentrations was assessed with a toxic units (TU) approach, with reference to acute effect concentrations (EC50 of green algae, 72 h, growth). The TU ranged from 0.001 to 0.03. Most concentrations exceeded the threshold of relevance set by an assessment factor of 1000, i.e., TU > 0.001. Locally applied herbicides acted by suppressing developmental stages, and the sum of TU exceeded 0.02 at all sites, mainly due to diflufenican. Not applied locally, terbuthylazine and its relevant metabolites, including terbutryn, acted by inhibiting photosynthesis, and the sum of TU reached 0.005. On this base, diflufenican was assessed to be likely a main stressor, all other detected herbicides to be potentially relevant. Uncertainties and knowledge gaps were specified. The result of the chemical risk assessment was counterchecked for consistence with biological monitoring data within a whole lake perspective. Concepts of empirical and advanced causal attribution methodology were applied to get a grip to the ecological causal field and to protection. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169083,,38056643,NA,passive sampling of herbicides above sediments at sites with losses of submerged macrophytes in a mesotrophic lake

Toxic chemicals are not constrained to their source of origin as they cross ecosystem boundaries via biotic (e.g., animal migration) and abiotic (e.g., water flow) vectors. Meta-ecology has led to important insights on how spatial flows or subsidies of matter across ecosystem boundaries can have broad impacts on local and regional ecosystem dynamics but has not yet addressed the dynamics of pollutants in recipient ecosystems. Incorporating meta-ecosystem processes (i.e., flux of materials across ecosystem boundaries) into contaminant dynamics can elucidate how contaminants may reverberate among local food chains. Here, we derive a modeling framework to predict how spatial ecosystem fluxes can influence contaminant dynamics and how this influence is dependent on the type of ecosystem flux (e.g., herbivore movement vs. abiotic chemical flows). We mix an analytical and numerical approach to analyze our integrative model which couples two subcomponents that have previously been studied independently of each other—an ecosystem model and a contaminant model. We observe an array of dynamics for how chemical concentrations change with increasing nutrient input and loss rate across trophic levels. When we tailor our range of chemical parameter values (e.g., environmental uptake of contaminant and assimilation efficiency of the contaminant) to specific organic chemicals, our results demonstrate that increasing nutrient input rates can lead to trophic dilution in pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls across trophic levels. However, increasing nutrient loss rate causes an increase in the concentrations of chemicals across all trophic levels. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that nutrient recycling is an important ecosystem process impacting contaminant concentrations, generating predictions to be addressed by future empirical studies. Importantly, our model demonstrates the utility of our framework for identifying drivers of contaminant dynamics in connected ecosystems including the importance that (1) ecosystem processes and (2) movement, especially movement of lower trophic levels, have on contaminant concentrations. © 2024 The Authors.

Repeated applications over time can lead to accumulation of residues in soil, water, and food and may have negative impacts on non-target organisms. However, the effects of herbicide residues on interspecific relationships, such as host-pathogen interactions, are poorly studied. In this study, we evaluated the effects of two different concentrations of a commercial pendimethalin-based formulation (PND), the residual contamination (S, 13 ppm) in treated soils and the maximum residue level allowed by the European Commission in cereals (EU, 0.05 ppm). We tested the effect of PND on the biological interaction between the mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus, 1758 and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana Vuillemin, 1912 (Bb, strain KVL 03–144) at two concentrations (LC50 5 × 105 conidia mL−1 and LC100 1 × 107 conidia mL−1). We checked the survival of beetles exposed to PND or/and inoculated with B. bassiana, the expression of four antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and finally how PND affects in vitro germination of fungus. The exposure to PND had no significant effects on the survival of either control or Bb-exposed beetles. In the mealworm beetle, upregulation of gene expression of the inducible AMPs Tenecin 1, 2, and 4 was observed in PND-treated beetles after inoculation with Bb, while the levels of the non-inducible AMP Tenecin 3 were similar between treatments. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that admitted residual doses of currently used herbicides modify an important component of the inducible immune response of an insect. This did not translate into an effect on the survival to B. bassiana in our system. However, residual doses of the herbicide at 13 ppm may temporarily affect fungal germination.

Moreover, pesticide applications, kill a broad range of natural enemies and pollinators, resulting in pest outbreaks of pesticide resistant phytophagous species and a worldwide shrinking of the pollinators’ populations. Natural pesticides called phytochemicals, are considered environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional pesticides, presenting lower risk to animals and humans. To minimize the environmental impact and the disruption of the species interactions, the potential lethal and sublethal effects of phytochemicals on beneficial arthropods must be evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of five phytochemical pesticides (Requiem®, Eradicoat®, Prev-Am®, FLiPPER®, BPA044I), on two predatory mites, two predatory insects and one pollinator, which are all important components of current integrated pest management (IPM) programs. The lethal and sublethal effects of the phytochemicals were evaluated on the phytoseiid mites (Acari, Phytoseiidae), Phytoseiulus persimilis (Evans), and Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot), as well as the predatory insects Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) (Heteroptera: Miridae) and Orius laevigatus (Fieber) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae). Also, the lethal effects were evaluated on the pollinator Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) which is used in greenhouse pollination. We evaluated the acute toxicity of the phytochemicals on adult arthropods and the effects on the predator fecundity, when exposed directly and indirectly through residues. Requiem® and BPA044I were harmless or slightly harmful to the mite and insect predators (toxicity <49%), nor did they affect their fertility, according to the IOBC classification. Eradicoat® was harmless to N. tenuis, but it had moderate toxicity to mites and O. laevigatus (<50%). Prev-Am® had high toxicity (>50%) on mites and low on insects, while FLiPPER® was moderately to highly toxic to all predators. The tested phytochemical products exhibited very low toxicity on the pollinator B. terrestris, with either oral or topical exposure and very high repellency. Overall, the evaluation of natural pesticide effects on biocontrol agents and pollinators is crucial for implementing successful IPM strategies. © 2023",,10.1016/j.cropro.2023.106381,,NA,NA,effects of novel and commercial phytochemicals on beneficial arthropods

This was constructed by synthesis of polyaniline (PA) and polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSS) modified biochar (BC) nanoparticle composite (PA-PSS-BC) and coating them on screen printed electrode as conductive and electrochemically active layer, and covalently immobilizing anti-atrazine antibody on electrode for specific target binding. The low cost biochar from sugarcane was highly conductive and favorable for attaching PA and PSS due to large surface area and sp2 carbon structure. Crediting to dopant PSS, PA-PSS-BC achieved significant enhancement of redox current signal even in phosphate buffered saline of neutral pH compared to that of without PSS. And redox current of PA was extremely stable with negligible signal change even after twenty cycles repeated reactions owning to protection by BC. These essentially ensured sensing platform being sensitively performed in neutral solution with exemption of adding external redox reagent. As a result, fairly low concentrations of atrazine could be detected within 5 min, with limit of detection being 0.407 ng/L in a dynamic detection range varying from 1 to 100 ng/L. Moreover, the immunosensor exhibited reasonable signal recoveries for detecting trace leveled atrazine in real water samples, high selectivity, and good stability with dry and cold storage. © 2023",,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.143198,Sulfones;Sulfonic Acids,NA,NA,polyaniline and polystyrene sulfonic acid modified on conductive biochar nanoparticle with strong signal enhancement for trace atrazine detection

However, chemical insecticides have been shown to be harmful also to beneficial insects and many other organisms like vertebrates. Thus, there is a need to replace those chemical insecticides by other control methods in order to protect the environment. Insect pest pathogens, like bacteria, viruses or fungi, are interesting alternatives for production of microbial-based insecticides to replace the use of chemical products in agriculture. Organic farming, which does not use chemical pesticides for pest control, relies on integrated pest management techniques and in the use of microbial-based insecticides for pest control. Microbial-based insecticides require precise formulation and extensive monitoring of insect pests, since they are highly specific for certain insect pests and in general are more effective for larval young instars.

Of particular interest is the influence of retired cropland on agricultural pests and pesticides, as these uncultivated lands may directly shift the distribution of pesticide use and may serve as a source of pests and/or natural enemies for remaining active croplands. Few studies have investigated how agricultural pesticide use is impacted by land retirement. Here we couple field-level crop and pesticide data from over 200,000 field-year observations and 15 years of production in Kern County, CA, USA to investigate: 1) how much pesticide use and applied toxicity are avoided annually due to the direct effects of retirement, 2) whether surrounding retirement drives pesticide use on active cropland and what types of pesticides are most influenced, and 3) whether the effect of surrounding retirement on pesticide use is dependent on the age or revegetation cover on retired parcels. Our results suggest about 100 kha are idle in any given year, which equates to about 1.3-3 M kg of pesticide active ingredients foregone. We also find retired lands lead to a small increase in total pesticide use on nearby active lands even after controlling for a combination of crop-, farmer-, region- and year-specific heterogeneity. More specifically, the results suggest a 10 % increase in retired lands nearby results in about a 0.6 % increase in pesticides, with the effect sizes increasing as a function of the duration of continuous fallowing, but decreasing or even reversing sign at high levels of revegetation cover. Our results suggest increasingly prevalent agricultural land retirement can shift the distribution of pesticides based on what crops are retired and what active crops remain nearby. © 2023",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165224,Pesticides;Retirement,37392893,NA,the effect of agricultural land retirement on pesticide use

However, their use in agriculture remains limited by their rapid degradation, limited duration of effect and non-target toxicity. These issues largely result from the under-optimized methods currently used to formulate EOs, in which their volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are poorly protected. In this study we compared pure Artemisia and Rosemary EOs to EOs formulated in three, low-cost, relatively simple, and easily applicable manners: as nanoemulsions, atomized powders, and Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NaDES). 24 hours after formulation, the entomotoxicity and phytotoxicity of the EOs were tested on Bemisia tabaci infested tomato plants. The identity and relative abundance of VOCs present in all formulations were also assessed 24 hours post-preparation using GC-MS and GC-FID. Nanoemulsions proved the most entomotoxic of formulations, followed by NaDES and pure EOs, while atomized powders were not significantly more entomotoxic than the control. Entomotoxicity was coupled with phytotoxicity for all formulations, except NaDES which induced particularly high rates of B. tabaci mortality when prepared with Rosemary EO, in addition to reducing damages on treated plants. Total VOC abundance depended on VOC release kinetics, determined by formulation, which although higher for pure EOs, was more gradual for NaDES. These results show the importance of EO formulation and the potential for NaDES to provide effective, sustained pest control. © 2023 The Authors",,10.1016/j.indcrop.2023.117006,"Oils, Volatile",NA,NA,effects of essential oilbased formulation on biopesticide activity

However, there is a scarcity of literature concerning human exposure to pesticides through the consumption of contaminated drinking water. This study investigates the levels of multiple pesticides in drinking water and their subsequent carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk in five selected districts (Peshawar basin) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-Pakistan, to understand the exact scenario of pesticide toxicity in the sources of drinking water. The water samples were extracted by liquid–liquid extraction and analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS). Results obtained indicated that the detected concentrations of ∑21 pesticides ranged between 0 and 883.7 µg L−1 in the study area. The highest concentration was detected for methiocarb (mean 5.30 µg L−1), followed by acetamiprid (0.90 µg L−1), while the lowest was observed for cyhalothrin (0.01 µg L−1). The highest concentration of EU Watch List of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (methiocarb and acetamiprid) in the study area is alarming. Most of the pesticide residues recorded in the water samples exceeded the maximum residue limits except for dieldrin and cyhalothrin. Whereas, the residues of aldicarb, carbofuran deg, carbofuran, atrazine, alpha endosulfan, beta endosulfan, cypermethrin-1, difenoconazol-I and difenoconazol-II were not observed in any of the collected samples.

Herein, an environment-friendly formulation of insecticide chlorantraniliprole (CAP) was fabricated through a simple approach of coprecipitation-based synchronous encapsulation by chitosan (CTS), with carrier–pesticide interaction mechanism and release behavior investigated. RESULTS: The resulting CAP/CTS controlled-release formulation (CCF) showed a good loading content of 28.1% and a high encapsulation efficiency of 75.6%. Instrument determination in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations displayed that the primary interactions between CAP and CTS were physical adsorption and complicated hydrogen (H)-bonds, which formed dominantly between N-H in amides [or nitrogen (N) in ring structures] of CAP and hydroxyl (or amino) groups of CTS, as well as oxygen (O) in CAP with hydrogen in CTS or H2O molecules. The in vitro release tests exhibited obvious pH/temperature sensitivity, with release dynamics following the first-order or Ritger–Peppas model. As the temperature increased, the CAP release process of the Ritger–Peppas model changed from Case-II to anomalous transport, and ultimately to a Fickian diffusion mechanism. The control effect against Plutella xylostella larvae also was evaluated by toxicity tests, where comparable efficacy of CCF to the commercial suspension concentrate was obtained. CONCLUSION: The innovative, easy-to-prepare CCF can be used as a formulation with obvious pH/temperature sensitivity and good efficacy on target pests.

Water supplies are getting contaminated due to the growing human population and its associated industrialization, urbanization, and chemically improved agriculture. Currently, a large number of people struggle to find clean drinking water, a problem that is particularly serious in developing countries. To meet the enormous demand of clean water around the world, there is an urgent need of advanced technologies and materials that are affordable, easy to use, thermally efficient, portable, environmentally benign, and chemically durable. Physical, chemical and biological methods are used to eliminate insoluble materials and soluble pollutants from wastewater. In addition to cost, each treatment carries its limitations in terms of effectiveness, productivity, environmental effect, sludge generation, pre-treatment demands, operating difficulties, and the creation of potentially hazardous byproducts. To overcome the problems of traditional methods, porous polymers have distinguished themselves as practical and efficient materials for the treatment of wastewater because of their distinctive characteristics such as large surface area, chemical versatility, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. This study overviews improvement in manufacturing methods and the sustainable usage of porous polymers for wastewater treatment and explicitly discusses the efficiency of advanced porous polymeric materials for the removal of emerging pollutants viz. pesticides, dyes, and pharmaceuticals whereby adsorption and photocatalytic degradation are considered to be among the most promising methods for their effective removal. Porous polymers are considered excellent adsorbents for the mitigation of these pollutants as they are cost-effective and have greater porosities to facilitate penetration and adhesion of pollutants, thus enhance their adsorption functionality. Appropriately functionalized porous polymers can offer the potential to eliminate hazardous chemicals and making water useful for a variety of purposes thus, numerous types of porous polymers have been selected, discussed and compared especially in terms of their efficiencies against specific pollutants.

Recent studies have proposed an effect of chemical stressors on an organism's isotope signature, questioning the use of SIA in food webs impacted by toxicants. Against this background, the present study investigates 1) whether trophic enrichment factors (TEFs; i.e., the offset in stable isotope signatures of a consumer to its diet) are altered by the neonicotinoid thiacloprid, and 2) whether tracking toxicant effects on an organism's diet composition (i.e., indirect effect) with SIA fits direct observations of consumption. To address the former, the amphipod Gammarus fossarum (Koch) was exposed to three levels (0, 0.75, and 5 µg L–1) of thiacloprid and fed with either black alder leaves or Baetis rhodani (Pictet) larvae over 6 weeks (n = 35). The thiacloprid-induced changes in TEFs that we found were statistically significant but small compared with other factors (e.g., resource quality, consumer, and physiological condition) and thus likely of minor importance. To address the latter issue, gammarids were exposed to two levels of thiacloprid (0 and 0.75 µg L–1) and fed with either black alder leaves, live B. rhodani larvae, or both over 2 weeks (n = 10). Dietary proportions as suggested by SIA were indeed in agreement with those derived from direct observation of consumption. The present study consequently suggests that SIA is as a robust tool to detect indirect toxicant effects especially if TEFs are assessed in parallel.

Though population-level variation in pesticide tolerance is commonly observed in host taxa, few studies have assessed population-level differences in the tolerance of parasites to different contaminants. We investigated population-level variation in insecticide tolerance of three Echinostoma trivolvis life stages (egg, miracidium, and cercaria) to three insecticides (carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, and diazinon). We tested two relevant metrics of insecticide tolerance—baseline and induced—across up to eight different parasite populations per life stage. Across all life stages, the insecticide treatments tended to reduce survival, but the magnitude of their effects often varied significantly among populations. Surprisingly, we found that exposure to chlorpyrifos increased the hatching success of echinostome eggs relative to the control treatment in three of six tested populations. We also found that cercariae shed from snails previously exposed to a sublethal concentration of chlorpyrifos had a significantly lower mortality rate when subsequently exposed to a lethal concentration of chlorpyrifos relative to individuals from snails that were not previously exposed; this suggests inducible tolerance in cercariae. We found no evidence that insecticide tolerance is correlated across parasite life stages within a population. Together the findings of our study demonstrate that single-population toxicity assays may greatly over- or underestimate the effects of pesticides on the survival of free-living parasite stages, insecticide tolerance levels may not be predictable from one parasite life stage to the next, and insecticides can have both expected and counterintuitive effects on non-target taxa. © 2023",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106626,Insecticides,37437313,NA,populationlevel variation in insecticide tolerance across three life stages of the trematode echinostoma trivolvis

Each commonly utilised pesticide possesses different uses. For instance, fungicides control fungal issues, herbicides curb weed growth, and insecticides destroy and repel insects. Although several ways to categorise them exist, pesticides are typically classified according to their chemical compositions. Rice production remains one of the most dominant crops grown in most Southeast Asian countries as it is a staple food. Nonetheless, the crop is highly dependent on pesticides, leading to growing concerns over the potential adverse effects of pesticides on the environment and human health. Despite the availability of numerous studies on the subject, a comprehensive understanding of the specific effects of pesticides on paddy fields in Southeast Asia is still lacking. Consequently, reviewing existing knowledge is necessary for synthesising and identifying research gaps to better inform policymakers, farmers, and other stakeholders in the agricultural sector. The objectives of the present review paper were to review the interactions between pesticides and the environment by understanding the physical and chemical properties of the chemicals, compare pesticide transportation modes in air, water, and soil and how they affect the environment, and evaluate and discuss the effects of pesticides on non-targeted organisms. This study assessed pesticide innovation reported between 1945 and 2021 for a better understanding of the utilisation of the chemicals over time. The pesticides assessed in this study were classified based on their chemical compounds, such as organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroid.

Propylea japonica (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is an abundant and widespread ladybeetle in agricultural fields in Asia. Both larvae and adults of P. japonica are likely to be exposed to insecticide residue in the field during their predatory activity. Sulfoxaflor is a highly powerful insecticide that has strong efficacy in controlling sap-sucking pests. To date, there have been several studies on the acute and long-term toxicity of sulfoxaflor to insects, but few studies have reported the impact of sulfoxaflor on the predators’ micro-ecosystems. This study was to determine the impact of sulfoxaflor on the symbiotic bacteria and developmental performance of P. japonica. In the present study, two concentrations (1 mg/L and 5 mg/L) and two exposure periods (1 day and 5 days) were set for P. japonica under sulfoxaflor exposure. The survival rate, developmental duration, pupation rate, emergence rate, and body weight of P. japonica were examined. Moreover, the bacterial community of P. japonica was investigated by high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Our results indicated that bacterial community of P. japonica was mainly composed of Staphylococcus, Pantoea, Acinetobacter, Rhodococcus, and Ralstonia at the genus level. The bacterial community of P. japonica in 1 mg/L and 5 mg/L sulfoxaflor groups was significantly altered on day 1, compared with that in control group. The results also showed that the larval duration was significantly prolonged but the pupal duration was significantly shortened in both sulfoxaflor groups. Meanwhile, the pupation and emergence rate was not significantly changed, but the body weights of adults were significantly decreased in both sulfoxaflor groups. Our study will provide a new perspective for evaluating the safety of pesticides to beneficial arthropods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s00248-022-02122-5,,36242623,NA,impact of sulfoxaflor exposure on bacterial community and developmental performance of the predatory ladybeetle propylea japonica

Numerous studies have suggested that nanopesticides could soon fully replace conventional pesticides since they are far more effective than those now in use. Due to an increase in their surface-to-volume ratio, nanomaterials exhibit different properties from their bulk counterparts. Nanopesticides are pesticides that have been made with these nanoparticles and have a high application efficiency and significantly fewer hazardous environmental impacts than pesticides that have been made chemically. Various formulation strategies, which include the containment of the active substance by the nanoparticles, have previously been established, exhibiting promising effects on the pests. Target specificity, high stability, and controlled active ingredients (AIs) release are a few of the noteworthy qualities these nanopesticides offer. The development of green nanopesticides derived from nature, which have very low ecotoxicities and nanoscale qualities, can also have a significant positive impact on crop output. However, before being mass-produced and used, the discovery still has to be thoroughly examined to determine its effects on people and the environment due to the lack of conclusive proof demonstrating its toxicity. This paper aims to represent the use of nanopesticides in crop protection and a detailed overview of the various methods for the formulation of nanopesticides. Also, the possible negative impacts on the non-target species by the application of nanopesticides have been briefly discussed. The need for the development of green nanopesticides to avoid the negative aspects of nanopesticides has also been highlighted. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",,10.1002/slct.202300756,,NA,NA,nanopesticides a review on current research and future perspective

In this study, the degradation kinetics, pathways, and aquatic toxicity of the new fused heterocyclic insecticide pyraquinil in water under different conditions were investigated for the first time. Pyraquinil was classified as an easily degradable pesticide in natural water, and hydrolyzes faster in alkaline conditions and at higher temperatures. The formation trends of the main transformation products (TPs) of pyraquinil were also quantified. Fifteen TPs were identified in water using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Orbitrap-HRMS) and Compound Discoverer software, which adopted suspect and nontarget screening strategies. Among them, twelve TPs were reported for the first time and 11 TPs were confirmed by synthesis of their standards. The proposed degradation pathways have demonstrated that the 4,5-dihydropyrazolo[1,5-a]quinazoline skeleton of pyraquinil is stable enough to retain in its TPs. ECOSAR prediction and laboratory tests showed that pyraquinil was “very toxic” or “toxic” to aquatic organisms, while the toxicities of all of the TPs are substantially lower than that of pyraquinil except for TP484, which was predicted to pose a higher toxicity.

Most nations lack the capacity to control pesticide contamination and have limited availability of pesticide use information. Ecuador is a country with intense pesticide use with high exposure risks to humans and the environment, although relative or combined risks are not well understood. Here, we analyzed the distribution of application rates in Ecuador and identified regions of concern because of high potential exposure. We used a geospatial analysis to identify grid cells (∼8 km × 8 km) where the highest pesticide application rates and density of human populations overlap. Furthermore, we identified other regions of concern based on the number of amphibian species as an indicator of ecosystem integrity and the location of natural protected areas. We found that 28% of Ecuador's population dwelled in areas with high pesticide application rate. We identified an area of ∼512 km2 in the Amazon region where high application rates, large human settlements, and a high number of amphibian species overlapped. Additionally, we distinguished clusters of pesticide application rates and human populations that intersected with natural protected areas. Ecuador exemplifies how pesticides are disproportionately applied in areas with the potential to affect human health and ecosystems' integrity. Global estimates of population dwelling, pesticide application rates, and environmental factors are key in prioritizing locations to conduct further exposure assessments.

The maize weevil contributes up to 40% of total food-grain losses during storage, mainly in developing countries. Current synthetic pesticides are ineffective, and, moreover, they raise serious environmental safety concerns as well as consumer health hazards. Drawing from past oversights and current environmental realities and projections, the global population has been switching to green living by developing sustainable strategies. In our context, these new greener strategies include the utilization of medicinal plants to control maize weevil infestation, which unlocks unlimited innovative possibilities, and, thus, improves the yield, quality, and safety of maize. Medicinal plants are less toxic, easily biodegradable, and capable of protecting grain from pests.

We assessed independent and combined effects of two agricultural herbicides and the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) on the growth, development and survival of larval American toads (Anaxyrus americanus). Wild-caught tadpoles were exposed to four concentrations of atrazine (0.18, 1.8, 18.0, 180 μg/L) or glyphosate (7, 70, 700, 7000 µg a.e./L), respectively contained in Aatrex® Liquid 480 (Syngenta) or Vision® Silviculture Herbicide (Monsanto) for 14 days, followed by two doses of Bd. At day 14, atrazine had not affected survival, but it non-monotonically affected growth. Exposure to the highest concentration of glyphosate caused 100% mortality within 4 days, while lower doses had an increasing monotonic effect on growth. At day 65, tadpole survival was unaffected by atrazine and the lower doses of glyphosate. Neither herbicide demonstrated an interaction effect with Bd on survival, but exposure to Bd increased survival among both herbicide-exposed and herbicide-control tadpoles. At day 60, tadpoles exposed to the highest concentration of atrazine remained smaller than controls, indicating longer-term effects of atrazine on growth, but effects of glyphosate on growth disappeared. Growth was unaffected by any herbicide-fungal interaction but was positively affected by exposure to Bd following exposure to atrazine. Atrazine exhibited a slowing and non-monotonic effect on Gosner developmental stage, while exposure to Bd tended to speed up development and act antagonistically toward the observed effect of atrazine. Overall, atrazine, glyphosate and Bd all showed a potential to modulate larval toad growth and development. © 2023",,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.115021,Fungi,37216860,NA,effects of herbicides and the chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on the growth development and survival of larval american toads anaxyrus americanus

The screening revealed at least one potential adverse consequence for each herbicide class assigned according to their mode of action on weeds. The classes with most toxic warnings were K1, K3/N, F1 and E. The selection of 11 commercial herbicides for in vitro biological tests on human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), the enzymes involved in neurotoxicity and detoxification of various xenobiotics, respectively, was based mainly on the structural similarity with inhibitors of cholinesterases. Organophosphate anilofos and oxyacetanilide flufenacet were the most potent inhibitors of AChE (25 μM) and BChE (6.4 μM), respectively. Glyphosate, oxadiazon, tembotrione and terbuthylazine were poor inhibitors with an estimated IC50 above 100 μM, while for glyphosate the IC50 was above 1 mM. Generally, all of the selected herbicides inhibited with a slight preference towards BChE. Cytotoxicity assays showed that anilofos, bensulide, butamifos, piperophos and oxadiazon were cytotoxic for hepatocytes (HepG2) and neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y).

Production has been exemplified in both stable transgenic plants and using transient expression strategies. In particular, species of Nicotiana have been engineered to produce a range of useful molecules, including insect sex pheromones, which are valued for species-specific control of agricultural pests. To date, most studies have relied on strong constitutive expression of all pathway genes. However, work in microbes has demonstrated that yields can be improved by controlling and balancing gene expression. Synthetic regulatory elements that provide control over the timing and levels of gene expression are therefore useful for maximizing yields from heterologous biosynthetic pathways. In this study, we demonstrate the use of pathway engineering and synthetic genetic elements for controlling the timing and levels of production of Lepidopteran sex pheromones in Nicotiana benthamiana. We demonstrate that copper can be used as a low-cost molecule for tightly regulated inducible expression. Further, we show how construct architecture influences relative gene expression and, consequently, product yields in multigene constructs. We compare a number of synthetic orthogonal regulatory elements and demonstrate maximal yields from constructs in which expression is mediated by dCas9-based synthetic transcriptional activators.

As an important economic and model insect of Lepidoptera, Bombyx mori was extremely sensitive to λ-cyh, and pesticide drift often leads to silkworm poisoning. However, little is known about the persistence of sublethal effects or the potential recovery from short-term exposure to sublethal doses of pesticides. In this study, we estimated the sublethal effects caused by short-term exposure (24 h) of λ-cyh LC1, LC10, LC25, and LC50, respectively, and investigated the persistent negative effects on the growth, survival, and pupal metamorphosis of silkworm larvae. Silkworm growth was mostly retarded after λ-cyh exposure, with dose-dependent recovery observed at delayed time points. Relative to the control, the treatment groups showed significantly higher larval mortalities and abnormal pupa rates. Additionally, transcriptome sequencing was conducted to investigate the effects of λ-cyh LC10 on the normal physiological functions in the midgut of B. mori. A total of 2697 differentially expressed genes were identified, and 57.1% of DEGs were down-regulated. Gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analysis further revealed that energy and nutrient metabolisms were negatively affected. Moreover, we demonstrated that sublethal λ-cyh inhibited the oxidative phosphorylation pathway by reducing the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex genes and consequently the synthesis of ATP.

However, the interaction between pesticides and Saccharomyces cerevisiae is still poorly understood. Herein, the fate, distribution and interaction effect with Saccharomyces cerevisiae of five commonly-used pesticides during the wine-making process were evaluated. The five pesticides exerted varied inhibition on the proliferation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the order of inhibition intensity was difenoconazole &gt; tebuconazole &gt; pyraclostrobin &gt; azoxystrobin &gt; thiamethoxam. Compared with the other three pesticides, triazole fungicides difenoconazole and tebuconazole showed stronger inhibition and played a major role in binary exposure. The mode of action, lipophilicity and exposure concentration were important factors in the inhibition of pesticides. Saccharomyces cerevisiae had no obvious impacts on the degradation of target pesticides in the simulated fermentation experiment. However, the levels of target pesticides and their metabolite were significantly reduced during the wine-making process, with the processing factors ranged from 0.030 to 0.236 (or 0.032 to 0.257) during spontaneous (or inoculated) wine-making process.

Chemical analyses were performed using inductively coupled plasma tandem mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS) supported by unsupervised pattern recognition techniques. Physiological parameters such as cuticle melanization, cellular (circulating hemocytes), and humoral (phenoloxidase enzyme activity) immune responses and mass loss were tested as exposure markers in both sexes. The results showed that NPK fertilizer application is the main cause of REE accumulation in beetles over time, besides toxic elements (Sr, Hg, Cr, Rb, Ba, Ni, Al, V, U) also present in the herbicide-treated beetles. The biomagnification of Cu and Zn suggested a high potential for food web transfer in agroecosystems.

As potential molecular tools in future agriculture 4.0, the photochromic pesticides are effective in optical control of receptors, ion channels, living behaviors, and enzymes, which displays an innovative way of pesticide discovery. In this review, we highlight the progresses of the photoisomerized insecticides and fungicides. By integrating photoswitches, such as azobenzenes and diarylethenes, into pesticide molecules, several PCLs were developed for optical regulation of important insect or fungi targets in vivo, including GABARs, RyRs, nAChRs, SURs, sodium channels, GluCls, and SDH. The results are highly significant in revealing interactions of agrochemicals with their targets, biological functions, and living behaviors, and provide powerful toolkits in understanding ligand-receptor interactions.

Intensive use of plant protection products is one key factor contributing to this decline. Especially the mixture of different plant protection products can pose an increased risk for pollinators as synergistic effects may occur. In this study we investigated the effect of the fungicide Cantus® Gold (boscalid/dimoxystrobin), the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan® (acetamiprid) and their mixture on honeybees. Since both plant protection products are frequently applied sequentially to the same plants (e.g. oilseed rape), their combination is a realistic scenario for honeybees. We investigated the mortality, the sucrose responsiveness and the differential olfactory learning performance of honeybees under controlled conditions in the laboratory to reduce environmental noise. Intact sucrose responsiveness and learning performance are of pivotal importance for the survival of individual honeybees as well as for the functioning of the entire colony. Treatment with two sublethal and field relevant concentrations of each plant protection product did not lead to any significant effects on these behaviors but affected the mortality rate. However, our study cannot exclude possible negative sublethal effects of these substances in higher concentrations.

L.G., Faure P.A., Welch K., Jr.",,,Elsevier B.V.,,"Bat populations are dwindling worldwide due to anthropogenic activities like agriculture, however the role that pesticide exposure plays on these declines is unclear. To address these research gaps, we first need to develop reliable methods to detect and monitor exposure to environmental pollutants and its effects on free-living bats. The use of biomarkers is a sensitive and informative tool to study sublethal effects in wildlife, however it requires laboratory validation and integrative approaches to be applicable to free-living species. In this study, we propose a set of non-destructive biomarkers to evaluate pesticide exposure in free-ranging bats and validated their suitability with dose-exposure experiments in captivity. We selected three biomarkers that have been widely used in vertebrate ecotoxicology and that combined represent sensitive, specific, and ecologically relevant responses to pollutants: DNA damage, AChE activity, and leukocyte profiles. We used two insectivorous bat species as model species Eptesicus fuscus (laboratory) and Pteronotus mexicanus (field). We found that micronuclei frequency (genotoxicity) and AChE activity (exposure and neurotoxicity) were robust indicators of toxicant exposure. The validity of this set of endpoints was supported by their consistent performance in laboratory and field experiments as well as by the significant correlation among them. Leukocyte profile (systemic stress) results were not consistent between laboratory and field studies, suggesting further evaluation of its suitability is needed. Integrative approaches, like the one we used here, maximize the insights about toxicant effects by combining the information of single biomarkers into more meaningful inferences, which can be applied to environmental risk assessments in wildlife. Furthermore, the use of non-destructive, cost-effective biomarkers is imperative when assessing toxicant exposure and effects in vulnerable wildlife and it should be a priority in the field of wildlife toxicology. © 2023",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162011,Pesticides,36737017,NA,nondestructive methods to assess pesticide exposure in freeliving bats

Further, they are reported to be rapidly excreted and metabolized, reducing their potential toxicity. Nevertheless, growing evidence of adverse effects of neonics on farmland bird species raise questions about the purported harmless nature of these pesticides. We attempted to search for pesticide residues in species of different trophic levels and at different life stages, by using multiple bird monitoring programs on a Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) platform. Three passerine birds—the blackbird (Turdus merula), cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus), and common nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos)—that feed on seeds and invertebrates were monitored during their reproductive period, and the grey partridge (Perdix perdix) that feeds on seeds was monitored during its wintering period. We also monitored chicks of an apex predator—the Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus)—that preys mostly upon common voles but also upon insects. We found that the birds' blood samples showed presence of residues of five neonics: three banned since 2018 in France—clothianidin, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam—and two—dinotefuran and nitenpyram—used for veterinary purposes only. While none of these neonics was detected in blackbirds, all were present in grey partridges. Clothianidin was detected in all species, except blackbirds. Concentrations of the three banned neonics were similar or higher than concentrations found in birds monitored elsewhere before the ban. These findings raise questions about the persistence of neonics within the environment and the mode of exposure to wild fauna.

Here we investigate how an emerging concern of modern human activity, pharmaceutical pollution, influences the spread of disease in a population, using the water flea Daphnia magna and the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa as a model system. We found that exposure to different concentrations of fluoxetine - a widely prescribed psychoactive drug and widespread contaminant of aquatic ecosystems - affected the severity of disease experienced by an individual in a non-monotonic manner. The direction and magnitude of any effect, however, varied with both the infection outcome measured and the genotype of the pathogen. By contrast, the characteristics of unexposed animals, and thus the growth and density of susceptible hosts, were robust to fluoxetine. Using our data to parameterize an epidemiological model, we show that fluoxetine is unlikely to lead to a net increase or decrease in the likelihood of an infectious disease outbreak, as measured by a pathogen's transmission rate or basic reproductive number. Instead, any given pathogen genotype may experience a twofold change in likely fitness, but often in opposing directions.

Using the MethylRAD method, this study investigates whether exposure to pesticide contamination in natural populations of the endemic mayfly A. torrens produces genome wide changes in levels of DNA methylation. From a total of 1,377,147 MethylRAD markers produced from 285 specimens collected at 30 different study sites along the Limarí watershed of north-central Chile, six showed significant differential methylation between populations exposed and unexposed to pesticides. In all cases the effect of pesticides was positive, independent and stronger than the effects detected for other spatial and environmental factors. Only one candidate marker appeared correlated significantly with additional variables, nitrate and calcium levels, which also reflects the impact of agrichemicals and could additionally suggest, to a lower extent, antagonistic effects of mineral salts concentration for this specific marker. These results suggest that the effect of pesticide exposure on methylation levels is apparent at these six MethylRAD markers in A. torrens populations. Such data is challenging to obtain in natural populations and is, for the most part, lacking in ecotoxicological studies.

In microcosms, gammarids were exposed for 72 h to 12 herbicides individually (quinmerac, mesotrione, bentazone, isoproturon, chlortoluron, metazachlor, chloridazone, diflufenican, flufenacet, aclonifen, prosulfocarb and metolachlor) at a field-realistic concentration (i.e. 10 μg/L). The sublethal effects were assessed by monitoring several biochemical, physiological and behavioural traits. In exposed gammarids, alterations in behavioural activities were observed, i.e. increased locomotion and respiration as a general trend. Moreover, biochemical biomarkers suggested herbicide-dependent disruptions in moulting, antioxidant responses and cell integrity. Integrating multi-metric variations through statistical analyses allowed us to identify herbicide clusters likely to trigger common sets of biological responses. Depressed antioxidant defence at the cell level and impaired respiration at the individual level were the predominant toxic effects of herbicides, related to their hydrophobic feature. Furthermore, establishing relationships between sublethal alterations in gammarids and acute lethality or chronic toxicity values defined for regulatory purposes supports the relevance of these alterations as early warnings of toxicity.

A screening-level assessment of their potential for biological effects was conducted by computing toxicity quotients (TQs) for chemicals with available US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Aquatic Life Benchmark values. In addition, exposure activity ratios (EAR) were calculated using information from the USEPA ToxCast database. Between 16 and 81 chemicals were detected per site, with 97 unique compounds detected overall, for which 64 could be assessed using TQs or EARs. Ten chemicals exceeded TQ or EAR levels of concern at two or more sites. Chemicals exceeding thresholds included seven herbicides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, diuron, metolachlor, acetochlor, atrazine, simazine, and sulfentrazone), a transformation product (deisopropylatrazine), and two insecticides (fipronil and imidacloprid). Watersheds draining agricultural and urban areas had more detections and higher concentrations of pesticides compared with other land uses. Chemical mixtures analysis for ToxCast assays associated with common modes of action defined by gene targets and adverse outcome pathways (AOP) indicated potential activity on biological pathways related to a range of cellular processes, including xenobiotic metabolism, extracellular signaling, endocrine function, and protection against oxidative stress. Use of gene ontology databases and the AOP knowledgebase within the R-package ToxMixtures highlighted the utility of ToxCast data for identifying and evaluating potential biological effects and adverse outcomes of chemicals and mixtures.

This study aimed to evaluate the health condition of bats from different food guilds captured in two areas with different land use profiles in Brazil and to compare data on the oxidant-antioxidant balance and histopathological changes due to different anthropogenic pressures. Bats were collected from a protected area in Serra do Cipó National Park (SCNP), MG, Brazil, and an area with intense agricultural activity in the municipality of Uberaba (UB), MG, Brazil. Despite the differences in land use and occupation between the studied areas, bats showed similar responses. However, the trophic guilds were affected differently. Frugivorous bats in both areas showed lower activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) and concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) than other guilds, which can be explained by the greater intake of antioxidants from the diet in addition to the lower production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Histopathological analysis of the livers revealed that the animals had a similar prevalence in the two areas, with some differences related to guilds. Compared with other bats, hematophagous bats from SCNP had a higher prevalence of steatosis and, together with frugivorous bats from Uberaba, had higher frequencies of ballooning degeneration, suggesting that these animals are subjected to anthropogenic factors capable of inducing disturbances in hepatic metabolism. Hematophagous bats from Uberaba had a higher prevalence of portal inflammation, while insectivorous bats from Uberaba had a higher prevalence of lobular and portal inflammation. The profiles of use and occupation of the areas are different; Uberaba bats seem to face worse conditions because they show more liver damage owing to lipoperoxidation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159631,,36280059,NA,influence of landscape ecology and physiological implications in bats from different trophic guilds

Pesticide use estimation at field level is prone to error due to inconsistencies between ground-reporting and geospatial data coverage; attempts to rectify these inconsistencies have been limited in approach and rarely scaled to multiple crop types. We built upon a previously developed Bayesian approach to combine multiple crop types for a probabilistic determination of field-crop assignments and to examine co-occurrence of critical vernal pool habitats and bifenthrin application within a 5-county area in California (Madera, Merced, Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Stanislaus counties). We incorporated a multi-scale repeated sampling approach with an area constraint to improve the delineation of field boundaries and better capture variability in crop assignments and rotation schemes. After comparing the accuracy of the spatial probabilistic approach to USDA Census of Agriculture crop acreage data, we found our approach allows more specificity in the combination of crop types represented by the potential application area and improves acreage estimates when compared to traditional deterministic approaches. In addition, our multi-scale sampling scheme improved estimates of bifenthrin acreage variability for co-occurrence analysis and allowed for estimates of crop rotations that were previously uncaptured.

It enters water bodies primarily through drift from agricultural areas so that aquatic organisms are exposed to this chemical, especially after rain events. Glyphosate is advertised and sold as a highly specific herbicide, which interacts with the EPSP synthase, an enzyme of the shikimate metabolism, resulting in inhibition of the synthesis of vital aromatic amino acids. However, not only plants but also bacteria can possess this enzyme so that influences of glyphosate on the microbiomes of exposed organisms cannot be excluded. Those influences may result in subtle and long-term effects, e.g., disturbance of the symbiotic interactions of bionts with microorganisms of their microbiomes. Mechanisms how the transformation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) of glyphosate might interfere in this context have not understood so far. In the present study, molecular biological fingerprinting methods showed concentration-dependent effects of glyphosate and AMPA on fish microbiomes. In addition, age-dependent differences in the composition of the microbiomes regarding abundance and diversity were detected. Furthermore, the effect of exposure to glyphosate and AMPA was investigated for several fish pathogens of gut microbiomes in terms of their gene expression of virulence factors associated with pathogenicity. In vitro transcriptome analysis with the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri revealed that it is questionable whether the observed effect on the microbiome is caused by the intended mode of action of glyphosate, such as the inhibition of EPSP synthase activity.

Currently, only a few alternative control agents are available on the market, such as neem oil, the fungus Metarhizium sp., and the microsporidian Paranosema locustae. In this study, we improved the formulation of a botanical insecticide that is based on linseed oil and was found to be effective against the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. To make sure that linseed oil is most effective, we first tested several natural plant oils in a comparative laboratory study. Linseed oil performed best and resulted in 100% mortality within only 2 days after a single spray treatment. However, this linseed oil formulation contains three expensive essential oils, thus we further improved it to avoid costly essential oils. A much lower concentration of linseed oil was also found to be highly effective and killed adult S. gregaria within 3 days in an experiment performed under semifield conditions. Furthermore, a concentrated stock solution of this botanical insecticide was developed to increase stability and reduce shipping costs in areas where water for dilution is available. Mechanical treatment, applied during the preparation of this linseed oil emulsion, resulted in the formation of micro-colloids, which prevent the separation of phases and enable 1:16 dilution with water containing bicarbonate. Interestingly, only 24 h after single spray treatment, locusts became immobile and most of them were unable to jump, which would make them easy prey for natural enemies. Later, insects died due to the hardening of the linseed oil emulsion. This novel linseed oil emulsion is harmless for humans, rather easy to produce, and remains stable over weeks in its concentrated form, which suggests that it is promising alternative agent for locust control. © 2023 The Authors.

The survey found that the main phytochemicals prospected as insecticides belong to the following major chemical groups: terpenoids, terpenes, and carbonyl, all of which were tested, mainly against beetles (Coleoptera), caterpillars (i.e., larvae of Lepidoptera), and mosquitoes and other flies (i.e., Diptera). These studies are burgeoning at an exponential rate, with an evident focus on mortality endpoint estimates, but they are also neglecting sublethal assessments. China and India in Asia, as well as Brazil in the Americas, were responsible for most studies. The majority of the papers used stored grain insects as experimental models, which limits the applicability and representativeness of the findings. As a result, the main modes of exposure tested were fumigation and contact, which leads to the prevalence of estimates of lethal concentration in these studies. Therefore, a broader range of insect species deserves testing, with suitable modes of exposure identifying and characterizing the main molecules responsible for the insecticidal activity, which is seldom performed. Attention to these needs will circumvent current biases and allow the recognition of the main patterns of association between the origin and structure of phytochemicals and their insecticidal effects. © 2023 by the authors.",,10.3390/plants12020318,Bias (Epidemiology),NA,NA,research trends biases and gaps in phytochemicals as insecticides literature survey and metaanalysis

The ATTAC workflow brings together guidelines supporting both the data prime movers and re-users.

Consumers state that foods labeled as organic are nutritionally superior and safer than their conventionally produced equivalent. The research question for this systematic review is as follows: is there a difference between the effects of sustainable agriculture and conventional farming methods on rice grain end-use quality, healthfulness, and safety? The studies (n = 23) examined for this review suggest that organic production practices don’t influence most end-use quality (e.g., chalk, milling yield, pasting properties) and healthfulness (e.g., gamma-oryzanol fraction and tocols) traits studied, or if it does, it will be to a small degree. If differences in end-use quality traits are found, they will be associated with grain protein content, which varies along with the dose of nitrogen applied during rice growth. We conclude that the studies evaluated in this review found that organically produced rice grain was less likely to contain residues of the pesticides (e.g., organochlorine) examined in the study than the rice is grown using conventional methods. There was some evidence that organically grown rice is more likely to be contaminated with mycotoxin-producing fungi and some mycotoxins. Common shortcomings of the studies were that they were poorly designed, with limited to no details of the cultural management practices used to grow the rice studied, the length of time fields was under organic management not stated, cultivars were not named, and the data wasn’t analyzed statistically. © 2022 by the authors.",,10.3390/foods12010073,Oryza sativa;Cereals,NA,NA,organic rice production practices effects on grain enduse quality healthfulness and safety

A common approach for investigating population- or community-level impacts on bioindicators compares demographic parameter estimates (e.g., population size or density) between sites that were subjected to different levels of contamination. However, the traditional analytical method used in such studies is nonspatial capture-recapture, which results in conclusions about potential relationships between demographics and contaminants being inferred indirectly. Here, we extend this comparative approach to the spatially explicit framework, allowing direct estimation of said relationships and comparisons between study areas, by applying spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models to bioindicator (deer mice [Peromyscus spp.]) detection data from two study areas that were subjected to different industrial activities and remediation practices. Bioindicator density differed by 178% between the neighboring study areas, and the area with the highest soil concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, chromium, and zinc had the highest bioindicator density. Under the traditional nonspatial approach, we might have concluded that soil chemical levels had negligible influences on demographics. However, by modeling density as a spatial function of select chemical concentrations using SCR models, we found strong support for a positive relationship between density and soil chromium concentrations in one study area (β = 0.82), which was not masked by or associated with habitat-related metrics. To obtain reliable inferences about potential effects of environmental contamination on bioindicator demographics, we contend that a comparative spatially explicit approach using SCR ought to become standard. © 2022 The Authors",,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120541,,36336177,NA,comparative spatially explicit approach for testing effects of soil chemicals on terrestrial wildlife bioindicator demographics

The transcription of cytochrome P450 3A13 (CYP3A13) was upregulated 3–13 fold by PHE but suppressed by heat shock. The suppression by heat shock might contribute to the reduced detoxification of PHE during high-temperature exposure. In line with this, we found that the internal PHE concentration was approximately 70% higher in heat-shocked springtails than in animals kept at control temperature. In general, the transcription of genes encoding enzymes of detoxification phase Ⅱ (glutathione S-transferase 3) and phase Ⅲ (ABC transporter 1) and the activity of antioxidant defense enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) were less influenced than genes encoding phase I detoxification mechanisms (CYP3A13).

While valuable, these chemicals can also have unwanted off-target effects on human health, biodiversity, and resistance evolution. Pesticide usage data can help to estimate and mitigate these impacts, but many countries lack spatial data on chemical usage trends. In contrast to pesticide usage, data on pesticide registration are more widely available and often organised into structured databases in accordance with governmental regulatory requirements. Here, we explored the extent to which pesticide registration databases can infer patterns of usage across agricultural pesticides, based on United States (US) and Australian data. Our predictive models explained 56% and 38% of the variation in pesticide usage across the US and Australia, respectively, with pesticide registrations explaining 58% and 23% of this variation and the remainder explained by land use patterns. Our results show that pesticide registrations can help to infer usage patterns across different chemical groups, active ingredients, and agricultural regions. Increasing numbers of registered products, pests, and products for a given active ingredient were associated with increased usage. However, there remains unexplained variation in pesticide usage patterns between active ingredient groups, highlighting the importance of additional explanatory factors.

Through wet deposition, pesticides can be removed from the atmosphere far from their initial application site, posing a variety of environmental and health hazards, such as toxicity to terrestrial and aquatic species, crop damage, and poor air quality. Identifying pesticides and their degradation products in wet deposition is crucial to understanding how they are transported in the atmosphere. High-resolution mass spectrometry is a useful tool to carry out suspect screening on complex mixtures. However, suspect screening for pesticides in atmospheric waters is lacking. In this work, liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QToF-MS) is used for the first time to screen for suspect pesticides in wet deposition. The composition of precipitation samples collected in the central United States from 2018 to 2021 was screened against a library of thousands of compounds, and the presence of 23 pesticides was confirmed using reference standards, including common herbicides such as atrazine, metolachlor, and alachlor, as well as three species that had never before been quantified in wet deposition: diphenamid, octhilinone, and desthio-prothioconazole. A significant increase in the deposition flux of many pesticides was observed at the start of planting season, suggesting local agricultural sources to the atmosphere. In addition, pesticides not commonly used locally were also detected, suggesting regional atmospheric transport. Using statistical analyses and air mass back trajectory calculations, the seasonal trends, physicochemical properties, and potential origins of pesticides were examined.

Although herbicides are the most commonly used pesticides worldwide, they have received less attention in this debate. We investigated the extent to which long-term trends in herbicide use in Austria influence potential toxic exposures to non-target organisms and potential risks to humans. We analyzed official sales data of 101 herbicide active ingredients (AIs) approved in Austria between 2010 and 2019 regarding their ecotoxicological properties based on lethal doses (LD50 and LC50) weighed by their persistence in the environment (DT50) for honeybees (Apis mellifera), earthworms (Eisenia fetida), and birds (Serinus serinus). Human health risks were qualitatively assessed based on official hazard statements for the AIs used. Results: In Austria, herbicide amounts sold decreased significantly by 24% from 1480 to 1123 tonnes between 2010 and 2019. This also led to a considerable decrease in the amounts of AIs classified by H-statements of the EU Pesticides Database: − 71% acute inhalation toxicity, − 58% reproductive toxicity,− 47% specific target organ toxicity. Yet, 36% of herbicides used were still classified as highly hazardous pesticides according to the Pesticide Action Network. Surprisingly, over the same period, toxic loads to honeybees increased by 487% (oral exposure), while lethal toxic loads to earthworms increased by 498%, and to birds by 580%. This can be attributed to a shift toward the use of more acutely toxic and especially more persistent AIs. The most problematic AI for honeybees, earthworms, birds and humans was the highly persistent diquat. The further ranking of the most toxic herbicides varied considerably depending on the organism. It is important to note that this toxic load assessment, like official environmental risk assessments, evaluates the potential risk but not the actual fatalities or real-world exposure. Conclusions: Our results show a trade-off between herbicide amounts and toxicological hazards to humans and other non-target organisms.

Here, CsA was evaluated as a propective insecticide for H. armigera.

Continuous wildlife poisoning episodes with carbofuran and aldicarb across the globe illustrate how partial regulations are insufficient to address the adverse environmental impacts of HHPs. Carbofuran and aldicarb are restricted in 83 and 125 countries, respectively, including total bans in EU, where they are still responsible for wildlife poisoning. Remaining stocks in countries where banned may contribute to their short-medium term use, but the absence of a global ban leaves room for manufacturing, allowing in turn a continuous illegal trade and use over time. Following FAO's proposal to eliminate HHPs by 2030, and considering the decreasing presence in ecosystems of the few pesticides already banned or severely restricted at global scale, a total ban must be implemented to effectively deter the use of carbofuran, aldicarb and other HHPs in wildlife poisoning on the medium-long term. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109747,Pesticides;Poisoning;Poisons,NA,NA,wipe out highly hazardous pesticides to deter wildlife poisoning the case of carbofuran and aldicarb

Date palms are mostly destroyed by invading populations of red palm weevils; thus, developing natural biopesticides for them requires a comprehensive screening program of plant secondary metabolites. In this research, we examined the pathogenicity of a new strain of Beauveria bassiana on an important agricultural pest, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, by measuring the relative activity of defensive enzymes and detoxifying enzymes in certain larval instars. Our findings reveal that the B. bassiana strain may infect the instars of R. ferrugineus, and its pathogenicity to the larvae steadily increases as the spore concentration increases. Seven days after inoculation, the LC50 (the median lethal concentration) of B. bassiana was 490.42 × 105 and 2974.47 × 108 spores/mL for the second and fourth instar R. ferrugineus, respectively, and the LC50 of B. bassiana for each R. ferrugineus instar decreased with infection time, indicating a significant dose effect. Infected R. ferrugineus larvae of the second instars showed considerable changes in the activity of both protecting and detoxifying enzymes (peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, Cytochrome P450, glutathione S transferase (GST), and esterase) as infection time progressed. In addition, R. ferrugineus larvae that were infected with B. bassiana had enzyme activity that persisted from 24 to 48 h, which was much longer than in the control group. Lethality of B. bassiana resulted in elevated expressions of GST, Esterase, and Cytochrome P450 responsive genes. In conclusion, the results of this research indicate that B. bassiana may be utilized as a bio-insecticide to suppress young larvae of R. ferrugineus in an integrated pest management program. © 2022 by the authors.",,10.3390/su142013002,,NA,NA,immune responses of rhynchophorus ferrugineus to a new strain of beauveria bassiana

Avian species have been particularly well monitored over the long term, documenting their declines. In particular, farmland birds are decreasing worldwide, but the contribution of pesticides to their decline remains controversial. Most studies addressing the effects of agrochemicals are limited to their assessment under controlled laboratory conditions, the determination of lethal dose 50 (LD50) values and testing in a few species, most belonging to Galliformes. They often ignore the high interspecies variability in sensitivity, delayed sublethal effects on the physiology, behaviour and life-history traits of individuals and their consequences at the population and community levels. Most importantly, they have entirely neglected to test for the multiple exposure pathways to which individuals are subjected in the field (cocktail effects).

However, information on the adverse effects of pesticides on zooplankton communities under natural field conditions are still lacking, although zooplankton is quite sensitive to most of pesticides in laboratory studies. In this study, a natural lake ecosystem (Liangzi Lake) was used to determine the relationship between pesticide contamination and abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton. In August 2020, the comprehensive trophic level indexes and the abundance of phytoplankton in the 14 sampling sites of Liangzi Lake were comparable, but the abundance of metazoan zooplankton showed significant variations across two orders of magnitude. These results suggested that other factors, such as pesticide contamination, might be responsible for the variations of metazoan zooplankton community. Furthermore, the responsible pesticides were screened, and totally 29 pesticides were obtained. Finally, five pesticides were identified to provide more than 99.4% toxic contributions and chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were two main causal agents. These results were further supported by laboratory exposure experiments using D. magna and field study in November 2020, where the concentrations of the 29 pesticides were strongly decreased and the abundance of metazoan zooplankton was comparable across the 14 sites of Liangzi Lake.

They were sampled for blood and organs before (BST), during (DST) and after (AST) pesticide treatment. Pesticide residues were analysed in water, sediments and fish muscles. Several biomarkers were investigated related to the immune (peroxidase, lysozyme and complement activities, superoxide anion production) and reproductive (sex steroids and vitellogenin levels) responses as well as neurotoxicity (cholinesterase activity) and tissue alterations. Biomarkers were assessed and analysed via the integrated biomarker response (IBR). The results showed that Batran water reservoir was a more harmful ecosystem for fish than Songhai one, especially by depressing some immune and reproductive functions in relation to a higher-level of pesticide contamination.

Moreover, in this species there is no information on bioaccumulation of AR diastereomers e.g., cis- and trans-bromadiolone. Trans-bromadiolone is more persistent in the rodent liver and thus, is expected to have a greater probability of trophic transfer to predators. Here, we report on bromadiolone occurrence, total concentrations and diastereomers proportions (trans- and cis-bromadiolone) in weasels from Castilla y León (north-western Spain) collected in 2010–2017, where bromadiolone was irregularly applied to control outbreaks of common voles Microtus arvalis mainly with cereal grain bait distributed by the regional government. We also tested variables possibly associated with bromadiolone occurrence and concentration, such as individual features (e.g., sex), spatio-temporal variables (e.g., year), and exposure risk (e.g., vole outbreaks). Overall bromadiolone occurrence in weasels was 22% (n = 32, arithmetic mean of concentration of bromadiolone positives = 0.072 mg/kg). An individual showed signs of bromadiolone intoxication (i.e., evidence of macroscopic hemorrhages or hyperaemia and hepatic bromadiolone concentration > 0.1 mg/kg).

Pesticide usage is affected by seasonal changes and analyzed by using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model (a statistical model that predicts future trends using time-series data). The future development of biopesticides in China was predicted using the compound annual growth rate (CAGR), which is calculated via the equation [(Final value/Starting value)1/years – 1] according to the annual growth rate of target products over time. According to the reducing trend of pesticide and biological pesticide usage annually, China is predicted possibly step into the era of pesticide-free agriculture in 2050 based on the analysis of the ARIMA model. With CAGR calculation, China will produce from 500 thousand to one million tons of biopesticides in 2050, which can meet the need to replace chemical pesticides in agriculture to prevent the present crop production loss. To achieve the goal, China still has the greatest challenges to develop biopesticides and use various strategies to control pest and crop diseases.

However, there are limited reports on their toxic effects on wild mammals. To predict NNI-induced toxic effects on wild mammals, it is necessary to determine the exposure levels and metabolic ability of these species. We considered that raccoons could be an animal model for evaluating NNI-induced toxicities on wildlife because they live near agricultural fields and eat crops treated with NNIs. The objective of the present study was to estimate the effects of NNI exposure on wild raccoons. Urinary concentrations of NNI compounds (n = 59) and cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism of NNIs (n = 3) were evaluated in wild raccoons captured in Hokkaido, Japan, in 2020. We detected either one of the six NNIs or one metabolite, including acetamiprid, imidacloprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, and desmethyl-acetamiprid in 90% of raccoons (53/59); the average cumulative concentration of the seven NNI compounds was 3.1 ng/ml. The urinary concentrations were not much different from those reported previously for humans. Furthermore, we performed an in vitro assessment of the ability of raccoons to metabolize NNIs using hepatic microsomes. The amounts of NNI metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry and compared with those in rats. Raccoons showed much lower metabolic ability; the maximum velocity/Michaelis–Menten constant (Vmax/Km) values for raccoons were one-tenth to one-third of those for rats. For the first time, we show that wild raccoons could be frequently exposed to NNIs in the environment, and that the cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism of NNIs in the livers of raccoons might be low.

Many pesticides were subsequently classified as persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) and banned on national or global scales. However, despite their risks for non-target vertebrate wildlife, PBT substances such as anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) are still permitted for use in Europe and have shown to threaten raptors. Whereas risks of ARs are known, much less information is available on emerging agrochemicals such as currently used PPPs and medicinal products (MPs) in higher trophic level species. We expect that currently used PPPs are relatively mobile (vs. lipophilic) as a consequence of the PBT criteria and thus more likely to be present in aqueous matrices. We therefore analyzed blood of 204 raptor nestlings of three terrestrial (red kite, common buzzard, Montagu’s harrier) and two aquatic species (white-tailed sea eagle, osprey) from Germany. In total, we detected ARs in 22.6% of the red kites and 8.6% of the buzzards, whereas no Montagu’s harriers or aquatic species were exposed prior to sampling. ΣAR concentration tended to be higher in North Rhine-Westphalia (vs. North-Eastern Germany) where population density is higher and intense livestock farming more frequent. Among the 90 targeted and currently used PPPs, we detected six substances from which bromoxynil (14.2%) was most frequent. Especially Montagu’s harrier (31%) and red kites (22.6%) were exposed and concentrations were higher in North Rhine-Westphalia as well. Among seven MPs, we detected ciprofloxacin (3.4%), which indicates that risk mitigation measures may be needed as resistance genes were already detected in wildlife from Germany. Taken together, our study demonstrates that raptors are exposed to various chemicals during an early life stage depending on their sampling location and underpins that red kites are at particular risk for multiple pesticide exposures in Germany. © 2022, The Author(s).",,10.1007/s11356-022-20089-1,Germany,35435551,NA,spatial variation of rodenticides and emerging contaminants in blood of raptor nestlings from germany

Farmers' decisions are heavily influenced by their risk aversion to pest outbreaks that result in major yield losses. However, the need for long-term pest population data across many farms has prevented researchers from exploring the drivers and implications of pest population variability (PV). Here, we demonstrate the critical importance of PV for sustainable farming by analyzing 13 years of pest densities across >1300 Spanish olive groves and vineyards. Variable populations were more likely to cause major yield losses, but also occasionally created temporal windows when densities fell below insecticide spray thresholds. Importantly, environmental factors regulating pest variability were very distinct from factors regulating mean density, suggesting variability needs to be uniquely managed. Finally, we found diversifying landscapes may be a win–win situation for conservation and farmers, as diversified landscapes promote less abundant and less variable pest populations. Therefore, we encourage agricultural stakeholders to increase the complexity of the landscapes surrounding their farms through conserving/restoring natural habitat and/or diversifying crops. © 2022 The Ecological Society of America.",,10.1002/eap.2607,,35366039,NA,the causes and consequences of pest population variability in agricultural landscapes

The evaluation on the toxic effects of the co-exposure of two or more pesticides or related metabolites could reflect the real situation of the exposing risks. In this study, zebrafish was used as a model to investigate the potential toxic interactions of chlorpyrifos and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE) on the survival rate, oxidative stress response and neurotoxicity, as well as their bioaccumulation and distribution in tissues. Co-exposure of chlorpyrifos and p,p’-DDE resulted in significant additive acute toxic effects on adult zebrafish with model deviation ratio (MDR) = 1.64. Both 7-day short-term at 1% LC50 and 35-day long-term at 0.5% LC50 co-exposure of chlorpyrifos with p,p’-DDE (50 and 100 µg/L) significantly reduced the survival rate of zebrafish colony to 75 and 82.5%. Co-exposure of chlorpyrifos and p,p’-DDE contributed to increased activity of antioxidant enzyme CAT, SOD and GST and excessive MDA generation, and decreased activity of CarE, CYP450 and AChE, compared with either single exposure of them. In co-exposure, the bioaccumulation of chlorpyrifos and p,p’-DDE was significantly different from the single exposure group. Overall, this study unraveled the potential toxic interaction of chlorpyrifos and p,p’-DDE on zebrafish and provided reference for environmental risk assessment of pesticide mixture. © 2022",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106194,,35623197,NA,the toxic effects of combined exposure of chlorpyrifos and p pdde to zebrafish danio rerio and tissue bioaccumulation

The qualitative content analysis of 77 briefs and 30 testimonies highlights five main institutional logics that contribute to the institutionalization of pesticide use despite the strong opposition it generates: the economic and strategic logic, the regulatory and administrative logic, the tailored advice and support logic, the research and innovation logic, and the traditional, rural and pragmatic logic. These logics show how the objectives, belief systems, and practices shared by pro-pesticide organizations can hold sway, including over public bodies that are a priori independent but tend to play a buffering and facilitating role in the use of these controversial products. This article contributes to the literature on institutional logics and corporate sustainability by showing how some of these logics can contribute to the continuation of unsustainable practices over time.

However, they can be limited due to low utilization efficiency, causing substantial losses to the environment and ecological damage. Nanotechnology is an active area of research regarding encapsulation of pesticides for sustainable pest control. Here, we developed intelligent formulations of avermectin (Av) quaternary ammonium chitosan surfactant (QACS) nanocapsules (i.e., Av-Th@QACS) with on-demand controlled release properties, toward ambient temperature and maximal synergistic biological activity of Av and QACS. The Av-Th@QACS regulated the quantity of pesticide release in accordance with the ambient temperature changes and, insofar as this release is a means of responding to variations in pest populations, maximized the synergistic activity. In addition, the Av-Th@QACS were highly adhesive to crop leaves as a result of the prolonged retention time on the crop leaves. Therefore, Av-Th@QACS exhibited greater control against aphids at 35 °C than at 15 and 25 °C. Compared with commercial formulations, Av-Th@QACS was more toxic at 35 °C and less toxic at 15 °C. Thus, researchers can apply Av-Th@QACS as intelligent nanopesticides with an on-demand, controlled release and synergistic biological activity and, in so doing, prolong pesticide duration and improve the utilization efficiency. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Pollution stress beyond natural homeostatic capacities can trigger succession of tolerant species within a community, enhancing the overall community tolerance. This process was operationalized in the Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) concept and applied in many case studies, however, the molecular mechanisms of community tolerance and implications for ecological functions remain largely unexplored. Our study aimed to demonstrate that 1) community metabolomics can unravel potential mechanisms of PICT in periphyton and 2) induced tolerance helps to maintain primary production under re-occuring pollution. To this end, we grew periphyton for 5 weeks with and without the model herbicide diuron in microcosms, quantified PICT, and determined the related metabolic fingerprint of periphyton by GC–MS-based untargeted metabolomics. Further, we explored the autotrophic community based on pigment composition and functional parameters including photosynthesis and gross primary production. Chronic diuron exposure resulted in a shift in pigment composition, higher community tolerance and an individual metabolic fingerprint in the contaminated communities. Opposing responses of selected metabolites during a short-term exposure indicated differences in diuron pre-adaptation in the different communities. Metabolites (threonic acid and two sugar acid lactones) were found to be related to tolerance development, suggesting that ascorbate metabolism was induced in contaminated communities. Despite these compensating mechanism, contaminated communities were compromised in production-to-respiration ratio and biomass. A ranking of sensitivity thresholds of different biological endpoints revealed that metabolites were less sensitive than photosynthetic parameters, which reflects the mode-of-action of the herbicide. In conclusion, we could demonstrate that community metabolomics is able to unravel complex biochemical changes and allows mechanistic insights into community tolerance. Moreover, we were able to show that induced community tolerance was insufficient to safeguard functions like primary production. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153777,,35150676,NA,community metabolomics provides insights into mechanisms of pollutioninduced community tolerance of periphyton

Here, we report a detection scheme to address these challenges, where analytes are recognized by 19F-labeled probes to induce characteristic shifts of 19F resonances that can be used as ""chromatographic"" signatures to pin down each low-concentration analyte in complex mixtures. This unique signal transduction mechanism allows detection sensitivity to be enhanced by using massive chemically equivalent 19F atoms, which was achieved through the proper installation of nonafluoro-tert-butoxy groups on probes of high structural symmetry. It is revealed that the binding of an analyte to the probe can be sensed by as many as 72 chemically equivalent 19F atoms, allowing the quantification of analytes at nanomolar concentrations to be routinely performed by NMR. Applications on the detection of trace amounts of prohibited drug molecules and water contaminants were demonstrated. The high sensitivity and robust resolving ability of this approach represent a first step toward extending the application of NMR to scenarios that are now governed by chromatographic and mass spectrometry techniques.

However, numerous initiatives have been undertaken to reduce risks from pesticide product use and provide the public with sufficient information. Nevertheless, food chain actors are not required to disclose much information on hazards, with many undervalued safety aspects. This situation has resulted in information gaps concerning the production, authorization, use, and impact of pesticide products for both consumers and regulatory stakeholders. Often, the public cannot directly access relevant information about pesticides with respect to retail products and their farm origins. National authorities have poor legal tools to efficiently carry out complete investigations and take action to mitigate pesticide externalities. We created the ontology PestOn to bridge these gaps and directly access pesticide product information, making existing data more useful and improving information flow in food value chains. This demonstration project shows how to integrate various existing ontologies to maximize interoperability with related information on the semantic web. As a semantic tool, it can help address food quality, food safety, and information disclosure challenges, opening up several opportunities for food value chain actors and the public. In its first version, the ontology PestOn accounts for more than 16,000 pesticide products that were authorized in Italy during the last 50 years and retrieved from the public pesticide register. The ontology includes information about active ingredients contained in pesticide products, roles, hazards, production companies, authorization status, and regulatory dates. These pieces of information can support agri-food stakeholders in classifying information in the domain of pesticide products and their active ingredients, while reducing unnecessary repetition in research.

The objective of this study was to look for a new control strategy such as application of insecticide-loaded carbon dot-embedded fluorescent mesoporous silica nanoparticles (FL-SiO2 NPs). Two different-sized methoxyfenozide-loaded nanoparticles (Me@FL-SiO2 NPs-70 nm, Me@FL-SiO2 NPs-150 nm) were prepared, with loading content 15% and 16%. Methoxyfenozide was released constantly from Me@FL-SiO2 NPs only at specific optimum pH 7.5. The release of methoxyfenozide from Me@FL-SiO2 NPs was not observed other than this optimum pH, and therefore, we checked and controlled a single release condition to look out for the different particle sizes of insecticide-loaded NPs. This pH-responsive release pattern can find potential application in sustainable plant protection. Moreover, the lethal concentration of the LC50 value was 24 mg/L for methoxyfenozide (TC), 14 mg/L for Me@FL-SiO2 NPs-70 nm, and 15 mg/L for Me@FL-SiO2 NPs-150 nm after 72 h exposure, respectively. After calculating the LC50, the results predicted that Me@FL-SiO2 NPs-70 nm and Me@FL-SiO2 NPs-150 nm exhibited better insecticidal activity against P. xylostella than methoxyfenozide under the same concentrations of active ingredient applied. Moreover, the activities of detoxification enzymes of P. xylostella were suppressed by treatment with insecticide-loaded NPs, which showed that NPs could also be involved in reduction of enzymes. Furthermore, the entering of FL-SiO2 NPs into the midgut of P. xylostella was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). For comparison, P. xylostella under treatment with water as control was also observed under CLSM. The control exhibited no fluorescent signal, while the larvae treated with FL-SiO2 NPs showed strong fluorescence under a laser excitation wavelength of 448 nm.

We conducted several different studies: (a) lethal bioassay against the 3rd, 5th, and adult stages under laboratory conditions; (b) sublethal effects on the reproduction, diet consumption, fecal production, and weight gain; (c) a greenhouse trial; and (d) a field cage trial. Under laboratory conditions, all EPF formulations caused significant mortality, and the highest efficacy was observed with Green Muscle, followed by Green Guard, B. bassiana, and M. anisopliae. Susceptibility was found to be greatest in 3rd-instar nymphs, followed by 5th instars, and then adults. Along with lethal effects, sublethal doses of EPF reduced the number of egg pods per female, total eggs per pod, and egg hatching, while extending nymphal developmental time and reducing adult longevity; again, Green Muscle performed better. Sublethal doses not only retarded reproduction, but also caused behavioral changes, including reductions in food consumption, fecal production, and weight gain. All EPF formulations not only produced significant mortality in laboratory conditions, but also performed very well under the greenhouse and field conditions.

Increased temperatures may also interact with other anthropogenic stressors, such as chemical contaminants, to exacerbate or reduce parasite transmission. However, studies on the effects of pesticides on non-target species are typically conducted at one standard temperature, despite the toxicity of many agrochemicals being temperature-dependent. Furthermore, most studies assessing the effects of temperature on pesticide toxicity have been conducted on host organisms, limiting our understanding of how temperature affects the toxicity of pesticides to free-living parasite stages as they move through the environment in search of a host. Using the free-swimming cercariae stage of the trematode Echinostoma trivolvis, we examined how the toxicities of three different pesticides (a carbamate insecticide, strobilurin fungicide, and triazine herbicide) vary by temperature by monitoring cercarial swimming activity over time. Our three main findings were: 1) a strong main effect of temperature across all pesticide trials – higher temperatures caused cercariae to cease swimming activity earlier, likely due to an increased rate of energy expenditure, 2) atrazine, azoxystrobin, and carbaryl were directly toxic to cercariae to some degree, but not in a predictable dose-dependent manner, and 3) the temperature at which pesticide exposure occurs could affect its toxicity to cercariae. The interaction between pesticide and temperature was most evident in the azoxystrobin exposure; azoxystrobin caused cercariae to cease swimming activity earlier at 30 °C but caused cercariae to maintain swimming activity longer at 18 °C relative to their respective pesticide-free control treatments.

The predator Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Miridae) plays an important role in controlling insect pests in solanaceous crops, but its concurrent herbivory often poses relevant concerns for tomato production. Although insecticide side effects on N. tenuis have been previously studied, little is known on the potential implications of neurotoxic chemicals at low concentrations. We assessed the baseline toxicity of three neurotoxic insecticides (lambda-cyhalothrin, spinosad and chlorpyrifos) on N. tenuis by topical contact exposure. The behavioral and reproduction capacity of the predator was then investigated upon exposure to three estimated low-lethal concentrations (LC1, LC10 and LC30). RESULTS: Predator survival varied among insecticides and concentrations, with LC30/label rate ratios ranging from 8.45% to 65.40% for spinosad and lambda-cyhalothrin, respectively. All insecticides reduced the fertility of N. tenuis females at all estimated low-lethal concentrations. Chlorpyrifos seriously compromised predator orientation towards a host plant even at LC1, while the same effect was observed for lambda-cyhalothrin and spinosad solely at LC30. Lambda-cyhalothrin (at all concentrations) and chlorpyrifos (at LC10 and LC30) also affected the time taken by N. tenuis females to make a choice. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that all three insecticides can be detrimental to N. tenuis and should be avoided when presence of the predator is desirable. © 2022 The Authors.

The females showed drastic changes in the mating receptivity; in most of the cases, the treated females were non-responsive to the courting males. They often showed mate rejection behaviour which was characterized by shaking of their abdomen and kicking to the courting males with the help of hind legs. Maximum aberration in mating behaviour was seen in the mating pairs, where both the mating partners were treated. Also, the O. sanctum leaf hexane extract impaired oviposition and egg hatchability in a dose-dependent manner. There was a decrease in the number of egg batches and eggs laid by the treated female. Although, the females laid fertile eggs, a significant decrease in the percent egg hatchability was reported in the treated females.

In humans, hair matrix analysis is a reliable tool for assessing cumulative exposure to organic pollutants such as pesticides but has rarely been used in other primates for this purpose. LC/MS-MS and GC/MS-MS multi-residue methods were used to screen the presence of 152 organic pollutants and their metabolites belonging to 21 different chemical families in hair samples from our closest relative, the chimpanzee. Samples were collected from 20 wild chimpanzees in Sebitoli, Kibale National Park, Uganda and 9 captive chimpanzees in the Réserve Africaine de Sigean, France. In total, 90 chemicals were detected, 60 in wild chimpanzees and 79 in captive chimpanzees. The median concentrations of detected chemicals in captive individuals were significantly higher than those in wild chimpanzees. Hair from the captive individuals at RAS was sampled a second time after 6 months in an environment of reduced exposure to these pollutants (diet of organic food, decreased use of plastic food and water containers). The number of chemicals detected in captive chimpanzees reduced from 79 to 63, and their concentrations were also significantly reduced. In the present study we report for the first time the use of hair analysis to detect organic pollutants in primate hair. We conclude that both wild and captive chimpanzees are exposed to a large range of different chemicals through their diet. Our study provides surprising and alarming evidence that besides the direct threats of poaching, deforestation and diseases, wild chimpanzees might be endangered by indirect consequences of anthropic activities.

This includes insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides commonly used in agriculture that are known to produce broad ranging, off-target effects on beneficial wildlife, even at seemingly non-toxic low dose exposures. Notably, these obscure adverse interactions may be related to host-associated microbiome damage occurring from antimicrobial effects, rather than the presumed toxic effects of pesticides on host tissue. Here, we critically review the literature on this topic as it pertains to the rhizosphere microbiome of crop plants and gut microbiome of pollinator insects (namely managed populations of the western honey bee, Apis mellifera), since both are frequent recipients of chronic pesticide exposure. Clear linkages between pesticide mode of action and host-specific microbiome functionalities are identified in relation to potential antimicrobial risks. For example, inherent differences in nitrogen metabolism of plant-and insect-associated microbiomes may dictate whether neonicotinoid-based insecticides ultimately exert antimicrobial activities or not. Several other context-dependent scenarios are discussed. In addition to direct effects (e.g., microbicidal action of the parent compound or breakdown metabolites), pesticides may indirectly alter the trajectory of host-microbiome coevolution in honey bees via modulation of social behaviours and the insect gut-brain axis-conceivably with consequences on plant-pollinator symbiosis as well. In summary, current evidence suggests: (1) immediate action is needed by regulatory authorities in amending safety assessments for “non-antimicrobial” pesticides; and (2) that the development of host-free microbiome model systems could be useful for rapidly screening pesticides against functionally distinct microbial catalogues of interest. © The Author(s) 2022.",,10.20517/mrr.2021.08,Pesticides,NA,NA,deteriorating microbiomes in agriculture the unintended effects of pesticides on microbial life

We recorded the density of seeds left on the soil surface, bird density, and consumption of pesticide-treated seed by birds using camera traps. We calculated the dose ingested by each bird species in a single feeding bout and if they ate treated seeds exclusively for 1 day. We extrapolated this for an additional 19 pesticides commonly used as seed treatments, assuming equal consumption rates. All three fields contained grains on the soil surface (mean 7.14 seeds/m2 on sowing day). In total, 1,374 granivorous birds spanning 18 different species were observed in the fields, with 11 species filmed eating the seeds. Fludioxonil appears to pose a low risk to birds, with &lt;1.14% of the LD50 potentially ingested by a bird for a daily maximum amount of seeds. Analysis of the further 19 pesticides commonly used as seed dressings suggests that the neonicotinoid insecticides imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam represent the highest risk for granivorous birds. For example, chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) could consume 63% of LD50 of imidacloprid in a single feeding bout, and 370% in a day.

We found that restocked eels exhibited good growth performance; moreover, the stocks were female-dominated, showed a good Fulton's condition factor (K) and lipid stores and had high survival probability estimated using the best model of Jolly-Seber stock assessment method for open populations. A necropsy revealed the absence of internal lesions. A swim bladder examination revealed the absence of the parasite Anguillicola crassus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses revealed an increase of Anguillid herpesvirus-1 (AngHV-1) prevalence throughout the study. Most positive subjects expressed viral loads compatible with a latent infection and correlated positively with K. All restocked eels were contaminated by at least one of the organic pollutant congeners studied, but the pollution loads corresponded to the lowest range of pollutant concentrations reported in the available literature for European eels and did not exceed the maximum residue and contaminant limits in food and feed of several national and international regulations. Pollutant loads were negatively correlated with K, lipid content and eel density for polychlorinated biphenyls PCB 138, 153 and 180 and K for pesticides p.p’-DDE, p.p’-DDD, p.p’-DDT and PBDE47. This study highlights the potential role played by upland aquatic ecosystems in enhancing riverine silver eel production from the perspective of species conservation.

However, the knowledge on the occurrence of CUPs in soil and air and the related human exposure in Africa is limited. This study investigated the presence of 30 CUPs in soil and air at two distinct agricultural sites in South Africa and estimated the human exposure and related risks to rural residents via soil ingestion and inhalation (using hazard quotients, hazard index and relative potency factors). We collected 12 soil and 14 air samples over seven days during the main pesticide application season in 2018. All samples were extracted, purified and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. In soils, nine CUPs were found, with chlorpyrifos, carbaryl and tebuconazole having the highest concentrations (up to 63.6, 1.10 and 0.212 ng g−1, respectively). In air, 16 CUPs were found, with carbaryl, tebuconazole and terbuthylazine having the highest levels (up to 25.0, 22.2 and 1.94 pg m−3, respectively). Spatial differences were observed between the two sites for seven CUPs in air and two in soils. A large dominance towards the particulate phase was found for almost all CUPs, which could be related to mass transport kinetics limitations (non-equilibrium) following pesticide application. The estimated daily intake via soil ingestion and inhalation of individual pesticides ranged from 0.126 fg kg−1 day−1 (isoproturon) to 14.7 ng kg−1 day−1 (chlorpyrifos). Except for chlorpyrifos, soil ingestion generally represented a minor exposure pathway compared to inhalation (i.e. &lt;5%). The pesticide environmental exposure largely differed between the residents of the two distinct agricultural sites in terms of levels and composition.

Due to their effects on the endocrine system, some pesticides are classified as endocrine disruptors. The aim of the study is to assess the interference of five pesticides on estrogen biosynthesis and estrogen signaling. Three neonicotinoid insecticides (Acetamiprid, Clothianidin, and Thiamethoxam), a carbamate insecticide (Methiocarb) and a herbicide (Oxadiazon) were tested. The effect of pesticides on estrogen biosynthesis was studied through an ELISA assay using a recombinant form of human aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the transformation of androgens to estrogens. Moreover, the effect of pesticides on estrogen signaling was assessed using a gene reporter assay on MELN cells, which measures estrogen receptor-mediated estrogenic activity. The results of the ELISA assay showed that the pesticides did not alter aromatase activity (no interference with estrogen biosynthesis), while the results of the gene reporter assay showed that only Methiocarb was able to alter estrogen signaling at high doses. The estrogenic activity of Methiocarb, expressed as 17β-estradiol equivalency factor (EEF), was equal to 8.0 × 10−8. In conclusion, this study suggested that Methiocarb should be considered a potential endocrine disruptor. © 2022 by the authors.

Animal-mediated pollination and seed dispersal are major mutualisms associated with distinct stages of plant reproduction. Nevertheless, we lack an integrated assessment on how multiple anthropogenic impacts affect these interrelated mutualisms. Here, we systematically reviewed the effect of the most important global anthropogenic factors (agrochemicals, climate change, fire, fragmentation, hunting, non-native species and urbanization) on pollination and seed dispersal. We evaluated which anthropogenic factors, mutualisms and their combinations have been more frequently investigated, the biogeographic and taxonomic tendencies and the most frequently recorded effects of anthropogenic factors. We show that pollination has been more broadly investigated, that the impacts of the anthropogenic factors on pollination and seed dispersal are biased towards the temperate region and forest biomes and lack representation from some relevant groups, such as mutualistic bats. Moreover, some anthropogenic factors have been more studied for one mutualism type in relation to the other, for instance, agrochemicals and urbanization on plant-pollinator interactions, even though these impacts could also generate direct and cascading effects on frugivores and seed dispersal. The predominance of negative effects observed, especially of climate change on plant-pollinator and non-native species on plant-frugivore interactions deserve special attention. Finally, we identify a gap in empirical studies that simultaneously consider pollination and seed dispersal as integrated components of plant reproduction, and combined anthropogenic factors in the same ecosystem.

Our results demonstrated that CYPs-mediated region-selective hydroxylation was a major metabolism pathway for CBZ in liver microsomes from various species including rat, mouse, minipig, dog, rabbit, guinea pig, monkey, cow and human, and the metabolite was biosynthesized and well-characterized as 6-OH-CBZ.

Whilst we are very good at detecting the presence of pollutants in tissues or the environment, making a convincing link between the presence of these compounds and mortality events in the field or population effects will remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. Creative new approaches are also being considered to mitigate the effects of pollution on wildlife and ecosystems. Depending on the source of pollution, the beneficial outcomes of mitigation measures, if properly implemented, could have immediate effects. Given the plethora of potential adverse pollution effects, frameworks to prioritize which threats are most likely to cause adverse effects and develop means to address or manage them are an imperative.

Scientific efforts are underway to develop new or optimize the existing techniques. In this regard, habitat modification with mulching has been widely investigated on the suppression of insect pest abundance. In general, vegetationally diverse cropping systems impairs the herbivore’s ability to locate the host plant by creating physical barriers, disrupting the visual and olfactory cues, and enhancing plant defenses that lead to the reduc-tion of pest abundance and disease incidences. Also, mulching increases natural enemy population density because of greater habitat diversity and food resources, thereby decreasing herbivore abundance indirectly by improving biological control activity. However, in some cases, mulching has negatively affected the crop yield by competing for available resources (water, nutrients, light, space, etc.), impacted natural enemy abundance and efficiency, or provided alternate hosts/refuge for the pest insects. Besides, mulching can also play a pivotal role in conserving and support the declining pollinator population by providing nectar and pollen, nesting sites, and refuge from predators. Overall, if appropriately planned, mulching might contribute significantly to insect pests’ non-chemical control and promote the diversity and abundance of natural enemies and pollinators. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",,10.1007/978-981-19-6410-7_15,,NA,NA,comparative effects of living and nonliving mulches on insect pest management in agroecosystems

However, solid organic wastes containing contaminants such as biosolids, animal manures, food wastes, and crop residues are a challenge for the viability of the biological decomposition process and the environmental safety of the resultant compost. Currently, composting, anaerobic digestion, and vermicomposting are the most common techniques for treating potentially hazardous organic wastes. Recently, insects larvae are emerging as a viable strategy for decomposing hazardous organic residues, including plastic wastes. In this chapter, we examine and compare the effects of vermicomposting and insect-based bioconversion on removing heavy metals, legacy and emerging organic pollutants, and pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant genes. Although there is a huge body of literature reporting how vermicomposting alters metal speciation and reduces pathogens, pharmaceuticals, and other organic pollutants, the mechanisms underpinning such beneficial effects are still speculative, and more research is needed to explore the toxicity of these pollutants (and derived metabolites) on the biological processes of vermicomposting. The final scope of using vermicomposting and insect-based bioconversion as bioeconomy options in managing hazardous organic wastes is the production of pollutant-free or nontoxic composts. To this, the inclusion of biochar (carbonaceous material generated by pyrolysis of biomass) in these biotransformation processes accelerates the organic matter decomposition and improves the quality of the resultant carbonaceous-rich composts as fertilizers.

Injudicious use of chemical pesticides has led to severe health hazards, environmental pollution, and increased cost of production. Thus, novel approaches are necessary to protect the crop plants with minimal or no deleterious effects on the environment. The development of various nanopesticide formulations has shown higher pesticidal activity, controlled release capacity, and targeted delivery properties. These nanomaterials open an exciting alternative to the existing synthetic chemical pesticides. Sustainable and steady release, target specificity, high efficiency, as well as prolonged persistence period of nanopesticides are vital characteristics for their applications in crop cultivation. However, a large-scale application of these promising nanomaterials requires further research for environmental safety, specificity to a target pest, cost effectiveness, and availability to the farmers. Considering their high efficacy at a lower dose, improved release capability, target-oriented delivery, and improved bioactivity, it is expected that nanopesticides would be utilized as environment-friendly pest control agents for promoting green agriculture in the future.

Gyps vultures are extremely sensitive (the lethal dose 50 [LD50 ] ~ 0.1 mg/kg – 0.2 mg/kg), with toxicity appearing to be linked to metabolic deficiency, demonstrated by the long T1/2 (~12 h – 17 h). This is in striking comparison to the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), in which the LD50 is ~10 mg/kg and the T1/2 is ~1 h. The phase 1 cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C subfamily has been cited as a possible reason for metabolic deficiency. The aim of this study was to determine if CYP2C9 homolog pharmacogenomic differences amongst avian species is driving diclofenac toxicity in Gyps vultures. We exposed each of 10 CYP-inhibited test group chickens to a unique dose of diclofenac (as per the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] toxicity testing guidelines) and compared the toxicity and pharmacokinetic results to control group birds that received no CYP inhibitor. Although no differences were noted in the LD50 values for each group (11.92 mg/kg in the CYP-inhibited test group and 11.58 mg/kg in the control group), the pharmacokinetic profile of the test group was suggestive of partial inhibition of CYP metabolism. Evaluation of the metabolite peaks produced also suggested partial metabolic inhibition in test group birds, as they produced lower amounts of metabolites for one of the three peaks demonstrated and had higher diclofenac exposure. This pilot study supports the hypothesis that CYP metabolism is varied amongst bird species and may explain the higher resilience to diclofenac in the chicken versus vultures. © 2022. The Authors.

It envisages taking agriculture from the era of indiscriminate natural re-source use and environmental degradation to the brave new world of advanced systems with enhanced material use efficiency and targeted applications to reduce crop losses caused due to abiotic-biotic stresses as well as to give due considerations to the environment. To manage plant diseases and insect pests, pesticides are inevitably used in ag-riculture. However, the higher dosage of these chemicals on a per hectare basis has resulted in many environmental and health hazards. To tackle the conventional pesticide related issues, a new field of science called nanotechnology has led to the development of nanopesticides that have less active ingredients, but better efficiency. The nanopesticides contain the carrier molecule or the active nanosized ingredient with a very high surface area to the volume property that provides them unique exploitable-advantages. Several formulations, viz., nanoemulsions, nanosuspensions, nano-gels, metal compound-based nanopesticides, have been developed for different modes of action and vivid applications. The biggest advantage comes due to the small size of the particles that helps in properly spreading the ingredients on the pest surface and, thus, producing a better action than conventional pesticides. The use of nanoparticles in the form of nanopesticides, nanofertilisers, and nano delivery systems is on the increase day by day due to their higher efficiency and reduced dosage requirements. However, human beings and other organisms are also getting exposed to the nano-entities during the application or afterwards. The interactions of these engineered nano-entities with biological systems are relatively unknown thus far.

The unresolved questions are remaining of how such stressors interact to alter ecosystem structure and function, and how impacted ecosystems are able to maintain their ecological balance. Hence, this paper discusses the effects of the insecticide Profenofos and herbicide MCPA on Ficus racemosa and Panicum maximum litter breakdown in 40 days of indoor microcosm systems. Litter breakdown rates were analysed in microcosms treated with pesticide concentrations of 0.010, 0.025, 0.100, 0.250, 1.000 mg/L and in control tanks with no pesticides. The results of the study indicated a significant alteration of litter breakdown rate of MCPA-treated tanks compared to the control tanks in terms of reduction percentage of dry weight, remaining organic matter content, microbial community sporulation, and remaining nutrient content (p < 0.05). The herbicide MCPA accelerated the structural impairment of leaf material by destructing the leaf material. No significant differences were observed between Profenofos-treated leaf packs and control leaf packs (p < 0.05). Aquatic hyphomycetes have degraded the applied Profenofos by consuming the nutrients from the litter. These alterations were modulated by the litter quality and microbial colonizations on leaf materials.

Gregarines are prevalent endoparasites in most invertebrates that affect the fitness of their hosts, but are often overlooked in ecological studies. Next to such biotic factors, a current common challenge is anthropogenic pollution with pesticides, which causes a major threat to non-target organisms that are readily exposed to lethal or sublethal concentrations. In a laboratory study, we investigated whether the presence of gregarines modulates the food consumption and life history traits of a (non-target) leaf beetle species, Phaedon cochleariae, in response to sublethal insecticide exposure. We show that the larval food consumption of the herbivore was neither affected by gregarine infection nor sublethal insecticide exposure. Nevertheless, infection with gregarines led to a delayed development, while insecticide exposure resulted in a lower body mass of adult males and a reduced reproduction of females. Individuals exposed to both challenges suffered most, as they had the lowest survival probability. This indicates detrimental effects on the population dynamics of non-target insects infected with naturally occurring gregarines that face additional stress from agrochemical pollution. Moreover, we found that the infection load with gregarines was higher in individuals exposed to sublethal insecticide concentrations compared to unexposed individuals. To counteract the global decline of insects, the potential of natural parasite infections in modulating insect responses to anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic environmental factors should be considered in ecological risk assessment. © 2021, The Author(s).",,10.1007/s00442-021-05086-4,Insecticides,34851452,NA,gregarines modulate insect responses to sublethal insecticide residues

Pest insect suppression by bats has been identified as an essential ecosystem service but remains poorly investigated. For example, we still lack a basic understanding of the proportion of pest insects that comprises the diet of many bat species. Here, we explored the diet composition of eight Brazilian bat species (78 individuals) in a human-modified landscape through the analysis of stable carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) isotopes. Bats were categorised into guilds: open-space aerial insectivores, narrow-space gleaning frugivores, or narrow-space gleaning nectarivores. We divided the insects collected into three groups depending on their 13C values: forest, mixed, and pest insects. We found that open-space insectivorous bats had the highest proportion of insects in total in their diet - consuming primarily from the forest group (56%) and the pest group (34%). Interestingly, narrow-space gleaning frugivores also consumed pest insects (almost 20%). The narrow-space gleaning nectarivores had traces of insects in their diet, yet the actual proportion was inconclusive. Even though bats were from different guilds, with diets consisting mainly of plants and insects, the 15N indicated that they fitted to similar trophic levels, as secondary consumers. Therefore, the trophic level of nectarivorous and frugivorous bats showed a more generalist diet than previously assumed. The proportion of forest insects in the diet of open-space aerial insectivores may indicate the importance of small forest patches as food resources for wildlife such as the ones included in human-modified landscapes.

However, the efficient application of MeJ in fields is very limited due to its poor water solubility, thermal stability and phytotoxicity at the high dose required to produce beneficial effects in plants. Here, a novel nanoelicitor (nano-MeJ) was prepared through the functionalization of biocompatible calcium phosphate nanoparticles. The resulting nanocomposite produced a significant increase of beneficial compounds (phytoalexins) in grapes and wines at low MeJ dosage. Indeed, results from in vivo field experiments on Monastrell vineyards (Vitis vinifera L.) revealed that grapes treated with nano-MeJ provided red wines with high content of beneficial stilbenes, similar to the levels obtained with conventional treatments but applying 10 times higher MeJ dosage. We demonstrated that the nanoparticles protect and retain MeJ on the surface of the leaves over long periods of time. This protective action along with the slow release provides a prolonged supply of the resistance-inductor elicitor through the leaves, resulting in a significant efficiency increase. Additionally, the nanocomposite was stable for long periods of time (more than 175 days) and exhibited lower cytotoxicity compared to MeJ, which are important features for its efficient and safe use in agriculture. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,10.1039/d1en00504a,Wine,NA,NA,nanoelicitors with prolonged retention and sustained release to produce beneficial compounds in wines

This article shed light on the potential of colloidal delivery systems, particularly controlled releasing profiles of several pesticides with enhanced stability and improved solubility. Colloidal nanodelivery systems, being efficient nanoformulations, have the ability to boost up the pest-control competence for prolonged intervals thru averting the early degradation of active ingredients under severe ecofriendly circumstances. This work is thus aimed to provide critical information on the meaningful role of nanocarriers for loading of pesticides. The smart art of pesticide-loaded nanocarriers can be more fruitful owing to the use of lower amount of active ingredients with improved efficiency along with minimizing the pesticide loss. Also, the future research gaps regarding nano-pesticide formulations, such as role of nanomaterials as active ingredients are discussed briefly.

It is one of the best studied cultivated dicotyledonous plants, often used as a model system for plant research into classical genetics, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, and molecular biology. Tomato plants are affected by different pathogens such as viruses, viroids, fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, and nematodes, that reduce yield and affect product quality. The study of tomato as a plant-pathogen system helps to accelerate the discovery and understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease resistance and offers the opportunity of improving the yield and quality of their edible products. The use of functional genomics has contributed to this purpose through both traditional and recently developed techniques, that allow the identification of plant key functional genes in susceptible and resistant responses, and the understanding of the molecular basis of compatible interactions during pathogen attack. Next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS), which produce massive quantities of sequencing data, have greatly accelerated research in biological sciences and offer great opportunities to better understand the molecular networks of plant–pathogen interactions. In this review, we summarize important research that used high-throughput RNA-seq technology to obtain transcriptome changes in tomato plants in response to a wide range of pathogens such as viruses, fungi, bacteria, oomycetes, and nematodes. These findings will facilitate genetic engineering efforts to incorporate new sources of resistance in tomato for protection against pathogens and are of major importance for sustainable plant-disease management, namely the ones relying on the plant’s innate immune mechanisms in view of plant breeding. © 2021, The Author(s).",,10.1038/s41438-021-00607-x,Breeding,NA,NA,high throughput sequencing unravels tomatopathogen interactions towards a sustainable plant breeding

We investigated the effects of current exposure and the carryover effects of past insecticide exposure on the individual vital rates and population growth of the solitary bee, Osmia lignaria. Bees in flight cages freely foraged on wildflowers, some treated with the common insecticide, imidacloprid, in a fully crossed design over 2 y, with insecticide exposure or no exposure in each year. Insecticide exposure directly to foraging adults and via carryover effects from past exposure reduced reproduction. Repeated exposure across 2 y additively impaired individual performance, leading to a nearly fourfold reduction in bee population growth. Exposure to even a single insecticide application can have persistent effects on vital rates and can reduce population growth for multiple generations.

This study investigated whether chlorine isotopologue distributions of polychlorinated organic pollutants are binomial and evaluated implications of the distributions to relevant analytical and environmental research by theoretical derivation, numerical simulation and experiment. Chlorine kinetic isotope effects and equilibrium isotope effects vary in stepwise chlorination reactions, leading to inconsistent chlorine isotope ratios on different reaction positions of products, which results in non-binomial chlorine isotopologue distributions of the products. After physical changes and dechlorination, chlorine isotopologues of POCs are unlikely binomially distributed. The experimental results demonstrated that the chlorine isotopologue distributions of perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, methyl-triclosan, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran in standards and four polychlorinated biphenyls in both standard solutions and sediments were non-binomial.

The initial concept of One Health was formulated decades ago and focused on disease transfer from wildlife to human populations. More recently, the concept has been used to associate resilience to disease with the health of the ecosystem and resilience to environmental stressors. The need for a One Health approach is particularly evident in the plight of Old World vultures, which are facing a conservation crisis due to drastic reductions in populations across their entire range. Moreover, vulture conservation exemplifies many contemporary tenets of One Health; vultures are critical to a sustainable and resilient ecosystem, which in turn is essential for the socio-ecological health of human communities. In this review, we examine the complex factors contributing to the demise of Old World vulture populations, using the lens of One Health to conceptualize the primary drivers impacting the health and sustainability of these populations. The One Health concept provides the basis for the development of a framework that incorporates a multidimensional approach and includes human health, wildlife health, environmental and disease-related stressors, disease incidences, societal pressures, and environmental contaminants.

The production of microalgal biomass, which is associated with the remediation of effluent, production of biofuels, and by-products of high added value (such as bioethanol, biomethane, biodiesel, biofertilizers, and biochar), has been highlighted among the types of sustainable refineries. Further, consortium cultures, with interactions between microalgae and bacteria, fungi, and protozoa at the cellular level, can generate mutual relationships in the conversion and use of nutrients. Large-scale microalgae cultivation enables the mitigation of the presence of inorganic carbon in the atmosphere through microalgal cellular respiration. To assess the economic and environmental sustainability of the promotion of technologies that use microalgae, the relationships between the bioeconomy and renewable energy must be established. The present study sought to demonstrate the relationship between the factors associated with the cultivation of microalgae using effluents and the use of microalgal biomass in the production of biocomposites. Furthermore, whether these factors could favor the reduction of costs related to the production processes and boost the biorefinery industry were also investigated.

Although chemical pesticide applications generally result in short-term decreases of pest densities, densities can subsequently resurge to higher levels than before. Thus, pesticide effects on pest densities beyond a single pest generation may vary, but they have not been reviewed in a systematic manner. Using mathematical predator–prey models, we show that pest resurgence is expected when effective natural enemies are present, even when they are less sensitive to pesticides than the pest. Model simulations over multiple pest generations predict that pest resurgence due to pesticide applications will increase average pest densities throughout a growing season when effective natural enemies are present. We tested this prediction with a meta-analysis of published data of field experiments that compared effects of chemical control of arthropod plant pests in the presence and absence of natural enemies. This largely confirmed our prediction: overall, pesticide applications did not reduce pest densities significantly when natural enemies were present, which concerned the vast majority of cases. We also show that long-term pesticide effectiveness is underreported and suggest that pest control by natural enemies deserves more attention. © 2021 The Authors.

In agricultural regions, the quantity of aquatic insects emerging from freshwaters can be impacted by insecticides originating from surrounding croplands. We hypothesized that, in such regions, adult aquatic insects could also act as vectors of pesticide transfer to terrestrial food webs. To estimate insect-mediated pesticide flux from wetlands embedded in an important agricultural landscape, semipermanetly and temporarily ponded wetlands were surveyed in cropland and grassland landscapes across a natural salinity gradient in the Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota (USA) during the bird breeding season in 2015 and 2016 (n = 14 and 15 wetlands, respectively). Current-use pesticides, including the herbicide atrazine and the insecticides bifenthrin and imidacloprid, were detected in newly emerged insects. Pesticide detections were similar in insects emerging from agricultural and grassland wetlands. Biomass of emerging aquatic insects decreased 43%, and insect-mediated pesticide flux increased 50% along the observed gradient in concentrations of insecticides in emerging aquatic insects (from 3 to 577 ng total insecticide g–1 insect). Overall, adult aquatic insects were estimated to transfer between 2 and 180 µg total pesticide wetland–1 d–1 to the terrestrial ecosystem. In one of the 2 study years, biomass of emerging adult aquatic insects was also 73% lower from agricultural than grassland wetlands and was dependent on salinity. Our results suggest that accumulated insecticides reduce the availability of adult aquatic insect prey for insectivores and potentially increase insectivore exposure to insect-borne pesticides. Adult aquatic insects retain pesticides across metamorphosis and may expose insectivores living near both agricultural and grassland wetlands to dietary sources of toxic chemicals.

Unlike conventional pesticides, these compounds are eco-friendly and beneficial for human health. However the mechanisms by which these compounds repel insects and affect their physiology remains poorly known. Here we used Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) to address these issues. We tested a wild strain, and a laboratory bred Canton S strain. Bitter gourd extract reduced the viability of developing flies, but did not affect survival in adults. Flies avoided bitter gourd extract in a food choice assay, and consumed a significantly low amount of food mixed with bitter gourd – indicating that it acts as an antifeedant. Transgenic flies with impaired aversive taste sensitive neurons showed a reduced aversion towards bitter gourd extract showing that these compounds act through the bitter sensitive gustatory neurons. Finally, flies also retained the memory of consuming bitter gourd extract for at least 24 hours, suggesting an additional cognitive mechanism for long term aversion. Our study provides the first evidence of bitter gourd compounds acting as antifeedants and also as potent reinforcers of aversive memory in drosophilids. We suggest that flies can be used to understand the physiological and neural mechanisms underlying the mode of action of other such phyto-extracts with the goal of developing potent but less harmful pest control formulations. © 2021 Korean Society of Applied Entomology",,10.1016/j.aspen.2021.06.009,,NA,NA,exploring the neural mechanisms of aversion to bitter gourd phytochemicals in insects using drosophila

However, the ecotoxicity of fungicides in aquatic species remains scarcely assessed at environmentally relevant concentrations, and there is scant information available on their combined effects. This study aims at investigating multi-level changes elicited by two currently used fungicides, boscalid and tebuconazole, in the amphipod Gammarus fossarum. In microcosms, gammarids were exposed for 72 h to fungicides tested individually or in binary mixture at 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 μg/L to monitor individual performances (locomotion, respiration and amplexus formation) and biochemical parameters (involved in energy metabolism, growth, moulting and cell stress). This range of exposure concentrations was field-realistic and largely lower than local environmental quality standards for the protection of aquatic wildlife. Overall, results showed that single and combined exposures altered the mobility and respiratory activity of individuals. At the cellular level, boscalid inhibited energy-based biomarkers whereas tebuconazole led to cytotoxicity associated with reduced antioxidant defences. In binary mixtures, the biochemical responses were mainly driven by the presence of boscalid. Multi-variable analyses, integrating individual alterations and cellular impairments alike, confirmed the relevance of the multi-level approach in forecasting the toxicity of fungicides and their mixtures towards other aquatic species.

Here, we investigated the effects of constant temperature and daily heat spikes, in presence/absence of insecticide treatment (cyfluthrin), on the condition (impairment of mobility) and thermal tolerance to cold (-6 °C) and heat (42.5 °C) of the terrestrial beetle Alphitobius diaperinus. The responses of insects from four populations (three farm-collected populations, one laboratory population) to different durations of extreme temperature exposure were compared. The results showed that the laboratory population was generally more sensitive to extreme cold and heat temperatures, with less than 50% of adults recovering after an exposure at -6 or +42.5 °C for 3h. Significant differences in the level of thermal tolerance were also found among insects from poultry farms.

The goal of this study was to determine the consequences of land management actions on the primary drivers of contaminant mixtures in five agricultural watersheds in the Chesapeake Bay, the largest watershed of the Atlantic Seaboard in North America where fish health issues have been documented for two decades. Surface water was collected and analyzed for 301 organic contaminants to determine the benefits of implemented best management practices (BMPs) designed to reduce nutrients and sediment to streams in also reducing contaminants in surface waters. Of the contaminants measured, herbicides (atrazine, metolachlor), phytoestrogens (formononetin, genistein, equol), cholesterol and total estrogenicity (indicator of estrogenic response) were detected frequently enough to statistically compare to seasonal flow effects, landscape variables and BMP intensity. Contaminant concentrations were often positively correlated with seasonal stream flow, although the magnitude of this effect varied by contaminant across seasons and sites. Land-use and other less utilized landscape variables including biosolids, manure and pesticide application and percent phytoestrogen producing crops were inversely related with site-average contaminant concentrations. Increased BMP intensity was negatively related to contaminant concentrations indicating potential co-benefits of BMPs for contaminant reduction in the studied watersheds.

Two species of small mammals (deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus and cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus) were collected from historically dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)-contaminated and reference areas at the Redstone Arsenal (Huntsville, AL, USA), a US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)-designated Superfund site. Soil samples taken concurrently with mammal collection from the DDT abatement site exhibited DDT and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) levels >1 ppm (USEPA total threshold limit concentration for DDT and DDE <1 ppm), whereas soil samples from the reference area had undetectable levels. Liver samples from individuals of both species collected in the contaminated areas also had significantly elevated DDT/DDE levels, with P. maniculatus averaging an approximately 20× greater load than that documented for S. hispidus. Both rodent species collected from the contaminated site had significantly lower total leukocyte counts and total differential blood cell counts (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively) than those collected from the nearby (~7000-m) reference site. Cellular stress indices also trended higher in both species, suggesting a potential for chronic exposure to DDT to act as a mediator of oxidative damage.

As ecosystems become increasingly exposed to chemical contaminants globally, it is important to consider not only the immediate consequences of contaminant exposure but also the potential costs associated with evolved responses. Theory predicts there may be trade-offs, including increased susceptibility to parasites, associated with evolved pesticide tolerance. It remains unclear, however, how environmental context (i.e. presence/absence of pesticides in the contemporary environment) interacts with evolved pesticide tolerance levels to influence infection outcomes. Several studies have demonstrated that wood frog (Rana sylvatica) populations close to agriculture, where frequent exposure to pesticides is more likely, show higher baseline tolerance to pesticides than do populations far from agriculture. Using eight wood frog populations from across an agricultural gradient, we explored patterns of variation in susceptibility to parasites associated with a population's proximity to agriculture (a proxy for pesticide tolerance), and how these patterns are influenced by experimental exposure of tadpoles to the insecticide carbaryl. We did this by first placing tadpoles in an environment containing the pesticide carbaryl (1 mg/L) or in a pesticide-free control environment for 5 days, and subsequently exposing tadpoles to trematodes (Echinostoma trivolvis) or ranavirus (frog virus 3). We found that variation in trematode susceptibility was related to the tadpole populations’ proximity to agriculture. Individuals from populations located close to agriculture were modestly more susceptible to trematode infections than individuals from populations farther from agriculture. Ranavirus susceptibility was not associated with proximity to agriculture. Surprisingly, exposure to carbaryl increased the survival rates of tadpoles infected with ranavirus. There were no other significant effects of carbaryl exposure on the measured disease outcomes. This study provides evidence for a potential trade-off between trematode resistance and putative pesticide tolerance. We show that host populations can vary significantly in their susceptibility to pathogens, but that pesticide exposure does not always increase parasite susceptibility or uniformly exacerbate disease outcomes. Further research is needed to determine how genetic variation among populations impact susceptibility to parasites, and if these patterns of susceptibility are consistent across space and time. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,10.1111/fwb.13708,Pesticides,NA,NA,populationlevel variation in infection outcomes not influenced by pesticide exposure in larval wood frogs rana sylvatica

Here, a sustainable, environmentally friendly strategy was designed for the control of major rice insect pests (i.e. Nilaparvata lugens, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis and Chilo suppressalis) with minimal impact on natural enemies via selection of a specific entomopathogenic fungal strain for use as a biological control agent. In large-scale multiyear field applications, Metarhizium anisopliae CQMa421 was shown to act as effectively as chemical pesticides for pest control. Rice pest control applications in all major rice-producing provinces in China covering > 6000 hectares, performed over a period of 8 years (2011–2018), showed equal rice harvest yields between the use of the fungal pathogen versus chemical pesticides. More importantly, the use of the specific fungal pathogen isolated by this strategy resulted in an increase in beneficial insects and other animals. These long-term field evaluation data and large-scale application results demonstrated the feasibility of shifting from chemical dependency to more nuanced approaches for pest control for maintaining agricultural productivity while protecting natural enemies.

Thus, basic knowledge of their physiological effects on insects is needed, especially for understanding their impact on beneficial insect species. In this study, we evaluated the effect of a pendimethalin-based herbicide (PND) on the cellular immune response of the carabid beetle Harpalus (Pseudoophonus) rufipes (De Geer 1774) (Coleoptera, Carabidae), acting as biocontrol agent in agroecosystems. Total and differential haemocyte counts and phagocytosis assay, performed by injecting in vivo carboxylate-modified polystyrene latex beads, were measured in beetles exposed to a recommended field dose (4L per ha) of PND to evaluate the exposure effects over the time. The pattern of haemocyte subpopulations and the decrease of the phagocytic index after the exposure to PND suggested a lowering of P. rufipes ability to face an infection performing a cell-mediated response. PND was also found to cause cytotoxic effects on the haemocyte ultrastructure. Ultrastructural alterations such as irregular shape, large vacuolization of the cytoplasm, and condensation of marginated chromatin were recorded from 2d of exposure. The loss of RER, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria integrity and the swelling of the outer nuclear membrane found in some haemocytes suggested an interference of PND with the membrane permeability. Results indicated that the exposure to PND impairs the distribution, morphology and physiological functions of haemocytes causing a decrease of P. rufipes immunocompetence. Moreover, the sensitivity to herbicide exposure makes this species a suitable model and a useful bioindicator for monitoring exposure effects on non-target species.

Agricultural practices are recognized to be an important pressure on farmland biodiversity, and pesticides are suspected to be one of the main causes of this decline in biodiversity. As part of the national plan for reduction of pesticides use (Ecophyto), the French ministry of agriculture launched the 500 ENI (nonintended effects) monitoring program in 2012 in order to assess the unintended effects of agricultural practices, including pesticide use, on biodiversity represented by several taxonomic groups of interest for farmers. This long-term program monitors the biodiversity of nontargeted species (earthworms, plants, coleoptera, and birds), together with a wide range of annual data on agricultural practices (crop rotation, soil tillage, weed control, fertilizers, chemical treatments, etc.). Other parameters (e.g., landscape and climatic characteristics) are also integrated as covariates during the analyses. This monitoring program is expected to improve our understanding of the relative contribution of the different drivers of population and community trends.

However, it is not only these overt impacts of human activities that are contributing to the global biodiversity crisis. Other disturbances, such as artificial light, anthropogenically generated noise, dust, vibrations, and physical visual disturbances (e.g., foreign objects such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles - UAVs) may be subtle or indirect, yet capable of creating significant impacts to fauna. These disturbances have previously been termed ‘enigmatic impacts’, suggesting they may be difficult to quantify or address. While there has been little research focus towards the mitigation or remediation of these impacts in conservation and restoration planning, a growing body of literature demonstrates that they can be disruptive and damaging to animal populations at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present a global review of the empirical evidence for disturbances (excluding direct habitat loss) that result from anthropogenic activities, developments, and industries, which are deleterious to the natural ecology of fauna species or communities.

However, use of an IGR product in a large-scale eradication program for a widespread invasive ant (Anoploepis gracilipes; yellow crazy ant) was ineffective. We tested the IGR in question (active ingredient: (S)-methoprene) on A. gracilipes colonies in a laboratory environment to evaluate efficacy. RESULTS: We found that treatment with (S)-methoprene resulted in lower egg production with subsequently decreased numbers of larvae, pupae, and workers over the 135 days of the experiment. None of the treated colonies died, and the number of worker ants in treated colonies was 36% of that seen in control colonies 135 days post-treatment. Treated queen egg production was 39% lower than queens in control colonies, but we saw no effect of treatment on the internal physiology of dissected queens. Treatment had no effect on worker activity levels. CONCLUSION: Our results show that although (S)-methoprene treatment reduced production of larvae, pupae and workers in treated colonies, the magnitude of reduction was lower than might be expected considering the responses of other species against which this IGR has been tested.

However, little is known about the persistence of harmful effects or potential recovery in response to a period of exposure to a sublethal insecticide dose. Adults of the mustard leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), were either exposed to a sublethal concentration of the pyrethroid λ-cyhalothrin for two weeks or kept unexposed as control. During, immediately after and at a delayed time after the exposure, consumption and reproduction, i.e., number of eggs laid and hatching success, were assessed. In addition, long-term effects on unexposed offspring were investigated. Exposure to λ-cyhalothrin reduced the consumption during the insecticide exposure, but led to compensatory feeding in females at a delayed time after exposure. The reproductive output of females was impaired during and directly after λ-cyhalothrin exposure. At the delayed time point there was no clear evidence for a recovery, as the reproduction of heavier females was still negatively affected, while lighter females showed an enhanced reproduction. Persistent negative effects on unexposed offspring had been found when collected from parents directly after a λ-cyhalothrin exposure period. In contrast, in the present experiment neither negative effects on life-history traits nor on consumption were observed in unexposed offspring derived from parents at the delayed time after λ-cyhalothrin exposure. Moreover, eggs of offspring from insecticide-exposed parents showed a higher hatching success than those of offspring of unexposed parents, which may indicate transgenerational hormesis.

Great progress has been achieved in identifying the species-specific sensitivity to dioxin-like compounds, which is attributed to different amino acid residues in the ligand-binding domain of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Besides the conventional concentration additivity, several studies have suggested that different classes of POPs possibly act synergistically or antagonistically based on their concentration. However, ecotoxicology information is still recorded in a scattered and inadequate manner, including lack of enough avian species, limited number of POPs investigated, and insufficient geographical representation, and thus our understanding of the effects of POPs on birds remains rudimentary, although mechanistic understanding of their mode of action is progressing. Particularly, research on what happens to wild bird populations and their ecosystems under POP stress is still unavailable. Thus, our aim is to predict and trace the effects POPs at different biological organization levels, especially from the molecular, cellular and individual levels to the population, community and ecosystem levels because of the limited and scattered information, as mentioned above. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,10.1039/d0em00451k,Ecotoxicology,33660728,NA,ecotoxicology of persistent organic pollutants in birds

Although most seabirds perish within the natural environment as a result of human activities, some are rescued and admitted to rehabilitation centres. Despite the considerable number of admissions, little is known regarding the physiological response seabirds have to specific admission reasons and the rehabilitation process. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of injury, emaciation, oiling, individual removal from the natural environment and the rehabilitation process on the physiological stress response of the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus). Urofaecal samples were collected from African penguins throughout a three-stage rehabilitation process and quantified for glucocorticoid metabolites (ufGCM). The three stages included an initial ICU crate stage (Stage 1), an ICU pen stage (Stage 2) and a rehabilitation stage (Stage 3). Data were analysed using a generalised linear model in order to determine the effect of admission reason, age and rehabilitation stage (Stage 1, 2 and 3) on ufGCM levels. Although the model indicated that only Stage 1 was a significant driver of adrenocortical activity in the study population, ufGCM levels of injured and emaciated animals within Stage 1 were considerably higher than those of birds with any other admission reason across all stages. This is the first study examining the causes and effect of rehabilitation on the physiological stress response in African penguins.

To avoid adverse side effects, there is a growing interest in promoting alternative methods including biological control based on the use of natural enemies. The European earwig Forficula auricularia L. (Dermaptera: Forficuidae) is an effective predator in apple orchards. Pesticide pressure has been shown to divert energy resources which could have a negative impact on life history traits. In this study we assessed (i) whether variations in pesticide exposure could differentially impact energy reserves, body weight and morphometric parameters of F. auricularia, and (ii) whether these effects persist into the next generation reared under optimal conditions. Individuals from the first generation were collected in late October from organic, IPM and conventional orchards. The next generation was obtained under a rearing program, in the absence of pesticide exposure. Earwigs collected from conventional orchards exhibited lower values for all morphometric parameters compared to those collected in organic orchards. However, a relaxed period without pesticide exposure (in autumn) appears to have allowed the females to recover their energy reserves to ensure reproduction and maternal care. Glycogen contents were the reserves that were more easily restored. However, probably due to the rearing conditions (food ad libitum), all the earwigs from the second generation exhibited higher body weights and energy reserves than their parents. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143604,Pesticides;Energy Metabolism;Body Weight,33246715,NA,how lasting are the effects of pesticides on earwigs a study based on energy metabolism body weight and morphometry in two generations of forficula auricularia from apple orchards

We examined effects of dermal PFAS exposure (30 d) on survival and growth of juvenile American toads (Anaxyrus americanus), eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum), and northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens). Chemicals included perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS) at 0, 80, 800, or 8000 ppb on a moss dry weight basis. Exposure to PFAS influenced final snout–vent length (SVL) and scaled mass index (SMI), a measure of relative body condition. Observed effects depended on species and chemical, but not concentration. Anurans exposed to PFOS, PFHxS (frogs only), and 6:2 FTS demonstrated reduced SVL versus controls, whereas salamanders exposed to 6:2 FTS showed increased SVL. Frogs exposed to PFHxS and 6:2 FTS and toads exposed to PFOS had increased SMI compared to controls; salamanders did not demonstrate effects. Concentrations of 6:2 FTS in substrate decreased substantially by 30 d, likely driven by microbial action. Perfluorooctane sulfonate had notable biota–sediment accumulation factors, but was still <1.

To understand pesticide effects on fish ChEs mean activity and variability, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses. Our goal was to verify (i) if brain and muscle ChEs responded differently to pesticide exposure; (ii) how fish size and life stage (i.e., juvenile and adult) influence ChEs variability and mean activity; (iii) what type of pesticides (i.e., herbicide, insecticide, and fungicide) has the strongest effect, and if the analytical-grade compounds differ from commercial formulations; (iv) if increasing concentrations combined with prolonged exposure leads to stronger ChEs inhibition; and (v) how each class of pesticide affects these enzymes. We validated ChEs reliability as biomarkers and identified factors influencing their response. Regardless of tissue, BChE response was more variable than AChE, and no difference between their average activity was detected. The size of juvenile fish is an important factor affecting ChEs mean activity and variability, whereas pesticide had no significant effect on adult fish ChEs. Insecticides were stronger inhibitors compared to herbicides and fungicides. Analytical-grade compounds decreased ChEs mean activity to a higher degree than commercial formulations. The combined effect of concentration and time was only significant for fungicides and insecticides. Among classes, organophosphorus insecticides had the strongest effect on ChEs, followed by carbamates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids. Organophosphorus herbicides and oxazolidinones were the only herbicides to decrease ChEs mean activity significantly, and their effects were similar from those of pyrethroids and organochlorines. Additionally, our results identified research gaps, such as the small number of studies on fungicides, neonicotinoids and other relevant pesticides. These findings suggest future directions, which might help researchers identify robust cause-effect relationships between fish ChEs and pesticides. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143829,Pesticides,33248758,NA,pesticide effects on fish cholinesterase variability and mean activity a metaanalytic review

The research was concentrated in the 1970s and 1980s, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in the USA. Of the total species in the world, only 5% of them have been studied, evaluating predominantly insectivorous species of the Family Vespertilionidae. Insecticides, mainly organochlorines, were the most studied pesticides. Most research was observational, with little information available on the effects of pesticides on natural bat populations. Despite the advances in analytical techniques for detecting contaminants, the number of studies is still insufficient compared to the number of active ingredients used. The effects of pesticides on other guilds and tropical species remain poorly studied. Future research should investigate the effects of pesticides, especially in sublethal doses causing chronic exposure.

Together with increasing urbanisation, chemical pollution arising from these land uses is a recognised threat to wildlife. Raptors are known to be particularly sensitive to pollutants that biomagnify and are thus frequently used sentinels for pollution in food webs. The current study focussed on anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) but also considered selected medicinal products (MPs) and frequently used plant protection products (PPPs). We analysed livers of raptor species from agricultural and urban habitats in Germany, namely red kites (MIML; Milvus milvus), northern goshawks (ACGE; Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawks (ACNI; Accipiter nisus) as well as white-tailed sea eagles (HAAL; Haliaeetus albicilla) and ospreys (PAHA; Pandion haliaetus) to account for potential aquatic exposures. Landscape composition was quantified using geographic information systems. The highest detection of ARs occurred in ACGE (81.3%; n = 48), closely followed by MIML (80.5%; n = 41), HAAL (38.3%; n = 60) and ACNI (13%; n = 23), whereas no ARs were found in PAHA (n = 13). Generalized linear models demonstrated (1) an increased probability for adults to be exposed to ARs with increasing urbanisation, and (2) that species-specific traits were responsible for the extent of exposure. For MPs, we found ibuprofen in 14.9% and fluoroquinolones in 2.3% in individuals that were found dead. Among 30 investigated PPPs, dimethoate (and its metabolite omethoate) and thiacloprid were detected in two MIML each. We assumed that the levels of dimethoate were a consequence of deliberate poisoning. AR and insecticide poisoning were considered to represent a threat to red kites and may ultimately contribute to reported decreased survival rates. Overall, our study suggests that urban raptors are at greatest risk for AR exposure and that exposures may not be limited to terrestrial food webs. © 2020 The Authors",,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110602,Biological Factors;Germany;Prednisolone,33307088,NA,linking landscape composition and biological factors with exposure levels of rodenticides and agrochemicals in avian apex predators from germany

To avoid excessive financial losses due to SBR, farmers utilize fungicides. Increasing fungicide costs are, therefore, becoming a threat to farmers’ incomes. Developing SBR-resistant cultivars is a possible solution to this problem. To investigate the effects of SBR-resistant cultivars on soybean farmers in Paraguay, we constructed a model for the supply and demand of soybeans considering yields, cultivated area, changes in the stock quantity of soybeans, exports of soybeans and soybean products, feed demand for soybean cake and price linkage functions. We established three scenarios: an SBR pandemic in which fungicides become ineffective (Scenario 1) and the adoption of SBR-resistant cultivars in 33% (Scenarios 2) and 75% (Scenarios 3) of cultivated areas. The estimation of these three scenarios demonstrates that SBR-resistant cultivar adoption will significantly reduce current fungicide costs for farmers by 112-253 million United States dollars (USD). The potential benefits of the widespread dissemination of SBR-resistant cultivars are also considered in terms of economic disparities and environmental risks.

Bti exposure extended host larval period, and atrazine exposure had a nonsignificant trend toward reducing host survival; however, neither pesticide influenced parasite success nor magnified the effects of parasites on their hosts. Parasites negatively influenced tadpole development and, by metamorphosis, parasitized frogs had severe limb deformities and greater mass than unparasitized frogs. The greater mass in parasitized frogs may have resulted from reduced competition between tadpoles and snails for algal resources because parasites decreased snail abundance in mesocosms. Reduced competition between tadpoles and snails may offset the direct negative effects of trematodes on tadpoles, enabling them to survive with high infection intensities.

Recent studies have shown that the damaging toxicological effects of pesticides can be amplified in stressful environments. However, few studies have documented these effects in natural settings where organisms are simultaneously exposed to pesticides and to other environmental stressors such as parasites. In this study, we assessed both pesticide and ectoparasite effects on the physiology of a free-ranging bird.

We found that combined exposure to pesticides and Protocalliphora larvae was negatively related to haematocrit, suggesting possible synergistic effects. However, we found no such relationships with BKA and leucocyte counts, highlighting the complexity of physiological responses to multiple stressors in natural settings.

The chemical studies showed increased pesticide concentrations in the gills as the first site for pollutants compared to the liver at the 96th hour. In addition, the histological analyses showed severe alterations in the gills and liver after exposure to both tested pesticides. In the gills, we found mainly intense proliferative and, to a lesser extent, degenerative changes and alterations in the circulatory system, such as necrosis and vasodilation. In the liver, regressive and progressive lesions, as well as circulatory disturbances and inflammation, were observed. The regressive lesions showed a higher degree of expression compared to the other changes. Furthermore, we found altered enzymatic activities—catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase—in the liver, compared to the control. Overall, both tested pesticides impacted the studied biomarkers in common carp, even at concentrations lower than those permitted by law. However, the results of the comparative analysis showed a relatively higher toxicity of CYP compared to CPF in the fish. Still, questions persist as to whether the observed changes are adaptive or entirely destructive. To avoid any danger or risk, these pesticides must be applied cautiously, especially near water bodies. © 2021 by the authors.

Danish drinking water comes entirely from groundwater. Both the raw groundwater and the treated drinking water are regularly monitored, and the chemical analyses are reported to a publicly available national database (Jupiter). Based on these data, in this study we (1) provide a status of pesticide content in drinking water supplied by public waterworks in Denmark and (2) assess the proportion of Danish households exposed to pesticides from drinking water. ‘Pesticides’ here refers also to their metabolites, degradation and reaction products. The cleaned dataset represents 3004 public waterworks distributed throughout the country and includes 39 798 samples of treated drinking water analysed for 449 pesticides (971 723 analyses total) for the period 2002–2019. Of all these chemical analyses, 0.5% (n = 4925) contained a quantified pesticide (>0.03 µg/l). Pesticides were found at least once in the treated drinking water at 29% of all sampled public waterworks for the period 2002–2019 and at 21% of the waterworks for the recent period 2015–2019. We estimate that 56% of all Danish households were potentially exposed at least once to pesticides in drinking water at concentrations of 0.03–4.00 µg/l between 2002 and 2019. However, in 2015–2019, the proportion of the Danish households exposed to pesticides (0.03–4.00 µg/l) was 41%. The proportion of Danish households potentially exposed at least once to pesticides above the maximum allowed concentration (0.1 µg/l) according to the EU Drinking Water Directive (and the Danish drinking water standard) was 19% for 2002–2019 and 11% for 2015–2019.

Agricultural intensification, however, can impact bats foraging near crops, affecting the ecosystem services they provide. Exposure to pesticides, for example, may induce chromosome breakage or missegregation that can result in micronucleus formation. Detection of micronuclei is a simple, inexpensive, and relatively minimally invasive technique commonly used to evaluate chemical genotoxicity but rarely applied to assess wildlife genotoxic effects. We evaluated the suitability of the micronucleus test as a biomarker of genotoxicity for biomonitoring field studies in bats. We collected blood samples from insectivorous bats roosting in caves surrounded by different levels of disturbance (agriculture, human settlements) in Colima and Jalisco, west central Mexico. Then, we examined the frequency of micronucleus inclusions in erythrocytes using differentially stained blood smears. Bats from caves surrounded by proportionately more (53%) land used for agriculture and irrigated year-round had higher micronucleus frequency than bats from a less disturbed site (15% agriculture). We conclude that the micronucleus test is a sensitive method to evaluate genotoxic effects in free-ranging bats and could provide a useful biomarker for evaluating risk of exposure in wild populations.

Average levels (gaseous and particulate phase) of PAHs (36 compounds, 11–18 ng/m3), PCBs (49 congeners, 77–93 pg/m3) and OCPs (23 substances, 77–140 pg/m3) were comparable to those reported for similar locations worldwide. Multiple-linear regression analysis, performed to relate atmospheric concentrations with meteorological conditions, revealed as main controlling factors local sources for PAHs and long-range transport (LRT) for PCBs and OCPs. The consideration of parent-metabolite ratios for most OCPs excluded fresh inputs. The application of the potential source contribution function (PSCF) identified Black Sea and eastern Balkans as likely sources for PCBs and OCPs. Significant linear correlations (R2 = 0.79–0.98) were determined between the partitioning coefficients (logKp) and partial vapor pressures (logPL0) for most air samples for PAHs and PCBs excepting OCPs. Slope mr values were close to −1 for PAHs and OCPs indicating gas/particle partitioning close to equilibrium. The corresponding mr values for PCBs were shallower (&lt;-0.60) denoting non-equilibrium conditions and potential sampling artefacts.

At harvest, we found pest outbreaks increased four-fold in simplified, vineyard-dominated landscapes compared to complex landscapes in which vineyards are surrounded by semi-natural habitats. Similarly, insecticide applications doubled in vineyard-dominated landscapes but declined in vineyards surrounded by shrubland.

We firstly compared the baseline activity of B-esterases and glutathione-S-transferase in Allolobophora chlorotica and Aporrectodea caliginosa. Secondly, vulnerability of these species to pesticide exposure was assessed by in vitro trials using the organophosphate (OP) chlorpyrifos-ethyl-oxon (CPOx) and ethyl-paraoxon (POx), and by short-term (7 days) in vivo metabolic responses in soil contaminated with pesticides. Among B-esterases, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was abundant in the microsomal fraction (80% and 70% of total activity for A. caliginosa and A. chlorotica, respectively). Carboxylesterase (CbE) activities were measured using three substrates to examine species differences in isoenzyme and sensitivity to both in vitro and in vivo exposure. CbEs were mainly found in the cytosolic fraction (80% and 60% for A. caliginosa and A. chlorotica respectively). GST was exclusively found in the soluble fraction for both species. Both OPs inhibited B-esterases in a concentration-dependent manner. In vitro trials revealed a pesticide-specific response, being A. chlorotica AChE more sensitive to CPOx compared to POx. CbE activity was inhibited at the same extent in both species. The 7-d exposure showed A. chlorotica less sensitive to both OPs, which contrasted with outcomes from in vitro experiments.

As a result, carbon isotope ratios derived from different chlorine-isotopologue pairs, e.g. 12C235Cl4 vs. 12C13C35Cl4, should be consistent. Yet this recognition may not exactly reflect the reality. This study investigated the consistency/inconsistency of carbon isotope compositions of chlorine-isotopologue pairs of individual organochlorines including two chloroethylenes, three polychlorinated biphenyls, methyl-triclosan and hexachlorobenzene. The raw carbon isotope ratios were measured by gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Data simulations in terms of background subtraction, background addition, dual 13C-atoms substitution, deuterium substitution and hydrogen-transfer, along with measurements at different injection concentrations were conducted to confirm the validity of measured carbon isotope ratios and their differences. Inconsistent carbon isotope ratios derived from chlorine-isotopologue pairs of individual organochlorines were observed, and the isotopologues of each organochlorine were thus inferred to be non-randomly distributed. Mechanistic interpretation for these findings was tentatively proposed according to a basic principle in clumped-isotope geochemistry, reaction thermodynamics and kinetics, along with isotope effects occurring in electron ionisation mass spectrometry. This study sheds light on the actual carbon isotope compositions of chlorine-isotopologue pairs of organochlorines, and yields new insights into the real distributions of carbon and chlorine isotopologues.

Statistical analyses and principal component analysis suggested that the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers contributes to the accumulation of HMs and REEs in the soil. Different accumulation patterns were recorded in treated fields as a consequence of the type and amount of agrochemical used and the crop rotation.

We hypothesise that ecosystem services can be spatially quantified at high spatial and thematic detail by integration of local knowledge and data within models, contributing to identification of key factors that influence their delivery. We demonstrate this by making use of local knowledge and data to assess ecosystem services in the Hoeksche Waard, a Dutch municipality characterised by historically-rich cultural landscapes and predominant agriculture. Ecosystem services assessed include crop production, air quality regulation, human health, pest control, soil biodiversity, sociocultural values, property value. Quantification methods were selected based on their suitability for modelling ecosystem services given particular resource endowments (i.e., time, data, knowledge). Methods implemented include look-up tables, causal relationships, expert elicitation, primary data extrapolation, and regression models. Maps displaying the distribution of ecosystem services at high spatial resolution (10 × 10 m) enabled identification of factors that influence their delivery, including the distribution and typology of natural elements, ecological pressures that require mitigation, and the distribution of inhabitants that act as ecosystem service beneficiaries. For instance, the distribution and typology of field margins plays a key role in the suppression of pests (aphids) by natural enemies (hoverflies, carabids, coccinellids). Air quality regulation (i.e. particulate matter retention) is highest in the northeast sector of the municipality given higher concentrations of particulate matter that require mitigation due to the area's proximity to the cities of Rotterdam and Dordrecht.

However, organic herbicides may also adversely affect beneficial insects, and their nontarget effects are unknown. Here, we examine the combined impacts of cultural and chemical tools on weed cover while monitoring activity of beneficial epigeal insects and measuring rates of weed seed biological control to assess potential nontarget effects of organic herbicides. In a 2-yr experiment, we compared three cover crop mulch treatments and three organic herbicide treatments (capric/ caprylic acid, corn gluten meal, and herbicide-free) in a reduced-tillage system.

However, information on CECs in freshwater environments in sub-Saharan countries is very limited. Here, we investigated the occurrence of CECs in snails and sediments collected from 48 sites within the Lake Victoria South Basin, Kenya, which have been previously investigated for water contamination. Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) with a target list of 429 compounds. Results: In total, 30 compounds have been detected in snails and 78 in sediment samples, compared to 79 previously identified compounds in water. By extending the monitoring of CECs to snails and sediments, we found 68 compounds that were not previously detected in water. These compounds include the anti-cancer drug anastrozole, detected for the first time in the Kenyan environment. Individual compound concentrations were detected up to 480 ng/g wet weight (N-ethyl-o-toluenesulfonamide) in snails and 110 ng/g organic carbon (pirimiphos-methyl) in sediments. Higher contaminant concentrations were found in agricultural sites than in areas not impacted by anthropogenic activities. Crustaceans were the organisms at greatest toxic risk from sediment contamination [toxic unit (TU) up to 0.99] with diazinon and pirimiphos-methyl driving this risk. Acute and chronic risks to algae were driven by diuron (TU up to 0.24), whereas fish were found to be at low-to-no acute risk (TU up to 0.007). Conclusions: The compound classes present at the highest frequencies in all matrices were pesticides and biocides. This study shows substantial contamination of surface water in rural western Kenya.

We collected 551 samples of 10 different vegetables in 11 cities from Zhejiang province during 2015–2017. Three fungicides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The average apparent recoveries of three fungicides ranged from 84.2% to 110% with the relative standard deviations lower than 10%. The LOD values of procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin was 2, 0.09, and 1 μg/kg, respectively. The levels of procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin in those vegetables ranged from ND-875, ND-238, and ND-76 μg/kg, respectively. The highest mean concentrations of procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin were found in eggplant (68 μg/kg), spinach (16.4 μg/kg), and kidney bean (4 μg/kg), respectively. Tomato (62.6% of samples), eggplant (44.3% of samples), and cucumber (41.6% of samples) were most frequently detected with fungicides. Solanaceous fruit vegetables have the highest detection rate than other vegetables, and fungicides were most frequently detected in winter. The mean concentrations of three fungicides in different vegetables were all below the maximum residue limits for the national food safety standards of China, and the health risks resulting from consuming those vegetables in adults and children were all within the safe ranges.

Toxicant exposure can alter the local transmission of wildlife diseases by reducing survival or altering immune defence. However, predicting the impacts of pathogens on wildlife across their ranges is complicated by heterogeneity in toxicant exposure across the landscape, especially if toxicants alter wildlife movement from toxicant-contaminated to uncontaminated habitats. We developed a mechanistic model to explore how toxicant effects on host health and movement propensity influence range-wide pathogen transmission, and zoonotic exposure risk, as an increasing fraction of the landscape is toxicant-contaminated. When toxicant-contaminated habitat is scarce on the landscape, costs to movement and survival from toxicant exposure can trap infected animals in contaminated habitat and reduce landscape-level transmission. Increasing the proportion of contaminated habitat causes host population declines from combined effects of toxicants and infection. The onset of host declines precedes an increase in the density of infected hosts in contaminated habitat and thus may serve as an early warning of increasing potential for zoonotic spillover in urbanizing landscapes. These results highlight how sublethal effects of toxicants can determine pathogen impacts on wildlife populations that may not manifest until landscape contamination is widespread. © 2020 The Author(s).",,10.1098/rsbl.2020.0559,,33202181,NA,landscapelevel toxicant exposure mediates infection impacts on wildlife populations toxicants and infection in wildlife

More specifically, induced pesticide tolerance, in which populations exposed to a contaminant show increased tolerance to the contaminants later, has been documented in multiple taxa. However, the physiological mechanisms of induced tolerance remain unclear. We hypothesized that induced pesticide tolerance is the result of a generalized stress response based on previous studies showing that both natural stressors and anthropogenic stressors can induce tolerance to pesticides. We tested this hypothesis by first exposing larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) to either an anthropogenic stressor (sublethal carbaryl concentration), a natural stressor (cues from a caged predator), or a simulated stressor via exogenous exposure to the stress hormone corticosterone (125 nM). We also included treatments that inhibited corticosterone synthesis with the compound metyrapone (MTP). We then exposed the larvae to a lethal carbaryl treatment to assess time to death. We found that prior exposure to 125 nM of exogenous CORT and predator cues induced tolerance to a lethal concentration of carbaryl through a slight delay in time to death. Pre-exposure to sublethal carbaryl, as well as MTP alone or in combination with predator cues, did not induce tolerance to the lethal carbaryl concentration relative to the ethanol vehicle control treatment. Our study provides evidence that pesticide tolerance can be induced by a generalized stress response both in the presence and absence (exogenous CORT) of specific cues and highlights the importance of considering physiological ecology and environmental context in ecotoxicology. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s10646-020-02277-2,Pesticides,32936363,NA,pesticide tolerance induced by a generalized stress response in wood frogs rana sylvatica

Studying their effects is critical because they can induce positive hormetic responses, possibly leading to greater pest multiplication and promoting the evolution of pest resistance. Here, we investigated the responses of the pest moth Spodoptera littoralis to low concentrations of deltamethrin, and tested for variation in effects of the pesticide between developmental stages and sexes. Indeed, we show that a given concentration of deltamethrin has different effects between stages, and even between sexes. Two experimental concentrations led to very high mortality early in S. littoralis development (4th larval instar), but only to low mortality rates in adults. Moreover, our highest experimental concentration had only detrimental effects in adult females, but improved the reproductive success of adult males. Model projections showed that the lethality from treatments at the 4th larval instar was the predominant effect. Because of the high multiplication rate of S. littoralis, it was also found that treatments with very similar effects on larval mortality can lead to either population extinction or rapid pest resurgence. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s11356-020-10181-9,,32696409,NA,effects of low concentrations of deltamethrin are dependent on developmental stages and sexes in the pest moth spodoptera littoralis

However, the current regulatory environmental risk assessment considers thresholds from laboratory studies completed under standardized conditions that do not reflect environmental dynamics. Using the General Unified Threshold model for Survival (GUTS) model framework, we predicted the impact of time-varying pesticide exposures on the survival of gammarids in a small agricultural stream. The LP50 values were used as an additional metric for assessing risks (defined in GUTS as a multiplication factor applied to the concentration time series to induce 50% mortality by the end of exposure). Although real-case exposures to individual pesticides were predicted to produce little to no impact on survival, the LP50 values indicate acute (LP50 ≤ 100) and/or chronic (LP50 ≤ 10) toxicities for azoxystrobin, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and imidacloprid, while risk to propiconazole exposure was considered very low (LP50 ≫ 100). Finally, the model was extended to reflect mixture toxicity via concentration addition. It predicted risks under acute and chronic exposures to organophosphates and neonicotinoids. Given that gammarids are simultaneously exposed to multiple chemicals and other stressors throughout their lifetime, a decline in survival probabilities due to chemical stress can likely influence their overall fitness. We recognize that some assumptions require validation, but our work included a level of realism that can assist risk managers when evaluating the cumulative consequences of chemical exposure.

Thus, to evaluate possible ecological stress due to pesticide load, a thorough assessment of the potential toxicity of pesticide mixtures is required. Here we report water discharge and quality data of an eastern Mediterranean micro-estuary (Alexander stream), targeting the temporal distribution of a pesticide mixture. Over 150 water samples were collected during 2 hydrological years representing base-flow and flood conditions. On average, each water sample contained 34 and 45 different pesticides with peak concentrations of 1.4 μg L−1 of Imidacloprid and 55 μg L−1 of Diuron during base-flow and flood events, respectively. Pesticide mixtures were potentially toxic to benthic invertebrates and algae during flood events, surpassing the toxicity benchmark with medians of 110% and 155%, respectively. The herbicide Diuron and the insecticide Imidacloprid were the main pesticides responsible for the high potential toxicity during flood events. The falling limb of the flood hydrographs was found to inflict the highest stress on the estuarine environment due to elevated toxicity combined with prolonged residence time of the water. Examination of the potential chronic toxicity of single compounds showed continuous stress for plants, algae, amphibians, crustaceans, insects and fish from nine pesticides. Our data show that the ecosystem of the Alexander micro-estuary is under a continuous chronic stress with acute peaks in potential toxicity during flood events and the period that follows them. We propose that analyzing a small set of flood-tail samples is needed for the evaluation of small estuarine ecosystems risk during the rainy season. From a management perspective, we suggest better control of application practices for Diuron in the watershed to minimize the stress to the estuarine ecosystem. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114941,Pesticides,32806444,NA,environmental risk dynamics of pesticides toxicity in a mediterranean microestuary

We studied the acute toxicity and the sublethal effect on the voracity of the generalist predator Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) caused by the exposure to three systemic insecticides routinely used against aphids. The tested insecticide concentrations were the Lethal Concentration 50% (LC50), 20% (LC20) and 1% (LC1) estimated for the target pest Aphis gossypii (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in a companion study. The survival and the voracity differed among the tested chemicals and concentrations, but only thiamethoxam at LC50 caused a significant predator mortality, and individuals that survived showed a reduced predation rate. The predators showed a density independent functional response after the exposure to most of the insecticide-concentration combinations, while an inverse density dependence of the prey consumption rate was observed for coccinellids exposed to sulfoxaflor and thiamethoxam at their lowest tested concentration.

Wildlife are useful bioindicators, but traditional comparative experimental approaches rely on a staunch and typically unverifiable assumption that, in the absence of contaminants, reference and contaminated sites would support the same densities of bioindicators, thereby inferring direct causation from indirect data. We demonstrate the utility of spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models for overcoming these issues, testing if community density of common small mammal bioindicators was directly influenced by soil chemical concentrations. By modeling density as an inhomogeneous Poisson point process, we found evidence for an inverse spatial relationship between Peromyscus density and soil mercury concentrations, but not other chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, at a site formerly occupied by a nuclear reactor. Although the coefficient point estimate supported Peromyscus density being lower where mercury concentrations were higher (β = -0.44), the 95% confidence interval overlapped zero, suggesting no effect was also compatible with our data. Estimated density from the most parsimonious model (2.88 mice/ha; 95% CI = 1.63-5.08), which did not support a density-chemical relationship, was within the range of reported densities for Peromyscus that did not inhabit contaminated sites elsewhere. Environmental pollution remains a global threat to biodiversity and ecosystem and human health, and our study provides an illustrative example of the utility of SCR models for investigating the effects that chemicals may have on wildlife bioindicator populations and communities.

One potential hazardous consequence of this interaction could be the increase of chromosomal damage and induction of cell death, which culminate in tadpole mortality. In this study, the preservation level of the riparian forest of four different streams located at the Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil was evaluated through satellite imagery analysis. The incidence of solar UVB and UVA radiation were measured with a radiometer in the amphibian breeding sites, and the presence of agrochemicals in the water was quantified through liquid chromatography coupled in tandem to mass spectrometry. Tadpole population density of two endangered forest-specialist amphibian species (Boana curupi and Crossodactylus schmidti) was evaluated in each stream, and the chromosomal damage of the collected larvae was determined through cytogenetic analysis of blood samples. The results clearly indicate that the preservation of riparian forest efficiently blocks the incidence of UV radiation upon the water surface and reduce by 2.7-fold the entry of agrochemicals from adjacent agricultural crops. Tadpoles collected in streams with preserved and continuous riparian forest presented a significantly lower amount of micronuclei, as well as higher population density in comparison to tadpoles collected in streams located in converted agricultural landscape.

Recent developments in bioanalytics, however, have facilitated the study of fluctuations in the metabolism of biological systems in response to treatments with bioactives and the discovery of corresponding toxicity biomarkers. Neonicotinoids are improved insecticides that target nicotinic acetylocholine receptors (nAChR) in insects which are similar to mammals. Nonetheless, they have sparked controversy due to effects on non-target organisms. Within this context, mammalian cell cultures represent ideal systems for the development of robust models for the dissection of PPPs' toxicity. Thus, we have investigated the toxicity of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and their mixture on primary mouse (Mus musculus) neural stem/progenitor (NSPCs) and mouse neuroblastoma-derived Neuro-2a (N2a) cells, and the undergoing metabolic changes applying metabolomics. Results revealed that NSPCs, which in vitro resemble those that reside in the postnatal and adult central nervous system, are five to seven-fold more sensitive than N2a to the applied insecticides. The energy equilibrium of NSPCs was substantially altered, as it is indicated by fluctuations of metabolites involved in energy production (e.g. glucose, lactate), Krebs cycle intermediates, and fatty acids, which are important components of cell membranes. Such evidence plausibly suggests a switch of cells' energy-producing mechanism to the direct metabolism of glucose to lactate in response to insecticides. The developed pipeline could be further exploited in the discovery of unintended effects of PPPs at early steps of development and for regulatory purposes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.104617,,32711778,NA,mining the effect of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin on the chemical homeostasis and energy equilibrium of primary mouse neural stemprogenitor cells using metabolomics

It was shown recently that several Lysobacter type strains produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which controlled the growth of Phytophthora infestans in vitro when the bacteria were grown on a protein rich medium. In the present study, Lysobacter capsici AZ78 (AZ78) has been tested for its potential to produce VOCs that may contribute to the bioactivity against soilborne plant pathogens. To this end, split Petri dish assays of bacterial cultures have been combined with GC-MS measurements with the aim to reveal the identity of the VOCs which inhibit the growth of Pythium ultimum Rhizoctonia solani, and Sclerotinia minor. While AZ78 completely suppressed the growth of P. ultimum and S. minor, the growth of R. solani was still reduced significantly. The GC-MS analysis revealed 22 VOCs to be produced by AZ78, the majority of which were (putatively) identified as mono- and dialkylated methoxypyrazines. Based on additional cultivation and GC-MS experiments, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-3-methoxypyrazine and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine were selected as presumable bioactive compounds. Further bioassays employing indirect exposure to standard solutions (1–10 mg per Petri dish) of the synthetic compounds via the gas phase, revealed that each of these pyrazines was able to suppress the growth of the pathogens under investigation.

Contrastingly, we demonstrate a straightforward relationship between poison-induced individual mortality and population changes in the threatened red kite (Milvus milvus). By linking field data of 1,075 poisoned red kites to changes in occupancy and abundance across 274 sites (10 × 10-km squares) over a 20-y time frame, we show a clear relationship between red kite poisoning and the decline of its breeding population in Spain, including local extinctions.

This works provides a perspective on pesticide use in current agriculture with the aim of identifying the influence of pesticides on food production and their impact on the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to highlight the importance of determining pesticide residues in food, aiming to ensure food safety, since these compounds can represent risks to human health and the environment. The effects of pesticides on humans range from headaches, nausea and skin and eye irritation to chronic problems such as cancer and neurological disorders, and extend to other non-target organisms such as birds, fish and bees, contaminating water, soil, and plants, as opposed to the benefits of increased production, consequently other measures for pesticide consumption need to be evaluate to ensure human health, food safety and environmental protection. It is important to note that chromatographic techniques and mass spectrometry assist in the determination of pesticide residues and evaluate the quality of the food that reaches the consumer, and together with the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs), established by the legislation of each country, these instrumentation act to control the exposure of population to pesticides. Although the MRL is used as a parameter for food quality, the global differences in pesticide legislation do not guarantee the consumer safety.

CYPs are active in the metabolism of various reactions of pesticides, and there are potentially different short-lived oxidant species in CYPs (Compound I vs Compound 0), which make elucidating their biotransformation mechanism challenging. To facilitate this task, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the puzzling bifurcation pathways of dieldrin by CYPs. The results show that the two-oxidant mechanism does not work, while the bifurcation pathways are within the mechanistic framework of a two-state reactivity of Compound I. Specifically, 9-hydroxy-dieldrin as a hydroxylation product is formed via H-abstraction and essentially barrierless C-9 alkyl radical rebound in the doublet state; while 3-ketone-dieldrin as a dechlorination product is formed via H-abstraction, C-9 alkyl radical cyclization, and C-3 cyclized radical rebound in the quartet state followed by HCl elimination, originating from a significant barrier for C-9 alkyl radical rebound in the quartet state to provide this radical sufficient lifetime for cyclization. Thus, the ratio [dechlorination]/[hydroxylation] can be estimated as 1:35, consistent with the experimental findings.

Filling these knowledge gaps is particularly important regarding amphibians, because they play significant roles in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, and their populations are declining worldwide.

We exposed two anuran species throughout their larval development to each of two environmentally relevant concentrations of each pollutant, and recorded mortality and 17 sub-lethal endpoints up to several months after exposure. Mortality was low and unrelated to treatment. In agile frogs (Rana dalmatina), we found that treatment with 0.3 μg/L terbuthylazine decreased tadpole activity and reduced fat bodies in juveniles, whereas treatment with 50 μg/L carbamazepine decreased spleen size and increased spleen pigmentation. In common toads (Bufo bufo), treatment with 0.003 μg/L terbuthylazine increased body mass at metamorphosis, treatment with 0.3 μg/L terbuthylazine increased the size of optic tecta, and treatment with 0.5 μg/L carbamazepine decreased hypothalamus size. Treatment with 50 μg/L carbamazepine reduced the feeding activity of toad tadpoles, decreased their production of anti-predatory bufadienolide toxins, and increased their body mass at metamorphosis; juvenile toads in this treatment group had reduced spleen pigmentation. Neither treatments affected the time to metamorphosis, post-metamorphic body mass, or sex ratios significantly. These results show that environmental levels of both terbuthylazine and carbamazepine can have several sub-lethal effects on anurans, which may be detrimental to individual fitness and population persistence in natural conditions.

Yet, some critical relevant mechanisms are controversial and ambiguous, and information about the EI-induced H-abstraction reactions of halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) is completely in the dark. This study provides a systematic investigation of H-abstraction reactions of HOCs taking place in the EI source using 13C6-hexachlorobenzene (13C6-HCB) and 13C6-hexabromobenzene (13C6-HBB) as exemplary compounds by gas chromatography (GC)-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). The H-abstraction efficiencies were evaluated with the MS signal intensity ratios of ions with H-abstraction relative to the corresponding original ions (without H-abstraction). Ion source temperatures, EI energies, and numbers of heavy isotope atoms (37Cl or 81Br) of isotopologues were investigated in terms of their effects on the H-abstraction efficiencies. The H-abstraction efficiencies of individual isotopologues generally decreased from the first to the last isotopologues of respective ions, and those of individual ions were different from each other, with the highest values of 0.017 and 0.444 for 13C6-HCB and 13C6-HBB, respectively. The overall H-abstraction efficiencies involving all measured ions of 13C6-HCB and 13C6-HBB were 0.004 and 0.128, respectively. With increasing ion source temperatures, the H-abstraction efficiencies first increased to a summit and then began to linearly decrease. EI energies and emission currents could impact the H-abstraction efficiencies but showed no certain tendency. The H-abstraction reactions were inferred to belong to ion-molecule reactions, and the siloxanes bleeding from the GC column might be a hydrogen source. Some strategies were proposed for eliminating or alleviating the interference triggered by the H-abstraction reactions in EI-MS in identification of halogenated organic pollutants (HOPs).

Although many species are disadvantaged by these changes, others thrive in these new environments, achieving densities that exceed those in natural habitats. Often the same species that benefit from urbanization are successful invaders in introduced habitats, suggesting that similar processes promote these species in both environments. Both processes may especially benefit certain species by modifying their interactions with harmful parasites (‘enemy release’). To detect such modifications, we first need to identify the mechanisms underlying host–parasite associations in natural populations, then test whether they are disrupted in cities and introduced habitats. We studied the interaction between the cane toad Rhinella marina, a globally invasive species native to South America, and its Amblyomma ticks. Our field study of 642 cane toads across 46 sites within their native range in French Guiana revealed that 56% of toads carried ticks, and that toads with ticks were in poor body condition relative to uninfected conspecifics. Across natural and disturbed habitats tick prevalence and abundance increased with toad density, but this association was disrupted in the urban environment, where tick abundance remained low even where toad densities were high, and prevalence decreased with density. Reductions in the abundance of ticks in urban habitats may be attributable to pesticides (which are sprayed for mosquito control but are also lethal to ticks), and our literature review shows that tick abundance is generally lower in cane toads from urban habitats across South America. In the invasive range, ticks were either absent (in 1,960 toads from Puerto Rico, Hawai'i, Japan and Australia) or less abundant (in Florida and the Caribbean; literature review). The positive relationship between host density and parasite abundance is thought to be a key mechanism through which parasites regulate host populations; anthropogenic processes that disrupt this relationship may allow populations in urban and introduced habitats to persist at densities that would otherwise lead to severe impacts from parasites. © 2020 British Ecological Society",,10.1111/1365-2656.13175,,31945186,NA,urbanization and translocation disrupt the relationship between host density and parasite abundance

Hotspots of pesticide use were generally located in agricultural valleys, as anticipated, yet were surprisingly ephemeral. Between 0–5 % of species richness hotspots intersected annual pesticide use hotspots depending on the focal taxa. The level of overlap also varied over the growing season, peaking for most taxa in May through July.

We developed a system to classify pesticide risks and hazards with respect to human and environmental health and produce a minimum (lower risk) pesticide list. Methods: We classified 659 pesticides by acute and chronic risks to human health (eg, respiratory and carcinogenic effects) and by environmental risks, including biomagnification and atmospheric ozone depletion and risks to aquatic life, terrestrial wildlife, and pollinators. From this analysis, we produced a guideline for selection of lower risk pesticides. The classification of highly hazardous and high-risk compounds has been tested in more than a million farm households in the tropics, and in US integrated pest management (IPM) programmes. The full classification, including the minimum pesticide list, has been used in management of the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) throughout Africa and Asia. Findings: Our analysis developed a stand-alone guideline for selection of lower risk pesticides. When classifying pesticides in current use against the fall armyworm in Africa, our guideline identified chemicals that are effective and of lower risk to human and environmental health. We argue that a minimum (lower risk) pesticides list, which meets IPM needs, could be developed from our classification system. Interpretation: As far as we are aware, our analysis is the first to propose a method for implementing the idea of a minimum pesticide list and the first to outline lower risk candidate compounds. Currently accepted criteria for defining highly hazardous pesticides do not adequately protect human bystanders, aquatic life, terrestrial wildlife, and pollinators.

Here, water-dispersible difunctional NPs were developed using flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) where self-assembling amphiphilic block copolymers were used to encapsulate a highly hydrophobic model pesticide, Lambda-cyhalothrin, and the fluorescent dye Nile red. The particle size (ranging from 158 to 280 nm) and fluorescence property of NPs could be controlled by varying the flow rate or Nile red feed concentration. The aggregation state and rearrangement of the dye molecules in the NPs were also investigated.

However, these two population contexts have mostly been considered separately. Moreover, because the sensitivity of the different pathways of energy to stress may differ, it is difficult to predict combined stressor effects. We used an agent-based model of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to infer the population-level impacts of a hypothetical, sublethal stressor that affects an individual's metabolism (growth, reproduction, maintenance, or assimilation) in systems in which population size is controlled by different combinations of food availability and predation. We found that population-level effects are rarely directly proportional to individual-level effects, and were greater when the stressor impacted assimilation and populations were predation-controlled. Our results suggest that individual-level measurements alone are insufficient for inferring population-level impacts of stressors and that accurate inference hinges on insight into how populations are regulated. We suggest incorporating individual-level data into mechanistic models that take into account both the energy budgets of individuals and the population-level context. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108903,"Stress, Physiological;Prednisolone",NA,NA,population context matters predicting the effects of metabolic stress mediated by food availability and predation with an agent and energy budgetbased model

In this work, a comprehensive review is presented on the occurrence of CECs in wastewater, sludge, surface water, sediment, groundwater and drinking water of Africa. Further attention is given to the performance of wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) and trickling filters (TF) with respect to CECs removal. For the first time, we also look at the state of knowledge on the performance of point-of-use technologies (POUs) regarding the removal of CECs in drinking water. Generally, CECs in Africa occur at the same order of magnitude as in the Western world. However, for particular groups of compounds and at specific locations such as informal settlements, clearly higher concentrations are reported in Africa. Whereas antiretroviral and antimalarial drugs are rarely detected in the Western world, occurrence patterns in Africa reveal concentrations up to &gt;100 μg L−1. Removal efficiencies of WSPs and TFs focus mainly on PPCPs and vary significantly, ranging from no removal (e.g. carbamazepine) to better than 99.9% (e.g. paracetamol).

Organic food is free from residues of pesticides and tends to contain significantly more valuable nutritional compounds than the conventional counterpart. It is not more contaminated by mycotoxins than conventional food, and it does not present a higher level of heavy metals. Concerning livestock, animals are kept at lower density, and the use of antibiotics is strictly regulated (reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance), and the use of growth hormone is forbidden.

Smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries have generally a low socio-economic status and educational level. Consequently, they are particularly vulnerable to negative impacts of pesticides on their health, yields, or land. In a Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices study, we compared the pest management practices between a market-oriented farming system in Zarcero County, Costa Rica, and a subsistence-based farming system in Wakiso District, Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among smallholder farmers from Costa Rica (n = 300) in 2016 and from Uganda (n = 302) in 2017. We enrolled conventional and organic farmers, but also farmers with mixed practices and non-applicators of any pest management strategy. We found that the majority of pesticides used in both case studies are classified as highly hazardous by the World Health Organization. While more than 90% of smallholder farmers from both countries were aware of the negative health effects of pesticide exposure, <11% in Costa Rica and <2% in Uganda reported using personal protective equipment every time they handled or applied pesticides. Hygiene and other safe use practices were not adopted by all farmers (<61%), especially among farmers applying more hazardous pesticides. Conventional farmers from Costa Rica (14%) and Uganda (19%) reported disposing pesticide residuals into rivers. Using a logistic regression we found that organic farmers were more likely to having been trained on safe pesticide use practices. Using a robust regression, we observed that smallholder household income was primarily driven by education and not directly by the use of synthetic pesticides.

The fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea Drury (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is a widespread invasive species. It is native to North America, ranging from southern Canada to northern Mexico. During and after the 1940s, this pest was accidentally introduced in many parts of Europe and Asia. It has now spread to more than 30 countries. The larvae feed on leaves of a wide range of tree species, including ones used as street trees in cities, causing an increase in urban management cost. Although several pest management methods have been employed, pest damage continues especially in newly invaded areas. In this study, we examined the effect and cost-effectiveness of the komo-trap, traditionally used in Japan to reduce the population of larvae of the pine moth Dendrolimus spectabilis Butler (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae). This trap, which is safe for people and ecosystems, has not yet been applied to trap the fall webworm. Methods. In two seasons of 2017, we set komo-traps on street trees in Hakodate City, Japan. We counted the numbers of captured fall webworms compared with controls. We also monitored other species to evaluate any nontarget effects of the trap. Results. One komo, the material cost of which is about 1.10 USD, captured 43.8 fall webworms on average in summer and 27.2 in the fall. The values were significantly larger than those of the controls, which were 0.07 in summer and 0.14 in winter. Bycatch of other species was minimal in summer, whereas in the fall one komo, on average, caught 10.7 woodlice Porcellio sp. or spp. (Isopoda: Porcellionidae). Discussion. The komo-trap is effective in capturing fall webworm. The cost performance of the trap is very favorable, and the nontarget effects can be reduced by using the trap in summer only. The komo-trap would complement other control methods such as tree pruning. Because its cost is low, we recommend that the komo-trap be introduced as a larger-scale trial.

They provide a low cost and efficacious approach to pest control, where they may be employed both reactively and pre-emptively. It is likely insecticides will continue to play a role in meeting the challenge of feeding a growing global population. The widespread use of insecticides creates potential for negative impacts on non-target invertebrate populations. Many countries have regulatory processes in place to manage these. However, there regulatory processes have potential limitations when it comes to detecting the long-term and large-scale consequences of insecticide use. For example, long-term sub-lethal effects resulting from low dose exposure durations are rarely considered in toxicity tests, while predictable additive effects of mixtures of active ingredient are often ignored. In order to address this data gap, there is substantial scope for using existing spatially and temporally explicit biological records of species occurrence. This could help in monitoring and assessment to support our responsibilities to maintain biodiversity while continuing to grow enough food to feed the human population. How this is achieved poses several problems, both practical and analytical. Here, we describe how national-scale data on the spatial and temporal distribution of native invertebrates can be combined with maps of large-scale insecticide application and exposure risk to explore the actual consequences for non-target native biodiversity. Understanding these impacts on native invertebrates will provide a vital evidence base to inform policy decisions that could complement existing regulatory processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/bs.aecr.2020.07.001,Insecticides,NA,NA,detecting landscape scale consequences of insecticide use on invertebrate communities

The overuse of chemical pesticides in the control of such pests caused several side-effects including environmental contaminations, human health problems, and insect pests' resistance. In this circumstance, researchers have focused on safe and effective alternatives to chemical pesticides. In the present study, the insecticidal efficiency of essential oil extracted from the summer savory (Satureja hortensis L.) was assessed on the R. dominica and T. castaneum adults. The chemical profile of essential oil was evaluated through a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer, in which estragole, β-ocimene and d-limonene were the main components. The essential oil had considerable fumigant toxicity on insect pests. The mortality of insects was dependent on the essential oil concentration and exposure time. Probit analysis indicated that R. dominica with low LC50values (Lethal Concentration to kill 50 % of tested insects) was more susceptible than T. castaneum. Accordingly, S. hortensis essential oil with a high level of phenylpropanoid and terpenic compounds can be recommended as an efficient and natural alternative to the detrimental chemicals in the management of R. dominica and T. castaneum. © 2020 University of Ljubljana.

Compared with their ability to become resistant to insecticides, insect pests do not easily become resistant to the infection by entomopathogenic fungi. In this study, we evaluated the mortality and immune response of the serious crop pest Locusta migratoria manilensis after exposure to a new entomopathogenic fungus strain, Metarhizium anisopliae CQMa421. M. anisopliae CQMa421 could effectively infect and kill the L. migratoria adults and nymphs. The locust LT50 under 1 × 108 conidia/mL concentration of M. anisopliae was much lower than that under conidial concentration 1 × 105 conidia/mL (i.e., 6.0 vs 11.2 and 5.0 vs 13.8 for adults and nymphs, respectively). The LC50 (log10) of M. anisopliae against locust adults and nymphs after 10 days was 5.2 and 5.6, respectively. Although the number of hemocytes in L. migratoria after exposure to M. anisopliae did not differ with that in the controls, the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and prophenoloxidase (ProPO) did differ between the two treatments. The activities of both SOD and ProPO under the M. anisopliae treatment were lower than that in the controls, except for the ProPO activity at 72 h and the SOD activity at 96 h. Further, the expression of the L. migratoria immune‐related genes defensin, spaetzle, and attacin differed after exposure to M. anisopliae for 24 h to 96 h. Taken together, this study indicated that infection with M. anisopliae CQMa421 could cause the death of L. migratoria by interacting with the immune responses of the host, demonstrating that this fungal strain of M. anisopliae can be an efficient biocontrol agent against L. migratoria. © 2019 by the authors.

People fight against current outbreaks by using chemical pesticides or an insect fungus known as Green Muscle™. While chemical pesticides may be harmful for humans and non-target species, the sporulation of the fungus takes a long period of time and requires conditions of high humidity that are not always found in the field. In this study, we tested the toxicity of a linseed oil/bicarbonate emulsion against gregarious desert locusts and screened for plant essential oils that enhance its toxicity. Finally, we combined three essential oils to develop a novel formulation that is effective against the desert and migratory locust species after single spray treatment. Within 24 h, this formulation caused a mean mortality rate of 80% and 100% of desert and migratory locusts, respectively. Its toxicity is based on a synergistic effect resulting from the combination of caraway, orange peel and wintergreen oils. In addition, we tested this botanical pesticide on two beetle species regarded either as alternative or beneficial non-target species. The first species, mealworm beetles, did not suffer from the spray treatment and behaved normally after 8 days. In contrast, 67.7% of ladybird adults died in the same time span. Interestingly, the growth of wheat seedlings was almost unaffected by spraying this botanical pesticide.

Concern has been raised that some pesticides may act as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with the potential to interfere with the hormone systems of non-target invertebrates and vertebrates, including humans. EDCs act at low doses and particularly vulnerable periods of exposure include pre- and perinatal development. Of critical concern is the number of pesticides with the potential to interfere with the developing nervous system and brain, notably with thyroid hormone signaling. Across vertebrates, thyroid hormone orchestrates metamorphosis, brain development, and metabolism. Pesticide action on thyroid homeostasis can involve interference with TH production and its control, displacement from distributor proteins and liver metabolism. Here we focused on thyroid endpoints for each of the different classes of pesticides reviewing epidemiological and experimental studies carried out both in in vivo and in vitro. We conclude first, that many pesticides were placed on the market with insufficient testing, other than acute or chronic toxicity, and second, that thyroid-specific endpoints for neurodevelopmental effects and mixture assessment are largely absent from regulatory directives. © Copyright © 2019 Leemans, Couderq, Demeneix and Fini.",,10.3389/fendo.2019.00743,Pesticides;Thyroid Gland;Thyroid Hormones,NA,NA,pesticides with potential thyroid hormonedisrupting effects a review of recent data

It often involves microorganisms or molecules produced by microorganisms that will be able to interact with either a plant or pathogens of this plant to reduce the growth of the pathogen and limit its negative impact on the host plant. When new biocontrol products are developed, strains were mostly selected based on their ability to inhibit a pathogen of interest under in vitro conditions via antagonistic effects. Strains with no in vitro effect are often discarded and not tested in planta. But is the in vitro selection of bacterial agents according to their antagonism activities towards a plant pathogen the best way to get effective biocontrol products? To answer this question, we used wheat and the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum as a study pathosystem model. A library of 205 soil bacteria was screened in 2 types of in vitro growth inhibition tests against F. graminearum, and in an in planta experiment. We find strains which do not have inhibition phenotypes in vitro but good efficacy in planta. Interestingly, some strains belong to species (Microbacterium, Arthrobacter, Variovorax) that are not known in the literature for their ability to protect plants against fungal pathogens. Thus, developing a biocontrol product against F. graminearum must be preferentially based on the direct screening of strains for their protective activity on wheat plants against fungal diseases, rather than on their in vitro antagonistic effects on fungal growth.

It is a particularly relevant issue in semi-arid regions due to the sensitivity of endemic species to pollutants and to interactions with temperature stress. This paper investigates the presence of pesticides in rivers within a semi-arid agricultural watershed of Chile, testing for their effects on population genetic characteristics of the endemic mayfly Andesiops torrens (Insecta, Ephemeroptera). Pesticides were detected in sediment samples in ten out of the 30 sites analyzed throughout the upper part of the Limarí watershed. To study the evolutionary impact of such contamination on A. torrens, we used a genome-wide approach and analyzed 2056 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) loci in 551 individuals from all sites. Genetic differentiation was weak between populations, suggesting high gene flow across the study area. While we did not find evidence of pesticide effects on genetic diversity nor on population differentiation, the allele frequency of three outlier SNP loci correlated significantly with pesticide occurrence. Interrogation of genomic resources indicates that two of these SNPs are located within functional genes that encode for the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 and Dumpy, both potentially involved in insect cuticle resistance processes. Such genomic signatures of local adaptation are indicative of past adverse effects of pesticide exposure on the locally adapted populations. Our results reveal that A. torrens is sensitive to pesticide exposure, but that a high gene flow may confer resilience to contamination.

We have performed an integrated chemical and bioanalytical profiling of surface water samples from Swedish agricultural areas, aiming to assess toxic activity due to presence of pesticides. A total of 157 water samples were collected from six geographical sites with extensive agricultural activity. The samples were chemically analyzed for 129 commonly used pesticides and transformation products. Furthermore, the toxicity was investigated using in vitro bioassays in the water samples following liquid–liquid extraction. Endpoints included oxidative stress response (Nrf2 activity), estrogen receptor (ER) activity, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activity. The bioassays were performed with a final enrichment factor of 5 for the water samples. All bioassays were conducted at non-cytotoxic conditions. Results: A total of 51 pesticides and transformation products were detected in the water samples. Most of the compounds were herbicides, followed by fungicides, insecticides and transformation products. The highest total pesticide concentration in an individual sample was 39 µg/L, and the highest median total concentration at a sample site was 1.1 µg/L. The largest number of pesticides was 31 in a single sample. We found that 3% of the water samples induced oxidative stress response, 23% of the samples activated the estrogen receptor, and 77% of the samples activated the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Using Spearman correlation coefficients, a statistically significant correlation was observed between AhR and ER activities, and AhR activity was strongly correlated with oxidative stress in samples with a high AhR activity. Statistically significant relationships were observed between bioactivities and individual pesticides, although the relationships are probably not causal, due to the low concentrations of pesticides. Co-occurrence of non-identified chemical pollutants and naturally occurring toxic compounds may be responsible for the induced bioactivities. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that integrated chemical analysis and bioanalysis can be performed in water samples following liquid/liquid extraction with a final enrichment factor of 5. AhR and ER activities were induced in water samples from agricultural areas. The activities were presumably not caused by the occurrence of pesticides, but induced by other anthropogenic and natural chemicals. © 2019, The Author(s).",,10.1186/s12302-019-0241-x,Pesticides,NA,NA,assessment of pesticides in surface water samples from swedish agricultural areas by integrated bioanalysis and chemical analysis

Among pesticides, neonicotinoids are the best-selling class of agricultural insecticides and are suspected to represent significant risks to freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. Despite growing recognition that neonicotinoid impacts may be modified by the presence of additional stressors, there is limited information about their interactions with other agricultural stressors in freshwater ecosystems. We conducted an outdoor pond-mesocosm experiment to investigate the individual and interactive effects of nutrients, fine sediment, and imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide) inputs on freshwater community structure (density, diversity, and composition of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates) and ecosystem functioning (ecosystem metabolism, primary production, and organic matter decomposition). We hypothesized antagonistic nutrient-imidacloprid, and synergistic sediment-imidacloprid interactions, affecting aquatic invertebrate communities. The three stressors had significant individual and interactive effects on pond ecosystems. The insecticide neutralized the positive effects of nutrient additions on benthic invertebrate richness and mitigated the negative effects of sediment on zooplankton communities (antagonistic interactions). Moreover, we observed compensatory responses of tolerant benthic invertebrates, which resulted in reversal interactions between sediment and imidacloprid. Furthermore, our observations suggest that imidacloprid has the potential to increase net ecosystem production at environmentally relevant concentrations. Our findings support the hypothesis that the impacts of imidacloprid may be modified by other agricultural stressors. This has important implications on a global scale, given the widespread use of these pesticides in intensive agricultural landscapes and the growing body of literature suggesting that traditional pesticide assessment frameworks, based on laboratory toxicity tests alone, may be insufficient to adequately predict effects to complex freshwater ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.301,Food;Insecticides,31539961,NA,nutrients and sediment modify the impacts of a neonicotinoid insecticide on freshwater community structure and ecosystem functioning

Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) have been advocated as an environmental sentinel for contaminants due to their longevity, site fidelity and prey species that often overlap with human consumption. Using archived (1992–2010) samples of livers from Northern sea otters (n = 50) from Alaska we examine concentrations of chlordanes (CHLs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and associated metabolites. We found some evidence for declining ΣPCBs over the two decades, however for most animals concentrations were low compared to toxicological thresholds. Six animals had relatively high concentrations of ΣPCBs (mean = 262,000 ng/g lipid weight), ΣDDTs (mean = 8,800 ng/g lw), and ΣPBDEs (mean = 4,600 ng/g lw), with four of these six animals experiencing hepatic parasitism or hepatitis.

In the present study we subjected springtails (Folsomia candida) to combined exposure to phenanthrene and dynamic heat cycles in a full factorial experiment. In a microcosm experiment, we studied the population growth of springtails subjected to a range of sub-lethal concentrations of phenanthrene. During the 28-day experiment we further subjected microcosms to varying numbers of repeated dynamic heat cycles (0–5 cycles) simulating repeated heat waves. We found a synergistic interaction between the effects of phenanthrene and the number of heat waves on both body mass of adults and juvenile production of F. candida showing that the negative effects of phenanthrene were intensified when animals were heat stressed, and/or vice versa. This interaction was not related to internal concentrations of phenanthrene in adult springtails, nor was it due to altered degradation of phenanthrene in soil. We argue that both phenanthrene (by its partitioning into membrane bilayers) and heat have detrimental effects on the physical conditions of cellular membranes in a dose-dependent manner, which, under extreme circumstances, can increase membrane fluidity to a level which is sub-optimal for normal membrane functioning.

An alternative control strategy for insect pests in storage houses is the use of botanicals. In this study, four plant essential oils, two plant extracts, two herbicides, and two insecticides were used against Tribolium confusum and the comparison of toxicity was made by calculating LC50 and LT50 values. LC50 values were higher for abamectin (2.09–10.23 mg/L) and cypermethrin (3.41–11.78 mg/L) insecticides followed by neem essential oil (7.39–19.24 mg/L) and citrus extract (10.14–24.50 mg/L).

Methods: We measured the response of plants traits and soil properties to the factorial combination of three rates of organic-approved P sources applied in rotation phase-1 of legume–flax cropping systems, and of granular AMF inoculant applied in the first, second, or both rotation phases, or not applied. Treatment combinations effects on the rhizosphere communities of AMF, fungi, and bacteria were tested by amplicon sequencing, in two pedoclimates. Results: Inoculation had limited effects in both environments. Composted manure decreased lentil yield, but increased lentil N and P concentrations and soil P fertility on the Chernozem, while increasing pea productivity on the Luvisol. Composted manure applied in rotation phase-1 had a residual effect on flax productivity, N and P concentrations, and soil P fertility in both environments.

Despite growing support for efforts to strengthen local food systems, surprisingly little is known about the relationship of local food to environmental sustainability. In particular, the relationship of local food systems to the use of agricultural chemicals to manage pests, weeds and disease has not been a subject of systematic research. In this paper, I use longitudinal data from the US Census of Agriculture to explore whether growth in local food systems is associated with decreased on-farm use of agricultural chemicals. Drawing on county-level data from 1997 to 2012, I find that an increase in the strength of local food systems-whether measured as the number of farms that market products directly to consumers, or as the total value of direct market products-has been broadly associated with a decrease in spending on agricultural chemicals in the USA as a whole. But the magnitude of the relationship between direct marketing to consumers and changes in agricultural chemical use has dwindled over time, to the point where it is not clear whether contemporary local food systems are still incentivizing farmers to reduce their use of pesticides. Overall, this study lends new credence to the idea that robust local food systems can benefit the environment. But even where just one dimension of agriculture's impact on the environment is concerned, the characteristics of local food systems appear to have varied over time-a qualification that argues strongly for further research into the relationship of local food to agricultural practice. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.",,10.1017/S1742170517000758,,NA,NA,do direct market farms use fewer agricultural chemicals evidence from the us census of agriculture

Meanwhile, the characteristic absorption peak at 400 nm of p-NP increases gradually with the raised concentration of pesticide. Therefore, a dual-mode method including smartphone-based colorimetric and spectroscopic strategies was rationally developed. Herein, methyl-paraoxon was selected as the representative compound. Under the optimum conditions, the detection limits of both two strategies were calculated to be 0.42 μmol L −1 .

We reported a summary of that meeting (reviewing several topics related to olive oil, not limited to health) and concluded that substantial evidence is accruing to support the widespread opinion that extra virgin olive oil should, indeed, be the fat of choice when it comes to human health and sustainable agronomy. © 2019 by the authors.

Urban remnant vegetation can help mitigate these impacts and could be vital for species unable to survive in harsh urban environments. Although resembling nonurban habitats, urban vegetation remnants are subject to additional environmental stresses. Here, we evaluate the occurrence and density of the endemic ghost butterfly (Morpho epistrophus nikolajewna) that was once common, in the highly fragmented Atlantic forest of NE Brazil. We tested whether this butterfly would be found at lower densities in urban forest fragments of contrasting sizes as opposed to rural ones, given the number of environmental stressors found in urban areas. We surveyed 14 forest fragments (range 2.8 to over 3,000 ha) of semideciduous Atlantic forest in rural and urban locations using transect based distance sampling. The ghost butterflies showed strong seasonality; flying only from April to June. They were only identified in an urban fragment (515 ha), with an estimate of 720 individuals and a density 1.4 ind/ha. All forest fragments had experienced some level of logging in the past, which might have had an effect in the butterfly population. Nevertheless, rural forest fragments were subject to increased particulate matter concentrations, associated to biomass burning that we suggest might have had a more influential role driving the collapse of rural populations. Our findings show the importance of urban forest remnants to sustain population of this endangered species. © 2019 The Authors.

Standardized ecotoxicity tests, environmental fate studies, and exposure models are used at lower tiers and follow well-defined methods for assessing risk. If a lower tier assessment indicates that the pesticide may pose an ecological risk, higher tier studies using more environmentally realistic conditions or assumptions can be performed to refine the risk assessment and inform risk management options. However, there is limited guidance in the United States on options to refine an assessment and how the data will be incorporated into the risk assessment and risk management processes. To overcome challenges to incorporation of higher tier data into ecological risk assessments and risk management of pesticides, a workshop was held in Raleigh, North Carolina. Attendees included representatives from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, United States Department of Agriculture, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, universities, commodity groups, consultants, nonprofit organizations, and the crop protection industry. Key recommendations emphasized the need for 1) more effective, timely, open communication among registrants, risk assessors, and risk managers earlier in the registration process to identify specific protection goals, address areas of potential concern where higher tier studies or assessments may be required, and if a higher tier study is necessary that there is agreement on study design; 2) minimizing the complexity of study designs while retaining high value to the risk assessment and risk management process; 3) greater transparency regarding critical factors utilized in risk management decisions with clearly defined protection goals that are operational; and 4) retrospective analyses of success–failure learnings on the acceptability of higher tier studies to help inform registrants on how to improve the application of such studies to risk assessments and the risk management process.

Essential oils produced from botanical extracts used in management programs should be effective against pests and selective to natural enemies. Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is one of the most destructive pests of solanaceous crops in the world, and a possible management strategy consists of releases of the predator Nesidiocoris tenuis (Hemiptera: Miridae), along with botanical applications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Prev-am® oil on T. absoluta offspring, either with or without the predator N. tenuis, as well as the oil’s effects on N. tenuis predatory behavior and longevity. The oil’s effects were compared with distilled water (control) and a synthetic pesticide (lambda-cyhalothrin). The response of populations to lambda-cyhalothrin was similar to that with Prev-am®, compared to the control, showing that N. tenuis had higher capacity to reduce T. absoluta populations. The survival analysis of predators exposed to Prev-am® indicates that none of the concentrations differed significantly from the control. In addition, the canonical variate analysis indicated significant overall differences in the predator behavior submitted to different treatments, suggesting that synthetic pesticide treatment affected predator behavior when compared to control and Prev-am®.

The exposure to low insecticide doses is often associated with a fitness decline in affected organisms. We determined the effects of exposure to the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin, at a concentration 20 times lower than the LC50, on the cuticle surface profile containing mating cues, the mating and aggression behaviour and fitness consequences for a beetle species (Phaedon cochleariae Fabricius), which faces agropollutants when occurring close to farmland. Traits were investigated in the insecticide-exposed parental generation, and carry-over effects into their unexposed offspring were studied. In both the parental and the offspring generation, the chemical surface profile was unaffected by the insecticide exposure. Nevertheless, insecticide exposure and carry-over effects decreased male mating acceptance of females in no-choice situations. A reduced acceptance of insecticide-exposed females may be related to changes in specific chemical surface cues, because males attempted to mate more readily with dummies treated with surface extracts of control females than of insecticide-exposed females. Moreover, females became more aggressive in dual-choice situations towards other females in the presence of an insecticide-exposed compared to an unexposed male, potentially due to neuronal dysfunctions. Thus, both intersexual (chemical) communication during mating and intrasexual communication were altered in response to insecticide exposure. Insecticide-exposed parents and their offspring suffered from a decreased reproductive output, likely due to direct toxic effects or constraints induced by detoxification processes. The carry-over effects might be mediated by a parental insecticide transfer or insecticide-induced heritable epigenetic changes involved in detoxification processes. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that sublethal insecticide exposure can have far-reaching consequences on (non-target) herbivores. These results have implications for population dynamics and, ultimately, for ecological communities, as insects are highly important members of food chains.

These pesticides are toxic to non-target arthropods and their repeated use increases the risk of resistance. We studied mechanisms involved in tolerance and resistance to OP insecticides in the earwig Forficula auricularia, an effective generalist predator in pomefruit orchards. Adult earwigs were sampled in three apple orchards managed under contrasting strategies: conventional, Integrated Pest Management, and organic. The threshold activities of enzyme families involved in pesticides tolerance: Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and Carboxylesterases (CbEs) were measured in earwig extracts. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was monitored as a toxicological endpoint. Variations in these activities were assessed prior to and after exposure to chlorpyrifos-ethyl at the normal application rate. We observed that the mortality of earwigs exposed to chlorpyrifos-ethyl depended on the management strategy of orchards. Significantly lower mortality was seen in individuals sampled from conventional orchard. The basal activities of CbEs and GSTs of collected organisms were higher in conventional orchard. After in vivo exposure, AChE activity appeared to be inhibited in surviving males with no difference between orchards. However an in vitro inhibition trial with chlorpyrifos-oxon showed that AChE from earwigs collected in organic and IPM orchards were more sensitive than from conventional ones. These observations support the hypothesis of a molecular target modification in AChE and highlight the possible role of CbEs in effective protection of AChE.

The extract tested is the hydrolate –product from a semi industrial steam distillation process- of a Spanish pre-domesticated variety of L. luisieri. This hydrolate has been recently shown to have bionematicide activity against the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica. A previous study showed that the main components of the hydrolate are camphor and 2,3,4,4-Tetramethyl-5-methylidenecyclopent-2-en-1-one. Hydrolate caused acute toxicity (LC 50 2.2% v/v) on A. cepa, while only a slight toxicity on E. fetida (LC 50 &gt; 0.4 mL/g). All the concentrations tested (from 1 to 100% v/v) caused a significant decrease in bacterial growth (LC 50 9.8% v/v after 120 h of exposure). The physiological diversity of the community was also significantly altered, except in the case of the lowest concentration of hydrolate (1% v/v). The ability of soil microbial communities to use a variety of carbon sources increased for all substrates at the highest concentrations. These results show that both the plants and bacterial communities of the soil can be affected by the application of biopesticides based on these hydrolates, which highlights the need for a more detailed risk assessment during the development of plant-based products. © 2019",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.293,,30927731,NA,ecotoxicity of a new biopesticide produced by lavandula luisieri on nontarget soil organisms from different trophic levels

Infection not only spreads within the host organism but also spreads between individuals. Here we propose and study a multilevel model which links the within-host statuses of immunity and parasite density to population epidemiology under sublethal and lethal toxicant exposure. We analyse this nested model in order to better understand how toxicants impact the spread of disease within populations. We demonstrate that outbreak of infection within a population is completely determined by the level of toxicant exposure, and that it is maximised by intermediate toxicant dosage. We classify the population epidemiology into five phases of increasing toxicant exposure and calculate the conditions under which disease will spread, showing that there exists a threshold toxicant level under which epidemics will not occur. In general, higher toxicant load results in either extinction of the population or outbreak of infection. The within-host statuses of the individual host also determine the outcome of the epidemic at the population level. We discuss applications of our model in the context of environmental epidemiology, predicting that increased exposure to toxicants could result in greater risk of epidemics within ecological systems. We predict that reducing sublethal toxicant exposure below our predicted safe threshold could contribute to controlling population level disease and infection. © 2018 The Authors",,10.1111/oik.05654,,NA,NA,how do toxicants affect epidemiological dynamics

Emerging insects are prey for predators in the riparian zone, enriching the terrestrial ecosystem with energy and nutrients. Stressors associated with agriculture can alter insect communities in water and on land, resulting in complex response patterns of terrestrial predators relying on prey from both systems. Examining the effects from individual agricultural stressors such as pesticides is hampered in landscapes with intensive agriculture where multiple stressors like habitat degradation and typically co-occur. In rural regions of Eastern Europe, traditional low intensity agriculture based on working animals and human labour prevails alongside intensive, mechanised agriculture. Assuming that low-intensity agriculture relies on no or limited pesticide use, whereas fertilizer use is similar across different agricultural intensities, such regions may allow to study in-stream pesticide effects independent from other stressors, such as nutrient input or habitat degradation. We examined the taxonomic and trait response of riparian spider communities to gradients of agricultural stressors and environmental variables in the region around Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Pesticide sampling was done using passive samplers in the streams adjacent to spider sampling sites. To capture spiders with different traits and survival strategies, we used multiple collection methods. Community composition was best explained by in-stream pesticide toxicity and shading of the stream bank, a proxy for the quality of the habitat. Species richness and the number of spider individuals were negatively associated with in-stream pesticide toxicity. In contrast, mean body size and shading preference of spider communities responded strongest to shading, whereas mean niche width (habitat preference for moisture and shading) responded strongest to the other environmental variables. Our study suggests that in-stream pesticide toxicity can influence riparian communities. The identification of mechanisms requires further studies targeting the potential contributions of direct toxicity and indirect effects from reduced aquatic and terrestrial prey availability. © 2018",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.370,Pesticides,30639710,NA,do agricultural pesticides in streams influence riparian spiders

Small mustelids (SMs; weasels, Mustela nivalis L.; stoats, Mustela erminea L.) consume water voles (WVs, Arvicola scherman S.) and can be exposed to bromadiolone, an anticoagulant rodenticide used in some countries to reduce WV damage to grasslands. Here, we investigated whether bromadiolone affected SM abundance. Results: We monitored SM abundance using footprint tracking tunnels in spring and autumn at ten sites. Among these sites, four were treated with bromadiolone, while six were not treated. We found reduced SM abundance at these four sites from spring to autumn (treated sites, mean ± SE SM abundance change = −1.68 ± 0.42; untreated sites, 0.29 ± 0.25). Using a linear model, we observed that SM abundance decreased as a function of the quantity of bromadiolone applied during the 3 months before the autumn estimate. We found that WV abundance increased at treated sites (linear model, treated sites, mean ± SE WV abundance change = 1.4 ± 0.4; untreated sites, 0.33 ± 0.25). Thus, at treated sites, SM abundance declined despite increased food availability. By analyzing residues in vole livers and SM scats we showed that SMs may be exposed to bromadiolone at the sites where this compound was used. Conclusion: This study is the first to document the relationship between SM abundance and bromadiolone usage for small mammal control.

Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are among the most studied contaminants due to their persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity potential. Biomagnification is often described using the estimation of a Trophic Magnification Factor (TMF). This estimate is based on the relationship between contamination levels of the species and their trophic level. However, while the estimation can be significantly biased in relation to multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g. species physiology, measurement errors, food web complexity), usual TMF estimation methods typically do not allow accounting for these potential biases. More accurate and reliable assessment tool of TMFs and their associated uncertainty are therefore needed in order to appropriately guide chemical pollution management. The present work proposes a relevant and innovative TMF estimation method accounting for its many variability sources. The ESCROC model (EStimating Contaminants tRansfers Over Complex food webs), which is implemented in a Bayesian framework, allows for a more reliable and rigorous assessment of contaminants trophic magnification, in addition to accurate estimations of isotopes trophic enrichment factors and their associated uncertainties in food webs. Similar to classical mixing models used in food web investigations, ECSROC computes diet composition matrices using isotopic composition data while accounting for contamination data, leading to more robust food web descriptions. As a demonstration of the practical application of the model, ESCROC was implemented to revisit the trophic biomagnification of 5 polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in a complex estuarine food web (the Gironde, SW France). In addition to the TMF estimate and 95% confidence intervals, the model provided biomagnification probabilities associated to the investigated contaminants—for instance, 92% in the case of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)—that can be interpreted in terms of risk assessment in a precautionary approach, which should prove useful to environmental managers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.058,Bayes Theorem;Food,30580218,NA,estimating contaminants transfers over complex food webs escroc an innovative bayesian method for estimating pops biomagnification in aquatic food webs

Yet, few studies in estuarine systems have evaluated the effects of a single, low-dose exposure to pesticides on key predators. Here, we investigated the effects of a common pyrethroid (resmethrin) + synergist (piperonyl butoxide; PBO) mixture used for mosquito abatement on two life stages (adult and juvenile) of an important invertebrate estuarine predator, prey, and fishery species: the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). The effects of resmethrin with PBO (Res–PBO) were assessed using behavioral and mesocosm experiments to link effects on individuals with changes in predator–prey interactions: (1) In static non-renewal exposures, crabs exposed to 1:3, 10:30, or 100:300 µg l−1 Res–PBO or PBO-alone had increased mortality and reduced locomotor ability within 1–12 h, with higher effects in adults than juveniles. (2) In mesocosms, sublethal exposure to 1:3 µg l−1 Res–PBO altered abult and juvnile foraging ability by lowering the ability of adult crabs to cannibalize juvenile crabs but increasing juvenile crab foraging rates. Juvenile crabs were also more vulnerable to predation following pesticide exposure. Thus, a single, sublethal exposure to low, environmentally occurring pesticide concentrations reduced blue crab survivorship and locomotor functioning, and altered predator–prey interactions by changing foraging rates and increasing vulnerability to predators. Pesticide stressors may therefore play an important but underestimated role in shaping coastal ecosystems in which invertebrate predators are important and may contribute to U.S. blue crab population declines. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s00442-019-04361-9,Pesticides;Prednisolone,30830264,NA,dazed confused and then hungry pesticides alter predatorprey interactions of estuarine organisms

Moreover, the regulatory effect of this predator on population dynamics of D. porcellus, and hence on yam chips losses, were evaluated under both laboratory and natural conditions. Female A. biannulipes laid on average 42.1 ± 6.8 eggs, which hatched some 4.3 ± 0.3 d after laying, with a hatching rate of 86%. A total of five nymphal stages were recorded with a total nymphal period of 28.2 ± 0.1 d, and a total developmental period of 32.4 ± 2.3 d. Female A. biannulipes lived longer (29.3 ± 1.3 d) than did the males (25.8 ± 4.1 d). Periods of pre-oviposition, oviposition, and post-oviposition were 12.8 ± 1.7, 10.5 ± 1.0 and 5.3 ± 0.5 d, respectively. Life‐table analysis revealed an intrinsic rate of increase 0.29 females/day and a gross reproductive rate of 28.38 females/female. The predator A. biannulipes exhibited a ‘pin and jab’ mode of predation, and its mating behaviour consisted in sequential actions (excitation and approach, riding over, copulation and post-copulation). Under laboratory conditions, A. biannulipes significantly reduced the numbers of D. porcellus and the weight loss of yam chips after 8 weeks at the initial density of 10 predator for 20 preys. Similar trends were observed under farmer storage conditions; there was a significant reduction in the D. porcellus population and in weight loss of yam chips as compared to the control treatment after 8 and 12 weeks for all tested density prey/predator.

Bees are highly sensitive to environmental change, and while their diversity declines in simplified habitats distant from undisturbed areas, bees respond to agricultural practices and habitat configuration at different scales. Mountainous tropical agroecosystems are highly heterogeneous at local and landscape scales, and the responses of bee communities to environmental change in these regions are still underexplored. We examined the local and landscape habitat factors influencing bee abundance and diversity, and changes in bee generic and tribe composition in Anolaima, Colombia. We surveyed bees, measured local habitat features such as flower abundance, tree diversity, ground cover and vegetation structure, and evaluated land cover types and landscape characteristics in seventeen farms. We found that elevation, vertical structure of the vegetation and landscape structure influenced bee community structure. While local factors predicted the response of most individual bee groups, landscape factors influenced the abundance of Apis and Trigona, two genera with disproportionately high abundances across study sites. We also found that human constructions serve as refuges for several bee genera. Our paper suggests a process of biotic homogenization with the loss of bee diversity and concurrent spread of Apis and Trigona in landscapes dominated by pastures, unshaded crops or eroded soils. We also highlight the high sensitivity of native bees to habitat configuration and disturbance, and the importance of traditional farming systems for the conservation of bee communities in mountainous tropical agroecosystems. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,10.1007/s10841-018-00122-w,Colombia,NA,NA,local and landscape habitat influences on bee diversity in agricultural landscapes in anolaima colombia

In the present study by subjecting the zebrafish model to an environmentally realistic concentration of TBZ, we clearly demonstrate that this fungicide has the potential to induce severe morphological and ultrastructural alterations in gills. The main morphological effects recorded in this study were as follows: The proliferation of the main epithelium, ectopia of chloride cells, lamellar shortening, necrosis, and apoptosis.

Most studies of ground-active arthropods in fields rely on activity-density measurement using pitfall traps. Assemblages locally observed are likely to composed both resident and immigrant species, and that is especially true for arthropods exhibiting high dispersal abilities and/or larval development that is very different from the adults. Using a spatially paired design of emerging traps vs pitfall traps in 10 pairs of organic (OF) and conventional (CF) fields, we quantified how circulating and emerging assemblages of an abundant taxa of mobile and holometabolous insects, carabid beetles, were impacted by different field farming systems and landscape characteristics. Field sampling was carried out during 5 months of 2015 in Brittany (Western France), during which 24,726 individuals belonging to 85 species were captured. Our results revealed that the number of individuals and species of both emerging and circulating assemblages were significantly higher in OF compared to CF, reinforcing the idea that OF provide more suitable conditions for both resident and mobile arthropods. Landscape and local factors had a similar influence on emerging carabid assemblages, whereas local factors were stronger drivers for circulating carabid assemblages. This study highlights the importance of distinguishing resident (emergent) and mobile (circulating) individuals when assessing the differential role of local vs. landscape factors in community assembly.

Since the acceleration of the Industrial Revolution (~1850), humans have become a huge geological force. In 1800, 1 billion people lived in the world, but in 2018 the global human population exceeded 7.6 billion. The beginning of large-scale human impacts during the 1950s was related to the dynamics of global population growth thus far unprecedented in human history. The years 1950-1970 were defined by a quickly expanding chemical industry and the widespread popular belief that so-called progress would result in seemingly endless improvement in the quality of everyday life but that led to destruction and pollution of environment with huge amounts of chemicals (including metals) from industry, agriculture and transport. Anthropogenic metal emission still persists in the world, but its main sources are no longer located in Europe and North America, however, in Asia where half of the global population live. For example, in 2015 aluminium ore mining increased 33 times compared to 1950 and the mining of other economically important metals [iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn)] >6 times. In the case of highly toxic metals such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), this increase was 4.3 higher, respectively, but there was a 50% decrease in mercury (Hg) production.

It describes how this radical change in land cover has led to changes in rainfall patterns that are associated with extended drought periods and analyzes how these critical water shortages jeopardize socio-economic health beyond the immediate region. Further, it explicates how intensified transgenic soy farming and other pesticide-heavy crop production contributes to rising public health crises associated with carcinogen-contaminated water and food sources. Lastly, it identifies emerging trends that suggest how agribusiness corporations and governments may be legally ascribed moral responsibilities for maintaining socio-ecological health of the biome.

In the current study, the pesticidal potential of sesquiterpenes (C15 H24), an important class of plant secondary metabolites primarily composed of three isoprene units, was evaluated by laboratory toxicity, feeding performance bioassays, and host detoxification gene expression patterns. Dose-mortality response bioassays performed against mid-aged eighth-instar red palm weevil larvae revealed dose-dependent mortality. Only three sesquiterpenes, including Farnesol (LD50 = 6559 ppm) and Farnesyl acetate (LD50 = 7867 ppm), are considered to have significant toxicity, with Picrotoxin (LD50 = 317 ppm) being the most toxic. Furthermore, highly toxic sesquiterpene (Picrotoxin) established in the current study tremendously reduced the feeding performance indices, including the efficacy of conversion of digested food (ECD) (81.74%) and the efficacy of conversion of ingested food (ECI) (73.62%). The least toxic sesquiterpenes, including β-Caryophyllene, (+)-Cedrol, Nerolidol, (+)-Nootkatone, and Parthenolide, observed in the current study failed to impart significant reductions of ECI and ECD indices.

Evaluating the benefits of promoting natural habitats in economic terms should make different management alternatives easier to compare. However, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying the connection between natural habitat and natural pest control. In this study, we link measurements of natural habitat and ground cover with abundances of multiple natural enemy groups and biological control of the olive pest Prays oleae to describe spatial patterns in biocontrol and the economic value associated. Natural habitat increased biocontrol and crop yields by an average of 186.36 €/ha. This could be attributable to the entire community of predatory natural enemies present in the olive regardless of natural habitat. One predator species of this community, Anthocoris nemoralis, whose abundance was influenced by natural habitat, was strongly associated with elevated biocontrol. We hypothesize that this predator species could be the link between natural habitat and the biological control. Our results suggest that olive growers could stand to gain from conserving natural habitat. Moreover, our evidence suggests that minimizing the use of chopped pruning remains may result in increased biocontrol by bolstering the abundance of A. nemoralis.

The increased use of bioinoculants, which consist of microorganisms that establish synergies with target crops and influence production and yield by enhancing plant growth, controlling disease, and providing critical mineral nutrients, is a potential solution. The microorganisms found in bioinoculants are often bacteria or fungi that reside within either external or internal plant microbiomes. However, before they can be used routinely in agriculture, these microbes must be confirmed as non-pathogenic strains that promote plant growth and survival.

In sugarcane cultivation—the country's most extensive agricultural crop—atrazine-based formulations are the principal form of weed control. Several studies have investigated adverse effects of atrazine or their formulations on anurans, but not specifically on Brazilian species. Our aim was therefore to investigate the lethal and sublethal effects of an atrazine-based herbicide in Rhinella schneideri tadpoles and, in particular, effects on the pigmentation system as a new endpoint in ecotoxicological studies. Rhinella schneideri tadpoles at the Gosner-30 stage were exposed to the atrazine-based herbicide formulation, SIPTRAN 500 SC®, in acute bioassays at concentrations of 1.5–25 mg/L. The lethal and sublethal effects induced were analysed at different ecotoxicological levels: organismal level (alterations in behaviour, growth, development, and body mass; morphologic abnormalities), histological level (liver histopathology), the pigmentation system (melanomacrophages and dermal-melanophores), and cellular level (erythrocyte micronucleus formation and other nuclear-abnormalities). This herbicide induced sublethal effects at the organismal level with alterations in swimming and growth and morphologic abnormalities. These results demonstrated that, in anuran tadpoles, the atrazine-based agrochemical increased the frequency of micronucleus formation and other nuclear-abnormalities in erythrocytes and caused liver damage. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time effects of an atrazine-based formulation on the pigmentation system of anuran tadpoles, specifically an increase in the number of melanomacrophages and dermal melanophores.

In this study, tissue-specific accumulation, biotransformation and elimination of a current-use pesticide fipronil in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were quantified by combining in vivo measurements and a newly developed multi-compartmental toxicokinetic model. Waterborne fipronil was taken up via gills and metabolized rapidly and solely to fipronil sulfone. Significant decrease of fipronil residues in liver and intestine during exposure period strongly suggested the induction of metabolism in these two organs. Significant transport of fipronil and fipronil sulfone in the liver-bile-intestine system implied that hepatobiliary excretion and enterohepatic re-absorption played important roles in fipronil metabolism and system circulation of the parent compound and the metabolite. The multi-compartmental model quantitatively described the highly dynamic inter-compartmental transport and rapid branchial clearance of fipronil in fish. Modeling results also suggested that uptake and biotransformation were the stronger driving forces for the inter-compartmental transport of fipronil in fish than the inherent partitioning capacity.

We addressed this problem by selecting matched organic-conventional pairs of soybean fields such that in each pair the soybean fields were similar in size, hedgerow length, and surrounding landscape composition within 1 km, 2 km and 3 km of the fields. At each of our 16 field pairs (32 sites), we measured relative differences in bat species richness and abundance using acoustic bat recorders, and bat prey availability using black-light traps. We predicted that organic soybean fields would have greater bat species richness, bat abundance and bat prey abundance than conventional soybean fields due to the prohibition of synthetic pesticides and longer more diverse crop rotations in organic fields, both of which should benefit bat insect prey. We found that organic soybean fields had higher bat species richness, bat abundance and bat prey abundance than conventional fields, after controlling for the effect of differences in soybean height between conventional and organic fields.

The median lethal value (96 h LC50) of PFF was estimated as 1.26 mg/L for L. luteola in a semi-static system and on the basis of LC50 value three concentrations viz., 0.126 (1/10 of LC50, Sublethal I), 0.63 (1/2 of LC50, Sublethal II) and 0.84 mg/L (2/3 of LC50, Sublethal III) were determined. Snails were exposed to above-mentioned concentrations of PFF along with solvent control (acetone) and negative control for 96 h. The haemolymph was collected at 24 and 96 h of after treatment. In heamolymph of PFF exposed snail, lipid peroxide, glutathione reduced glutathione S transferase and superoxide dismutase activities at the tested concentrations significantly differ from those in the control. The genotoxicity induced in hemocytes of treated snails was measured by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis assay. The data of this experiment demonstrated significantly enhancement of oxidative stress and DNA damage in the treated snails as compared to controls. Also, we observed statistically significant correlations of ROS with DNA damage (% tail DNA) (R2 = 0.9708) for 24 h and DNA damage (R2 = 0.9665) for 96 h. Results of the current experiment can be useful in risk evaluation of PFF among aquatic organisms.

Especially when organochlorides contain three or more chlorinated carbons, they tend to be more toxic to the human body possibly owing to relatively high reactivity. Several electron donors (TPCAs) are designed to devise a novel detection system for toxic organochlorides containing trichlorinated carbons, and the detection mechanism of the devised sensor system is systematically identified by EPR measurement and the analysis of the solution after the detection of chloroform, which is used as a model compound. Since the detection system simultaneously utilizes the radical-generation capability and the low LUMO level of the trichlorinated carbon, it provides high selectivity against most of the common organic compounds including other organochlorides containing mono- or dichlorinated carbons, and the outstanding selectivity of the designed sensor has been verified with Mirex composed of numerous chlorinated carbons. In addition, the detection system exhibits immediate sensing capability because only electron transfer and radical reaction are involved in the detection process.

Larvae were exposed to concentrations of 0, 1, 5, and 10 ppb atrazine for 3 or 6 wk. Hemocyte counts, hemolymph phenyloxidase (PO) activity, cuticular PO, and gut PO were measured at the end of each trial period as indicators of immune system strength. Atrazine concentration had a significant effect on hemocyte counts after controlling for larval size. There was a significant interaction between time and concentration for hemolymph PO, cuticular PO, and a marginal interaction for gut PO. The effect of atrazine on the measured immune parameters was often nonmonotonic, with larger effects observed at intermediate concentrations. Therefore, atrazine affects both hemocyte numbers and PO activity over time in P. longipennis, and the changed immune function demonstrated in this study is likely to modify susceptibility to pathogens, alter wound healing, and may decrease available energy for growth and metamorphosis. © The Author(s) 2018.

Accelerated degradation studies were performed on freeze-dried ZNPs synthesized with different cationic and non-ionic surfactants. These polymeric particles dispersed in alkaline media (pH = 9) revealed hydrodynamic diameters ranging between 210.6 and 297.3 nm and negative surface charges from −44.3 mV to −34.56 mV. Degradation profiles of the studied particles were assessed within the pH limits of soils under agricultural exploitation (pH 4 and 9). The time-dependent decrease of the parent protein fractions was monitored by capillary gel electrophoresis, where the rate constants of the hydrolytic degradation allows the estimation of ZNPs’ persistence at any temperature of interest. Results showed that in alkaline media promotes a faster chemical degradation of ZNPs (total at 20 °C in ∼3918 days at pH = 4 vs. 205 days at pH = 9), however the nature of the used surfactant may completely reverse the observed trend. Identifying the technological variables that impact their surface chemistry and susceptibility towards hydrolytic degradation, opens new perspectives in the programmed degradation of ZNPs, which may ensure a safer and more sustainable use of these nanodelivery systems.

The total population consists of spatially separated patches, and the mutation occurs in particular patches. We present reaction–diffusion equations which have two terms: reaction and migration terms. The former represents the RPS game with mutation, while the latter corresponds to random walk. The basic equations are solved analytically and numerically. It is found that the mutation induces one of three phases: the stable coexistence of three species, the stable phase of two species, and a single-species phase. The phase transitions among three phases occur by varying the mutation rate. We find the conditions for coexistence are largely changed depending on metapopulation models.

Three different localities associated to rainfed agriculture were assessed, two of them enclosed to a RAMSAR site (National Park “Esteros de Farrapos e Islas del Rio Uruguay”). Pesticide residues occurred in muscle tissue of 143 from 149 sampled fishes (96%). Thirty different pesticides were detected at concentrations from &lt;1 to 194 μg kg−1.

The bioinsecticide spinosad was initially recognized as safe for non-target organisms; however, its toxicity has been changing this view. Here, we investigated the survival, behavioral changes, and structural changes in the midgut and Malpighian tubules of A. mellifera treated orally with a spinosad formulation. RESULTS: The field-recommended concentration of spinosad killed 100% of the bees. The 5% and 50% lethal concentrations (LC5 and LC50, respectively) of spinosad altered the behavioral activity, reducing the walking distance and velocity, and increased the resting time in comparison to the control. The LC50 caused disorganization of the epithelia of tested organs and induced oxidative stress and cell death. CONCLUSIONS: The present work provides new insights into the debate about the role of bioinsecticides in the mortality of Africanized honey bees. Even at very low concentrations, the spinosad formulation was toxic to the vital organs midgut and Malpighian tubules and adversely affected walking behavior. This detailed evaluation of the impact of the bioinsecticide on A. mellifera will contribute to the clarification of disturbances probably caused by spinosad formulations, which can be used to develop more sustainable protocols in agriculture. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",,10.1002/ps.4815,,29194936,NA,spinosadmediated effects on the walking ability midgut and malpighian tubules of africanized honey bee workers

Enantiomeric selectivity comes from the different effects of the enantiomers on target and non-target organisms. In this study, the enantiomers of three amide herbicides were purified by the semi-preparative column and were used to investigate the enantioselective effects on target Echinochloa crusgalli (lowland rice weeds), and non-target Microcystis aeruginosa, and the yeast transformed with the human TRβ plasmid organisms. The results showed that (i) the R-enantiomers of the three amide herbicides exhibited the strongest activity toward weed inhibition and the lowest toxicity toward non-target organisms; (ii) napropamide was better suited for controlling root growth, while acetochlor and propisochlor were better for leaves control; (iii) herbicides at certain low concentrations (0.01 mg L−1 for acetochlor and propisochlor) could be utilized to promote plant growth. These findings encourage the use of R-amide herbicides instead of their racemates to increase the efficiency of weed control and reduce the risk to non-target organisms.

We analyzed the degree of resistance and molecular genetic changes underlying resistance in Hyalella azteca, a species complex of freshwater crustaceans inadvertently exposed to pesticide pollution via runoff. We surveyed 16 waterways encompassing most major watersheds throughout California and found that land use patterns are predictive of both pyrethroid presence in aquatic sediments and pyrethroid resistance in H. azteca. Nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions in the voltage-gated sodium channel including the M918L, L925I, or L925V confer resistance in H. azteca. The most frequently identified mutation, L925I, appears to be preferred within the species complex. The L925V substitution has been associated with pyrethroid resistance in another insect, but is novel in H. azteca. We documented a variety of pyrethroid resistance mutations across several species groups within this complex, indicating that pyrethroid resistance has independently arisen in H. azteca at least six separate times. Further, the high frequency of resistance alleles indicates that pesticide-mediated selection on H. azteca populations in waterways equals or exceeds that of targeted terrestrial pests. Widespread resistance throughout California suggests current practices to mitigate off-site movement of pyrethroids are inadequate to protect aquatic life from negative ecological impacts and implies the likelihood of similar findings globally. © 2017 The Authors.

Common ecotoxicological assessments of riverine systems are mainly based on water sampling and analysis of only the dissolved phase, and address a single pesticide's toxicological impact under laboratory conditions. A clear overview of mixtures of pesticides in the adsorbed and dissolved phases is missing, and therefore the full ecotoxicological impact is not fully addressed. The aim of this study was to characterize and quantify pesticide concentrations in both suspended sediment and dissolved phases, to provide a better understanding of pesticide-load dynamics during storm events in coastal streams in a Mediterranean climate. High-resolution sampling campaigns of seven flood events were conducted during two rainy seasons in Alexander stream, Israel. Samples of suspended sediments were separated from the solution and both media were analyzed separately for 250 pesticides. A total of 63 pesticides were detected; 18 and 16 pesticides were found solely in the suspended sediments and solution, respectively. Significant differences were observed among the pesticide groups: only 7% of herbicide, 20% of fungicide and 42% of insecticide load was transported with the suspended sediments. However, in both dissolved and adsorbed phases, a mix of pesticides was found which were graded from “mobile” to “non-mobile” with varied distribution coefficients. Diuron, and tebuconazole were frequently found in large quantities in both phases. Whereas insecticide and fungicide transport is likely governed by application time and method, the governing factor for herbicide load was the magnitude of the stream discharge. The results show a complex dynamic of pesticide load affected by excessive use of pesticides, which should be taken into consideration when designing projects to monitor riverine and estuarine water quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.213,Pesticides,29289002,NA,pesticide load dynamics during stormwater flow events in mediterranean coastal streams alexander stream case study

Two approaches, namely toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) and effect-directed analysis (EDA) have been developed. Conventional sediment TIEs take the advantage of environmental relevance by using whole organism bioassays; however, they suffer from lack of effective methods for specifically identifying major contributors as it typically only evaluates contaminant class rather than specific contaminants. Alternatively, EDA is a powerful tool in identifying causes of sediment toxicity with sophisticated fractionation and chemical analysis of targeted and non-targeted non-polar organic toxicants, but it is not always environmentally relevant due to the use of in-vitro bioassays and exhaustive solvent extraction. An integrated TIE and EDA method would provide an environmentally relevant and toxicant specific approach to effectively determine causality of sediment toxicity by combining the merits of the two methods. Bioavailability-based extraction and dosing techniques are recommended to be incorporated into the integrated method to improve the accuracy of toxicity diagnosis. Besides considering bioavailability in the integrated TIE and EDA approach, the premise of adverse outcome pathways should also be considered. Generally speaking, both TIE and EDA have focused on adverse effects at cellular and organism levels. The addition of trait-based approaches in screening multiple toxicological endpoints helps to extend effects on cellular and organism levels to population level, and provides a better understanding of potential impacts to the community and ecosystem. The outcome pathway underlies the critical role of determining causality in interpreting impacts of complex mixtures to benthic community and aquatic ecosystem.

We assessed the behavioural response of the Neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros, a soybean pest in the Neotropical region with increasing pest status, following exposure to chlorantraniliprole, pyriproxyfen and spinosad, insecticides commonly used against soybean caterpillars and whiteflies. Both individuals, or only the male or female of each mating pair, were exposed. Reproductive behaviour and output were measured to determine insecticide- and gender-mediated fitness. We found that treatment scenario significantly affected mating behaviour, and that the duration of some behaviours were significantly affected. Chlorantraniliprole and pyriproxyfen reduced latency to mate, while spinosad increased this behaviour. Insecticide exposure also decreased the interacting time of each couple and male antennation of the female. Fertility table analyses of exposed couples indicated negligible effect of pyriproxyfen exposure, while spinosad extended generation time and reduced net reproductive rate, leading to lower rates of population growth of the brown stink bug. In contrast, chlorantraniliprole led to only a slight extension on the generation time, but enhanced net reproductive rate of the stink bug leading to higher rates of population growth; no effects on sexual fitness were observed, as both compounds exhibited similar effect on females and males. Latency to mate correlated significantly with the population growth rate.

Since empirical toxicity studies of pollutants generally focus on a handful of model organisms, reliable approaches are needed to assess sensitivity to chemicals across the wide variety of species in the environment. Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCM) offer a promising approach for toxicity extrapolation incorporating known evolutionary relationships among species. If phylogenetic signal in toxicity data is high, i.e., closely related species are more similarly sensitive as compared to distantly related species, PCM could ultimately help predict species sensitivity when toxicity data are lacking. Here, we present the largest ever test of phylogenetic signal in toxicity data by combining phylogenetic data from fish with acute mortality data for 42 chemicals spanning 10 different chemical classes. Phylogenetic signal is high for some chemicals, particularly organophosphate pesticides, but not necessarily for many chemicals in other classes (e.g., metals, organochlorines).

We investigated 17 rice fields in two regions of Northern Vietnam in 2014 and 2015. At each region, we explore the abundance of pesticides used with three methods including (1) the novel approach of collecting pesticide packages close to our target rice fields, (2) observations of farmers spraying pesticides in the surrounding and (3) interviewing local farmers. By collecting pesticide packages, we found 811 packages containing 74 different active ingredients. On average, 19 active ingredients (ranging from four to 40 active ingredients) were applied with an average content of 275.3 g of active ingredients per site. Insecticide packages (39%) were most abundant followed by those of fungicides (31%), herbicides (16%) and other active ingredients (14%). On all sites, active ingredients banned in the European Union were applied by the farmers. Collecting pesticide packages proved to be an efficient and rapidly implemented method to obtain some baseline information about pesticide application (for Northern Vietnam).

Birds associated with farmlands and grasslands in North America have experienced severe declines over the last several decades, prompting the need for a comprehensive review of the drivers, mechanisms and magnitude of effects on bird populations. Here we evaluated changes in North American farmland bird populations over time and conducted a systematic review and analysis of the published literature to identify the major causes. Based on North American Breeding Bird Survey data, populations of 57 of 77 (74%) farmland-associated species decreased from 1966 to 2013. Multiple species exhibited highly congruent declines during the 1960s-1980s − a period with rapid changes in farming practices to low tillage systems, heavy pesticide use and widespread conversion of grassland habitat to cropland. The most severe declines occurred in aerial insectivorous birds (average change of −39.5% from 1966 to 2013), followed by grassland (‐20.8%) and shrubland (‐16.5%) bird species. Direct agricultural drivers impacting bird abundance, survival, and reproduction include loss of natural habitats, interference from farming equipment, and direct mortality or sublethal effects from pesticide exposure. Subtle interference with behaviour or physiology are reported through indirect drivers such as reduced food supplies, sublethal pesticide toxicity, habitat fragmentation and alteration, and disturbance. Indirect effects are likely significant for many species, particularly aerial insectivores, but detailed mechanistic studies are lacking. Our review of 122 studies found that pesticides (42% of all studies), followed by habitat loss or alterations (27%), were most predominant in negatively affecting farmland birds, with pesticides (93% negative) and mowing/harvesting (81% negative) having the most consistently negative effects. Modifications to farmland management such as reducing pesticide inputs through integrated pest management and maintaining or restoring uncultivated field margins and native habitat could positively influence farmland birds without significantly reducing agricultural crop yields. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.agee.2017.11.028,North America,NA,NA,analysis of trends and agricultural drivers of farmland bird declines in north america a review

Because current methods to identify lead exposure require animal capture and blood collection, management would benefit from the development of a less costly and noninvasive behavioral test for illness in wild animals. We attempted to design such a test to identify lead exposure in California condors (Gymnogyps californianus) that we tracked with global positioning system (GPS) telemetry in southern California, USA, 2013–2016. We measured blood-lead concentrations in tracked birds and expected that flight behavior would be influenced by lead exposure; thus, we measured the effect of blood-lead concentrations on 2 different types of movement rates and on the proportion of time condors spent in flight. We found no effect of lead exposure on any of these 3 behavioral metrics. Our work suggests that the measurements we took of flight behaviors were not a useful tool in predicting lead exposure in the mildly to moderately exposed birds we studied. Wild birds are effective at hiding illness, especially condors who have a strong social hierarchy in which showing weakness is a disadvantage. However, focusing on behaviors other than flight, expanding the sample studied to include birds with a wider range of lead concentration values, or analyzing tissues such as feathers (rather than, or in addition to, blood) may be more useful for identification of lead exposure and other diseases that may limit wildlife populations. © 2017 This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. © 2017 This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.",,10.1002/jwmg.21378,California,NA,NA,lack of observed movement response to lead exposure of california condors

Recent mass mortalities in the Kruger National Park (KNP) raised concerns about possible influence of pollution. We analysed eggs and their eggshells collected from nests inside the KNP and from a crocodile farm for metallic elements. We found that mercury, selenium, and copper occurred at levels of concern. Eggshells had very high concentrations of iron. Apart from toxicological implications associated with elevated concentrations in eggs, we found iron possibly contributing towards thicker eggshells. Thicker shells may act as a barrier to gas and water exchange, as well as possibly increasing the effort required for the hatchling to emerge from tightly packed shells under sand. Pollutants are transported into the KNP via rivers, and possibly via air. Mercury and copper pollution are waste-, industrial- and mining-related; ecotoxicological concern should therefore be extended to all areas where the four African crocodile species occur. Reptiles are under-represented in ecotoxicological literature in general, and especially from Africa. We know of only one previous report on metals and metalloids in crocodile eggs from Africa (Zimbabwe), published 30 years ago. Reduced fitness, endocrine disruption and effects on behaviour are other possible sub-lethal effects associated with metallic elements that may only become apparent decades later in a long-lived species such as the Nile Crocodile. In the face of habitat destruction, pollution, human population increases, and climate change, further research is needed regarding pollutant concentrations and effects in all African reptiles. The rivers that carry water from outside the park sustain its aquatic life, but also transport pollutants into the KNP.

This paper provides a review on the quality of organic produce in terms of its nutritional value, the presence of pesticide residues, heavy metals, mycotoxins and bacterial contamination, and the issue of antibiotics. The use of Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone is addressed. Hydroponic techniques are also discussed. Compared to conventional produce, organic produce is richer in some useful compounds. Nevertheless, heterogeneous findings have been reported. Studies concord in finding organic food much less contaminated by pesticides, and with residues of much lower toxicity compared to those found in conventional foods. As for heavy metals, mycotoxins and bacterial contamination, there are no significant differences in organic produce compared to conventional produce (with the exception of Cd, found to be lower in organic produce, which is a positive finding). More effective and detailed guidelines should be devised for the design and reporting of both primary studies and meta-analyses. Pesticide residues should be assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The issue of multiple residues should also be addressed. Of course, organic produce cannot be assumed, a priori, to be safe. Sound monitoring needs to be constantly performed. It is concluded that organic agriculture can provide important benefits to human health and to the environment, and promote a more compassionate treatment of animals. It is hoped that agricultural policies will pay more attention to organic, agroecological and low-input agricultural practices, and invest in research and innovation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.10.014,Food,NA,NA,food quality assessment in organic vs conventional agricultural produce findings and issues

To appraise the recovery capabilities, frequency of micronuclei (MNs), other nuclear abnormalities and DNA single-strand breaks evaluated by single cell gel electrophoresis assay on circulating blood cells were employed as endpoints for genotoxicity. Growth, development, body mass, and morphological abnormalities were also employed as individual endpoints in the recovery assay. Results demonstrated that IMZT induced sublethal effects at both the individual (i.e., loss of keratodonts) and cytogenetic levels (e.g., increase of MN frequency, other nuclear abnormalities and DNA single-strand breaks). At 11 days of the exposure phase, tadpoles recovered their basal levels of frequency of MNs, other nuclear abnormalities, and comets.

Wild mice that inhabit farming land play a key ecological role, and can also be used as bioindicators of wildlife exposure to pollutants. The objectives of this work were to determine the presence of organochlorine pesticides (OC) in liver and evaluate the seasonal response of enzymatic biomarkers (BM) such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and catalase (CAT). Wild mice (Mus musculus) were captured between June 2015 and April 2016 in a watermelon crop of a rural community in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Individual mice were sacrificed in situ, followed by tissue dissection (liver, brain and skeletal muscle). Pesticides were determined by gas chromatography; BM activity was estimated by spectrophotometry. We captured 35 individuals, with a capture success of 2.33%. The prevailing OCs detected were drines in both climatic seasons. The rainy season influenced the activity of biomarkers to a greater extent, since AChE showed a lower activity (16 % and 40 % in brain and liver, respectively). GST was activated during the same season (77 % higher), while CAT did not show significant differences between seasons. There was no significant correlation between OC concentrations and biomarker activity, except for drines and AChE in the brain. OC concentrations recorded in the present work are below (2- and 20-fold lower) those reported in other works on rodents under controlled conditions. BM activity suggests that rainfall seem to exacerbate the effects of pesticides on mice; however, it seemingly does not pose a risk for their survival. The use of wild mice as bioindicators is a valuable and practical tool to detect disturbances derived from the use of pesticides in agricultural areas.

It is based on the use of a reduced graphene oxide-modified screen-printed electrode (RGO-SPE) and combines electrokinetic trapping (EKT) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). When a 50 μL droplet containing negatively charged RGO and positively charged gold nanorods is placed on the SPE, the RGO and gold nanorods are selectively attracted on the surface of the SPE during EKT. This leads to the formation of sandwich-type hybrid substrates. The resulting substrates also contain Raman “hot spots” among the high-density gold nanorods. This, along with the excellent adsorption performance of RGO, makes it an excellent SERS substrate for on-site detection of the charged pesticides. The method is highly reproducible and long-term stable. The spot-to-spot variation of the intensity of the SERS is <15%, and the performance of SERS activity is maintained over a period of 6 weeks. The method works over a wide range of concentrations (0.5 nM to 4 μM) for charged pesticides under optimal conditions, with a sub-nanomolar detection limit (at a signal to noise ratio of 3). The EKT-SERS method requires only microliter volumes and takes only minutes for completion. Therefore, the method provides high sensitivity for detection while preserving the selectivity and stability required for reliable quantitative analysis.

Here we investigated lethal and sublethal effects of azadirachtin, on treated adults in amodel insect, Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen). Dose-mortality relationships as well as several parameters of reproduction (mating, spermatogenesis, oogenesis and fertility) were examined. RESULTS: Neem-Azal, a commercial formulation of azadirachtin, applied topically on newly emerged adults, increased mortality with a positive dose-dependent relationship. The LD50 (0.63 μg) was determined 24 h after treatment using a non-linear regression.Adults surviving thisdosehadamating success thatwasdividedby3andaprogeny production reducedby halfwhen maleswere treated, and evenmorewhen femaleswere treated.When combining probability of survival, ofmating and reduced progeny, it appeared that LD50 induced a 98% reduction in reproductive rates.

The exchange of water between the surface-subsurface generates the hyporheic exchange flow: the engine that drives the ecological functioning of the HZ. The magnitude and direction of hydrological fluxes in the HZ follow complex spatial patterns, strongly influenced by the temporal dynamics of surface flow in rivers.2) The direction and magnitude of hydrological fluxes also shapes the structure of hyporheic communities (hyporheos). During surface disturbances such as flooding or drought, benthic organisms may also use the HZ as a refuge, although the importance of this role is debated.3) Streambed organisms differ in their ability to colonize the HZ depending on the biological traits they possess. The reduction in oxygen concentration and pore size with increasing sediment depth imposes a limit on the distribution of macroinvertebrates, which are replaced by a suite of smaller organisms (meiofauna and protists) at deeper sediment layers. Therefore, a concomitant reduction in net biomass and productivity might be expected through depth. However, only a few studies have assessed the contribution of the hyporheos to whole system production, and they have focused only on the fraction of relatively large organisms.4) The bioreactor ability of the HZ to transform nutrients and pollutants is an important ecosystem service sustained by the life activities of hyporheos. Biofilms have the key role in this process due to their capacity to metabolize a wide range of dissolved compounds, including emerging pollutants. However, the residence time of water in pore sediments (resulting from hyporheic exchange flow) and the rest of the community (constantly reworking the sediments and grazing biofilms) are indirectly involved. © 2017",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.036,,28803202,NA,interplay of hydrology community ecology and pollutant attenuation in the hyporheic zone

In this context, 10 sediments from a large urban river (Guangzhou reach of the Pearl River in China) were assessed for pyrethroid occurrence and sediment toxicity to the benthic invertebrate Chironomus dilutus. One half of the sediments exhibited lethality to C. dilutus in a 10-d exposure and all surviving midges showed significant change of enzymatic activity. Moreover, mortality occurred during a 20-d exposure for all the sediments, in accordance with the high hazard quotients to benthic species estimated from pyrethroid residues in sediment. Pyrethroids were detectable in all sediments with the concentrations ranging from 2.43 to 61.2 ng/g dry weight, and permethrin and cypermethrin dominated pyrethroid composition. Acute toxic units for pyrethroids ranged from 0.03 to 0.56 (cypermethrin accounted for 13–81%) and showed a direct relationship with sediment mortality among the midges. This is consistent with the studies on small creeks in Guangzhou in which sediment-bound cypermethrin was found as a main stressor to benthic invertebrates. Comparatively, sediment toxicity and pyrethroid residues in large rivers were significantly lower than those in nearby creeks (urban tributaries). The difference may be partially explained by differing flow rates and water-carrying capacity among waterbodies at different scales; further validation is required. Overall, extensive use of pyrethroids has caused a threat to benthic species not only in small creeks but also in large rivers.

We conducted an experiment with two rice paddy amphibians found in Luzon, Philippines, the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) and the endemic Luzon wart frog (Fejervarya vittigera), to determine whether exposure to a common herbicide, butachlor, drives competitive interactions in favor of the invasive amphibian. Our results revealed that competition had a strong effect on the development of both species, but in opposing directions; Luzon wart frog tadpoles were smaller and developed slower than when raised alone, whereas cane toad tadpoles were larger and developed faster. Contrary to our predictions, development and survival of endemic wart frog tadpoles was not affected by butachlor, whereas invasive cane toad tadpoles were affected across several endpoints including gene expression, body size, and survival. We also observed an interaction between pesticide exposure and competition for the cane toad, where survival declined but body size and expression of thyroid sensitive genes increased. Taken together, our findings indicate that the success of the cane toad larvae in rice fields may be best explained by increased rates of development and larger body sizes of tadpoles in response to competition with native Luzon wart frog tadpoles rather than lower sensitivity to a common pesticide. Our results for the cane toad also provide evidence that butachlor can disrupt thyroid hormone mediated development in amphibians, and further demonstrate that important species interactions such as competition can be affected by pesticide exposure in aquatic ecosystems. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,10.1007/s10646-017-1854-8,Pesticides;Oryza sativa,28936635,NA,competition and pesticide exposure affect development of invasive rhinella marina and native fejervarya vittigera rice paddy amphibian larvae

The effects of the Nosema ceranae/fipronil combination on the life traits and physiology of mature drones were examined following exposure under semi-field conditions. The results showed that the microsporidia alone induced moderate and localized effects in the midgut, whereas fipronil alone induced moderate and generalized effects. The parasite/insecticide combination drastically affected both physiology and survival, exhibiting an important and significant generalized action that could jeopardize mating success. In terms of fertility, semen was strongly impacted regardless of stressor, suggesting that drone reproductive functions are very sensitive to stress factors. These findings suggest that drone health and fertility impairment might contribute to poorly mated queens, leading to the storage of poor quality semen and poor spermathecae diversity.

In ecology, advances have been made to clearly define resilience based on underlying mechanistic assumptions. Engineering resilience (rebound) is used to describe the ability of organisms to recover from adverse conditions (disturbances), which is termed the rate of recovery. By contrast, the ecological resilience definition considers a systemic change, that is, when ecosystems reorganize into a new regime following disturbance. Under this new regime, structural and functional aspects change considerably relative to the previous regime, without recovery. In this context, resilience is an emergent property of complex systems. In the present study, we argue that both definitions and uses are appropriate in ecotoxicology, and although the differences are subtle, the implications and uses are profoundly different. We discuss resilience concepts in ecotoxicology, where the prevailing view of resilience is engineering resilience from chemical stress. Ecological resilience may also be useful for describing systemic ecological changes because of chemical stress. We present quantitative methods that allow ecotoxicologists and risk managers to assess whether an ecosystem faces an impending regime shift or whether it has already undergone such a shift. We contend that engineering and ecological resilience help to distinguish ecotoxicological responses to chemical stressors mechanistically and thus have implications for theory, policy, and application.

Recent rises in global temperatures have led researchers to predict that sex reversals will become more common, resulting in the distortion of many populations’ sex ratios. However, it is unclear whether susceptibility to climate-driven sex-ratio shifts depends on the type of sex determination that varies across species. First, we show here using individual-based theoretical models that XX/XY (male-heterogametic) and ZZ/ZW(female-heterogametic) sex-determination systems can respond differentially to temperature-induced sex reversals. Interestingly, the impacts of climate warming on adult sex ratio (ASR) depend on the effects of both genotypic and phenotypic sex on survival and reproduction. Second, we analyse the temporal changes of ASR in natural amphibian populations using data from the literature, and find that ASR shifted towards males in ZZ/ZW species over the past 60 years, but did not change significantly in XX/XY species.

We have asked the following questions: Does chemical pollution affect terrestrial top predator population? What are the mechanisms (if known) behind chemical pollution effects on top predators? What types of chemical pollution most commonly affect top predator species? Recent Findings: Pollutants present in the terrestrial top predators are industrial derived (PCBs), pesticides (insecticides and rodenticides), and trace metals (lead and mercury). Recent investigations on the effect of second-generation rodenticides (SGRs) are an emerging topic since these are causing deleterious effects on terrestrial top predator populations. On the other hand, eggshell thinning effects due to the old and known compounds such as DDT are still being observed in avian top predators. Further, lead pollution from spent ammunition affects predators after the hunting season. Summary: This information demonstrates that the occurrence and effects of chemical pollutants on terrestrial top predators is a relevant issue for species and ecosystem conservation.

This forest is home to many highly-valued animal species including fisher (Pekania pennanti; formerly Martes pennanti) and American marten (Martes americana). Second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) are commonly used near human infrastructure in developed areas to control and reduce damage from rodent pests. High body burdens of SGARs in rodent prey pose risks of secondary poisoning for fisher and marten that readily consume rodents. The objective of this research was to determine if fisher and marten living in anthropogenically-disturbed areas of northern Alberta showed evidence of SGAR exposure. Fisher and marten carcasses were collected from the region, aged, sexed, and liver samples were analysed for rodenticides using liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). SGARs were found in the livers of non-target fisher and marten. As SGARs were found in the livers of fisher with sufficient frequency for complete statistical analysis, analyses including ANOVA, linear regression, and spatial cluster analyses were used to assess spatial patterns exhibited by fisher exposure frequencies against potential explanatory variables such as boreal anthropogenic disturbances and land cover classes. Additionally, companies operating in the region were surveyed to identify their current rodent control measures in an effort to verify the results of the spatial analyses. This is the first study to demonstrate non-target SGAR exposure of fisher and marten in Canada.

Our focus was the upper Hudson River where PCBs occur at levels reported to have adverse impacts on wild birds.

At the local scale, many associations of habitat and sampling covariates with species detection probabilities were evident but none, including PCB concentration, with habitat occupancy, extinction or colonization of a given river segment. At the regional scale, survey effort and habitat factors not related to PCB exposure were the most important drivers of waterbird occurrence although two species were more likely to occur farther from the contaminated river segment.

And so, the Green Revolution in the 1960s-1980s was derived in a great increase of crops yields, saving many millions of people from starvation. One of the key factors in the Green Revolution was the application of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.

Many animals use defensive chemicals as protection from predators and diseases, yet the effects of chemical contaminants on this important fitness component are poorly known. Understanding such effects is especially relevant for amphibians, the globally most threatened group of vertebrates, because they are particularly vulnerable to chemical pollution. We conducted two experiments to investigate how exposure to glyphosate-based herbicides, the most widespread agrochemicals worldwide, affects the production of bufadienolides, the main compounds of chemical defence in common toads (Bufo bufo). In both experiments, herbicide exposure increased the amount of bufadienolides in toad tadpoles. In the laboratory, individuals exposed to 4 mg a.e./L glyphosate throughout their larval development had higher bufadienolide content at metamorphosis than non-exposed tadpoles, whereas exposure for 9 days to the same concentration or to 2 mg a.e./L throughout larval development or for 9 days had no detectable effect. In outdoor mesocosms, tadpoles from 16 populations exhibited elevated bufadienolide content after three-weeks exposure to both concentrations of the herbicide.

In spite of identifying glyphosate-detoxifying genes from microorganisms, the plant mechanism to detoxify glyphosate has not been studied. We characterized an aldo-keto reductase gene from Pseudomonas (PsAKR1) and rice (OsAKR1) and showed, by docking studies, both PsAKR1 and OsAKR1 can efficiently bind to glyphosate. Silencing AKR1 homologues in rice and Nicotiana benthamiana or mutation of AKR1 in yeast and Arabidopsis showed increased sensitivity to glyphosate. External application of AKR proteins rescued glyphosate-mediated cucumber seedling growth inhibition. Regeneration of tobacco transgenic lines expressing PsAKR1 or OsAKRI on glyphosate suggests that AKR can be used as selectable marker to develop transgenic crops. PsAKR1- or OsAKRI-expressing tobacco and rice transgenic plants showed improved tolerance to glyphosate with reduced accumulation of shikimic acid without affecting the normal photosynthetic rates.

It is a valuable method of determining whether or not control measures are necessary against an individual pest or group of pests. For thresholds to be effective, farmers and agronomists need to be confident that they accurately reflect the risk of economic loss in relation to the current cropping systems, as well as being practical to use. A lack of confidence can lead to the use of insurance sprays (insecticides applied irrespective of actual pest abundance), which are environmentally damaging, increase the risk of pest resistance, and decrease gross margins. We found that most current economic thresholds for pests of arable crops are not based on published evidence, and almost none account for the ability of crops to tolerate pest damage, or the amount, or type of crop damage that pests can cause. Furthermore, many of the methods of pest assessment are impractical, do not guarantee sufficiently accurate estimates of pest abundance, and are not described with sufficient detail to ensure consistency of pest assessment. Following a critique of current economic thresholds, this paper describes the relationship between invertebrate pest damage to crops, yield formation, and crop tolerance to pest damage, and describes what crop information is required to account for the capacity of crops to tolerate damage. This understanding is used to identify the key elements of economic threshold schemes for arable invertebrate pests, and describe a process by which thresholds can be applied. Finally we discuss the impact revised thresholds would have on crop production, and the further work needed to develop accurate, reliable, practical economic threshold schemes within integrated pest management strategies. We conclude that effective management of invertebrate pests in arable crops is reliant on: (1) Quantifying the crop damage a pest can cause; (2) Understanding the degree of tolerance a crop has to pest damage, and (3) Accurate and practical methods for assessing pest abundance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.cropro.2017.01.009,,NA,NA,a review of economic thresholds for invertebrate pests in uk arable crops

However, worldwide surveys have documented the contamination and impact of agrochemical residues in soils, and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including coastal marine systems, and their toxic effects on humans and nonhuman biota. Although persistent organic chemicals have been phased out and replaced by more biodegradable chemicals, contamination by legacy residues and recent residues still impacts on the quality of human food, water, and environment. Current and future increase in food production must go along with production of food with better quality and with less toxic contaminants. Alternative paths to the intensive use of crop protection chemicals are open, such as genetically engineered organisms, organic farming, change of dietary habits, and development of food technologies. Agro industries need to further develop advanced practices to protect public health, which requires more cautious use of agrochemicals through prior testing, careful risk assessment, and licensing, but also through education of farmers and users in general, measures for better protection of ecosystems, and good practices for sustainable development of agriculture, fisheries, and aquaculture. Enhanced scientific research for new developments in food production and food safety, as well as for environmental protection, is a necessary part of this endeavor.

Northern leopard frogs exposed to 1 mg L-1 of carbaryl had 61% higher parasite loads compared with unexposed individuals, while there was no immediate effect of carbaryl on parasite encystment in American toads.

In this study, our initial goal was to test whether herbicide application intensity was linked to offspring sex ratio in the White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys), a species that requires early-successional forest within forested landscapes. However, a rapid and accurate method using direct PCR to sex a large sample of birds (n > 1000 individuals) was unavailable, so our secondary goal was to develop a new approach for rapidly determine offspring sex. We obtained blood samples from sparrow young during the 2013–2014 breeding seasons in regenerating conifer plantations that were treated with one of four treatments (i.e. light, moderate, and intensive herbicide application, or no-spray control). We then optimized a protocol that used a commercially available, direct PCR kit to amplify sex-specific fragments of the CHD (chromo-helicase-DNA-binding) genes directly from whole blood stored in lysis buffer. Using this approach, we found no evidence that offspring sex ratio was linked to herbicide application intensity or to food availability across herbicide treatments. Our molecular sexing technique was 100% accurate when validated on known-sex adults, and 99.9% of our blood samples amplified successfully after being stored in lysis buffer stored for up to 3 years. The application of direct PCR for sexing birds eliminated the need for DNA extraction and substantially reduced sample processing time, cost, and the opportunity for errors during the extraction step.

During the growing season, those crop fields often receive additional broadband herbicide applications. However, despite this broad utilization, very little is known on potential side effects or interactions between these different pesticide classes on soil organisms. In a greenhouse pot experiment, we studied single and interactive effects of seed dressing of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. var. Capo) with neonicotinoid insecticides and/or strobilurin and triazolinthione fungicides and an additional one-time application of a glyphosate-based herbicide on the activity of earthworms, soil microorganisms, litter decomposition, and crop growth. To further address food-web interactions, earthworms were introduced to half of the experimental units as an additional experimental factor. Seed dressings significantly reduced the surface activity of earthworms with no difference whether insecticides or fungicides were used. Moreover, seed dressing effects on earthworm activity were intensified by herbicides (significant herbicide × seed dressing interaction). Neither seed dressings nor herbicide application affected litter decomposition, soil basal respiration, microbial biomass, or specific respiration. Seed dressing did also not affect wheat growth.

Pyrethroids exhibit low toxicity to mammals, but have extremely high toxicity to fish and non-target invertebrates. Their high hydrophobicity, along with pseudo-persistence due to continuous input, indicates that pyrethroids will accumulate in sediment, pose long-term exposure concerns to benthic invertebrates and ultimately cause significant risk to benthic communities and aquatic ecosystems. The current review synthesizes the reported sediment concentrations of pyrethroids and associated toxicity to benthic invertebrates on a global scale. Geographically, the most studied area was North America, followed by Asia, Europe, Australia and Africa. Pyrethroids were frequently detected in both agricultural and urban sediments, and bifenthrin and cypermethrin were identified as the main contributors to toxicity in benthic invertebrates.

Most ecotoxicological studies have been performed in countries and ecosystems in temperate zones, neglecting the tropics. In tropical environments most research has focused on water quality and aquatic toxicology, with regulations varying from country to country. Therefore, the present chapter aims at presenting the current status of ecotoxicological studies regarding the major risks to which Latin American freshwater resources are subjected, which can be included in six categories: 1) municipal discharges; 2) mining activities; 3) industrial/agricultural contamination; 4) depletion and contamination of aquifers/glaciers; 5) petroleum industry contamination; and 6) cyanobacteria toxins. In addition, information related to these threats is presented as evidence of the adverse effects caused to freshwater ecosystems: a) loss of biodiversity; b) eutrophication/bacterial-parasite contamination; c) bioaccumulation, bioconcentration and biomagnification; d) aquifer contamination and depletion; e) freshwater salinization.

The authors developed a detailed, individual-based population model for a threatened plant species, the decurrent false aster (Boltonia decurrens), for application in pesticide risk assessment. Floods and competition with other plant species are known factors that drive the species’ population dynamics and were included in the model approach. The authors use the model to compare the population-level effects of 5 toxicity surrogates applied to B. decurrens under varying environmental conditions. The model results suggest that the environmental conditions under which herbicide applications occur may have a higher impact on populations than organism-level sensitivities to an herbicide within a realistic range. Indirect effects may be as important as the direct effects of herbicide applications by shifting competition strength if competing species have different sensitivities to the herbicide. The model approach provides a case study for population-level risk assessments of listed species. Population-level effects of herbicides can be assessed in a realistic and species-specific context, and uncertainties can be addressed explicitly.

However, the various mechanisms of agriculture-induced evolution and their socio-ecological consequences are not often synthetically discussed. Here, we explore how agricultural practices and evolutionary changes in domesticated species cause evolution in wild species. We do so by examining three processes by which agriculture drives evolution. First, differences in the traits of domesticated species, compared with their wild ancestors, alter the selective environment and create opportunities for wild species to specialize. Second, selection caused by agricultural practices, including both those meant to maximize productivity and those meant to control pest species, can lead to pest adaptation. Third, agriculture can cause nonselective changes in patterns of gene flow in wild species. We review evidence for these processes and then discuss their ecological and sociological impacts. We finish by identifying important knowledge gaps and future directions related to the eco-evolutionary impacts of agriculture including their extent, how to prevent the detrimental evolution of wild species, and finally, how to use evolution to minimize the ecological impacts of agriculture.

Moreover, as interactions with natural stressors may cause underestimates of the impact of pesticides, we also tested whether this pathway depended on the presence of predator cues. Therefore, we exposed damselfly larvae to chlorpyrifos and cues from predatory dragonflies and focused on body stoichiometry and associated explanatory variables (growth rate, RNA:DNA, and energy storage molecules). The way the predator cues modulated the pesticide effects strongly differed between endpoints. Exposure to chlorpyrifos affected the key body stoichiometric ratios: chlorpyrifos consistently increased N:P, while its effects on C:N (decrease with predator cues) and C:P (increase without predator cues) strongly depended upon the presence of the natural stressor. These stoichiometric responses could be explained by associated changes in growth, RNA:DNA, and in C-rich fat and sugars and N-rich proteins.

To quantify the effect of these complex mixtures, mixture toxicity models have to be used. The standard is to use Concentration Addition (also called Dose Addition), where all co-occurring pesticides are transformed into one common unit, which is summed and used as the joint exposure concentration. Using this approach, both herbicides and insecticides can reach joint concentrations during storm flow that can cause measurable effects in the plant, algae and invertebrate communities. Fungicide concentrations rarely reach the same level of predicted environmental effects, but this is likely owed to the fact that the traditional ecotoxicological tests do not reflect aquatic fungi communities, which are likely the most sensitive to these pesticides. Except for extreme incidents, pesticide occurrences in agricultural catchments will rarely lead to acute extermination of the majority of species. There is no doubt, however, that peak pesticide concentrations can affect the species communities on sub-lethal endpoints such as growth, emergence times, feeding and drift behaviour which ultimately may translate into altered community structure and function. In addition to the low dose effects of pesticides, other stressors of both chemical and physical nature are also stressing the aquatic communities. Therefore, ensuring a diverse aquatic community, requires a broad focus including both combatting excessive concentrations of pesticides and other chemicals and improving the physical habitat on a local scale as well as on a catchment scale. Only holistic approaches, including all stressors of the aquatic ecosystem, will sufficiently safeguard aquatic ecosystems and potentially recreate lost habitats, as well as increase populations of threatened species. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/bk-2017-1249.ch012,Pesticides,NA,NA,low dose effects of pesticides in the aquatic environment

The principal of the proposed method is that the fluorescence quenching effect of quantum dots (QDs) can be observed by enzyme-generated H2O2. The active centers of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) could be inhibited in the presence of pesticides, which caused decrease of the generated H2O2. Then, the inhibition efficiency of pesticide to AChE activity could be evaluated by measuring the fluorescence changes. Different from biosensors based on immobilized enzyme or self-assembling technique, the proposed biosensor demonstrated a good selectivity for the detection of oxo forms of OPPs. In the present study, the important experimental conditions of the proposed biosensor were investigated.

Insecticides do not only reduce pest organisms on crops but can also affect non-target organisms when present in sublethal concentrations in the environment. We investigated the effects of an exposure to sublethal pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin) concentrations, at doses 20 and 60 times lower than the LC50, respectively, on reproductive traits and adult cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles of a leaf beetle (Phaedon cochleariae Fabricius). Furthermore, we tested for effects on growth and antennae symmetry of the offspring generation that was not exposed to the insecticide. Sublethal insecticide concentrations decreased the egg number produced by the adults and the hatching rate. Moreover, the chemical phenotype (CHC profile) of adults was altered in dependence of the insecticide treatment, with sex-specific effects. In the unexposed offspring of insecticide-exposed parents, a prolonged development time and a fluctuating asymmetry of the females' antennae were detected, revealing transgenerational effects. The insecticide effects on the CHC profiles of the parental generation might have been caused by changes in CHC precursors, which were potentially induced by the insecticide treatment of the insect diet. Such altered CHC pattern may have implications for intraspecific communication, e.g., in mate choice, as well as in an interspecific way, e.g., in interactions with other arthropod species. The observed detrimental transgenerational effects might be explainable by a reduced investment in the offspring, maternal transfer or epigenetic processes. An asymmetry of the antennae may lead to defects in the reception of chemical signals. In conclusion, the results disclose that, besides detrimental (transgenerational) effects on reproduction and development, an exposure to sublethal insecticide concentrations can impair the chemical communication between individuals, with impacts on the sender (i.e., the CHC profile) and the receiver (i.e., caused by asymmetry of the antennae). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.envpol.2017.07.018,Phenotype;Insecticides,28719883,NA,sublethal insecticide exposure affects reproduction chemical phenotype as well as offspring development and antennae symmetry of a leaf beetle

Additionally, we measured the expression levels of caspase-3, caspase-8, iNOS, MT1, CYP1A, and CYP3A genes in chlorpyrifos-exposed brain tissue, as well as the expression levels of FSH and LH genes in chlorpyrifos-exposed ovaries, using qRT-PCR. We observed severe histopathological lesions, including inflammation, degeneration, necrosis, and hemorrhage, in the evaluated tissues of common carp after both high and low levels of exposure to chlorpyrifos. We detected strong and diffuse signs of immunofluorescence reaction for 8-OHdG, iNOS, and cleaved caspase-3 in the chlorpyrifos-exposed brain and liver tissues. Furthermore, we found that chlorpyrifos exposure significantly upregulated the expressions of caspase-3, caspase-8, iNOS, and MT1, and also moderately upregulated CYP1A and CYP3A in the brain tissue of exposed carp. We also noted downregulation of FSH and LH gene expressions in chlorpyrifos-exposed ovary tissues. Based on our results, chlorpyrifos toxication caused crucial histopathological lesions in vital organs, induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in liver and brain tissues, and triggered reproductive sterility in common carp. Therefore, we can propose that chlorpyrifos toxication is highly dangerous to the health of common carp. Moreover, chlorpyrifos pollution in the water could threaten the common carp population.

Burning fossil fuels results in the increase of net atmospheric CO2 and climate change, hence there is widespread interest in identifying sustainable alternative fuel sources. Biofuels are one such alternative involving the production of biodiesel and bioethanol from plants. However, the environmental impacts of biofuels are not well understood. First generation biofuels (i.e. those derived from edible biomass including crops such as maize and sugarcane) require extensive agricultural areas to produce sufficient quantities to replace fossil fuels, resulting in competition with food production, increased land clearing and pollution associated with agricultural production and harvesting. Microalgal production systems are a promising alternative that suffer from fewer environmental impacts. Here, we evaluate the potential impacts of microalgal production systems on biodiversity compared to first generation biofuels, through a review of studies and a comparison of environmental pressures that directly or indirectly impact biodiversity. We also compare the cultivation area required to meet gasoline and distillate fuel oil demands globally, accounting for spatial variation in productivity and energy consumption. We conclude that microalgal systems exert fewer pressures on biodiversity per unit of fuel generated compared to first generation biofuels, mainly because of reductions in direct and indirect land-use change, water consumption if water is recycled, and no application of pesticides. Further improvements of technologies and production methods, including optimization of productivities per unit area, colocation with wastewater systems and industrial CO2 sources, nutrient and water recycling and use of coproducts for internal energy generation, would further increase CO2 savings. Overall pollution reductions can be achieved through increased energy efficiencies, along with nutrient and water recycling.

The Abam-PLA nanoparticles were spherical with diameters of around 450 nm, and their maximum abamectin loading rate was around 50%. The nanoparticles exhibited better continuous release behavior and photostability compared with active abamectin.

While the effects of individual stressors have been broadly investigated, there is growing evidence that multiple stressors are frequently encountered underscoring the need to examine interactive effects. Pesticides and infectious diseases are two common stressors that regularly occur together in nature. Given the documented lethal and sublethal effects of each stressor on individuals, there is the potential for interactive effects that alter disease outcomes and pesticide toxicity. Using larval wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), we examined the reciprocal interaction between insecticides (carbaryl and thiamethoxam) and the viral pathogen ranavirus by testing whether: (1) prior ranavirus infection influences pesticide toxicity and (2) sublethal pesticide exposure increases susceptibility to and transmission of ranavirus. We found that prior infection with ranavirus increased pesticide toxicity; median lethal concentration (LC50) estimates were reduced by 72 and 55% for carbaryl and thiamethoxam, respectively. Importantly, LC50 estimates were reduced to concentrations found in natural systems. This is the first demonstration that an infection can alter pesticide toxicity. We also found that prior pesticide exposure exacerbated disease-induced mortality by increasing mortality rates, but effects on infection prevalence and transmission of the pathogen were minimal. Collectively, our results underscore the importance of incorporating complexity (i.e. order and timing of exposures) into research examining the interactions between natural and anthropogenic stressors.

However, freshwater ecologists have largely disregarded the contribution of toxicants to stress in rivers, whereas ecotoxicologists have primarily examined toxicant effects in artificial systems. As a result, there is a paucity of information on the co-occurrence of organic toxicants with other stressors and on the relative importance of toxicants for overall ecological risk in rivers. We used monitoring data for German rivers to analyse the individual and joint occurrence of four stressors: habitat degradation, invasive species, nutrient pollution and organic toxicants. All stressors were examined for ecological risks in terms of whether they exceeded low- and high-risk thresholds derived from published studies and regulatory thresholds. Nutrients and habitat degradation exceeded low and high risk thresholds at c. 85% of the sites and invasive species and organic toxicants at c. 50% of the sites. At least one stressor exceeded thresholds at all sites for which data on all four stressors were available. Toxicity showed weak positive correlations with nutrients and habitat degradation (0.2 < Spearman's ρ < 0.34, 0.009 < P < 0.08). The risks of ecological effects arising from habitat degradation and invasive species were higher in lowland rivers, particularly for invasive species. Our assessment shows that organic toxicants contribute notably to risks of ecological effects in rivers, to a similar extent as invasive species, although habitat degradation and nutrients are the dominant stressors. Exposure to multiple stressors is the typical situation prevailing in rivers. Consequently, mitigation measures focusing on individual stressors may not be effective at reducing ecological risks. This suggests that integrating concepts and data from freshwater ecology and ecotoxicology is essential to meet the challenge of managing multiple stressors in river ecosystems. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,10.1111/fwb.12811,,NA,NA,contribution of organic toxicants to multiple stress in river ecosystems

Both direct and indirect impacts were evident across multiple levels of organisation and taxa, from the base of the food web to higher trophic levels. At the molecular level, differences in functional gene abundance within the impacted sites reflected a combination of direct and indirect effects of the pesticide, via elevated abundances of microbial populations capable of using chlorpyrifos as a resource (i.e. direct effect) and oxidising ammonia released by decaying macroinvertebrate carcasses (i.e. indirect effect). At the base of the food chains, diatom taxa found only in the impacted sites were an order-of-magnitude larger in cell size than the largest comparable taxa in control communities, following the near extirpation of their consumers. Population biomass of the key detritivore Gammarus pulex was markedly lower, as was the rate of litter decomposition in the impacted sites. This was partially compensated for, however, by elevated microbial breakdown, suggesting another indirect food-web effect of the toxic spill. Although many species exhibited population crashes or local extirpation, total macroinvertebrate biomass and abundance were largely unaffected due to a compensatory elevation in small tolerant taxa such as oligochaetes, and/or taxa which were in their adult aerial life stage at the time of the spill (e.g. chironomids) and thus avoided contact with the polluted waters and were able to repopulate the river quickly. Mass–abundance scaling of trophic links between consumers and resources revealed extensive restructuring within the food web. This case study shows that pesticides can affect food-web structure and ecosystem functioning, both directly and indirectly across levels of biological organisation. It also demonstrates how an integrated assessment approach, as adopted here, can elucidate links between microbiota, macroinvertebrates and fish, for instance, thus improving our understanding of the range of biological consequences of chemical contamination in natural ecosystems. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,10.1111/fwb.12676,Pesticides,NA,NA,genetoecosystem impacts of a catastrophic pesticide spill testing a multilevel bioassessment approach in a river ecosystem

We critically analyse the findings on pesticide–disease interactions, including effects on the survival, pathogen loads and immunity of bees, and assess the suitability of various endpoints to inform our mechanistic understanding of these interactions. We show that pesticide exposure and pathogen infection have not yet been found to interact to affect worker survival under field-realistic scenarios.

To better understand how the shift is reflected in aquatic environment, two sediment cores were collected from a rural (RLY) and a suburban (SGZ) river in South China. A variety of legacy organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and current-use pesticides (CUPs), including organophosphate, pyrethroid and phenylpyrazole insecticides were quantified at distinct increments of the sediment cores. Total insecticide concentrations were in the ranges of 67.6-1671 and 99.2-231 ng/g dry weight in RLY and SGZ with pyrethroids and organochlorines being the dominant components, respectively. In general, the shifting profile of sediment-bound insecticides from legacy OCPs to CUPs over time followed their historical application pattern, but significant differences were noted between the temporal profiles of the rural and suburban cores in regards to concentrations and composition of insecticides. The observed difference between the suburban and rural cores was synchronous with land use pattern and local economic changes. A steep increased occurrence of CUPs in the 1990s was observed in the RLY core, which is consistent with the onset of economic growth in this area. In contrast, the suburban SGZ area has been historically contaminated by legacy OCPs, with fresh input of OCPs in SGZ believed to be caused by soil erosion, caused by land reclamation activities associated with urban expansion. The current study shows the shift in insecticide application pattern from legacy OCPs to CUPs leading to an elevated CUP occurrence in the environment. It also suggests a stronger need for understanding not only environmental fate and risk, but also how their use pattern and land use changes impact the occurrence of pesticides. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.05.202,Insecticides;China;Suburban Population,NA,NA,insecticides in sediment cores from a rural and a suburban area in south china a reflection of shift in application patterns

In general, there are few pesticide studies using native anuran larvae and especially less toxico- logical experience with larval urodeles. Most information is available for embryos and larvae of the common frog (Rana temporaria) and the fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina). The observed effects include among others increased mortality and malformation rates, growth inhibition, behavioural and developmental changes. Abiotic and biotic co-factors can increase or decrease the effects. For example, pesticide mixtures can act in synergistic and cumulative ways. Rffects were sometimes observed at very low concentrations, which are understood as environmentally relevant. However, nearly nothing is known about real world contamination of aquatic amphibian habitats with plant protection products and environmentally relevant concentrations are usually modelled. Consequently, regular pesticide screening in amphibian habitats is a must.

Pesticides also have diverse mechanisms of action that make it difficult to identify impacts on exposed wildlife. Behavioral measures represent an important link between physiological and ecological processes, and are often used to generalize sub-lethal effects of pesticide exposure. In order to bridge the toxicological and behavioral literature, and identify chemical classes that denote the largest threat, we conducted a meta-analysis summarizing the effects of pesticides on swim speed and activity of aquatic vertebrates. We found that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides reduced the swim speed of exposed amphibians and fish by 35%, and reduced overall activity by 72%. There were also differences in the magnitude of this effect across chemical classes, which likely reflect underlying physiological processes. Pyrethroids, carbamates, and organophosphates all produced a large decrease in swim speed, where as phosphonoglycines and triazines showed no overall effect. Pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates, organochlorines, and organotins also produced a large decrease in activity, while phosphonoglycines had no overall effect, and triazines had the opposite effect of increasing activity. Our results indicate that even sub-lethal concentrations of pesticides have a strong effect on critical behaviors of aquatic vertebrates, which can affect fitness and alter species interactions.

Biometric indices for damage caused by pollutants such as the shell thickness and the shell index were determined and the egg contents were analyzed for various pollutants by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. A wide range of chemically activated luciferase expression (CALUX®) bioassays were performed on subsamples of the eggs. The following organohalogen compounds were found in the eggs of 2009: dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene, dieldrin, hexachlorocyclohexane, polychlorobiphenyls and polychlorodibenzodioxins and polychlorodibenzofurans, polybromodiphenyl ethers, hexabromocyclododecane, tetrabromobisphenyl A, perfluoro compounds, and mercury. The DDT metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE) (11,800 ng/g dry matter), was found to be the most highly concentrated egg contaminant followed by 2,2′,4,4′,5,5′-hexachlorobiphenyl (3800 ng/g). After a past general drop in pollution level, most egg contaminants presently plateau at levels that may still exceed limit values in foods of animal origin (DDE) or even toxicological thresholds (polychlorobiphenyls + polychlorodibenzodioxins, polybromodiphenyl ethers, perfluorooctanesulfonate, methylmercury). Accumulation of DDE could be shown in peregrine falcon eggs from the uplands of Southwest Germany with elevations up to 1500 m, presumably due to its global distribution and its cold condensation in higher altitudes. In contrast, the concentration of polychlorobiphenyls in falcon eggs decreases with elevation, indicating that these pollutants originate mainly from conurbations and local industrial sites. Significant negative correlations were found between both shell index and thickness and the concentration of Hg. A deleterious effect is also evident from a no-observed-adverse-effect level of 120 ng MeHg per gram egg determined by other authors in chronic feeding studies with ibises, which resulted in decreased egg productivity and male homosexual nesting and courtship behavior. The average Hg concentration in the peregrine falcon eggs from 2009 is almost four times higher than this level. MeHg accounted for 82.5% of the Hg present in the eggs of 2009 and 2010.

Rarely is this information readily available, making it difficult to determine the applicability of realistic models to quantify population-level risks. To evaluate the trade-offs between data demands and increased specificity of spatially explicit models for population-level risk assessments, we developed a model for a standard toxicity test species, the sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus), exposed to oil contamination following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and compared the output with various levels of model complexity to a standard risk quotient approach. The model uses habitat and fish occupancy data collected over fve sampling periods throughout 2008-2010 in Pensacola and Choctawhatchee Bays, Florida, USA, to predict species distribution, field-collected and publically available data on oil distribution and concentration, and chronic toxicity data from laboratory assays applied to a matrix population model.

By examining effects on individual fitness proxies, we aimed to determine the mechanisms behind documented amphibian and reptile declines in barren landscapes where vegetation was nearly decimated due to atmospheric metal and sulfur deposition from smelting operations in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. We examined individual characteristics of snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis, Storeria occipitomaculata) and frogs (Lithobates clamitans, L. pipiens, L. septentrionalis) in replicated barren and reference sites, including standard metabolic rates (in snakes), body condition (all species), female reproductive status (snakes), limb deformity (frogs), and fluctuating asymmetry (all species). Frogs in barren sites (except L. septentrionalis) were in poor body condition, and all but one case of limb deformities in frogs were found in barren sites. However, neither frogs nor snakes exhibited elevated frequency of fluctuating asymmetry in barren sites. Standard metabolic rates (SMR) were not elevated in either snake species, suggesting that metal toxicity does not present an energetic burden. Instead, female T. sirtalis from barren sites exhibited lower SMR and were in poor body condition, which is a predicted response to reduced food intake. By contrast, SMR and body condition of S. occipitomaculata were not different between barren and reference sites. While physiological responses differed between T. sirtalis and S. occipitomaculata, both species exhibited lower reproductive rates (proportion of pregnant females) in barren sites compared to reference sites. Thus, energy deficiency may explain reduced reproduction in T. sirtalis while reduced availability of suitable gestation microhabitat may be a limiting factor for S. occipitomaculata. Populations in smelting-impacted habitats include individuals with potentially compromised fitness. The low values of our measured fitness proxies appear to have resulted from pollution-induced changes in biotic and abiotic factors, in addition to (for frogs) or rather than (for snakes) from the direct toxicity. These results suggest that impact assessment based solely on toxicological data and species distributions can underestimate the full impacts of pollution, highlighting the need for integrated examination at multiple levels of biological organization. © 2016 Sasaki et al.",,10.1002/ecs2.1360,,NA,NA,effects of a miningaltered environment on individual fitness of amphibians and reptiles

Given the great diversity of PPPs applied on agricultural fields, we used exploratory GC/MS-MS and LC/MS-MS screenings measuring ca. 500 compounds. The limit of quantification was 0.01 mg/kg, a statutory reference. A total of 15 different compounds were detected in 24 clutches. Nine of them have been used by farmers to protect crops against fungi (difenoconazole, tebuconazole, cyproconazole, fenpropidin and prochloraz), insects (lambda-cyhalothrin and thiamethoxam/clothianidin) and weeds (bromoxynil and diflufenican). Some old PPPs were also detected (fipronil(+sulfone), HCH(α,β,δ isomers), diphenylamine, heptachlor(+epoxyde), DDT(Σisomers)), as well as PCBs(153, 180). Concentrations ranged between <0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg but reached 0.067 (thiamethoxam/clothianidin), 0.11 (heptachlor + epoxyde) and 0.34 (fenpropidin) mg/kg in some cases.

In this work, we demonstrated in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells the beneficial role of superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes against paraquat-induced toxicity, as well as the therapeutic potential of the SOD-mimetic compound M40403. Having verified the beneficial effects of superoxide dismutation in cells, we then evaluated the effects using Drosophila melanogaster as an in vivo model. Besides protecting against the oxidative damage induced by paraquat treatment, our data demonstrated that in Drosophila M40403 was able to compensate for the loss of endogenous SOD enzymes, acting both at a cytosolic and mitochondrial level.

Nevertheless, pesticide use is still a controversial issue and is at the regulatory forefront in most countries. The older generation of insecticide groups has been largely replaced by a plethora of novel molecules that exhibit improved human and environmental safety profiles. However, the use of such compounds is guided by their short-term efficacy; the indirect and subtler effects on their target species, namely arthropod pest species, have been neglected. Curiously, comprehensive risk assessments have increasingly explored effects on nontarget species, contrasting with the majority of efforts focused on the target arthropod pest species. The present review mitigates this shortcoming by hierarchically exploring within an ecotoxicology framework applied to integrated pest management the myriad effects of insecticide use on arthropod pest species. © Copyright 2016 by Annual Reviews.

Although to a lesser extent, this also holds for Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), the most widely used biological pesticide to control mosquito populations. This raises the need for the development of integrated pest management strategies that allow the reduction of Bti concentrations without loss of the mosquito control efficiency. To this end, we tested in a laboratory experiment the combined effects of larval exposure to a sublethal Bti concentration and predation risk cues on life history and physiology of larval and adult Culex pipiens mosquitoes. Besides natural predator kairomones and prey alarm cues, we also tested synthetic kairomones of Notonecta predators. Neither Bti nor predation risk cues affected mortality, yet when both stressors were combined mortality increased on average by 133% compared to the treatment with only predation risk cues. This synergistic interaction was also present when Bti was combined with synthetic kairomones. This was further reflected in changes of the composite index of population performance, which suggested lowered per capita growth rates in mosquitoes exposed to Bti but only when Bti was combined with synthetic kairomones. Furthermore, predation risk cues shortened larval development time, reduced mass at metamorphosis in males, and had an immunosuppressive effect in larval and adult mosquitoes which may affect the mosquito vector competence. We provide the first demonstration that synthetic kairomones may generate similar effects on prey as natural kairomones. The identified immunosuppressive effect of synthetic kairomones and the novel lethal synergism type between a biological pesticide and synthetic predator kairomones provide an important proof of principle illustrating the potential of this combination for integrated mosquito control and should in a next step be evaluated under more natural conditions. It may guide novel integrated pest management programs with Bti that incorporate synthetic kairomones and thereby can reduce environmental impact and evolution of resistance creating more efficient and sustainable mosquito control. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.",,10.1890/15-0326,Cues;Pesticides;Culicidae;Prednisolone,27209779,NA,synthetic predator cues impair immune function and make the biological pesticide bti more lethal for vector mosquitoes

The goal of the present study was to assess the effects of two commonly used fungicides, tebuconazole and pyrimethanil, on Italian Tree Frog (Hyla intermedia), a species frequently found in agricultural areas. Tadpoles were exposed to fungicides from developmental Gosner stage 25 (GS 25) to completion of metamorphosis (GS 46) and the whole exposure period lasted 78 days. For both tested fungicides we used two concentrations (5 and 50. μg/L) that are comparable to those detected in surface waters, near agricultural fields.A variety of sublethal effects-on growth, development, behavior, and physiology-may be used for evaluating alterations induced by pollutants in amphibians. We estimated whether pyrimethanil and tebuconazole exposure impacted on H. intermedia life history traits. For this purpose, survival, growth, development, initiation of metamorphosis, success and size at metamorphosis, time to metamorphosis, and frequency of morphological abnormalities were evaluated. We showed, for all considered endpoints, that the exposure to tebuconazole exerts more harmful effects on H. intermedia than does exposure to pyrimethanil.Before the onset of metamorphic climax we showed, for both fungicides, that the low concentrations (5. μg/L) induced significantly greater effects than the higher ones (50. μg/L) on survival and deformity incidence. During the metamorphic climax, a complete reversal of this nonlinear trend takes place, and the percentage of animals initiating metamorphosis was reduced in fungicide-exposed groups in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, a strong correlation emerged between fungicide exposure and the incidence of morphological abnormalities such as tail malformations, scoliosis, edema, mouth and limb deformities.Exposure to tested fungicides also caused a reduction in developmental rates just prior to the onset of metamorphic climax, which translated to a significant delay in timing of metamorphosis. We detected a drastic decrease in the success at metamorphosis in all exposed groups, compared to control group (86.25%). In fact, the percentage of survived larvae to GS 46, in the high and low concentrations, respectively, was only 22.5% and 36.25% in tebuconazole-exposed groups and 43.75% (50. μg/L) and 56.25% (5. μg/L) in pyrimethanil-exposed groups.Our findings underscore the hazardous properties of these two fungicides for non-target species in the context of ecotoxicological risk assessment.

The specific implication of the plant communities that are part of the make-up of buffer zones will be assessed in the context of agriculture-linked pollutions by pesticides. The distribution of environmental contaminations involving pesticides and associated products shows that plant communities of vegetative buffer strips are confronted with chemical and xenobiotic stresses that show great fluctuations and complexity, with, among other characteristics, exposures to mixtures of low levels of pollutants. The physical and microbiological dimensions of plant action on the environmental dynamics of contaminating pesticides are well understood, but higher plants are also capable of efficient responses to chemical and xenobiotic stresses and of phytoremediation of pollutants. However, the direct phytoremediating roles of plants in vegetative buffer-zones have remained poorly appreciated, and the interferences that affect this capacity for phytoremediation are not fully understood either. It is therefore essential that integrative studies take into account the diversity of contaminants, the diversity of plant species that are used in buffer zones, their capacity to respond to organic xenobiotics under laboratory controlled conditions, and their ecophysiological behaviour under real field conditions.

Moreover, the development and diversity of these aquatic organisms could also be affected by human-induced climate change that might lead to more periods with extreme temperatures. However, to what extent non-target effects of these herbicides on amphibians or algae are altered by varying temperature is not well known. Methods We studied effects of five concentrations of the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation Roundup PowerFlex (0, 1.5, 3, 4 mg acid equivalent glyphosate L-1 as a one time addition and a pulse treatment of totally 4 mg a.e. glyphosate L-1) on larval development of Common toads (Bufo bufo, L.; Amphibia: Anura) and associated algae communities under two temperature regimes (15 vs. 20 °C). Results Herbicide contamination reduced tail growth (-8%), induced the occurrence of tail deformations (i.e. lacerated or crooked tails) and reduced algae diversity (-6%). Higher water temperature increased tadpole growth (tail and body length (tl/bl) +66%, length-to-width ratio +4%) and decreased algae diversity (-21%). No clear relation between herbicide concentrations and tadpole growth or algae density or diversity was observed. Interactive effects of herbicides and temperature affected growth parameters, tail deformation and tadpole mortality indicating that the herbicide effects are temperature-dependent. Remarkably, herbicide-temperature interactions resulted in deformed tails in 34% of all herbicide treated tadpoles at 15 °C whereas no tail deformations were observed for the herbicide-free control at 15 °C or any tadpole at 20 °C; herbicide-induced mortality was higher at 15 °C but lower at 20 °C. Discussion These herbicide- and temperature-induced changes may have decided effects on ecological interactions in freshwater ecosystems. Although no clear dose-response effect was seen, the presence of glyphosate was decisive for an effect, suggesting that the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) in our study was 1.5 mg a.e. glyphosate L-1 water.

Increased concerns about the side effects of chemical pesticides have resulted in greater interest in developing biocontrol strategies against S. sclerotiorum. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of Streptomyces spp. as biological control agents against S. sclerotiorum on lettuce. Two Streptomyces isolates, S. exfoliatus FT05W and S. cyaneus ZEA17I, inhibit mycelial growth of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum by more than 75% in vitro. We evaluated their biocontrol activity against S. sclerotiorum in vivo, and compared them to Streptomyces lydicus WYEC 108, isolated from Actinovate®. When Streptomyces spp. (106 CFU/mL) were applied to S. sclerotiorum inoculated substrate in a growth chamber 1 week prior lettuce sowing, they significantly reduced the risk of lettuce drop disease, compared to the inoculated control. Interestingly, under field conditions, S. exfoliatus FT05W and S. cyaneus ZEA17I protected lettuce from drop by 40 and 10% respectively, whereas S. lydicus WYEC 108 did not show any protection. We further labeled S. exfoliatus FT05W and S. cyaneus ZEA17I with the enhanced GFP (EGFP) marker to investigate their rhizosphere competence and ability to colonize lettuce roots using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The abundant colonization of young lettuce seedlings by both strains demonstrated Streptomyces' capability to interact with the host from early stages of seed germination and root development. Moreover, the two strains were detected also on 2-week-old roots, indicating their potential of long-term interactions with lettuce. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations showed EGFP-S. exfoliatus FT05W endophytic colonization of lettuce root cortex tissues. Finally, we determined its viability and persistence in the rhizosphere and endorhiza up to 3 weeks by quantifying its concentration in these compartments.

The debate is meaningful within the context of rising health and environmental awareness on one hand, and the global challenge of feeding a steadily growing human population on the other. Conventional pesticide use has come under pressure in many countries, and some European Union (EU) Member States have adopted policies for risk reduction following Directive 2009/128/EC, the sustainable use of pesticides. Highly diverse crop production systems across Europe, having varied geographic and climatic conditions, increase the complexity of European crop protection. The economic competitiveness of European agriculture is challenged by the current legislation, which banned the use of many previously authorized pesticides that are still available and applied in other parts of the world. This challenge could place EU agricultural production at a disadvantage, so EU farmers are seeking help from the research community to foster and support integrated pest management (IPM). Ensuring stable crop yields and quality while reducing the reliance on pesticides is a challenge facing the farming community is today. Considering this, we focus on several diverse situations in European agriculture in general and in European crop protection in particular. We emphasize that the marked biophysical and socio-economic differences across Europe have led to a situation where a meaningful reduction in pesticide use can hardly be achieved. Nevertheless, improvements and/or adoption of the knowledge and technologies of IPM can still achieve large gains in pesticide reduction.

Moreover, fish sampled during winter displayed lower bactericidal competence, hematocrit, and condition factor than those sampled in summer independently of site, whereas the opposite pattern was found for bacterial agglutination. These results could be explained by life-history theory, which predicts a re-allocation of resources between reproduction and other physiological functions (including immunity) during the most energetically demanding season.

Due to their persistence many pollutants pass wastewater treatment plants without substantial removal. Transport and fate of pollutants in receiving waters and export to downstream ecosystems is not well understood. In particular, a better knowledge of processes governing their environmental behavior is needed. Although a lot of data are available concerning the ubiquitous presence of micropollutants in rivers, accurate data on transport and removal rates are lacking. In this paper, a mass balance approach is presented, which is based on the Lagrangian sampling scheme, but extended to account for precise transport velocities and mixing along river stretches. The calculated mass balances allow accurate quantification of pollutants' reactivity along river segments. This is demonstrated for representative members of important groups of micropollutants, e.g. pharmaceuticals, musk fragrances, flame retardants, and pesticides. A model-aided analysis of the measured data series gives insight into the temporal dynamics of removal processes. The occurrence of different removal mechanisms such as photooxidation, microbial degradation, and volatilization is discussed. The results demonstrate, that removal processes are highly variable in time and space and this has to be considered for future studies.

L. perenne was recently shown to undergo metabolic adjustments in response to sub-toxic levels of xenobiotics. To gain insight in such chemical stress responses, a de novo transcriptome analysis was carried out on leaves from plants subjected at the root level to low levels of xenobiotics, glyphosate, tebuconazole, and a combination of the two, leading to no adverse physiological effect. Chemical treatments influenced significantly the relative proportions of functional categories and of transcripts related to carbohydrate processes, to signaling, to protein-kinase cascades, such as Serine/Threonine-protein kinases, to transcriptional regulations, to responses to abiotic or biotic stimuli and to responses to phytohormones. Transcriptomics-based expressions of genes encoding different types of SNF1 (sucrose non-fermenting 1)-related kinases involved in sugar and stress signaling or encoding key metabolic enzymes were in line with specific qRT-PCR analysis or with the important metabolic and regulatory changes revealed by metabolomic analysis. The effects of pesticide treatments on metabolites and gene expression strongly suggest that pesticides at low levels, as single molecule or as mixture, affect cell signaling and functioning even in the absence of major physiological impact.

While sub-lethal Roundup (1-5%) exposures led to hormesis-characterized by a significant increase in biomass and vegetative reproduction, higher concentrations (≥6.25%) were toxic. A significant interaction between Roundup concentrations and leaf biomass was found to influence the F1 plantlets' biomass. Biomass asymmetry generally increased with increasing Roundup concentrations, indicating that plants were more stressed at higher Roundup treatments but within the low-dose regime (≤5% of the as-supplied formulation). While leaf apex region demonstrated higher reproduction with lower biomass increase, leaf basal area showed lower reproduction with greater biomass increase, in plantlets.

Especially intensification and expansion of agriculture are leading to increased pesticide exposure risks for wildlife. In the European Union, Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) have been established for the conservation of taxa listed in Annex II of the Habitats Directive. In the SACs, agricultural land use is legal. Therefore, we conducted a risk evaluation of pesticide exposure for Annex II reptiles by calculating proportions of land use with regular pesticide applications within SACs. Using three evaluation factors (occurrence probability, physiology, life-history aspects), a species-specific risk index was created. Nearly half of the species at above-average risk by pesticide use are globally threatened with extinction (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species). About 30% of their SACs are agriculturally used and one priority subspecies of the Habitats Directive is at highest risk (. Vipera ursinii rakosiensis). Also, all evaluated fresh-water and land-dwelling turtle species are at high risk. National variation in agricultural land use in the SACs was observed. Species at above-average risk are mainly distributed in the Mediterranean and Pannonian/Continental biogeographical regions of Europe. Conservation status according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as well as national differences among the member states argue for the inclusion of pesticide risk assessments in site-specific management plans for SACs to avoid regional loss of reptilian biodiversity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.biocon.2015.08.002,Pesticides,NA,NA,risk evaluation of pesticide use to protected european reptile species

However, pesticides have the potential to cause adverse human health or environmental effects, depending on exposure levels. This review examines existing pesticide legislation worldwide, focusing on the level of harmonization and impacts of differing legislation on food safety and trade. Pesticide legislation varies greatly worldwide, because countries have different requirements, guidelines, and legal limits for plant protection. Developed nations have more stringent regulations than developing countries, which lack the resources and expertise to adequately implement and enforce legislation. Global differences in pesticide legislation act as a technical barrier to trade. International parties such as the European Union (EU), Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have attempted to harmonize pesticide legislation by providing maximum residue limits (MRLs), but globally these limits remain variable.

Recent studies have shown that the root cap exudates obtained from several plant species trigger a state of dormancy or quiescence in various genera of nematodes. This phenomenon is not only of fundamental ecological interest, but also has application potential if the plant-produced compound(s) could be used to control harmful nematodes or help to prolong the shelf-life of beneficial entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs). The identification of the compound(s) involved in quiescence induction has proven to be a major challenge and requires large amounts of active material. Here, we present a high-throughput method to obtain bioactive root extracts from flash-frozen root caps of green pea and maize. The root cap extract obtained via this method was considerably more potent in inducing quiescence than exudate obtained by a previously used method, and consistently induced quiescence in the EPN Heterorhabditis megidis, even after a 30-fold dilution. Extracts obtained from the rest of the root were equally effective in inducing quiescence. Infective juveniles (IJs) of H. megidis exposed to these extracts readily recovered from their quiescent state as soon as they were placed in moist soil, and they were at least as infectious as the IJs that had been stored in water. Excessive exposure of IJs to air interfered with the triggering of quiescence. The implications of these results and the next steps towards identification of the quiescence-inducing compound(s) are discussed from the perspective of applying EPN against soil-dwelling insect pests. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,10.1007/s10886-015-0623-5,,26364294,NA,highly potent extracts from pea pisum sativum and maize zea mays roots can be used to induce quiescence in entomopathogenic nematodes

Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase activities were also measured as indicators of pesticide exposure. Predation activity decreased significantly in nymphs exposed to spinosad (62 %) and chlorpyrifos-ethyl (98 %) compared with controls. A similar response was found for both esterase activities.

We addressed 3 topics embedded in general stress ecology and evolutionary ecology that are relevant to arrive at a better evaluation of the risk of low contaminant levels in aquatic systems: 1) delayed effects of contaminants, 2) interactions between contaminants and biotic interactors, and 3) vulnerability to contaminants under global warming. We developed these topics by capitalizing on the key insights obtained using damselflies as model organisms. First, delayed contaminant effects on important fitness-related effects exist during the larval stage and after metamorphosis in the adult stage. Second, synergistic interactions of contaminants with bacteria and predation risk have been demonstrated, and we present advances in the mechanistic understanding of these synergisms with biotic interactors. Third, we illustrate the strength of assessing the effect of contaminants under global warming using a space-for-time substitution approach and the need to consider temperature extremes. These studies using damselflies as model organisms highlight the relevance of considering contaminant effects after the exposure period and in the presence of natural stressors, such as predation risk and higher temperatures. They further highlight the need for spatially explicit risk-assessment and conservation tools. These insights are relevant for most aquatic taxa. Indeed most aquatic taxa have a complex life cycle, are strongly affected by predation risk and by warming, and show latitudinal gradients.

In order to synthesize which research approaches have been used to examine the effect of neonicotinoids on bees and to identify knowledge gaps, we systematically reviewed research on this subject that was available on the Web of Science and PubMed in June 2015. Most of the 216 primary research studies were conducted in Europe or North America (82%), involved the neo-nicotinoid imidacloprid (78%), and concerned the western honey bee Apis mellifera (75%). Thus, little seems to be known about neonicotinoids and bees in areas outside Europe and North America. Furthermore, because there is considerable variation in ecological traits among bee taxa, studies on honey bees are not likely to fully predict impacts of neonicotinoids on other species. Studies on crops were dominated by seed-treated maize, oilseed rape (canola) and sunflower, whereas less is known about potential side effects on bees from the use of other application methods on insect pollinated fruit and vegetable crops, or on lawns and ornamental plants. Laboratory approaches were most common, and we suggest that their capability to infer real-world consequences are improved when combined with information from field studies about realistic exposures to neonicotinoids. Studies using field approaches often examined only bee exposure to neonicotinoids and more field studies are needed that measure impacts of exposure. Most studies measured effects on individual bees. We suggest that effects on the individual bee should be linked to both mechanisms at the sub-individual level and also to the consequences for the colony and wider bee populations. As bees are increasingly facing multiple interacting pressures future research needs to clarify the role of neonicotinoids in relative to other drivers of bee declines. © 2015 Lundin et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,10.1371/journal.pone.0136928,Insecticides,26313444,NA,neonicotinoid insecticides and their impacts on bees a systematic review of research approaches and identification of knowledge gaps

Spider activity density and species density were influenced by both farming system and surrounding landscape. Hunting spiders, which tend to have lower dispersal capabilities, had higher activity density, and more species were captured, on organic compared to conventional farms. There was also evidence for an interaction, as the farming system effect was particularly marked in the cropped area before harvest and was more pronounced in complex landscapes (those with little arable land). There was no evidence for any effect of farming system or landscape on web-building spiders (which include the linyphiids, many of which have high dispersal capabilities). For carabid beetles, the farming system effects were inconsistent. Before harvest, higher activity densities were observed in the crops on organic farms compared with conventional farms. After harvest, no difference was detected in the cropped area, but more carabids were captured on conventional compared to organic boundaries. Carabids were more species-dense in complex landscapes, and farming system did not affect this. There was little evidence that non-cropped habitat differences explained the farming system effects for either spiders or carabid beetles. For spiders, the farming system effects in the cropped area were probably largely attributable to differences in crop management; reduced inputs of pesticides (herbicides and insecticides) and fertilisers are possible influences, and there was some evidence for an effect of non-crop plant species richness on hunting spider activity density. The benefits of organic farming may be greatest for taxa with lower dispersal abilities generally. The evidence for interactions among landscape and farming system in their effects on spiders highlights the importance of developing strategies for managing farmland at the landscape-scale for most effective conservation of biodiversity. © 2015 Feber et al.

We estimate likelihood of rodenticide exposure across the species range for each land cover type based on a database of reported pesticide use and literature. Using a spatially-explicit population model, we find that 36% of modeled kit foxes are likely exposed, resulting in a 7-18% decline in the range-wide modeled kit fox population that can be linked to rodenticide use. Exposures of kit foxes in low-density developed areas accounted for 70% of the population-wide exposures to rodenticides.

Therefore, the raging debate regarding honey bee decline has surpassed the realm of beekeepers, academia, industry and regulatory agencies and now also encompasses non-governmental agencies, media, fiction writers and the general public. The early interest and concern about honey bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) soon shifted to the bigger issue of pollinator decline, with a focus on the potential involvement of pesticides in such a phenomenon. Pesticides were previously recognised as the potential culprits of the reported declines, particularly the neonicotinoid insecticides owing to their widespread and peculiar use in agriculture. However, the evidence for the potential pivotal role of these neonicotinoids in honey bee decline remains a matter of debate, with an increased recognition of the multifactorial nature of the problem and the lack of a direct association between the noted decline and neonicotinoid use. The focus on the decline of honey bee populations subsequently spread to other species, and bumblebees became another matter of concern, particularly in Europe and the United States. Other bee species, ones that are particularly important in other regions of the world, remain the object of little concern (unjustifiably so). Furthermore, the continuous focus on neonicotinoids is also in need of revision, as the current evidence suggests that a broad spectrum of compounds deserve attention.

The concept of ecosystem services is widely used in decision making in the context of valuing the service potentials, benefits, and use values that well-functioning ecosystems provide to humans and the biosphere and, as an endpoint (value to be protected), in ecological risk assessment of chemicals. Neonicotinoid insecticides are frequently detected in soil and water and are also found in air, as dust particles during sowing of crops and aerosols during spraying. These environmental media provide essential resources to support biodiversity, but are known to be threatened by long-term or repeated contamination by neonicotinoids and fipronil. We review the state of knowledge regarding the potential impacts of these insecticides on ecosystem functioning and services provided by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including soil and freshwater functions, fisheries, biological pest control, and pollination services. Empirical studies examining the specific impacts of neonicotinoids and fipronil to ecosystem services have focused largely on the negative impacts to beneficial insect species (honeybees) and the impact on pollination service of food crops. However, here we document broader evidence of the effects on ecosystem functions regulating soil and water quality, pest control, pollination, ecosystem resilience, and community diversity. In particular, microbes, invertebrates, and fish play critical roles as decomposers, pollinators, consumers, and predators, which collectively maintain healthy communities and ecosystem integrity. Several examples in this review demonstrate evidence of the negative impacts of systemic insecticides on decomposition, nutrient cycling, soil respiration, and invertebrate populations valued by humans. Invertebrates, particularly earthworms that are important for soil processes, wild and domestic insect pollinators which are important for plant and crop production, and several freshwater taxa which are involved in aquatic nutrient cycling, were all found to be highly susceptible to lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids and/ or fipronil at environmentally relevant concentrations. By contrast, most microbes and fish do not appear to be as sensitive under normal exposure scenarios, though the effects on fish may be important in certain realms such as combined fish-rice farming systems and through food chain effects. We highlight the economic and cultural concerns around agriculture and aquaculture production and the role these insecticides may have in threatening food security. Overall, we recommend improved sustainable agricultural practices that restrict systemic insecticide use to maintain and support several ecosystem services that humans fundamentally depend on. © The Author(s) 2014.",,10.1007/s11356-014-3277-x,Insecticides,25035052,NA,risks of largescale use of systemic insecticides to ecosystem functioning and services

Amphibian populations are undergoing unprecedented declines and extinctions with pesticides and emerging infectious diseases implicated as causal factors. Although these factors often cooccur, their effects on amphibians are usually examined in isolation. We hypothesized that exposure of larval and metamorphic amphibians to ecologically relevant concentrations of pesticide mixtures would increase their post-metamorphic susceptibility to the fungus Batra-chochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a pathogen that has contributed to amphibian population declines worldwide. We exposed five anuran species (Pacific treefrog, Pseudacris regilla; spring peeper, Pseudacris crucifer; Cascades frog, Rana cascadae; northern leopard frog, Lithobates pipiens; and western toad, Anaxyrus boreas) from three families to mixtures of four common insecticides (chlorpyrifos, carbaryl, permethrin, and endosulfan) or herbicides (glyphosate, acetochlor, atrazine, and 2,4-D) or a control treatment, either as tadpoles or as newly metamorphic individuals (metamorphs). Subsequently, we exposed animals to Bd or a control inoculate after metamorphosis and compared survival and Bd load. Bd exposure significantly increased mortality in Pacific treefrogs, spring peepers, and western toads, but not in Cascades frogs or northern leopard frogs. However, the effects of pesticide exposure on mortality were negligible, regardless of the timing of exposure. Bd load varied considerably across species; Pacific treefrogs, spring peepers, and western toads had the highest loads, whereas Cascades frogs and northern leopard frogs had the lowest loads. The influence of pesticide exposure on Bd load depended on the amphibian species, timing of pesticide exposure, and the particular pesticide treatment. Our results suggest that exposure to realistic pesticide concentrations has minimal effects on Bd-induced mortality, but can alter Bd load. This result could have broad implications for risk assessment of amphibians; the outcome of exposure to multiple stressors may be unpredictable and can differ between species and life stages.

It is based on bird habitat use of fields at the time of pesticide applications. It accounts for spatio-temporal heterogeneity at population and landscape scales.We identify and quantify the potential exposure to 179 ASs of 140 clutches during pre-laying, laying, and incubation phases, and of 75 coveys. The data come from a large scale field study combining radiotelemetry and a farmer survey.

In this context, we conducted an innovative study combining radiotelemetry, farmer surveys, residue analyses on carcasses and modelling to assess the unintentional effects of pesticides on terrestrial birds. We chose the grey partridge Perdix perdix as a case study because this typical bird of European cereal ecosystems is highly exposed to pesticides. In this paper we focused on acute and short-term impacts of pesticides on adult mortality during spring and summer in a one-substance approach (multiple exposure were not studied here) but for a large variety of active substances (a.s.) actually used in cultivated farmland of Northern France. The fate and the location of 529 partridges were monitored twice a day from early March to late August 2010 and 2011 on 12 sites (14,500. ha). Their daily potential exposure to 183 a.s. was determined by overlapping birds' habitat use and daily pesticide application data. Based on this procedure, we calculated mortality rates within 10 days following a potential exposure for 157 different a.s. 5 a.s. were associated with a ""10-day mortality rate"" higher than 10% but a single one (thiacloprid) is reported to be highly toxic to birds. We recorded 261 mortalities among which 94 carcasses were in suitable condition for residue analyses. We detected at least one a.s in 39.4% of carcasses. However, only 2 mortality cases were attributed to poisoning (carbofuran).

Given that the neonicotinoids have become the fastest-growing class of insecticides globally, we review here 150 studies of their direct (toxic) and indirect (e.g. food chain) effects on vertebrate wildlife—mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles. We focus on two neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and clothianidin, and a third insecticide, fipronil, which also acts in the same systemic manner. Imidacloprid and fipronil were found to be toxic to many birds and most fish, respectively. All three insecticides exert sub-lethal effects, ranging from genotoxic and cytotoxic effects, and impaired immune function, to reduced growth and reproductive success, often at concentrations well below those associated with mortality. Use of imidacloprid and clothianidin as seed treatments on some crops poses risks to small birds, and ingestion of even a few treated seeds could cause mortality or reproductive impairment to sensitive bird species. In contrast, environmental concentrations of imidacloprid and clothianidin appear to be at levels below those which will cause mortality to freshwater vertebrates, although sub-lethal effects may occur. Some recorded environmental concentrations of fipronil, however, may be sufficiently high to harm fish. Indirect effects are rarely considered in risk assessment processes and there is a paucity of data, despite the potential to exert population-level effects. Our research revealed two field case studies of indirect effects. In one, reductions in invertebrate prey from both imidacloprid and fipronil uses led to impaired growth in a fish species, and in another, reductions in populations in two lizard species were linked to effects of fipronil on termite prey. Evidence presented here suggests that the systemic insecticides, neonicotinoids and fipronil, are capable of exerting direct and indirect effects on terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate wildlife, thus warranting further review of their environmental safety. © The Author(s) 2014.",,10.1007/s11356-014-3180-5,,24938819,NA,a review of the direct and indirect effects of neonicotinoids and fipronil on vertebrate wildlife

Due to anthropogenic impact, urban populations are exposed to higher levels of contaminants and higher temperatures. Despite this, urbanisation is a largely overlooked spatial component in ecotoxicology. We tested in a common garden rearing experiment whether replicated urban and rural populations of the damselfly Coenagrion puella differ in their vulnerability to sublethal levels of a widespread pesticide, chlorpyrifos, in terms of ecologically relevant behaviours (exploration behaviour, activity, boldness and food intake), and to what extent these patterns are affected by temperature (20 and 24. °C). Except boldness, all behaviours were affected by previous pesticide exposure. While the pesticide did not affect exploration behaviour at 20. °C, it was associated with increased exploration at 24. °C, which may reflect an increased toxicity of chlorpyrifos at higher temperatures. Importantly, rural and urban larvae showed consistently different, sometimes even opposite behavioural responses to pesticide exposure. When exposed to the pesticide, rural larvae decreased activity and food intake at both temperatures; urban larvae instead increased activity at both temperatures and only reduced food intake at the high temperature. This suggests that urban larvae were less affected by the pesticide, which would be consistent with a scenario of local adaptation to higher contaminant levels. Our results highlight that urbanisation may be an important factor to arrive at a spatially explicit ecological risk assessment, and may be an ignored reason why studies on the same species may generate widely different vulnerabilities to pesticides. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.04.002,Pesticides,25863029,NA,urbanisation shapes behavioural responses to a pesticide

Therefore, the present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of temperature variation on dissipation of lindane from soil. The soil samples were spiked with four different concentrations of lindane (5, 10, 15 and 20mgkg-1) and were incubated at 28, 33, 40 and 48°C for 45 days. The residual lindane concentrations in soil, 50% dissipation rate of lindane (DT50), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) as well as soil dehydrogenase activities were monitored periodically. Irrespective of the initial lindane concentrations and exposure days, the increase in temperature significantly reduced the residual lindane and increased the dissipation of lindane from soil (p<0.001). Similarly, the temperature increase from 28-48°C significantly reduced the MBC content (p<0.01) and soil dehydrogenase activity (p<0.001). Most interestingly, the warming climate significantly reduced the DT50 days at 99.9% confidence level. This was more prominent at 48°C (r2=0.981). Our study concludes that warming temperature can significantly reduce the microbial activity, soil enzymes as well as the dissipation rate of pesticides from soil.

Neonicotinoids are suspected to pose an unacceptable risk to bees, partly because of their systemic uptake in plants, and the European Union has therefore introduced a moratorium on three neonicotinoids as seed coatings in flowering crops that attract bees. The moratorium has been criticized for being based on weak evidence, particularly because effects have mostly been measured on bees that have been artificially fed neonicotinoids. Thus, the key question is how neonicotinoids influence bees, and wild bees in particular, in real-world agricultural landscapes. Here we show that a commonly used insecticide seed coating in a flowering crop can have serious consequences for wild bees. In a study with replicated and matched landscapes, we found that seed coating with Elado, an insecticide containing a combination of the neonicotinoid clothianidin and the non-systemic pyrethroid β-cyfluthrin, applied to oilseed rape seeds, reduced wild bee density, solitary bee nesting, and bumblebee colony growth and reproduction under field conditions. Hence, such insecticidal use can pose a substantial risk to wild bees in agricultural landscapes, and the contribution of pesticides to the global decline of wild bees may have been underestimated. The lack of a significant response in honeybee colonies suggests that reported pesticide effects on honeybees cannot always be extrapolated to wild bees. ©2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In recent years, the focus of ecotoxicology has shifted from describing the effects of chemical contaminants on individual species to developing more integrated approaches for predicting and evaluating long term effects of chemicals across species and ecosystems. Traditional ecotoxicology is typically based on data of sensitivity to a contaminant of a few surrogate species and often considers little variability in chemical sensitivity within and among taxonomic groups. This approach assumes that evolutionary history and phylogenetic relatedness among species have little or no impact on species' sensitivity to chemical compounds. Few studies have tested this assumption. Using phylogenetic comparative methods and published data for amphibians, we show that sensitivity to copper sulfate, a commonly used pesticide, exhibits a strong phylogenetic signal when controlling for experimental temperature. Our results indicate that evolutionary history needs to be accounted for to make accurate predictions of amphibian sensitivity to this contaminant under different temperature scenarios.

In addition, WWTW bats had a significantly lower antioxidant capacity than bats from unpolluted sites. This suggests that bats at WWTWs may have a diminished capacity to cope with the excess reactive oxidative species (ROS) produced from pollutants such as metals. There was no increase in micronucleus frequency in WWTW bats, indicating that cellular functioning has not yet been disrupted by chemical exposure. Haematocrits, however, were significantly higher in WWTW bats, possibly due to erythrocyte production in response to certain pollutants. Thus, effects of pollutant exposure in bats foraging at WWTWs elicit sub-lethal haematological and genotoxic responses which may pose serious long-term risks. This provides evidence that WWTWs, that are aimed to remove pollutants from the environment, can themselves act as a source of contamination and pose a threat to animals exploiting these habitats. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.04.043,Musa,24953517,NA,haematological and genotoxic responses in an urban adapter the banana bat foraging at wastewater treatment works

To explore how population abundance/species diversity are influenced, and which functional traits are important in determining e-waste susceptibility, here we surveyed breeding and overwintering birds with a hierarchically nested sampling design, and used linear mixed models to analyze changes in bird assemblages along an exposure gradient in South China. Total bird abundance and species diversity decreased with e-waste severity (exposed 〈 surrounding 〈 reference), reflecting the decreasing discharge and consequent side effects. Twenty-five breeding species exclusively used natural farmland, and nine species decreased significantly in relative abundance at e-waste polluted sites. A high pairwise similarity between exposed and surrounding sites indicates a diffuse effect of pollutants on the species assembly at local scale. We show that sensitivity to e-waste severity varies substantially across functional guild, with the prevalence of woodland insectivorous and grassland specialists declining, while some open farmland generalists such as arboreal frugivores, and terrestrial granivores were also rare. By contrast, the response of waterbirds, omnivorous and non-breeding visitors seem to be tolerable to a wide range of pollution so far. These findings underscore that improper e-waste dismantling results in a severe decline of bird diversity, and the different bird assemblages on polluted and natural farmlands imply species- and guild-dependent susceptibility with functional traits. Moreover, a better understanding of the impact of e-waste with different pollution levels, combined multiple pollutants, and in a food-web context on bird is required in future. © 2015 Zhang et al.",,10.1371/journal.pone.0122264,China,25811881,NA,do bird assemblages predict susceptibility by ewaste pollution a comparative study based on species and guilddependent responses in china agroecosystems

The sample preparation procedure was carefully optimized for the efficient removal of co-extracted matrix components. The method involves extraction of acidic pesticides with acetonitrile containing hydrochloric acid, removal of water from crude extract by salting out, and sequential cleanup by octadecylsilyl silica gel and silica gel columns. For samples containing high amounts of pigments, such as spinach, additional cleanup using a graphitized carbon column was performed prior to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis. Recovery tests were performed for five times for each sample of cabbage, spinach, potato, eggplant, orange, and apple fortified at 0.01 mg kg−1. Out of the 73 tested pesticides, 70 for cabbage, 67 for spinach, 69 for potato, 67 for eggplant, 64 for orange, and 70 for apple were within the range of 70–120%, with relative standard deviations below 25%. Nitenpyram and pyrasulfotole showed low recoveries for all the samples tested, probably due to low recoveries from silica gel column.

Such variations in pesticide application strategies entail different temporal coincidence with amphibian species and with species' population proportions. For the first time, we assessed the presence of Bombina bombina, Rana arvalis, Pelobates fuscus and Triturus cristatus in agricultural fields. We quantified the temporal coincidence of pesticide applications with the breeding migrations of adult amphibians and evaluated a realistic exposure to pesticides, including the interception by various crops at different growth stages. The level of species-specific coincidence depended on the performed pesticide management, determined by the timing, crop, number and type of pesticide applications. Late migrating species, such as B. bombina and P. fuscus, overlapped more with pesticide applications than early migrating species, such as R. arvalis. Up to 86% of the reproducing population proportion of P. fuscus experienced a temporal coincidence with a single pesticide application during stem elongation in winter rape (80% interception). In maize, up to 17% of the reproducing population proportion of B. bombina encountered a single herbicide application during bare soil/emergence (no interception).

Exposure to pesticides poses a significant potential hazard to small reptiles, both from the direct effects of exposure, and indirectly because of their largely insectivorous diet and small home ranges. Aims Our study aimed to monitor the effects of two insecticides applied operationally for locust control in Australia. A phenyl pyrazole pesticide, fipronil, and a fungal biopesticide, Metarhizium acridium (Green Guard®), were applied aerially in either a barrier or block treatment in the absence of dense locust populations, and effects on non-target arid-zone reptiles were measured. Methods We monitored reptile-abundance and community-composition responses to treatments using a large field-based pitfall-trapping experiment, with replicated control and spraying treatments, which approximated the scale of aerial-based locust-control operations in Australia. Key results Neither reptile abundance nor community composition was significantly affected by locust-control treatments. However, both abundance and community composition as detected by pitfall trapping changed over time, in both control and treatment plots, possibly as a result of a decrease in annual rainfall. Conclusions The absence of any significant short-term pesticide treatment effects in our study suggests that the two locust-control application methods studied present a relatively insignificant hazard to reptiles at our site, based on a single application. Similar to other areas of Australia, climate and other factors are likely to be stronger drivers of reptile abundance and community structure. Implications Monitoring over an area that approximates the scale of the current locust-control operations is an important step in understanding the possible effects of current pesticide exposure on reptile populations and will inform insecticide risk assessments in Australia. However, important information on the immediate response of individuals to insecticide application and long-term effects of exposure are missing. The preliminary research reported in the present paper should be complemented by future investigations on long-term and sublethal impacts of pesticide exposure on Australian native reptiles and the possible benefits provided to reptiles by the resource pulses represented in untreated high-density locust populations.",,10.1071/WR14194,Insecticides,NA,NA,current insecticide treatments used in locust control have less of a shortterm impact on australian aridzone reptile communities than does temporal variation

These commercial orchards were as well compared to abandoned orchards. The density of Forficula auricularia and Forficula pubescens was studied for three years in 74 orchards around Avignon. The pesticide usage, some orchard characteristics and two small-scale landscape parameters were characterized. Pesticide use was significantly different between low-input, organic and IPM orchards with particularly significant differences in the number of insecticide applications (2.2, 4.9 and 9.2 respectively). Pesticide use had a much stronger impact on earwig community than other characteristics. F. auricularia density was significantly lower in IPM orchards (0.47 individuals per tree) compared to organic, low-input and abandoned orchards (3.1, 4.5 and 1.6 individuals per tree, respectively). F. pubescens was almost absent from IPM orchards and its abundance was higher in abandoned or low-input orchards compared to organic orchards (1.5 and 2.8 vs 0.8 individuals per tree). The percentage of F. pubescens in the earwig community decreased from abandoned (52%) to low-input (40%), organic (15%) and IPM orchards (0.5%). These results were confirmed by LD50 assays showing that for the two pesticides causing mortality close to normal application rates (chlorpyrifos-ethyl and acetamiprid), F. pubescens was significantly more sensitive than F. auricularia.

However, herbicides may negatively affect non-target organisms such as butterflies through direct chemical exposure or by altering plant community composition and structure. We evaluate the effect of the grass-specific herbicide fluazifop-p-butyl on behavior and demographic responses of the silvery blue butterfly (Glaucopsyche lygdamus) in the field and also quantify effects on reproductive behavior in the greenhouse. We find that in the first few months after an early spring application, herbicide decreases vertical grass structure but does not have a positive or negative net effect on adult behavior, egg deposition, larval density, pupal weight, or ant-tending association for the silvery blue. Our greenhouse oviposition choice trials corroborate field findings and indicate that females do not show preference for unsprayed host plants. Selective herbicides create a vegetative structure preferred by butterflies and do not negatively affect the silvery blue when applied in the early spring. Appropriate timing of herbicide application is likely the key to avoiding adverse effects on vulnerable butterfly life stages.

Between the weight loss curves of the T1, T2 and T3 of characteristic temperatures under the conditions of different CO2/air mixture have small differences.

Sediment samples were exposed to these pesticides to quantify responses of ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate uptake by the benthic microbial community. Control uptake rates of sediments had net remineralization of nitrate (-1.58 NO3 μg gdm-1 h-1), and net assimilation of phosphate (1.34 PO4 μg gdm-1 h-1) and ammonium (0.03 NH4 μg gdm-1 h-1). Metolachlor decreased ammonium and phosphate uptake. Chlorothalonil decreased nitrate remineralization and phosphate uptake. Nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate uptake rates are more pronounced in the presence of these pesticides due to microbial adaptations to toxicants. Our interpretation of pesticide availability based on their water/solid affinities supports no effects for atrazine and carbaryl, decreasing nitrate remineralization, and phosphate assimilation in response to chlorothalonil. Further, decreased ammonium and phosphate uptake in response to metolachlor is likely due to affinity. Because atrazine target autotrophs, and carbaryl synaptic activity, effects on benthic microbes were not hypothesized, consistent with results. Metolachlor and chlorothalonil (non-specific modes of action) had significant effects on sediment microbial nutrient dynamics. Thus, pesticides with a higher affinity to sediments and/or broad modes of action are likely to affect sediment microbes' nutrient dynamics than pesticides dissolved in water or specific modes of action. Predicted nutrient uptake rates were calculated at mean and peak concentrations of metolachlor and chlorothalonil in freshwaters using polynomial equations generated in this experiment. We concluded that in natural ecosystems, peak chlorothalonil and metolachlor concentrations could affect phosphate and ammonium by decreasing net assimilation, and nitrate uptake rates by decreasing remineralization, relative to mean concentrations of metolachlor and chlorothalonil.

To address this question, we measured concentrations of 164 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and halogenated phenols in 53 Hawaiian green turtle (Chelonia mydas) plasma samples archived by the Biological and Environmental Monitoring and Archival of Sea Turtle Tissues (BEMAST) project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Marine Environmental Specimen Bank. Four groups of turtles were examined: free-ranging turtles from Kiholo Bay (0% FP, Hawaii), Kailua Bay (low FP, 8%, Oahu), and Kapoho Bay (moderate FP, 38%, Hawaii) and severely tumored stranded turtles that required euthanasia (high FP, 100%, Main Hawaiian Islands). Four classes of POPs and seven halogenated phenols were detected in at least one of the turtles, and concentrations were low (often <200 pg/g wet mass). The presence of halogenated phenols in sea turtles is a novel discovery; their concentrations were higher than most man-made POPs, suggesting that the source of most of these compounds was likely natural (produced by the algal turtle diet) rather than metabolites of man-made POPs. None of the compounds measured increased in concentration with increasing prevalence of FP across the four groups of turtles, suggesting that these 164 compounds are not likely primary triggers for the onset of FP. However, the stranded, severely tumored, emaciated turtle group (n = 14) had the highest concentrations of POPs, which might suggest that mobilization of contaminants with lipids into the blood during late-stage weight loss could contribute to the progression of the disease. Taken together, these data suggest that POPs are not a major cofactor in causing the onset of FP. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/es5014054,,24963745,NA,investigating the potential role of persistent organic pollutants in hawaiian green sea turtle fibropapillomatosis

In a greenhouse experiment with white clover we investigated, to what extent a globally-used glyphosate herbicide affects interactions between essential soil organisms such as earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We found that herbicides significantly decreased root mycorrhization, soil AMF spore biomass, vesicles and propagules. Herbicide application and earthworms increased soil hyphal biomass and tended to reduce soil water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall. Herbicide application in interaction with AMF led to slightly heavier but less active earthworms. Leaching of glyphosate after a simulated rainfall was substantial and altered by earthworms and AMF. These sizeable changes provide impetus for more general attention to side-effects of glyphosate-based herbicides on key soil organisms and their associated ecosystem services.",,10.1038/srep05634,Fungi,25005713,NA,glyphosate herbicide affects belowground interactions between earthworms and symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi in a model ecosystem

We analysed endocrine activities in two rivers in Southern Germany using three approaches: (1) chemical analyses, (2) in vitro bioassays, and (3) in vivo investigations in fish and snails. Chemical analyses were based on gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. For in vitro analyses of endocrine potentials in water, sediment, and waste water samples, we used the E-screen assay (human breast cancer cells MCF-7) and reporter gene assays (human cell line HeLa-9903 and MDA-kb2). In addition, we performed reproduction tests with the freshwater mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum to analyse water and sediment samples. We exposed juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) to water downstream of a wastewater outfall (Schussen River) or to water from a reference site (Argen River) to investigate the vitellogenin production. Furthermore, two feral fish species, chub (Leuciscus cephalus ) and spirlin (Alburnoides bipunctatus), were caught in both rivers to determine their gonadal maturity and the gonadosomatic index. Chemical analyses provided only little information about endocrine active substances, whereas the in vitro assays revealed endocrine potentials in most of the samples. In addition to endocrine potentials, we also observed toxic potentials (E-screen/reproduction test) in waste water samples, which could interfere with and camouflage endocrine effects. The results of our in vivo tests were mostly in line with the results of the in vitro assays and revealed a consistent reproduction-disrupting (reproduction tests) and an occasional endocrine action (vitellogenin levels) in both investigated rivers, with more pronounced effects for the Schussen river (e.g. a lower gonadosomatic index). We were able to show that biological in vitro assays for endocrine potentials in natural stream water reasonably reflect reproduction and endocrine disruption observed in snails and field-exposed fish, respectively. © 2014 Henneberg et al.",,10.1371/journal.pone.0098307,Germany,24901835,NA,are in vitro methods for the detection of endocrine potentials in the aquatic environment predictive for in vivo effects outcomes of the projects schussenaktiv and schussenaktiv plus in the lake constance area germany

These declines have been largely attributed to habitat loss and degradation, especially from agricultural practices and intensification (the habitat-availability hypothesis). A recent analysis of North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) ""grassland breeding"" bird trends reported the surprising conclusion that insecticide acute toxicity was a better correlate of grassland bird declines in North America from 1980-2003 (the insecticide-acute-toxicity hypothesis) than was habitat loss through agricultural intensification. In this paper we reached the opposite conclusion. We used an alternative statistical approach with additional habitat covariates to analyze the same grassland bird trends over the same time frame. Grassland bird trends were positively associated with increases in area of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands and cropland used as pasture, whereas the effect of insecticide acute toxicity on bird trends was uncertain. Our models suggested that acute insecticide risk potentially has a detrimental effect on grassland bird trends, but models representing the habitat-availability hypothesis were 1.3-21.0 times better supported than models representing the insecticide-acute-toxicity hypothesis. Based on point estimates of effect sizes, CRP area and agricultural intensification had approximately 3.6 and 1.6 times more effect on grassland bird trends than lethal insecticide risk, respectively. Our findings suggest that preserving remaining grasslands is crucial to conserving grassland bird populations. The amount of grassland that has been lost in North America since 1980 is well documented, continuing, and staggering whereas insecticide use greatly declined prior to the 1990s.

We have developed and used new risk assessment models to provide, to our knowledge, the first detailed, geographically extensive, scientifically based analysis of pesticide risks for this region. Human health risks from dermal exposure to adults and children are severe enough in many crops to require long periods of up to three weeks when entry to fields should be restricted. This is impractical in terms of crop management, and regulatory action is needed to remove these pesticides from the marketplace. We also found widespread risks to terrestrial and aquatic wildlife throughout the region, and if these results were extrapolated to all similar irrigated perimeters in the Senegal and Niger River Basins, they suggest that pesticides could pose a significant threat to regional biodiversity. Our analyses are presented at the regional, national and village levels to promote regulatory advances but also local risk communication and management.

Although concentrations are rarely high enough to cause direct salmon mortality, they can reach levels sufficient to impair juvenile feeding behavior and limit macroinvertebrate prey abundance. This raises the possibility of direct adverse effects on juvenile salmon health in tandem with indirect effects on salmon growth as a consequence of reduced prey abundance. We modeled the growth of ocean-type Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at the individual and population scales, investigating insecticides that differ in how long they impair salmon feeding behavior and in how toxic they are to salmon compared to macroinvertebrates. The relative importance of these direct vs. indirect effects depends both on how quickly salmon can recover and on the relative toxicity of an insecticide to salmon and their prey. Model simulations indicate that when exposed to a long-acting organophosphate insecticide that is highly toxic to salmon and invertebrates (e.g., chlorpyrifos), the long-lasting effect on salmon feeding behavior drives the reduction in salmon population growth with reductions in prey abundance having little additional impact. When exposed to short-acting carbamate insecticides at concentrations that salmon recover from quickly but are lethal to invertebrates (e.g., carbaryl), the impacts on salmon populations are due primarily to reductions in their prey. For pesticides like carbaryl, prey sensitivity and how quickly the prey community can recover are particularly important in determining the magnitude of impact on their predators. In considering both indirect and direct effects, we develop a better understanding of potential impacts of a chemical stressor on an endangered species and identify data gaps (e.g., prey recovery rates) that contribute uncertainty to these assessments.",,10.1371/journal.pone.0092436,Pesticides,24686837,NA,a modeled comparison of direct and food webmediated impacts of common pesticides on pacific salmon

Because of its widespread use during the last few decades, lindane contaminated soils are found in almost all parts of India. Since phytoremediation is widely acknowledged as an innovative strategy for the clean-up of contaminated soils; the present study was aimed to evaluate the phytoextraction and dissipation of lindane by a leafy vegetable Spinacia oleracea L (Spinach).

The effects of single and combined stressors were studied by monitoring survivorship, growth, and physiological parameters, such as respiration, photochemistry (pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry and oxygen production), and chl a content. Specimens were exposed in flow-through aquaria for up to seven weeks to combinations of two pCO2 (~790 and ~490 μatm) and two temperature (28 and 31 °C) regimes. Elevated temperature had negative effects on the physiology of both species. Elevated pCO2 had negative effects on growth and apparent photosynthetic rate in H.depressa but a positive effect on effective quantum yield. With increasing pCO2, chl a content decreased in H. depressa and increased in M. vertebralis. The strongest stress responses were observed when the two stressors acted in combination. An interaction term was statistically significant in half of the measured parameters. Further exploration revealed that 75 % of these cases showed a synergistic (= larger than additive) interaction between the two stressors.

Therefore, in the present study, we sought to validate simple, adequate and consistent inventorying and monitoring methods for the ecological characterization of a hexachlorocylcohexane (HCH) isomers contaminated soil site in Lucknow, North India. The abundance and diversity of plant species, microbial biomass, total organic carbon, soil dehydrogenase activity, pesticide concentration in soil and plant species as well as the occurrence of ecologically sensitive species such as earthworms, honey bees and butterflies in contaminated and non-contaminated soil sites were studied. FTIR analysis was done for assessing the variation of functional groups present in soil. Furthermore, the germination assays of selected seeds were conducted in both HCH-contaminated and non-contaminated soils. Interestingly, there was a significant difference (p≤0.01) observed for the studied variables in HCH-contaminated site in comparison to the non-contaminated soil site and they were negatively correlated with the level of HCH contamination. Twenty five plant species were reported from the control site; whereas in the case of HCH-contaminated site, it was reduced to seven species. The presence of α-, β-, γ- and δ-HCH isomers in the soil samples of contaminated sites were varied from 5.18-12.45, 30.15-68.77, 6.93-16.55 and 0.75-7.54mgkg-1, respectively, whereas the concentrations of ∑HCH in plant samples were varied from 2.78 to 12.47mgkg-1. The germination percentages of all the test plants were significantly low in contaminated soil. Most interestingly, honeybees, earthworms and butterflies were not spotted in the contaminated sites.

Studying the effects of agricultural practices on these biological control agents is important for understanding its vulnerability in the field. The aim of this study was to characterize the B-esterase activities in the European earwig Forficula auricularia and to evaluate in vitro its sensitivity to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was mainly measured with 1.5. mM acetylthiocholine as the substrate in the microsomal fraction of earwig heads (70% of total AChE activity). Carboxylesterase (CbE) activities were measured with three substrates [5. mM 4-nitrophenyl acetate (4-NPA), 1. mM 4-nitrophenyl valerate (4-NPV), and 2. mM α-naphtyl acetate (α-NA)] to examine different isoenzymes, which were present mainly in the cytosolic fraction (about 70-88% of total activities) of all earwig tissues. CbE activity was higher than AChE activity, especially with α-NA, then 4-NPA and lastly 4-NPV. Chlorpyrifos-oxon an organophosphate, and carbaryl a carbamate pesticide, inhibited AChE and CbE activities in a concentration-dependent manner. Earwig CbE activities showed a stronger sensitivity to organophosphate than AChE, with the strongest effect for chlorpyrifos-oxon on male carboxylesterase activities. CbE and AChE showed about the same sensitivity to carbamate pesticides regardless of sex.

For each polymer, five environmentally relevant concentrations were tested (from 2.5 to 250 μg/L) for an exposure time of 48 h. NP effects were assessed at the biochemical level by investigating the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activity of the antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT) and at the behavioral level by evaluating the swimming behavior (distance moved). Our results highlight that exposure to PVC-NPs can have sublethal effects on Daphnia magna at the biochemical and behavioral levels. The potential role of particle size on the measured effects cannot be excluded as PVC and PE showed a wider size range distribution than PS, with particles displaying sizes from 50 to 350 nm. However, we infer that the chemical structure of PVC, which differs from that of PE of the same range size, concurs to explain the observed effects.

A promising alternative to classical chemical insecticides is photosensitive molecules – here called photosensitive insecticides or PSIs – that when ingested and activated by light, generate broadly toxic reactive oxygen species. This mechanism of indiscriminate oxidative damage decreases the likelihood that target site modification-based resistance evolves. Here, we tested whether the PSIs, methylene blue (MB) and rose bengal (RB), are viable insecticides across the mosquito lineage. RESULTS: MB and RB are phototoxic to both Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae at micromolar concentrations, with greatest toxicity when larvae are incubated in the dark with the PSIs for 2 h prior to photoactivation. MB is ten times more toxic than RB, and microscopy-based imaging suggests that this is because ingested MB escapes the larval gut and disperses throughout the hemocoel whereas RB remains confined to the gut. Adding food to the PSI-containing water has a bidirectional, concentration-dependent effect on PSI toxicity; toxicity increases at high concentrations but decreases at low concentrations. Finally, adding sand to the water increases the phototoxicity of RB to Ae. aegypti. CONCLUSION: MB and RB are larvicidal via a light activated mechanism, and therefore, should be further investigated as an option for mosquito control. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",,10.1002/ps.7758,Methylene Blue;Culicidae;Photosensitivity Disorders;Photosensitizing Agents;Insecticides,37682561,NA,larvicidal activity of the photosensitive insecticides methylene blue and rose bengal in aedes aegypti and anopheles gambiae mosquitoes

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a review of available stranding data sourced from iNaturalist, news websites, and published papers. A total of 3.148 reports encompassing 189 batoid species were recovered, revealing the vulnerability of both oceanic and coastal species to strandings. Nevertheless, limited data on life stage, sex, animal condition, and fate hinder a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. Putative causes were identified only for a small percentage (6%) of the reports, namely pollution, abrupt environmental alterations, predation, pathologies, and fishing activities. The earliest reported stranding dates back to 1989, with an increase in reports observed since 2019. iNaturalist accounted for the majority (75%) of records, emphasizing its significance as a platform for reporting and monitoring batoid strandings. These strandings were reported in 51 countries, with the coastal areas of California, United States, particularly notable. Among the identified species, Rhinoptera bonasus exhibited the highest number of strandings, with 392 recorded individuals. Alarmingly, more than half of the reports involved threatened species, underscoring the need for increased attention to batoid strandings. To address these issues, we propose the establishment of stranding monitoring networks and the development of a freely accessible global database. In addition, the training of volunteer citizen scientists, the development of rescue and rehabilitation protocols, and manuals of good fishing practices aimed at commercial and recreational fisheries are also recommended.

Following a before–after-control-impact design, we housed wild-caught juvenile yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in outdoor mesocosms to assess survival and behaviour under baseline conditions, then exposed fish to one of three treatments: negative control, 2 mg/L NAFC, or 15 mg/L NAFC. We performed behavioural assays (no-stimulus activity, food stimulus, and predator stimulus using a model bird) and assessed a comprehensive suite of endpoints (equilibrium losses, activity, shoaling, burst swimming, freezing, and space use). We found that exposure to 15 mg/L NAFCs substantially reduced fish survival and impaired fish equilibrium in all three behavioural tests. Furthermore, exposure to NAFCs impaired anti-predator behaviour: while the activity of control fish increased by two-fold in response to a predator stimulus, fish exposed to 2 or 15 mg/L NAFC did not change their activity levels after stimulation. No significant changes were observed in other behavioural endpoints. Overall, our findings suggest that a week-long exposure to NAFCs at concentrations commonly found in tailings ponds, constructed wetlands, and other mining-impacted waters may affect multiple facets of fish behaviour that could ultimately lead to reduced fitness in fish populations. © 2024 The Author(s).",,10.1139/facets-2022-0176,,NA,NA,naphthenic acid fraction compounds produced by the extraction of bitumen from oil sands alter survival and behaviour of juvenile yellow perch perca flavescens

In environments impacted by humans, animals may be exposed to a wide array of chemical contaminants due to agriculture, industry, and other activities. Among other effects, these chemical contaminants may influence behaviors prey animals use to cope with predation risk, likely reducing survival by suppressing or even maladaptively reversing normal behavioral responses. Changes in behavioral responses could be the result of impaired detection of cues that indicate predator presence or altered behavioral plasticity in response to predator cues. In a laboratory experiment, we tested the effects of the commonly used herbicide metolachlor on the behavior of tadpoles of the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) in both the absence and presence of water conditioned with cues (odor) of fish. We observed several behaviors in the tadpoles reflective of predator avoidance when exposed to combinations of metolachlor (0 or 80 ppb) and the presence or absence of fish cues. We found that metolachlor had size-dependent effects on tadpole activity levels, with larger tadpoles being much less active in the absence of metolachlor but similar in activity to small tadpoles when metolachlor was present. Fish cues similarly had size-dependent effects on multiple tadpole behaviors. Finally, hiding behavior and zone change (movement) behavior of tadpoles in response to fish cues varied depending on the presence of metolachlor and, in the case of zone changes, tadpole size. Our findings indicate that the presence of chemical contaminants has the potential to alter important antipredator behaviors. However, these effects are complex, and size may mediate the nature of the response to both chemical contaminants and predators. © 2023 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.",,10.1080/03949370.2023.2298471,Cues,NA,NA,effects of metolachlor and fish cues on tadpole antipredator behaviors

This study investigates the transfer of organochlorine pesticide (OCP) from water, soil, and feed to milk in free-range dairy cows using the carryover rates (CORs) and biotransfer factors (BTFs) from feed to milk as tools that can be used for human and animal risk assessments. BTFs can predict the transfer of OCPs into milk due to cows’ ingestion of contaminated feed. Samples were collected from ten small-scale dairy cow farms located near Baia Mare city, NW Romania, identified for distributing fresh milk in the local market. After the appropriate extraction was performed, the OCP concentrations were measured by gas chromatography equipped with an electron capture detector and randomly confirmed using mass spectrometry. The most prominent compounds in the soil, feed, and milk samples were hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites. The concentrations of OCPs were lower than the maximum admissible values in feed, water, soil, and milk. The CORs of OCPs varied over four orders of magnitudes, from 0.10% (2,4′–dichlorodiphenylchloroethylene, 2,4′–DDE) to 250% (4,4′–dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, 4,4′–DDT). Similar to CORs, the values of BTFs varied largely, from 0.0001 to 1.408. Additionally, the values higher than the unit for some BTFs could be due to the accumulation and biomagnification of these organochlorine compounds in the animal body.

This is particularly true when animals become tolerant to situations that may be perceived as risky, although the actual risk is nonexistent. We provide a framework to understand the causes and consequences of behavioural tolerance. Tolerance can emerge from genetic, epigenetic, or learning mechanisms, each exerting different degrees of influence on its speed of acquisition, reversibility, specificity, and duration.

Sertraline acts by blocking serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters systems and has been detected in surface waters globally, where it may impact fish behavior. We classified zebrafish personality on three behavioral axes, boldness, anxiety, and sociability, assigning fish as either high or low in each category. The fish were exposed to nominal concentrations of 0, 5, 50, 500, or 5000 ng/L sertraline (measured concentrations: <10, 21.3, 370, and 2200 ng/L, respectively) to assess changes in boldness, anxiety, and sociability after 7 and 28 days. We also measured shoaling behavior and response to an alarm cue, and determined the gut microbiome of a subset of fish. After 7 days there was no overall effect of sertraline on boldness, but there was an interaction between initial personality and sex, with a stronger impact on females classified as low-boldness personality. Sertraline reduced sociability in all treatments compared with the control, but there was again an interaction between sertraline and initial personality. Fish that were classified as low-sociability responded more strongly to sertraline. After 7 days, fish exposed to a nominal concentration of 5000 ng/L (2200 ng/L measured) showed higher anxiety than controls, with the overall pattern of initial behavior retained. After 28 days, similar patterns were observed, but with higher variation. There was only a weak association between the gut microbiome and personality. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering initial behavior, which can affect response to pollutants.

To address this issue, zebrafish embryos were exposed to EPH and COC for 14 days post-fertilization (dpf) at 10, 100, and 1000 ng L−1. The bioaccumulation, development, behavior, cell neurotransmitter levels and apoptosis were detected to investigate the developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) of EPH and COC. The results showed that EPH decreased heart rate, while COC increased heart rate. EPH caused cell apoptosis in the brain by AO staining. In addition, behavior analysis indicated that EPH and COC affected spontaneous movement, touch-response, swimming activity and anxiety-like behaviors. EPH and COC altered the levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine (DA) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with changes of the transcription of genes related to the DA and GABA pathways.

Most protocols and regulations, however, are designed to provide protection from lethal effects and are thus based on conventional estimates of population lethality. The relative lack of reliable behavioral endpoints makes it challenging to implement regulations that are similarly protective against sublethal toxicity. The objective of this study was to quantify the avoidance behavior of Hyalella azteca when exposed to three insecticides—bifenthrin (B), chlorpyrifos (C), and permethrin (P)—at a range of estimated lethal concentrations. A two-choice behavioral arena was used for each chemical to quantify H. azteca activity and time spent in either uncontaminated sediment or sediment spiked at concentrations reflecting estimated 48-h lethal concentrations (LC50, LC25, and LC10). For all three insecticides, naïve H. azteca demonstrated a preference for the uncontaminated sediment over the contaminated sediment at the LC50 (B: 312 ng/gOC; C: 1265 ng/gOC; P: 5042 ng/gOC) and LC25 (B: 230 ng/gOC; C: 859 ng/gOC; P: 3817 ng/gOC), spending significantly more time in the uncontaminated side of the arena. H. azteca did not avoid sediment at LC10 (B: 204 ng/gOC; C: 609 ng/gOC; P: 1515 ng/gOC) levels, indicating the existence of a potential threshold of detection. Despite the lack of substrate preference at this exposure level, H. azteca were nevertheless more active (i.e., increased zone-switching) when exposed to bifenthrin at the LC10, suggesting a possible irritation response (e.g., movement after exposure) to this chemical. Our results provide evidence that H. azteca exhibit innate avoidance responses to sediments contaminated with common insecticides at concentrations below those represented by traditional toxicological endpoints (e.g., LC50). The sensitivity and ease with which this behavioral endpoint can be assayed demonstrates the potential utility of behavioral endpoints in toxicological assessments using model organisms. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140492,Insecticides,37865201,NA,avoidance behavior of hyalella azteca in response to three commonuse insecticides

We focus on their climate-pathogen relationships in Eurasia, the only region where their geographical distributions overlap. Eurasia harbours invaded and native areas of both pathogens and the natural habitats where they co-exist, making it an ideal region to examine their environmental niche correlations. Our understanding of how climate change will affect their distribution is broadened by the differences in climate correlates and niche characteristics between Bd and Bsal in Asia and Europe. This knowledge has potential conservation implications, informing future spread of the disease in different regions. Results: We quantified the environmental niche overlap between Bd and Bsal in Eurasia using niche analyses. Results revealed partial overlap in the niche with a unique 4% of non-overlapping values for Bsal, suggesting segregation along certain climate axes. Bd tolerates higher temperature fluctuations, while Bsal requires more stable, lower temperature and wetter conditions. Projections of their Realized Climatic Niches (RCNs) to future conditions show a larger expansion of suitable ranges (SRs) for Bd compared to Bsal in both Asia and Europe, with their centroids shifting in different directions. Notably, both pathogens' highly suitable areas in Asia are expected to shrink significantly, especially under the extreme climate scenarios. In Europe, they are expected to expand significantly. Conclusions: Climate change will impact or increase disease risk to amphibian hosts, particularly in Europe. Given the shared niche space of the two pathogens across available climate gradients, as has already been witnessed in Eurasia with an increased range expansion and niche overlap due to climate change, we expect that regions where Bsal is currently absent but salamanders are present, and where Bd is already prevalent, may be conducive for the spread of Bsal. © 2023, The Author(s).",,10.1186/s12862-023-02132-y,,37370002,NA,the two chytrid pathogens of amphibians in eurasiaclimatic niches and future expansion

The potential threat posed by these contaminants to organisms has prompted scores of toxicology studies. Contaminant concentrations in wildlife toxicology studies are inconsistently expressed in wet or dry mass units, or even on a lipid-normalized basis, but tissue composition is rarely reported, and the conversion between dry and wet mass units, notably, is often based on assumed empirical moisture contents in tissues. However, diverse factors (e.g., tissue, storage conditions) may affect tissue composition and render comparisons between studies difficult or potentially biased. Here, we used data on the concentration of mercury, a global pollutant, in tissues of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) to quantify the effects of diverse variables on moisture and lipid contents, and their consequences on contaminant concentration in different tissues, when converting between wet and dry mass units (lipid extracted or not). We found that moisture content differed largely between organs, enough to preclude the use of a single conversion factor, and decreased by 1% per year when stored at −80 °C. Although most fox tissues had low lipid concentrations, lipid content affected water content and their extraction affected the wet to dry mass conversion factor. We thus recommend reporting tissue composition (at least water and lipid contents) systematically in toxicology studies of mercury specifically and of contaminants in general, and using tissue/species specific conversion factors to convert between dry and wet mass concentration. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.envres.2023.116727,,37495068,NA,tissue composition and storage duration affect the usefulness of generic wettodry mass conversion factors in toxicology studies

Our results show that higher sediment levels of industrial contaminants at the most downstream Detroit River site (Trenton Channel) are associated with increased perch liver detoxification activity and liver size, reduced brain size, and reduced scale cortisol content. Trenton Channel also displayed food web disruption, where adult perch occupied lower trophic positions than forage fish. Somatic growth and relative gut size were lower in perch sampled at the reference site in Lake St. Clair (Mitchell's Bay), possibly because of increased competition for resources.

Behavioural responses often underlie these changes in population dynamics, such as altered habitat choice or foraging activity. Here, we present a framework for understanding how and why behaviour is affected by human activities and how the behavioural responses in turn influence higher ecological levels. We further review the literature to assess the present state of the field and identify gaps in our knowledge. We begin with discussing the factors that determine how an individual responds to a change in the environment and whether the response is adaptive or not. In particular, we explain the importance of the evolutionary history of the species. We then search the literature to assess our current knowledge of the impact of human disturbances on the behaviour of fishes and the consequences for ecosystems. The search reveals that much attention has been directed to the impact of human activities on the behaviour of fishes, but that worryingly little is known about the consequences of these responses for populations, communities and ecosystems. Yet, behavioural responses can have profound ecological consequences given that behaviour underly many, if not most, species interactions. Thus, more attention should be paid to the mechanisms and pathways through which behavioural responses influence higher ecological levels.

Samples were taken from the fur of bats (Eptesicus nilssonii, Myotis brandtii, Myotis mystacinus and Plecotus auritus) to measure concentrations of 55 elements by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Variations in element concentrations between different bat groups (species, sex, reproductive status) were analysed with a focus on arsenic (As), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) as these are known to cause specific health concerns in wildlife. For M. brandtii we found the highest As concentrations, especially in lactating bats, with a maximum exceeding those from other studies where bats had compromised health. Whereas for M. mystacinus there was a negative correlation between body condition index (BCI) and As concentration, indicating a potential danger for bats in the study area. In M. mystacinus and M. brandtii Hg concentrations were higher for sixteen individuals than in other studies where bats suffered genotoxic effects, although median levels were still below this threshold. Lactating bats from P. auritus and M. brandtii had higher Hg concentrations than bats of other reproductive status, which could endanger offspring as Hg can be transferred through lactation. In females from M. mystacinus Pb concentrations were more than three times higher compared to males. There was also a negative correlation between Pb concentration and BCI, which could mean that Pb has an adverse effect on health. Although many other biotic and abiotic factors should be considered, some of the variations in element concentrations could be due to different behaviours (foraging, roosting, etc.) in the studied species. The high levels of chemical contamination in some of the bats in our study, particularly reproductive individuals, is of conservation concern as bats are important agents for insect control. © 2023 The Authors",,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122092,,37348695,NA,species and reproductive status influence element concentrations in bat fur

We argue that this focus on contemporary dynamics is too narrow: Eco-evolution should be extended, first, beyond pure demography to include all environmental dimensions and, second, to include slow eco-evolution which unfolds over thousands or millions of years. This extension allows us to conceptualise biological systems as occupying a two-dimensional time space along axes that capture the speed of ecology and evolution. Using Hutchinson's analogy: Time is the ‘theatre’ in which ecology and evolution are two interacting ‘players’. Eco-evolutionary systems are therefore dynamic: We identify modulators of ecological and evolutionary rates, like temperature or sensitivity to mutation, which can change the speed of ecology and evolution, and hence impact eco-evolution. Environmental change may synchronise the speed of ecology and evolution via these rate modulators, increasing the occurrence of eco-evolution and emergent system behaviours. This represents substantial challenges for prediction, especially in the context of global change. Our perspective attempts to integrate ecology and evolution across disciplines, from gene-regulatory networks to geomorphology and across timescales, from today to deep time. © 2023 The Authors.

Determining the difference between what are hypothesized as normal metal levels and those associated with acute mining toxicity is challenging as spatial and temporal overlap of migratory birds with anthropogenic point sources can be highly variable at individual, population, and species levels. We examined the concentrations of 5 geologically prominent metals and metalloids in the region (arsenic, cadmium, copper, manganese, and zinc) in tissues (kidney, n = 64; liver, n = 65; and muscle, n = 65) from 4 species common to the northern Rocky Mountains in western Montana (Canada goose, Branta canadensis, n = 12; snow goose, Anser caerulescens, n = 15; mallard, Anas platyrhynchos, n = 32; and American coot, Fulica americana, n = 6), to identify metal concentrations for comparison to acute mining-associated mortalities. Metal levels were highly variable across tissue types for all species. For example, the highest concentrations of copper, manganese, and zinc were measured in the liver (18,300, 3,960, and 38,200, respectively; ug/kg), while cadmium levels were highest in the kidney (973 ug/kg). Among species and tissue types, metal levels were also highly variable. For example, copper levels in mallards were highest in the kidney (6,700 ug/kg) and lowest in muscle (2,780 ug/kg). In contrast, copper levels in American coots were highest in muscle (14,400 ug/kg) and lowest in the kidney (5,060 ug/kg). While the wide variation in metal concentrations among species and tissue types measured in our study can make for difficult comparisons, the results are similar to control cases from other peer-reviewed publications, and several times lower than dose-response experiments and incidents in which mining-associated mortality was known.

In particular, chemical contaminant exposure has neurotoxic, endocrine-disrupting, and behavioral effects which may additively or interactively combine with challenges associated with climate change. We used a literature review across animal taxa and contaminant classes, but focused on Arctic endotherms and contaminants important in Arctic ecosystems, to demonstrate potential for interactive effects across five bioenergetic domains: (1) energy supply, (2) energy demand, (3) energy storage, (4) energy allocation tradeoffs, and (5) energy management strategies; and involving four climate change-sensitive environmental stressors: changes in resource availability, temperature, predation risk, and parasitism. Identified examples included relatively equal numbers of synergistic and antagonistic interactions. Synergies are often suggested to be particularly problematic, since they magnify biological effects. However, we emphasize that antagonistic effects on bioenergetic traits can be equally problematic, since they can reflect dampening of beneficial responses and result in negative synergistic effects on fitness. Our review also highlights that empirical demonstrations remain limited, especially in endotherms. Elucidating the nature of climate change-by-contaminant interactive effects on bioenergetic traits will build toward determining overall outcomes for energy balance and fitness.

The present study tested the hypotheses that mercury enhances the effects of fragmentation by (1) reducing the cumulative daily movement of organisms, (2) shifting their foraging behavior, and (3) altering the vertical movement of the marsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata) in a field experiment. Random walk simulations were used to access how changes in movement affect the search efficiency of organisms in the long term. Eighteen 1.5 m2 plots were constructed in a salt marsh where landscapes characteristics were manipulated to reach three different levels of habitat cover. Daily movement of 12 marked control and mercury-exposed snails were measured in each plot. Bayesian models were used to analyze the data and evidence ratios were used to test the hypotheses. The results showed that the effects of fragmentation were consistent in both control and exposed treatments, with an increase in the cumulative displacement of organisms. However, mercury significantly reduced the movement of organisms in all levels of fragmentation, shifting their foraging behavior (evidence ratio &gt; 1000). Exposed snails were more likely to be found inactive in comparison with the control treatment (evidence ratio &gt; 1000). Fragmentation also reduced the vertical movement of organisms in both treatments. In contrast, mercury increased the vertical movement of organisms (evidence ratio &gt; 1000). The search efficiency of organisms also increased in a highly fragmentated landscape, suggesting that changes in foraging behavior are likely due to reduced resources and consequently increase in foraging effort. The present study shows that mercury exposure can enhance the effects of habitat fragmentation by changing organisms’ movement, foraging behavior, and search efficiency.

In this article, we provide an overview of the approaches, accomplishments, and plans for advancing computational exposure science within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (EPA/ORD). First, to characterize the universe of chemicals in commerce and the environment, a carefully curated, web-accessible chemical resource has been created. This DSSTox database unambiguously identifies >1.2 million unique substances reflecting potential environmental and human exposures and includes computationally accessible links to each compound's corresponding data resources. Next, EPA is developing, applying, and evaluating predictive exposure models. These models increasingly rely on data, computational tools like quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models, and machine learning/artificial intelligence to provide timely and efficient prediction of chemical exposure (and associated uncertainty) for thousands of chemicals at a time. Integral to this modeling effort, EPA is developing data resources across the exposure continuum that includes application of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) non-targeted analysis (NTA) methods providing measurement capability at scale with the number of chemicals in commerce. These research efforts are integrated and well-tailored to support population exposure assessment to prioritize chemicals for exposure as a critical input to risk management. In addition, the exposure forecasts will allow a wide variety of stakeholders to explore sustainable initiatives like green chemistry to achieve economic, social, and environmental prosperity and protection of future generations. © 2023",,10.1016/j.envint.2023.108097,,37478680,NA,cuttingedge computational chemical exposure research at the us environmental protection agency

In this study, we examined the effects of a potent algal neurotoxin, β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), on the development and behavior of larval Fathead Minnows, Pimephales promelas, during predator-prey interactions. We exposed eggs and larvae to environmentally relevant concentrations of BMAA for 21 days, then tested subjects in prey-capture and predator-evasion assays designed to isolate the effects of exposure at sequential points of the stimulus-response pathway. Exposure was associated with changes in the ability of larvae to detect and respond to environmental stimuli (i.e., a live prey item and a simulated vibrational predator), as well as changes in behavior and locomotor performance during the response.

Accordingly, we investigated the effects of acute 3-day exposure of eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to field-realistic levels (nominal concentrations: 30 and 300 ng/L) of the widespread psychoactive pollutant, fluoxetine, on diurnal activity patterns and restfulness, as indicators of disruptions to sleep.

Specifically, unexposed control fish were markedly diurnal, swimming farther during the day and exhibiting longer periods and more bouts of inactivity at night. However, in fluoxetine-exposed fish, this natural diel rhythm was eroded, with no differences in activity or restfulness observed between the day and night.

A key mechanism for facilitating success following environmental change is phenotypic plasticity. Organisms use cues to respond phenotypi-cally to environmental conditions; many incorporate recent information (within-generation plasticity) and information from previous generations (transgenerational plasticity). We extend an existing evolutionary model where organisms utilize within-generational plastic-ity, transgenerational plasticity, and bet hedging to include changes in environmental regime. We show how when rapid evolution of plasticity is not possible, the effect of environmental change (altering the environment mean, variance, or autocorrelation or cue reliabil-ity) on population growth rate depends on the population’s evolutionary history and past evolutionary responses to historical environmental conditions. We then evaluate the predictions that populations adapted to highly variable environments or with greater within-generational plasticity are more likely to successfully respond to environmental change. We identify when these predictions fail and show that environmental change is most detrimental when previously reliable cues become unreliable. When multiple cues become unreli-able, environmental change can cause deleterious effects regardless of the population’s evolutionary history.

That body of work has inspired the development of a new discipline called conservation behavior. Yet, the majority of those synthetic papers focus on non-fish taxa such as birds and mammals. Many fish populations are subject to intensive exploitation and management and for decades researchers have used concepts and knowledge from animal behavior to support management and conservation actions. Dr. David L. G. Noakes is an influential ethologist who did much foundational work related to illustrating how behavior was relevant to the management and conservation of wild fish. We pay tribute to the late Dr. Noakes by summarizing the relevance of animal behavior to fisheries management and conservation. To do so, we first consider what behavior has revealed about how fish respond to key threats such as habitat alteration and loss, invasive species, climate change, pollution, and exploitation. We then consider how behavior has informed the application of common management interventions such as protected areas and spatial planning, stock enhancement, and restoration of habitat and connectivity. Our synthesis focuses on the totality of the field but includes reflections on the specific contributions of Dr. Noakes. Themes emerging from his approach include the value of fundamental research, management-scale experiments, and bridging behavior, physiology, and ecology.

The four main methods to study fish movement are through observation and interception, electronic tracking, otolith chemistry and environmental DNA. We discuss the strengths and shortcomings of these methods and suggest effective management can be aided by combining these and other methods. Often the weaknesses of one technique can be met by the strengths of the others.

To investigate the nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) of predation on the ecotoxicity evaluation of antibiotics, the median lethal concentration (LC50), relative population growth rate (RGR), and activities of three antioxidases were measured in the ciliate Paramecium jenningsi exposed to graded concentrations of the antibiotics nitrofurazone (NFZ) or erythromycin (ERY) in the presence or absence of a predator, i.e., the ciliate Didinium nasutum. The results showed that (1) NCEs significantly reduced the LC50 of NFZ but had no effect on that of ERY; (2) predation pressure alone had no significant effect on the inhibitory rate of the P. jenningsi population, but the interaction with NFZ was synergistic, while that with CRY was additive; (3) the concentration[sbnd]response (i.e., mortality) model for each antibiotic exposure with and without predation pressure differed significantly in the parameter slope; (4) RGRs were significantly reduced by antibiotic exposure or NCEs; only in NFZ-exposed groups did the RGRs decrease linearly with increasing exposure concentration; and (5) the activities of all three antioxidases significantly increased due to NCEs or following exposure to antibiotics. In brief, NCEs were detected in P. jenningsi, and these had additive or synergistic effects on antibiotic ecotoxicity, but their magnitude depended on the properties and exposure concentrations of the antibiotics. Our findings suggest that it is necessary to consider the roles of NCEs in the ecotoxicity evaluation of environmental contaminants. © 2023 The Authors",,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114536,Prednisolone;Anti-Bacterial Agents,36634479,NA,predation risk affects the ecotoxicity evaluation of antibiotics population growth and antioxidase activity in the ciliate paramecium jenningsi

The advancements in the development of mass spectrometry and analytical methods during recent years have facilitated studies of pharmaceutical residues and wastes in the environment. Though early evidence of the waste generated by pharma industries that served as a source of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the environment was sporadic, these investigations received little attention at that time. In the late 1990s, the finding of oestrogens in sewage and wastewater as a cause of fish feminization triggered a surge of interest in pharmaceuticals in the environment, particularly the role of excreted medications. Following that, ecotoxicologists took an interest in pharmaceutical waste found in sewage effluents and rivers, which may have diverted attention away from potential alternate sources of pharmaceutical residues. The identification of diclofenac residues in cow carcasses as a cause of vulture population decline in India taught us that exposure routes are often not predictable. There are many more categories of drugs like antibiotics, analgesics, and their metabolites that cause serious harm to the environment and living beings. Therefore, it has been essential to diagnose and to study the pollution caused by pharma industry on a global level so that potential measures can be taken to minimize the problems caused by pharmaceutical waste. Therefore, steps can be taken to minimize their serious post effects and repercussions and potential strategies can be framed to cope with this global issue. © 2023 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This review synthesises recent research, which has observed sub-lethal effects, following pharmaceutical uptake by plants. Potential links between pharmaceutical mode of action and observed sub-lethal effects in the plant were then examined. Common receptors and biological pathways across species suggests a clear need to integrate plant cellular biology into our understanding of the impacts of pharmaceuticals on important plant functions and processes. To help prioritise future research efforts an analysis of shared mammalian and plant biochemical pathways was undertaken to identify classes of pharmaceuticals which may present a greater risk to key plant functions. These included sulfonylurea antihyperglycemics, steroids, opiods, antipsychotic phenothiazines and pharmaceuticals targeting several neurotransmitters shared between mammals and plants (including beta-blockers, antihistamines and benzodiazepines). Whilst a number of pharmaceutical induced sub-lethal effects have been observed, this review highlights the clear need to study a wider range of pharmaceuticals on a broader range of plant species, including cover crops and wild plants, under realistic exposure scenarios, to fully understand the wider implications of pharmaceutical exposure in agro-ecosystems. State-of-the art omics-techniques offer great potential to understand the mode of action of pharmaceuticals in plants and elucidate links between the pharmaceutical intended mode of action and observed plant effects.

We collected wings from 39 ducks harvested by recreational hunters at two sites (one coastal, one inland) in Victoria, southeastern Australia, in 2021. We examined three groups of POPs: nine congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 13 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and 12 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The PCBs, OCPs, and PAHs were detected at quantifiable levels in 13%, 72%, and 100% of birds, respectively. Of the congeners we tested for in PCBs, OCPs, and PAHs, 33%, 38%, and 100% were detected at quantifiable levels, respectively. The highest levels of exposure to POPs that we found were to the PAH benzo[b]fluoranthene, occurring at a concentration range of 1.78 to 161.05 ng/g wet weight. There were some trends detected relating to differences between geographical sites, with higher levels of several PAHs at the coastal versus inland site. There were several strong, positive associations among PAHs found. We discuss potential sources for the POPs detected, including industrial and agricultural sources, and the likely role of large-scale forest fires in PAH levels.

Although this topic is increasingly discussed in the recent scientific literature, there is still a substantial gap between most ecotoxicological studies and a solid evaluation of potential ecotoxicological consequences on ecosystem services. This was recently highlighted by a collective scientific assessment (CSA) performed by 46 scientific experts who analyzed the international science on the impacts of PPPs on biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and ecosystem services. Here, we first point out the main obstacles to better linking knowledge on the ecotoxicological effects of PPPs on biodiversity and ecological processes with ecosystem functions and services. Then, we go on to propose and discuss possible pathways for related improvements. We describe the main processes governing the relationships between biodiversity, ecological processes, and ecosystem functions in response to effects of PPP, and we define categories of ecosystem functions that could be directly linked with the ecological processes used as functional endpoints in investigations on the ecotoxicology of PPPs. We then explore perceptions on the possible links between these categories of ecosystem functions and ecosystem services among a sub-panel of the scientific experts from various fields of environmental science. We find that these direct and indirect linkages still need clarification. This paper, which reflects the difficulties faced by the multidisciplinary group of researchers involved in the CSA, suggests that the current gap between most ecotoxicological studies and a solid potential evaluation of ecotoxicological consequences on ecosystem services could be partially addressed if concepts and definitions related to ecological processes, ecosystem functions, and ecosystem services were more widely accepted and shared within the ecotoxicology community. Narrowing this gap would help harmonize and extend the science that informs decision-making and policy-making, and ultimately help to better address the trade-off between social benefits and environmental losses caused by the use of PPPs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s11356-023-29128-x,,NA,NA,linking ecotoxicological effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functions to impairment of ecosystem services is a challenge an illustration with the case of plant protection products

In plants, all compounds and several of their metabolites were found in the leaves, indicating the mobility and transformation of the compounds within the plant systems. Factors that control the compounds mobility in plants were found to be the pH of soils and the xylem flow. As for fish, many of the compounds were found in the brain and muscles of fish, some of which, depending on the species, affected the behaviour of the fish.

However, research tends to focus on a few model species, which limits possibilities of extrapolating and predicting toxicological effects and adverse outcomes at the population and ecosystem level. In this regard, it is recommended to assess critical species-specific behavioral responses in taxa playing key roles in trophic food webs, such as cephalopods. These latter, known as masters of camouflage, display rapid physiological color changes to conceal themselves and adapt to their surrounding environments. The efficiency of this process depends on visual abilities and acuity, information processing, and control of chromatophores dynamics through nervous and hormonal regulation with which many contaminants can interfere. Therefore, the quantitative measurement of color change in cephalopod species could be developed as a powerful endpoint for toxicological risk assessment.

Many facilities are set up to reduce the transfer of pesticides from agricultural parcels into the environment, thereby preventing their input into water bodies. Artificial ponds collecting runoff and erosion fluxes represent a complementary tool for mitigating pesticide transfer. Ponds are free-water surface constructed wetlands, rarely dry out, and do not exceed 2 m in depth. Their main compartments include a water column, a sediment layer, living organisms, and suspended particles. The dissipation potential of ponds is due to a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes that pesticides undergo in an interplay between different pond compartments. Although many studies on the dissipation potential of ponds focus on nitrates and suspended sediments, very little is known about the behavior of pesticides. Also, most studies evaluate a process individually without emphasizing its eventual interaction with other processes. Few papers address and compare mathematical formulations of pesticide transfer and transformation processes for artificial pond modeling. In this review, we investigate the interactions and contribution of multiple processes to artificial pond dissipation function by comparing their rates evaluated at different scales. We also discuss the mathematical formulations of these processes and their relationship with pesticide properties. Our evaluation suggests that quantifying the contribution of each process to pesticide dissipation in artificial ponds is an important tool for the hierarchization of dissipation processes. We believe that quantification and hierarchization may improve the estimation of overall artificial pond efficiency. We anticipate this work to be the basis for developing a process-based model of pesticide fate in artificial ponds.

Nocturnally migrating birds are attracted to ALAN during migration and if ALAN occurs in unison with ATC, the chances of ground-level ATC contamination occurring at stopover sites could increase. Here, we document the relationship between ALAN and ATC within the contiguous United States based on 479 toxic chemicals from 15,743 releasing facilities. Using weekly diurnal estimates of relative abundance for 165 nocturnally migrating passerine (NMP) bird species, we assess how the species richness and relative abundance of NMP species are correlated with ALAN and ATC across the annual cycle. The concentration of ATC increased with increasing ALAN levels, except at the highest ALAN levels. The species richness of NMP species was positively correlated with ATC during the non-breeding season and migration, and negatively correlated during the breeding season. The relative abundance of NMP species was negatively correlated with ATC during the breeding and non-breeding seasons and the correlation did not differ from zero during migration. Through the disorienting influence of ALAN, our findings suggest large numbers of NMP species are being exposed to higher ATC concentrations at stopover sites. Outside of migration, large numbers of NMP species that winter along the US Gulf Coast are being exposed for an extended period of time to higher ATC concentrations. Initiatives designed to decrease ALAN during migration have the potential to reduce the acute and chronic effects of ATC contamination, lower the maternal transfer of toxic chemicals to eggs, and decrease the biologically mediated transport of toxic chemicals across regions. However, these initiatives will not benefit species that experience prolonged ATC exposure during the non-breeding season along the US Gulf Coast, a region that could be a significant source of ATC contamination for North American birds. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,10.1111/gcb.16443,,36281768,NA,light pollution enhances groundlevel exposure to airborne toxic chemicals for nocturnally migrating passerines

Despite the reduced concentrations at which they are detected, their negative impact on natural biota constitutes a global concern. The consequences of pharmaceuticals’ presence in water sources and food have been evaluated with a higher detail for human health. However, although most of the pharmaceuticals detected in the environment had not been designed to act against microorganisms, it is of utmost importance to understand their impact on the environmental native microbiota. Microbial communities can suffer serious consequences from the presence of pharmaceuticals as pollutants in the environment, which may directly impact public health and ecosystem equilibrium. Among this class of pollutants, the ones that have been studied in more detail are antibiotics. This work aims to provide an overview of the impacts of different pharmaceuticals on environmental biofilms, more specifically in biofilms from aquatic ecosystems and engineered water systems. The alterations caused in the biofilm function and characteristics, as well as bacteria antimicrobial tolerance and consequently the associated risks for public health, are also reviewed.

Over the past century, mosquito control has mostly relied on neurotoxic chemicals—such as pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, chlorinated hydrocarbons, carbamates and organophosphates—that target adults. However, their persistent use has selected for insecticide resistance. This has led to the application of progressively higher amounts of insecticides—known as the pesticide treadmill—and negative consequences for ecosystems. Comparatively less attention has been paid to larvae, even though larval death eliminates a mosquito’s potential to transmit disease and reproduce. Larvae have been targeted by source reduction, biological control, growth regulators and neurotoxins, but hurdles remain. Here, we review methods of mosquito control and argue that photoactive molecules that target larvae—called photosensitive insecticides or PSIs—are an environmentally friendly addition to our mosquitocidal arsenal. PSIs are ingested by larvae and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) when activated by light. ROS then damage macromolecules resulting in larval death. PSIs are degraded by light, eliminating environmental accumulation. Moreover, PSIs only harm small translucent organisms, and their broad mechanism of action that relies on oxidative damage means that resistance is less likely to evolve. Therefore, PSIs are a promising alternative for controlling mosquitoes in an environmentally sustainable manner. © 2022 by the authors.",,10.3390/insects13121093,Pesticides;Photosensitivity Disorders;Culicidae;Photosensitizing Agents;Insecticides,NA,NA,chemical control of mosquitoes and the pesticide treadmill a case for photosensitive insecticides as larvicides

We found that sediment interstitial water (porewater) was toxic to urchin embryos at 22 of 25 sites.

These challenges do not influence species or populations to the same extent and therefore a comprehensive evaluation of organismal health is needed to determine their ultimate impact. Evidence suggests that telomeres (the terminal chromosomal regions) are sensitive to environmental conditions and have been posited as a surrogate for animal health and fitness. Evaluation of their use in an applied ecological context is still scarce. Here, using information from molecular and occupational biomedical studies, we aim to provide ecologists and evolutionary biologists with an accessible synthesis of the links between human disturbances and telomere length. In addition, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on studies measuring telomere length in wild/wild-derived animals facing anthropogenic disturbances. Despite the relatively small number of studies to date, our meta-analysis revealed a significant small negative association between disturbances and telomere length (−0.092 [−0.153, −0.031]; n = 28; k = 159). Yet, our systematic review suggests that the use of telomeres as a biomarker to understand the anthropogenic impact on wildlife is limited. We propose some research avenues that will help to broadly evaluate their suitability: (i) further causal studies on the link between human disturbances and telomeres; (ii) investigating the organismal implications, in terms of fitness and performance, of a given telomere length in anthropogenically disturbed scenarios; and (iii) better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of telomere dynamics.

Although ammonia is a potent neurotoxin, how sublethal concentrations of ammonia influence the central nervous system (CNS) and the complex behaviors of fish is still unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that acute sublethal ammonia exposure can change social behavior of adult zebrafish. The exposure to 90 mg /L of (NH4+) for 4 h induced a strong fear response and lower shoaling cohesion; exposure to 180 mg /L of (NH4+) for 4 h reduced the aggressiveness, and social recognition, while the anxiety, social preference, learning, and short-term memory were not affected. Messenger RNA expressions of glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase in the brain were induced, suggesting that ammonia exposure altered glutamate neurotransmitters in the CNS. Our findings in zebrafish provided delicate information of ammonia neurotoxicity in complex higher-order social behaviors, which has not been revealed previously.

Agricultural activities, including the use of hormonal growth promotants (HGPs), are a major source of EDC contamination. One potent EDC that enters into the environment through the use of HGPs is 17β-trenbolone. Despite EDCs being repeatedly shown to affect reproduction and development, comparatively little is known regarding their effects on behaviour. Amphibians, one of the most imperilled vertebrate taxa globally, are at particular risk of exposure to such pollutants as they often live and breed near agricultural operations. Yet, no previous research on amphibians has explored the effects of 17β-trenbolone exposure on foraging or antipredator behaviour, both of which are key fitness-related behavioural traits. Accordingly, we investigated the impacts of 28-day exposure to two environmentally realistic concentrations of 17β-trenbolone (average measured concentrations: 10 and 66 ng/L) on the behaviour and growth of spotted marsh frog tadpoles (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis). Contrary to our predictions, there was no significant effect of 17β-trenbolone exposure on tadpole growth, antipredator response, anxiety-like behaviour, or foraging. We hypothesise that the differences in effects found between this study and those conducted on fish may be due to taxonomic differences and/or the life stage of the animals used, and suggest further research is needed to investigate the potential for delayed manifestation of the effects of 17β-trenbolone exposure. © 2022",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106289,,36087492,NA,effects of the agricultural pollutant 17βtrenbolone on morphology and behaviour of tadpoles limnodynastes tasmaniensis

AMPA induces various adverse effects on aquatic wildlife, including selective mortality, which suggests that glyphosate exposure may have selected for AMPA-resistant individuals. We tested this hypothesis using spined toads (Bufo spinosus), an amphibian found in a variety of habitats, from AMPA-exposed agricultural lands to AMPA-free forested areas. We predicted that the offspring of individuals originating from agricultural habitats would develop AMPA-resistance - and be less prone to develop adverse effects from- AMPA exposure. To investigate this question, we performed a common garden brood-rearing experiment. The embryos and larvae of 40 spined toad pairs captured in agricultural and forest ponds were exposed either to an environmental relevant concentration of AMPA (0.4 μg L−1) or to control conditions (n = 8160 embryos, n = 240 tadpoles). We monitored development durations, developmental abnormalities and morphology, measured across key developmental stages. Although we observed significant effects of AMPA on fitness parameters in each group, these effects were not exacerbated in individuals from AMPA-free habitats. We suggest that temporal and/or spatial dynamics of contamination, as well as gene flow between exposed and preserved populations, may hinder adaptive divergence between populations.

Movement behavior of zebrafish (Danio rerio) was analysed according to different sizes of observation arena (four sizes: 5x5cm2, 10x10cm2, 15x15cm2 and 30x30 cm2). The observation arena was separated into corner, boundary and central areas based on experimental data. The results showed that the shapes of the corner, boundary and central areas were accordingly different in different sizes of the arena. Individuals stayed in the boundary zone for a substantial proportion (approximately 55 - 58 %) of the observation period while in the corner zone they stayed for the shortest time period (approximately 12-14 %). Movement parameters (speed, acceleration, etc.) of each individual varied in different areas on different sizes and speed was highest in the size of 15x15cm2 while acceleration was highest in the size of 30x30cm2. These reveal that the movement behaviors of zebrafish were affected by different sizes of arenas, at larger sizes they move more actively compared to smaller sizes. However, Transition probability matrices (TPMs) of moving between different areas in the observation were stable. These findings imply that there is a stereotypic inner state that maintains basic behaviors in animals.

In Rwanda, the increasing industrial activities have resulted in a new pollution problem due to the unabated release of untreated and incompletely treated industrial wastewater into the environment, causing high pollution loads in the receiving water bodies and the ecological environment. Kigali Special Economic Zone (KSEZ) is an industrial hub with over 60 industries. Except fo a handful of separate studies on industrial effluent a decade ago, no water pollution study was conducted after the hub formation. The present study aims to investigate the pollution impacts of wastewater effluents from selected industries in KSEZ and the main wastewater discharge channel (MWDC). Wastewater samples were collected weekly for three months (from February to March 2019) and analysed using standard instruments and laboratory procedures for selected water quality parameters. The results revealed that wastewater effluents from KSEZ comprise various hazardous pollutants beyond the maximum permissible limit of the Rwandan industrial effluent discharge standard and the World Health Organization maximum allowable limit for wastewater reuse for irrigation. The pH of the wastewater ranges from acidic to neutral (4.3–6.7), and there were drastic variations in electrical conductivity (EC) (394–1205.6 μS/cm), biological oxygen demand (BOD5) (77.5–237.6 mg/L), chemical oxygen demand COD (240.5–735.6 mg/L), phosphate (2.6–6.1 mg/L), nitrate (1.01–3.2 mg/L), and the heavy metals including Cu+2 (0.20–9.40 mg/L), Pb+2(0.30–1.35 mg/L), Mn+2(0.065–1.10 mg/L) and Zn+2 (4.55–5.95 mg/L).

Biotic and abiotic urban conditions can influence an individual's success in pre- and post-copulatory mating, for example through impacts on mate attraction and mate preference, fertilisation success, resource competition or rival interactions. Divergent sexual selection pressures can lead to differences in behavioural, physiological, morphological or life-history traits between urban and non-urban populations, ultimately driving adaptation and speciation. Most studies on urban sexual selection and mating interactions report differences between urban and non-urban populations or correlations between sexual traits and factors associated with increased urbanisation, such as pollution, food availability and risk of predation and parasitism. Here we review the literature on sexual selection and sexual traits in relation to urbanisation or urban-associated conditions. We provide an extensive list of abiotic and biotic factors that can influence processes involved in mating interactions, such as signal production and transmission, mate choice and mating opportunities. We discuss all relevant data through the lens of two, non-mutually exclusive theories on sexual selection, namely indicator and sensory models. Where possible, we indicate whether these models provide the same or different predictions regarding urban-adapted sexual signals and describe different experimental designs that can be useful for the different models as well as to investigate the drivers of sexual selection.

We measured horn size, condition dependence (i.e. size-corrected body mass) and allometry, besides abundance and sexual size dimorphism in three species: Copris incertus, Euoniticellus intermedius and Digitonthophagus gazella. In contrary to our expectations, horn size was independent of contamination and individual condition. However, strong positive allometric relationships were reduced by herbicide contamination for C. incertus and D. gazella and were increased by ivermectin for C. incertus, revealing differential investment in horn production according to body size in contaminated habitats. At the population level, large-horned C. incertus males were more abundant in contaminated pastures, potentially revealing a case of evolutionary rescue by sexual selection or a plastic response to higher population densities. Finally, chemical compounds affected the sexual size dimorphism of all three species, with potential effects on female fecundity or intrasexual selection.

Doves were fed with test food (untreated and neonicotinoid-treated sorghum, soybean or soybean cotyledons) and maintenance food (seed mix) for 3–5 days to study the repellency (primary repellency and conditioned aversion) and anorexia caused by neonicotinoid-treated food, followed by a 7-day period on maintenance food to study the persistence of the anorexic effect after neonicotinoid exposure. Immediately afterward, the same doves were exposed to treated test food during a second period of 3–5 days to study the potential reinforcement of food avoidance. Finally, doves were fed with untreated test food to test the capacity of the pesticide to induce conditioned food aversion against untreated food in subsequent encounters.

Finally, we characterized the uptake/depuration pharmacokinetics of oxazepam in snail tissues across time, which revealed that the snails reach a steady state equilibrium in < 8 hours of exposure and depurate at a similar rate. Overall, our study suggests that snails such as M. tuberculata, due to their behavioural resilience and high bioconcentration potential, could act as vectors for pharmaceutical transfer throughout the food web in pharmaceutical-polluted habitats (e.g., wastewater outfalls). © 2022",,10.1016/j.envadv.2022.100187,Oxazepam,NA,NA,uptake depuration and behavioural effects of oxazepam on activity and foraging in a tropical snail melanoides tuberculata

They are an instrumental tool for sustainable development and to reduce the impact of large-scale industrial projects on biodiversity. The accurate assessment of the effects of projects on wildlife populations has a variety of ecological, cultural, and economic implications. However, assessments are commonly done using indirect indicators such as the predicted impact of changes in the quantity and quality of wildlife habitat and (or) predicted changes in nonspecific wildlife population metrics (e.g., relative abundance). In recent decades, the interpretation of wildlife health has moved from the classical dichotomous state of “disease presence/absence” to a broader concept that integrates the interaction of biological, social, and environmental health determinants. We sought to determine how wildlife health metrics are used in EIA processes and propose a framework to characterize, quantify, and monitor wildlife health in future EIAs. First, we performed a targeted review of EIA documents from three jurisdictions in Canada to characterize the relevance and use of “wildlife health” in these documents. Then, we reviewed case studies and research examples to understand wildlife health in different contexts associated with conservation biology to propose a framework to incorporate wildlife health into baseline monitoring and mitigation processes in EIAs. Our targeted review illustrates that while wildlife health and related terminology is often invoked in the main and specific objectives of EIAs, it is rarely tracked and quantified in EIAs and related processes. We identified approaches that can be used to effectively incorporate wildlife health in EIAs, including contextspecific wildlife health metrics, participatory epidemiology, community-based sampling, and local ecological knowledge. We illustrate case studies where wildlife health can facilitate the inclusion of communities, Indigenous governments, and local ecological knowledge into the evaluation process of projects and developments and into comanagement practices of wildlife. Our work highlights the critical need to move towards incorporating wildlife health into EIA processes to provide a more direct and holistic perspective on the potential environmental impacts and improve the opportunities for early implementation of mitigation measurements. © 2022, Canadian Science Publishing.

We examined the transfer pathways of chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) through a terrestrial trophic web and investigated the potential for their bioaccumulation along the trophic chain. Soil, plants, arthropods, and vertebrates were sampled from different localities in the south of Cairo (El-Tebbin, Egypt) and the amounts of Cr and Ni from these samples were measured. We also computed a body condition index (BCI) for vertebrates to estimate individual health and fitness levels in relation to heavy metal concentrations in the liver. The levels of Cr and Ni varied significantly among the samples. Lower trophic levels showed a tendency for biomagnification, while higher trophic levels showed possible biodilution of the two heavy metals: arthropods, amphibians, and lizards concentrated more Cr and Ni than the other taxonomic groups; conversely birds and small mammals generally showed lower levels of Cr and Ni. A negative relationship was obtained when the concentrations of Cr in the soil, plant, and arthropods, and the concentrations of Ni in the wolf spider were plotted as a function of the distance to the industrial area. A significant inverse relationship was found between the Ni concentration of liver and body length, while body mass had no significant effect. Our study thus highlights the varied effects of heavy metal concentrations across a complex food web at different distances from the pollution source, and the need for further studies of their effect on multiple species in an ecosystem. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.115748,"Metals, Heavy;Food",NA,NA,trophic transfer of heavy metals along a pollution gradient in a terrestrial agroindustrial food web

Even though wastewater effluent is discharged continuously all year long, its impacts across seasons, specifically during winter, have largely been neglected in ecotoxicological research. Seasonal differences are of particular interest, as temperature-driven metabolic changes in aquatic organisms can significantly alter their ability to respond to chemical stressors. In this study, we examined the effects of multiple levels of wastewater effluent exposure (0, 25, or 50% treated effluent) on the physiological and behavioural responses of adult fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) at temperatures simulating either summer (20 °C) or winter (4 °C) conditions. At 20 °C, wastewater exposure posed a metabolic cost to fish, demonstrated by higher standard metabolic rate and was associated with increased haematocrit and a reduction in boldness. In contrast, fish exposed to wastewater at 4 °C experienced no change in metabolic rate but performed fewer social interactions with their conspecifics. Taken together, our results demonstrate that wastewater exposure can lead to metabolic and behavioural disruptions, and such disruptions vary in magnitude and direction depending on temperature.

Yet, how heavy metal pollution influences the impacts of predatory fish on ecosystem structure is unknown. This study was conducted in the Osor stream (Spain), which features a metal (mainly Zn) pollution gradient. We aimed to determine how the responses of benthic communities to the presence and absence of predatory fish interact with environmental stress and to test whether the top-down control of top predators is context dependent. To address these questions, periphyton biomass and macroinvertebrate densities were determined throughout an exclosure/enclosure mesocosm experiment using the Mediterranean barbel (Barbus meridionalis) as a top predator. The monitoring study showed that metal accumulation in periphyton and macroinvertebrates reflected patterns observed in water. The mesocosm study showed that fish predation effects on larval chironomids were not context-dependent and that periphyton biomass was markedly lower in the presence of fish regardless of metal pollution levels. This strong top-down control on periphytic algae was attributed to the foraging behaviour of fish causing bioturbation. In contrast, the top predator removal revealed grazer-periphyton interactions, which were mediated by heavy metal pollution. That is, periphyton benefitted from a lower grazing pressure in the metal-polluted sites. Together, our results suggest that the top–down control by fishes depends more on functional traits (e.g. feeding behaviour) than on feeding guild, and demonstrate the capacity of top predators to modify anthropogenic stressor effects on stream food-web structure. © 2022, The Author(s).",,10.1007/s00027-022-00849-4,"Metals, Heavy",NA,NA,response of stream ecosystem structure to heavy metal pollution contextdependency of topdown control by fish

Chlorella sp. was interacted with pristine TiO2 NPs (0.05, 05, and 5 mg/L), TC (0.5 mg/L), and their combinations for 48 h. The toxicity induced in Chlorella sp. by pristine TiO2 NPs through oxidative stress and chloroplast damage was not significantly changed in the presence of TC. Principal component analysis for the toxicity parameters revealed a strong association between growth inhibition and adsorption/internalization. In the second trophic level (A. salina), the waterborne exposure of TC additively increased the toxicity of TiO2 NPs. Both adsorption and degradation played a major role in the removal of TC from the suspension, resulting in additive toxic effects in both Chlorella sp. and A. salina. Compared to the waterborne exposure, the foodborne exposure of TiO2 NPs and TC induced lesser toxic effects owing to reduced uptake and accumulation in A. salina.

The European Water Framework Directive sets out that risk assessment should be performed at the catchment level, crossing borders where needed. The present study defines ecological risk profiles for surface water concentrations of 8 APIs (carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, cyclophosphamide, diclofenac, erythromycin, 17α-ethinylestradiol, metformin, and metoprolol) in the Vecht River, a transboundary river that crosses several German and Dutch regions. Ultimately, 3 main goals were achieved: 1) the geo-referenced estimation of API concentrations in surface water using the geography-referenced regional exposure assessment tool for European rivers; 2) the derivation of new predicted-no-effect concentrations for 7 of the studied APIs, of which 3 were lower than previously derived values; and 3) the creation of detailed spatially explicit ecological risk profiles of APIs under 2 distinct water flow scenarios.

Top predators—as bioindicators—can be used to assess and monitor the health of these ecosystems. We measured eight health parameters (e.g., parasites, wounds and scars, tail loss and body condition) in a wetland top predator, the western tiger snake, Notechis scutatus occidentalis. For three years, snakes were sampled across four wetlands along an urban gradient. For each site, we used GIS software to measure the area of different landscapes and calculate an urbanisation–landscape score. Previously published research on snake contamination informed our calculations of a metal-pollution index for each site. We used generalised linear mixed models to assess the relationship between all health parameters and site variables. We found the metal-pollution index to have the most significant association with poor body condition. Although parasitism, tail loss and wounds differed among sites, none of these parameters influenced body condition.

A decrease in quality of habitats associated with preference for these over other available higher quality is referred as ecological trap. In 2015, the Fundão dam containing iron mining tailings, eastern Brazil, collapsed and released about 50 million cubic meters of metal-rich mud composed by Fe, As, Cd, Hg, Pb in three rivers and the adjacent continental shelf. The area is a foraging site for dozens of seabird and shorebird species. In this study, we used a dataset from before and after Fundão dam collapse containing information on at-sea distribution during foraging activities (biologging), dietary aspects (stable isotopes), and trace elements concentration in feathers and blood from three seabird species known to use the area as foraging site: Phaethon aethereus, Sula leucogaster, and Pterodroma arminjoniana. In general, a substantial change in foraging strategies was not detected, as seabirds remain using areas and food resources similar to those used before the dam collapse. However, concentration of non-essential elements increased (e.g., Cd and As) while essential elements decreased (e.g., Mn and Zn), suggesting that the prey are contaminated by trace elements from tailings. This scenario represents evidence of an ecological trap as seabirds did not change habitat use, even though it had its quality reduced by contamination.

Residues of the NSAID diclofenac in cattle carcasses caused widespread mortality and catastrophic population declines in three species of Gyps vulture during the 1990s and 2000s. Diclofenac is now banned, but other NSAIDs are used in its place. Different lines of evidence, including safety testing in Gyps vultures, have shown that some of these other NSAIDs are toxic, or probably toxic, to vultures. The NSAID nimesulide is widely available and commonly used, and has been found in dead vultures with signs of renal failure (i.e. visceral gout) and without the presence of diclofenac and/or other vulture-toxic NSAIDs. Nimesulide is therefore probably toxic to vultures. Here, we report safety testing of nimesulide in Gyps vultures. In a controlled toxicity experiment, we gave two vultures the maximum likely exposure (MLE) of nimesulide calculated from initial pharmacokinetic and residue experiments in cattle. Two other control birds were given an oral dose of water.

Following the Deepwater Horizon (DwH) oil spill disaster of the northern Gulf of Mexico (USA), numerous ecotoxicological studies showed severe species-level impacts of oil exposure on estuarine fish and invertebrates, yet post-spill surveys found little evidence for severe impacts to coastal populations, communities, or food webs. The acknowledgement that several confounding factors may have limited researchers' abilities to detect negative ecosystem-level impacts following the DwH spill drives the need for direct testing of weathered oil exposure effects on estuarine residents with high trophic connectivity. Here, we describe an experiment that examined the influence of previous exposure to four weathered oil concentrations (control: 0.0 L oil m−2; low: 0.1 L oil m−2; moderate: 0.5-1 L oil m−2; high: 3.0 L oil m−2) on foraging rates of the ecologically important Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis). Following exposure in oiled saltmarsh mesocosms, killifish were allowed to forage on grass shrimp (Palaeomonetes pugio) for up to 21 h. We found that previous exposure to the high oil treatment reduced killifish foraging rate by ~37% on average, compared with no oil control treatment. Previous exposure to the moderate oil treatment showed highly variable foraging rate responses, while low exposure treatment was similar to unexposed responses. Declining foraging rate responses to previous high weathered oil exposure suggests potential oil spill influence on energy transfer between saltmarsh and off-marsh systems. Additionally, foraging rate variability at the moderate level highlights the large degree of intraspecific variability for this sublethal response and indicates this concentration represents a potential threshold of oil exposure influence on killifish foraging. We also found that consumption of gravid vs non-gravid shrimp was not independent of prior oil exposure concentration, as high oil exposure treatment killifish consumed ~3× more gravid shrimp than expected. Our study findings highlight the sublethal effects of prior oil exposure on foraging abilities of ecologically valuable Gulf killifish at realistic oil exposure levels, suggesting that important trophic transfers of energy to off-marsh systems may have been impacted, at least in the short-term, by shoreline oiling at highly localized scales. This study provides support for further experimental testing of oil exposure effects on sublethal behavioral impacts of ecologically important estuarine species, due to the likelihood that some ecological ramifications of DwH on saltmarshes likely went undetected.

These changes can have dramatic impacts, both positive and negative, on the health of wildlife. Predicting the effect of urbanization on wildlife health is challenging. While some wildlife species thrive in urban areas, others are less tolerant, and urbanization is often associated with a loss of native species and declines in species richness. Populations of synanthropic species that live in urban areas often reach very high densities as a result of abundant, stable anthropogenic resources. However, the health of these animals may be negatively impacted by urbanization as a result of increased exposure to pollution/contaminants, poor quality food resources, and increased exposure to some pathogens in urban areas. Increased transmission of pathogens to vulnerable wildlife hosts or to humans in urban areas is of particular concern. Increased human population densities and changing human perceptions of wildlife in urban areas can lead to increasing human-wildlife conflicts that require careful management to protect both human and wildlife health. As urbanization increases globally, further research is required to reveal patterns and processes affecting urban wildlife health throughout the world. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature.Switzerland AG 2022.",,10.1007/978-3-030-90510-1_12,,NA,NA,urbanization

When environment or human health damage have occurred, the recovery processes could be impossible or very expensive. Using sensing systems such as sensors, biosensors, or nanobiosensors and biochemical responses such as biomarkers or genes are required for the development of control and precautional strategies. Environmental risk assessment (ERA) investigates the environmental risks and informs about handling of these risks. Subtitles of ERA are hazard identification, risk assessment, risk management, risk communication and monitoring, and feedback. These are all interpreted as main sustainability concepts. Risk assessment and management policies include quantitative and qualitative anal-ysis of potential and/or specific chemical and/or biological pollutants. Accurate, fast analysis methods are required for the detection of these environmental pollu-tants. Biosensors can be used for analysis of these substances since biosensors are portable, have low cost, and can be tailored according to specific needs. They can also be combined with nanomaterials for increasing surface area and for enhancing specificity and selectivity. They have the potential to detect analytes at very low concentrations in a solution. These technical improvements can be applied to detect infections, medicines, heavy metals, and other contaminants that have yet to be discovered. Thus, nanobiosensors are perfect tools for hazard identification and envi-ronmental monitoring.

Many more industry and regulatory scientists are aware of this technique and what it can offer, but it is still not a routine approach for environmental monitoring/assessment or chemical regulation. More attention to the robustness and reproducibility of results and strategies for effective use in a regulatory context is still required, but environmental metabolomics is no longer merely an experimental technique restricted to research laboratories. Instead, it is a rapidly maturing bioanalytical technique with clear applications in the environmental field. These applications are likely to grow into the future. However, how can we move the science forward? Where might it find more use? What might the future hold in terms of applications and technological development?

In the Neotropics, the political organization of the territory, the complex socio-economic context, and the environmental heterogeneity impose additional challenges to the use of genetics for wildlife conservation. Here we present an assessment of the state-of-the-art on the conservation genetics of the giant anteater, as a study case. We use this species to discuss key wildlife threats and challenges along nine major Neotropical biomes. We review the main scientific research on the species, comprising and analyzing genetic data, and focusing on each biome and its region-specific threats. Our genetic meta-analysis reveals low levels of genetic diversity for the species, signs of population differentiation and dissimilar demographic trends per biome. Large-scale investigations are needed to disclose between hypotheses of panmixia, population structure and local adaptation, and to better assess the species demography. The limited information available for a known Vulnerable species perfectly illustrates the need for greater and internationally concerted investment in genetic/genomic research in the Neotropics.

A video tracking analysis after 24 h and 48 h of exposure allowed us to evaluate different behavioural responses (distance moved, average velocity, active time, and average acceleration). The results indicate that BSRs are sensitive indicators of sub-lethal stress. Highly concentration-and time-response changes for both compounds were observed during the experiments. In particular, in the first 24 h of exposure, both compounds elicited a similar decreasing trend in swimming behaviour, in which CPF induced the highest decline. Further, hypoactivity was associated with the narcotic effects of both compounds. Conversely, after 48 h of exposure, we observed an increasing tendency in the swimming parameters, particularly at the highest tested concentrations. However, the compounds did not exhibit the same trend. Rather, CPF-m induced high variations from the control groups. This reversal trend could be due to the activation of compensatory mechanisms, such as feeding, searching, or avoidance behaviours. These results suggest that BSRs are measurable active responses of organisms, which are controlled by time. se only © 2022, Page Press Publications.

Other valuable benefits of fish and aquatic ecosystems include recreational boating, sport fishing, swimming, and relaxation. Many types of organic and inorganic contaminants such as plastics, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and metals are released by humans into the environment, both aquatic and terrestrial. Contaminants from agricultural activities, such as pesticides, are very toxic to nontarget organisms, including fish. These pesticides impair the metabolism of fish and may even cause death. With the increase in the human population, new problems have arisen, such as the greater pace of industrialization, wastewater disposal and industrial resource issues, abandoned military installations, and contaminants from urban areas directly or indirectly being released into bodies of water. Aquatic ecosystems are at much higher risk due to the additional toxins being released. Heavy metals and pesticides cause toxicity and many diseases in fish due to aquatic pollution. Furthermore, increasing pollution of groundwater and surface water from a variety of industrial, municipal, and agricultural sources has additionally tainted water quality in these sources, effectively reducing the supply of freshwater for human use. The persistent toxicity and the ability of higher concentrations of heavy metals, metalloids, and pesticides to accumulate in water and sediment allow them to become severe poisons for all living organisms.

We review and outline steps that can be taken to improve accuracy in the estimation of the number of birds affected in each of three phases: (1) pre-planning; (2) during a response; and (3) post-response. The more pre-planning undertaken, the more robust the estimates will be. Personnel involved in damage assessment efforts must have training in quantitative biology and need support during all three phases. The main approaches currently used to estimate the number of birds affected include probability exposure models and carcass sampling — both onshore and on the water. Probability exposure models can be used in the post-incident phase, particularly in offshore scenarios where beached bird surveys are not possible, and requires three datasets: (1) at-sea bird densities; (2) bird mortality; and (3) the spill trajectory. Carcass sampling using beached bird surveys is appropriate if trajectories indicate affected birds will reach shore. Carcass sampling can also occur via on-water transects and may overlap with risk assessment efforts. Damage assessment efforts should include a measure of sublethal effects following the post-acute phase of spills, yet this area has significant knowledge gaps. We urge jurisdictions worldwide to improve pre-incident planning. We provide guidance on how, in the absence of pre-incident data, quality data can be obtained during or after an incident.

It is important to predict changes in organism health, given a known number of environmental factors and pollutant concentrations, in order to better manage contaminants through biomarker analysis. This study aims to examine the ecosystem health of the Brantas River based on its environmental condition and the hematology profile of Gambusia affinis fish present in the river. This species was chosen because of its wide distribution along the Brantas River, and because it is very tolerant, adaptable, highly abundant, and easy to catch. Methods: The study area included 10 sampling sites along the Brantas River watershed. In total, six water quality parameters were observed (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia concentration, and phenol concentration) and hematology measurements consisted of erythrocyte, leucocyte, and micronuclei analyses. Results: The results showed that the upstream area of Brantas River, located in Batu, was the least polluted region, while Mojokerto was the most polluted. The erythrocyte level of Gambusia affinis caught in most sampling sites was quite low. Furthermore, research revealed that the status of Gambusia affinis' hematological profile was significantly correlated (p<0.05) with water quality parameters, particularly DO, BOD, ammonia, and phenol. Conclusions: It can be concluded from these results that the hematological profile of the fish is poor due to high levels of organic waste and harmful substances. © 2022 Hertika AMS et al.",,10.12688/f1000research.74117.2,,NA,NA,effect of environmental factors on blood counts of gambusia affinis caught at brantas river watershed indonesia

However, the report also concluded that this need cannot be specified with existing data, but consideration must be made of local conditions. Two considerations are (1) the discharged amount of pharmaceutical into receiving water bodies and (2) the turnover of water in the recipient, where the highest risks are related to recipients with a low water turnover and low dilution. The current project comprised eight different WWTPs distributed throughout the entire County Skåne (Scania) in Sweden, with a population of ca. 1,300,000 persons. In total, 21 of 22 pharmaceuticals were analyzed according to the list proposed by the Swedish Medical Products Agency 2015. The results show that large amounts of pharmaceuticals are released from the WWTPs yearly to Scanian recipients. The total discharge of pharmaceuticals from the eight treatment plants adds up to 71 kg of these 21 substances alone, mainly comprising metoprolol, which is a drug that lowers blood pressure, and the analgesic drug diclofenac. Additionally, carbamazepine, losartan, naproxen and oxazepam were present in significant concentrations. These represented three illnesses that are very common: high blood pressure, inflammation/pain and depression/anxiety. The concentrations were generally in line with previous national Swedish screenings. It was estimated that, when one million cubic meters (1,000,000 m3 ) of wastewater is discharged, almost 4 kg of the 21 pharmaceuticals is released. The total volume wastewater release by the &gt;90 WWTPs in Scania was estimated to 152,887,000 m3, which corresponded to 590 kg/year. The investigated 21 drugs cover only a small part of many hundred pharmaceuticals that are in use in Sweden. Thus, most likely, one or several tons of pharmaceuticals leak out to the Scanian recipients annually. The analysis of river samples shows that the dilution of wastewater is a key parameter in reducing concentrations. However, some locations have remarkably high concentrations, which occur when the volume wastewater is large in relation to the flow in the river. These kinds of regional results are of importance when selecting where advanced treatment should be prioritized in a first instance, as requested by the Swedish EPA. © 2021 by the authors.

A multilevel biomarker approach was applied to assess the effects of a 48 h exposure of two freshwater mesoamerican fish species (Parachromis dovii and Poecilia gillii) to a mixture of sublethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos (5 μg/L) and difenoconazole (325 μg/L). Transcriptomic induction of cyp1A and the activities of 7-ethoxy-resorufin-O-distillase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were measured as biotransformation-related biomarkers; cholinesterase activity (ChE) was assessed as a neurotoxicity biomarker; resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured as a physiological biomarker; and the movement of fish in a dark–light environment as a behavior biomarker. The exposure to the mixture had evident effects on P. gillii, with significant induction of cyp1A transcription, increased EROD activity, ChE inhibition in muscle, and increased permanence in the light side of the dark–light environment. Meanwhile, P. dovii only showed significant induction of cyp1A, without evidence of neurotoxicity or changes in behavior. This study demonstrates that the severity of the effects caused by the exposure to a mixture of pesticides can differ among species from the same trophic chain.

Plant-microbe interactions are a class of species interactions on which ecosystems and agricultural systems depend, yet may be affected by multiple global change stressors. Here, we use duckweed and microbes from its microbiome to model responses of interacting plants and microbes to multiple stressors: climate change and tire wear particles. Climate change is occurring globally, and microplastic tire wear particles from roads now reach many ecosystems. We paired perpendicular gradients of temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) treatments with factorial manipulation of leachate from tire wear particles and duckweed microbiomes. We found that tire leachate and warmer temperatures enhanced duckweed and microbial growth, but caused effects of microbes on duckweed to become negative. However, induced negative effects of microbes were less than additive with warming and leachate. Without tire leachate, we observed that higher CO2 and temperature induced positive correlations between duckweed and microbial growth, which can strengthen mutualisms. In contrast, with tire leachate, growth correlations were never positive, and shifted negative at lower CO2, again suggesting leachate disrupts this plant-microbiome mutualism. In summary, our results demonstrate that multiple interacting stressors can affect multiple interacting species, and that leachate from tire wear particles could potentially disrupt plant-microbe mutualisms. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.envres.2021.111727,,34339696,NA,microplastics shift impacts of climate change on a plantmicrobe mutualism temperature co2 and tire wear particles

In this study, the individual and combined effects on the terrestrial earthworm E. fetida exposed to the anionic surfactant sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES) and the pesticides chlorpyrifos (CPF) and imidacloprid (IMI) were investigated, by using the avoidance behaviour as endpoint. Earthworms were exposed to a soil artificially contaminated with five sub-lethal concentrations of each contaminant, both as single substances and in combination of binary and ternary mixtures. Overall results showed that IMI provoked the highest avoidance effect on earthworms, with a concentration value that induced an avoidance rate of 50% of treated organisms (AC50) of 1.30 mg/kg, followed by CPF (AC50 75.26 mg/kg) and SLES (AC50 139.67 mg/kg). The application of the Combination Index (CI) method, indicated that a deviation from the additive response occurred for most of the tested chemical mixtures, leading to synergistic or antagonistic avoidance responses. Synergistic effects were produced by the exposure to the two lowest concentrations of the CPF+IMI mixture, and by the highest concentrations of SLES+CPF and SLES+CPF+IMI mixtures. On the contrary, antagonistic effects were observed at the lowest concentrations of the binary mixtures containing the SLES and at almost all the tested concentrations of the SLES+CPF+IMI mixture (with the exception of the highest tested concentration).

The social environment, however, represents the arena in which individual-level performance shapes group- or population-level outcomes and may therefore mediate many of the ultimate consequences of chemicals for wildlife. Here, we evaluated the role that the social environment plays in determining the consequences of pollutant exposure. We exposed groups of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) to an emerging pharmaceutical pollutant that is commonly detected in freshwaters (the benzodiazepine, oxazepam) and allowed them to form dominance hierarchies. Exposure affected dominant and subordinate fish differently, causing fish to become less aggressive at high doses and subordinate fish to become more competitively successful at low doses. These perturbations had further consequences for growth, fin damage, and survival. Exposure also modulated physiological stress in the hierarchy, and social status itself affected how much oxazepam was absorbed in tissues, potentially creating a dynamic feedback loop that further influences the asymmetric effects of exposure on differing social statuses. Many effects followed a “U-shaped” dose-response curve, highlighting the importance of nonlinear, low-dose effects. Altogether, we show that social structure in animal groups can interact with and modulate the effects of an environmental contaminant.

In recent years, scientists, environmental managers, and policymakers have been interested in using behavioural endpoints for chemical regulation, given their importance for fitness and survival. The body of research on whether and how pharmaceutical exposure alters the behaviour of aquatic animals has grown exponentially, making it difficult to get an overview of the results. With an international spotlight on the management of these environmental threats, synthesizing the currently available data is vital to inform managers and policymakers, as well as highlighting areas where more research is needed. This is a protocol for a systematic evidence map (SEM) and serves as an a priori record of our objectives and methodological decisions. Our objectives are to identify, catalogue, and present primary research articles on the effects of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals on aquatic animal behaviour. Methods: The literature search will be conducted using two electronic databases: Web of Science and Scopus, and we will supplement these searches with additional sources. The search string has been developed using a Population–Exposure–Comparison–Outcome (PECO) framework, to capture articles that used an aquatic organism (P, population) to test the effects of a pharmaceutical (E, exposure) on behaviour (O, outcome). Eligible articles must also have a control group (C, comparison). Articles will be screened in two stages, title and abstract, followed by full-text screening before data extraction. Decision trees have been designed a priori to appraise articles for eligibility at both stages of screening. At both stages, screening each article will be completed by two independent reviewers. Study validity will be appraised but not used as a basis for article inclusion. The information extracted from the eligible articles, along with bibliometric data, will be mapped and displayed. All data associated with this SEM will be publicly available through the Open Science Framework (OSF) and a future project webpage. © 2021, The Author(s).",,10.1186/s13750-021-00241-z,Animal Shells;Animals,NA,NA,evidence of the impacts of pharmaceuticals on aquatic animal behaviour a systematic map protocol

Ecologists commonly use current spatial relationships between species and environmental conditions to make predictions about the future. This assumes that species will track conditions by shifting their distributions. However, theory and experimental evidence suggest that species interactions prevent communities from predictably tracking temporal changes in environmental conditions on the basis of current spatial relationships between species and environmental gradients. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the dynamics of protist species in replicated two-patch microcosm landscapes that experienced different regimes of spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity (light vs. dark). Populations were kept in monocultures or polycultures to assess the effect of species interactions. In monocultures, abundances were predictable on the basis of current environmental conditions, regardless of whether the populations had experienced temporal environmental change. But in polycultures, abundances also depended on the history of the environmental conditions experienced. This suggests that because of species interactions, communities should respond differently to spatial versus temporal environmental changes. Thus, species interactions likely reduce the accuracy of predictions about future communities that are based on current spatial relationships between species and the environment. © 2021 The University of Chicago.

We review the evidence that the critical oxygen level, a measure of hypoxia tolerance, provides a valuable biomarker of impacts of diverse classes of contaminants. When coupled with measures of cardiorespiratory variables, it can provide insight into mechanisms of toxicity. The critical thermal maximum, a simple measure of tolerance of acute warming, also provides a valuable biomarker despite a lack of understanding of its mechanistic basis. Its relative ease of application renders it useful in the rapid evaluation of multiple species, and in understanding how the severity of contaminant impacts depends upon prevailing environmental temperature. The critical swimming speed is a measure of exercise performance that is widely used as a biomarker in temperate species but very few studies have been performed on subtropical or tropical fishes. Overall, the review serves to highlight a critical lack of knowledge for subtropical and tropical freshwater fishes.

We examined male reproductive behaviour by testing the time spent near a female behind a partition, as well as the number of copulation attempts made, and the time spent chasing a female in a free-swimming context. Sperm traits were also assayed for all males. We found that exposure of male fish to 17β-TB altered the relationship between key pre- and post-copulatory reproductive traits. Furthermore, 17β-TB-exposed males had, on average, a higher percentage of motile sperm, and performed fewer copulation attempts than unexposed males.

In England, the deterioration in pollution incident performance makes it important to investigate common trends that could be addressed to improve pollution management. This study presents the first external analysis of available national pollution incident data, obtained through Environmental Information Regulations 2004 requests to the English Environment Agency. The study aimed to assess and compare the pollution incident performance of water and sewerage companies in England. Results indicated that there were significant variations in numbers of pollution incidents reported and the severity of the impact on the water environment for different asset types (operational property). There were significant positive relationships between the self-reporting percentages and total numbers of reported pollution incidents per 10,000 km sewer length for pumping stations and sewage treatment works. These results indicate that in at least these asset types, an estimated 5% of pollution incidents could go unreported. Pollution events that go unreported can lead to more severe impacts to the water environment, so rapid and consistent reporting of incidents is crucial for limiting damage. The results have significance for the water industry internationally, because the issues presented here are not restricted to England. In the short-term, research should focus on investigating best practice and standardising reporting of pollution incidents, so that an accurate baseline of the number of pollution incidents occurring can be determined. © 2021 Purnell et al.

Heavy metals and other potentially toxic elements have accumulated in mountain areas via atmospheric transport. The influence of the daily range size of the European hare on its contamination by heavy metals was investigated in three habitat types (forest, woodland edge, meadow) in the Spišská Magura mountain range in the West Carpathians. Individual hares (n = 21) were traced and located by GPS following snowfall. Pair samples of their faeces (n = 64) and food (n = 64) were collected from feeding sites. The maps created were used for determination of the size of the daily range as being small or large. All hares that have a small daily range avoid meadows and open spaces due to the higher predation risk. However, individuals with a large daily range feed in all habitats, including meadows. Hares with a small daily range in a forest habitat ingested higher amounts of bio-elements Ca, Cr, S, and Mn as well as higher amounts of heavy metals Ba and Pb than hares with a large daily range. Moreover, dominant hares with a small daily range, with access to abundant food sources in a forest habitat, may gradually take on higher levels of bio-elements including heavy metals that are present in their food source. In contrast, in the woodland edge, hares with a small daily range had a smaller concentration of Ca, Cr, Mn, S, Ba, and Pb compared to hares with a large daily range.

Contamination by different chemical compounds, such as pesticides, is among the main causes of population decreases and species extinction. Insects are key for ecosystem maintenance; unfortunately, their populations are being drastically affected by human-derived distur-bances. Pesticides, applied in agricultural and urban environments, are capable of polluting soil and water sources, reaching non-target organisms (native and introduced). Pesticides alter insect’s development, physiology, and inheritance. Recently, a link between pesticide effects on insects and their epigenetic molecular mechanisms (EMMs) has been demonstrated. EMMs are capable of regulating gene expression without modifying genetic sequences, resulting in the expression of different stress responses as well as compensatory mechanisms. In this work, we review the main anthropogenic contaminants capable of affecting insect biology and of triggering EMMs. EMMs are involved in the development of several diseases in native insects affected by pesticides (e.g., anomalous teratogenic reactions). Additionally, EMMs also may allow for the survival of some species (mainly pests) under contamination-derived habitats; this may lead to biodiversity decline and further biotic homogeniza-tion. We illustrate these patterns by reviewing the effect of neonicotinoid insecticides, insect EMMs, and their ecological consequences. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the widespread use of these polyphenol oxidases is limited by elevated production costs and restricted knowledge on their spectrum of action. Here, six tyrosinase homologs were identified and characterized from the genomes of four widespread freshwater ciliates using bioinformatics. Next, we performed a virtual screening to calculate binding energies between 3D models of these homologs and ~ 1000 contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), as an indirect approach to identify likely and unlikely targets for tyrosinases. Many fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, illicit drugs, natural toxins, and pesticides exhibited strong binding energies to these new tyrosinases, suggesting the spectrum of targets of these enzymes might be considerably broader than previously thought. Many ciliates, including those carrying tyrosinase genes, are fast-growing unicellular microeukaryotes that can be efficiently cultured, at large scales, under in vitro conditions, suggesting these organisms should be regarded as potential low-cost sources of new environmental biotechnological molecules. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,10.1002/prot.26139,,33969540,NA,new tyrosinases with putative action against contaminants of emerging concern

Before harvesting, sugarcane is burned to facilitate manual cutting, generating ashes that may reach water bodies and cause the death of aquatic organisms. While studies have addressed the lethal effects of sugarcane ashes (SCA) on different fishes, little is known about the effects of sublethal SCA concentration on aquatic organisms. In this study, we evaluated the behaviour of a piscivorous (Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus) and an invertivorous (Moenkhausia forestii) fish species, after a short-term (24 h) exposure to a sublethal concentration of SCA (0.8 g L−1). We hypothesized that the outcomes of predator–prey interaction would change when the players are subjected to sublethal SCA concentration. Our findings revealed that neither the behaviours of predator and prey fish species nor the outcome of their interactions was changed by the exposure to sublethal SCA concentrations, suggesting that their behavioural traits were not particularly sensitive to SCA. However, we emphasize that (i) other predatory and anti-predator behavioural traits could be affected by SCA even at under 0.8 g L−1 concentration and (ii) higher concentrations of SCA and/or long-term exposure may trigger profound changes in the behaviour of predator and prey fish species. Our findings are worrisome because there are new public policies to expand sugarcane production in Brazil, with the possibility of continuing burning sugarcane crops across the country.

Neurochemicals are shown to alter the behaviour of common study species but it remains difficult to translate these results to biologically meaningful predictions across taxa.

Here, we use a laboratory experiment to assess baseline behavioural variation (spontaneous activity level and geotaxic behaviour) in the freshwater fairy shrimp Branchipodopsis wolfi and how this is affected by chronic exposure to an environmentally-relevant concentration of the anxiolytic pharmaceutical fluoxetine. The more conspicuously coloured and larger females of the species were overall less active and more benthic than males. Moreover, amongst females, vertical activity was negatively associated with size, while an opposite relationship was found for males. These trade-offs are likely part of an antipredator strategy to reduce the probability of being detected by visual hunters, but disappeared after exposure to fluoxetine. This is of particular interest since it is an effective proof of principle that neurochemicals may impact ecologically-relevant trade-offs between conspicuous morphology and antipredator behaviour.

Lockdowns likely alter extrinsic factors that normally limit raptor populations. These environmental changes are in turn expected to influence – mediated by behavioral and physiological responses – the intrinsic (demographic) factors that ultimately determine raptor population levels and distributions. Using this population-limitation framework, we identify a range of research opportunities and conservation challenges that have arisen during the pandemic, related to changes in human disturbance, light and noise pollution, collision risk, road-kill availability, supplementary feeding, and persecution levels.

Studies in model organisms have shown that epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, can be modulated by various environmental factors, including pollutants, influencing gene expression, and various organismal traits. Yet experimental data on the effects of pollution on DNA methylation from wild animal populations are largely lacking. We here experimentally investigated for the first time the effects of early-life exposure to environmentally relevant levels of a key pollutant, arsenic (As), on genome-wide DNA methylation in a wild bird population. We experimentally exposed nestlings of great tits (Parus major) to arsenic during their postnatal developmental period (3 to 14 days post-hatching) and compared their erythrocyte DNA methylation levels to those of respective controls. In contrast to predictions, we found no overall hypomethylation in the arsenic group. We found evidence for loci to be differentially methylated between the treatment groups, but for five CpG sites only. Three of the sites were located in gene bodies of zinc finger and BTB domain containing 47 (ZBTB47), HIVEP zinc finger 3 (HIVEP3), and insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1). Further studies are needed to evaluate whether epigenetic dysregulation is a commonly observed phenomenon in polluted populations and what are the consequences for organism functioning and for population dynamics. © 2021 The Authors.

Mortality and biochemical sublethal effects were evaluated using acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities and thyroid hormone (T4) levels. The LC50 value at 48h was 0.859 mg L−1 for S. nasicus and 0.221 mg L−1 for E. bicolor tadpoles. After exposure to sublethal DIC concentrations for 48 h, GST activity increased in S. nasicus but significantly decreased in E. bicolor with respect to controls. GR activity decreased only in S. nasicus at all the tested DIC concentrations. AChE activity was significantly inhibited in both S. nasicus and E. bicolor tadpoles at 48 h. DIC also caused significant changes in transamination, as evidenced by an increase in AST and ALT activities in both amphibian species. T4 levels were higher in DIC-treated tadpoles of both species than in controls. The DIC-induced biochemical alterations in glutathione system enzymes and transaminases indicate lesions in liver tissues and cellular function. Moreover, the observed AChE inhibition could lead to the accumulation of acetylcholine, excessively stimulating postsynaptic receptors, and the increase in T4 levels in both species may indicate an overactive thyroid. The commercial DIC formulation showed a high biotoxicity in the two amphibian native species after short-term exposure, controversially differing from the toxicity level indicated in the official fact sheet data.

Larvae were chronically exposed to 17β-estradiol (0.0–2.3 μg/L E2) from free swimming (Gosner stage 26) until metamorphosis. Juvenile frogs were allowed to mature within the enclosures for 60 days to assess effects of larval exposure on development, including body mass, snout-vent length (SVL), sex ratio, gonad size, and gonadal histopathology. Forty-eight percent of the initial 600 animals were recovered at the end of the study. Recovery was not influenced by E2 exposure, but larval losses were negatively impacted by unusually high spring rain events that flooded some larval tanks, and heat-related mortality of late stage larvae during summer. All surviving larvae completed metamorphosis within an average of 47 days. Overall, E2 exposure did not influence sex ratio, or the body mass, SVL, or gonad size of either males or females. Development of testes was not influenced by E2 exposure, but oviduct development in males was 4.5-fold greater in the highest treatment. Oviduct and ovary development in females exposed to the two highest E2 treatments were half that of control females. Although not treatment related and despite ad-lib feeding, variation in terminal body mass and SVL within enclosures was pronounced, with minimum – maximum differences ranging from 207 to 1442 mg for body mass and 1 mm to 15 mm for SVL. This design allowed us to assess the effects of larval exposure to a contaminant on post-metamorphic development of a native amphibian in a semirealistic field environment.

Behavioral responses are integrative and cumulative tools that reflect changes in energy allocation in organisms. Thus, feeding rate and locomotion velocity (pLMV) were determined to assess the effects induced by the laboratory exposure of adult planarians to water samples collected in the region of Tocantins-Araguaia, identifying the sampling points affected by contaminants. Furthermore, physicochemical and microbiological parameters, as well as the presence of inorganic compounds (dissolved aluminum, total barium, total chloride, dissolved iron, total fluoride, total manganese, nitrates, nitric nitrogen, total sulfate, total zinc) and surfactants, were determined on each specific sampling point. The behavioral biomarkers (feeding rate and pLMV) of the freshwater planarians were significantly decreased when organisms were exposed to water samples from four municipalities (Formoso do Araguaia, Lagoa da Confusão, Gurupi and Porto Nacional), sites of the Tocantins-Araguaia hydrographic region—TAHR. Both behavioral biomarkers decreased up to ~37–39% compared to organisms in ASTM medium only. Our results showed that these behavioral biomarkers can be used for fast screening monitoring of environmental samples of freshwater ecosystems, since a decrease in feeding rate and locomotor activity was observed in sites impacted by anthropogenic activities. However, the absence of effects observed in some sampling points does not represent the absence of contamination, since several other classes of contaminants were not determined. In these negative results, the absence of deleterious effects on behavioral biomarkers might only be indicative that the potential presence of contaminants on such sites does not significantly affect the performance of planarians. This fast screening approach seems to be useful to determine contaminated sites in freshwater ecosystems for biomonitoring purposes. This knowledge will help to develop biomonitoring programs and to decide appropriate sampling sites and analysis. Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

One reason for this controversy is that fluoxetine displays distinct and opposing acute and chronic effects. A second reason is that most studies have been limited to two or at the most three concentrations. To address these deficiencies we exposed adult zebrafish, both single females and shoals consisting of one male and two females, to seven fluoxetine concentrations, ranging from 5 ng/L to 5 μg/L and measured their swimming behaviour, and response to a conspecific alarm substance (CAS) at seven, 14 and 28 days. We also measured the light startle response of unexposed F1 larvae at days seven and 28 post-hatch and the response to CAS at day 28. On day 7 fluoxetine decreased swimming speed at concentrations ≥500 ng/L. After addition of CAS fish exposed to 5, 500 and 1000 ng/L decreased swimming, while fish exposed to 10, 500 and 1000 ng/L significantly increased time motionless. On day 14 only fish exposed to 50 ng/L were significantly slower than controls before addition of CAS, but afterwards fish exposed to 5, 50, 1000 and 5000 ng/L showed significant differences from controls. On day 28 fish exposed to 50 and 5000 ng/L had slower average swimming speeds than controls before addition of CAS. After addition all fish except controls and those exposed to 500 ng/L showed decreased average speed. At seven days post-hatch, F1 larvae whose parents were exposed to 100 ng/L showed significantly higher activity than controls and those exposed to 500 ng/L fluoxetine showed lower activity in the light startle response.

Here, we utilized RNA-Seq to build a whole brain transcriptome profile to examine the impact of a common endocrine disrupting pharmaceutical (17α-ethinyl estradiol, EE2) on reproductive behaviour in wild guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Specifically, we annotated 16,791 coding transcripts in whole brain tissue in relation to the courtship behaviour (i.e. sigmoid display) of EE2 exposed (at environmentally relevant concentration of 8 ng/L for 28-days) and unexposed guppies. Further, we obtained 10,960 assembled transcripts matching in the non-coding orthologous genomes. Behavioural responses were assessed using a standard mate choice experiment, which allowed us to disentangle chemical cues from visual cues. We found that a high proportion of the RNAseq reads aligned back to our de novo assembled transcriptome with 80.59% mapping rate. Behavioural experiments showed that when males were presented only with female visual cues, there was a significant interaction between male treatment and female treatment in the time spent in the preference zone. This is one of the first studies to show that transcriptome-wide changes are associated with the reproductive behaviour of fish: EE2 exposed male guppies that performed high levels of courtship had a gene profile that deviated the most from the other treatment groups, while both non-courting EE2 and control males had similar gene signatures. Using Gene Ontology pathway analysis, our study shows that EE2-exposed males had gene transcripts enriched for pathways associated with altered immunity, starvation, altered metabolism and spermatogenesis. Our study demonstrates that multiple gene networks orchestrate courting behaviour, emphasizing the importance of investigating impacts of pharmaceuticals on gene networks instead of single genes. © 2020 Elsevier LtdTranscriptome-wide changes associated with the reproductive behaviour of male guppies exposed to EE2. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.116286,Transcriptome;Estradiol;Ethinyl Estradiol,33360600,NA,transcriptomewide changes associated with the reproductive behaviour of male guppies exposed to 17αethinyl estradiol

To do so, we assessed the metabolic, immunologic, and histopathologic alterations in liver samples of American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus), at the premetamorphic stage, through biomarkers indicative of general energetic status, i.e., glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism using biochemical and histochemical approaches. The immunologic responses were assessed by the quantification of melanomacrophage centres (MMCs); the histopathologic evaluation of the liver sections was also performed. The assay was carried out over 21 days with two periods of sampling (after 7 and 21 days) to assess the effects of exposure over time. The animals were exposed to the considered safe levels of lithium (2.5 mg L−1) and selenium (10 μg L−1), both, isolated and mixed.

These samples were subjected to further thermal annealing treatment at ~1000 °C in air atmosphere. The properties of these compounds were investigated using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) techniques. The SEM images for the grown sample show small dense and compact crystals. The FTIR spectra shows absorption bands associated with the OH− and CO32− ions. XRD diffractograms identified a face-centred cubic structure for metallic Pd, and traces of PdO in the tetragonal structure. The grain size ranges between ~33.91 nm and 86.92 nm, and ~33.96 nm–86.94 nm, respectively. The bandgap energy (~3.7 eV) showed a shift towards higher energy linked with the quantum confinement effect. PL spectrum displayed eight emission bands at the UV–Vis range (~363–524 nm). The time-resolved (delayed) PL spectra were achieved ~13.0 ns after excitation. PL signals presented two blue emission bands in the Vis region, and they were associated with native crystalline defects. These blue emission bands are explained by the vacancies and interstitial defects, mostly associated with surfaces or grain boundaries. Likewise, emission bands were investigated, applying the Maxwell–Boltzmann theoretical model and contrasting them with the experimentally registered signals.

Concomitantly, these pharmaceuticals are frequently detected in surface waters. Serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine form the second largest group of antidepressants worldwide, and venlafaxine is the second most prescribed antidepressant in Germany. As drug targets are evolutionary highly conserved, venlafaxine can potentially change not only behavior and related physiological processes in humans but also in non-target species, especially aquatic organisms. In order to test this hypothesis for fish, we exposed brown trout larvae and juveniles to venlafaxine at concentrations ranging from 1 to 1,000 μg/L. Larvae were exposed for 5 months from the eyed ova stage until 8 weeks post yolk-sac consumption at 7 and 11 °C. Juveniles were exposed for 4 weeks at 7 °C. Mortality, weight, length, behavior during exposure and behavior in a stressful environment were recorded in both experiments. For larvae, additionally, hatching rate and heart rate were analyzed. In juvenile fish, tissue cortisol levels were determined. Our results clearly showed, that brown trout, irrespective of their life stage, change their behavior when being exposed to venlafaxine: During exposure, venlafaxine at 7 °C caused larvae to sojourn in the upper part of the aquaria for a longer time, with a lowest observed effect concentration of 100 μg/L. In a stressful environment with limited space, fish exposed to ≥10 μg/L venlafaxine were less active than controls. Furthermore, venlafaxine reduced the growth of larvae (length at ≥10 μg/L, weight at 1 mg/L) and their survival after 5 months (at 1 mg/L). Hatching rate and heart rate of larvae as well as tissue cortisol concentration of juveniles were not affected by venlafaxine treatment. © Copyright © 2021 Ziegler, Banet, Bauer, Köhler, Stepinski, Tisler, Huhn, Zwiener and Triebskorn.",,10.3389/fenvs.2020.586584,Antidepressive Agents,NA,NA,behavioral and developmental changes in brown trout after exposure to the antidepressant venlafaxine

In the natural environment, pollutants seldom occur in isolation, but little is known about the effects and risks of combinations of chemicals. This study aimed to investigate the effects of concurrent exposure to six psychoactive PhACs on locomotory behavior and life history traits of clonal marbled crayfish Procambarus virginalis. Crayfish were exposed to ~1 μg L−1 of the antidepressants sertraline, citalopram, and venlafaxine; the anxiolytic oxazepam; the opioid tramadol; and the widely abused psychostimulant methamphetamine. In the absence of shelter, exposed crayfish moved significantly shorter distances and at lower velocity and showed significantly less activity than controls. With available shelter, exposed crayfish moved significantly more distance, showed higher activity, and spent a significantly more time outside the shelter than controls. Molting, mortality, and spawning frequency did not vary significantly between the groups. Hemolymph glucose level did not vary among groups and was not correlated with observed behaviors. Results suggest that environmental concentrations of the tested compounds in combination can alter the behavior of non-target aquatic organisms as individual exposure of these compounds, which may lead to disruption of ecosystem processes due to their reduced caution in polluted conditions.

In this work, Daphnia magna F0 mothers were exposed to a range of silver and titanium dioxide NMs. The key biological life history traits (survival, growth and reproduction) of the F1 intergenerations, at the first (F1B1), third (F1B3) and fifth (F1B5) broods, were investigated. Furthermore, the F1 germlines of each of the three broods were investigated over 3 more generations (up to 25 days each) in continuous or removed-from NM exposure, to identify how the length of maternal exposure affects the resulting clonal broods. Our results show how daphnids respond to NM-induced stress, and how the maternal effects show trade-offs between growth, reproduction and survivorship. The F1B1 (and following germline) had the shortest F0 maternal exposure times to the NMs, and thus were the most sensitive showing reduced size and reproductive output. The F1B3 generation had a sub-chronic maternal exposure, whereas the F1B5 generation suffered chronic maternal exposure where (in most cases) the most compensatory adaptive effects were displayed in response to the prolonged NM exposure, including enhanced neonate output and reduced gene expression. Transgenerational responses of multiple germlines showed a direct link with maternal exposure time to ‘sub-lethal’ effect concentrations of NMs (identified from standard OECDs acute toxicity tests which chronically presented as lethal) including increased survival and production of males in the F1B3 and G1B5 germlines.

Phenotypically plastic defences often come with trade-offs related to foraging, such that the magnitude of defence is mediated by body condition and food availability. Such adaptive responses are beneficial to prey, and there is an increasing appreciation that they can be disrupted by chemical compounds resulting from human activities. We examined predator-induced behaviours in freshwater snails (Physa acuta) using 32 combinations of different concentrations of olfactory predator cues, body condition and food availability to understand how they respond to the trade-off between avoiding predators and obtaining food. Using a subset of these conditions (16 environments), we then examined how snail responses were altered by increases or decreases in pH. We found that snails responded to increased predator cue concentrations with a shape consistent with a saturating response curve and that low body condition and low food availability weakened these responses. When we increased pH (from 7.8 to 9.5), snails exhibited weaker predator avoidance responses, but only in the absence of food. When we decreased pH (from 7.8 to 6.0), snails exhibited stronger predator avoidance responses and stronger declines in foraging, but only in the presence of food. Collectively, these results suggest that changes in pH due to acid mine drainage, eutrophication and ocean acidification may substantially alter the adaptive responses of aquatic animals.

Contamination increased barnacle mortality and reduced predation with no effects on interaction strength. This was because the higher mortality of the prey compensated for the lower consumption of the predator.

However, coastal ecosystems are under increasing pressure from human populations. In particular, urban stormwater is an increasingly important threat to the integrity of coastal systems. Urban catchments exhibit altered flow regimes that impact ecosystem processes and coastal foodwebs. In addition, urban stormwater contains complex and unpredictable mixtures of chemicals that result in a multitude of lethal and sublethal impacts on species in coastal systems. Along the western coast of the United States, we estimate that hundreds of billions of kilograms of suspended solids flow off land surfaces and enter the Northern California Current each year. However, 70% of this pollution could be addressed by treating only 1.35% of the land area. Determining how to prioritize treatment of stormwater in this region requires a clear articulation of objectives-spatial distribution of appropriate management actions is dependent on the life histories of species, and management schemes optimized for one species may not achieve desired objectives for other species. In particular, we highlight that the scale of stormwater interventions must match the ecological scale relevant to species targeted by management. In many cases, management and policy will require mechanisms in order to ensure that local actions scale-up to efficiently and effectively achieve management objectives. In the face of rapid urbanization of coastal zones, failure to consider the match of management and ecological scales will result in the continued decline of coastal ecosystems and the species they support.

Using choice tests between unoiled and oiled sediments at one of three randomized concentrations (low: 0.1 L oil m-2, medium: 0.5 L oil m-2, or high: 3.0 L oil m-2), we found that, even at low prior exposure levels, killifish lose recognition of oiled sediments compared to control, unexposed fish. Preference for unoiled sediments was absent across all oil concentrations after oil exposure, and some evidence for preference of oiled sediments at high exposure was demonstrated. These results highlight the lack of response to toxic environments in exposed individuals, indicating altered behavior despite organism survival.

A review,2020,1,1,,22279717,8,12,,Fleeger J.W.,,,MDPI AG,,"Indirect effects in ecotoxicology are defined as chemical-or pollutant-induced alterations in the density or behavior of sensitive species that have cascading effects on tolerant species in natural systems. As a result, species interaction networks (e.g., interactions associated with predation or competition) may be altered in such a way as to bring about large changes in populations and/or communities that may further cascade to disrupt ecosystem function and services. Field studies and experimental outcomes as well as models indicate that indirect effects are most likely to occur in communities in which the strength of interactions and the sensitivity to contaminants differ markedly among species, and that indirect effects will vary over space and time as species composition, trophic structure, and environmental factors vary. However, knowledge of indirect effects is essential to improve understanding of the potential for chemical harm in natural systems. For example, indirect effects may confound laboratory-based ecological risk assessment by enhancing, masking, or spuriously indicating the direct effect of chemical contaminants. Progress to better anticipate and interpret the significance of indirect effects will be made as monitoring programs and long-term ecological research are conducted that facilitate critical experimental field and mesocosm investigations, and as chemical transport and fate models, individual-based direct effects models, and ecosystem/food web models continue to be improved and become better integrated. © 2020 by the author.

Forty and nineteen from 66 selected pharmaceuticals and their metabolites were positively found in water and sediment samples, respectively from the representative WSP. After a six-month study, which corresponds to aquaculture operations, fourteen pharmaceuticals and their metabolites were detected (at a frequency of higher than 50% of samples) in at least one fish tissue collected from the WSP.

Understanding how sub-lethal effects of toxicants can affect the quality and functions of biogenic habitats is critical if we are to establish effective guidelines for protecting ecosystems. We carried out a global systematic review and meta-analysis critically evaluating contaminant effects on properties of habitat-formers linked to ecosystem functioning. We reviewed a total of 95 publications. However, 40% of publications initially captured by the literature search were identified as having flaws in experimental design and ~11% did not present results in an appropriate way and thus were excluded from the quantitative meta-analysis. We quantitatively reviewed 410 studies from 46 publications, of which 313 (~76%) were on plants and seaweeds, that is macro-algae, saltmarsh plants and seagrasses, 58 (~14%) studied corals and 39 (~10%) looked at toxicant impacts on bivalves, with 70% of those on mussels and the remaining studies on oysters. Response variables analysed were photosynthetic efficiency, amount of chlorophyll a (as a proxy for primary production) and growth of plants, seaweeds and corals as well as leaf area of plants. We also analysed filtration, growth and respiration rates of bivalves. Our meta-analysis found that chemical contaminants have a significant negative impact on most of the analysed functional variables, with the exception of the amount of chlorophyll a. Metals were the most widely harmful type of contaminant, significantly decreasing photosynthetic efficiency of kelps, leaf area of saltmarsh plants, growth of fucoids, corals and saltmarsh plants and the filtration rates of bivalves. Organic contaminants decreased the photosynthetic efficiency of seagrass, but had no significant effects on bivalve filtration. We did not find significant effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on any of the analysed functional variables or habitat-forming taxa, but this could be due to the low number of studies available. A meta-regression revealed that relationships between concentrations of metal contaminants and the magnitude of functional responses varied with the type of metal and habitat-former. Increasing concentrations of contaminants significantly increased the negative effects on the photosynthetic efficiency of habitat-formers. There was, however, no apparent relationship between ecologically relevant concentrations of metals and effect sizes of photosynthetic efficiency of corals and seaweeds. A qualitative analysis of all relevant studies found slightly different patterns when compared to our quantitative analysis, emphasising the need for studies to meet critical inclusion criteria for meta-analyses. Our study highlights links between effects of contaminants at lower levels of organisation (i.e. at the biochemical and/or physiological level of individuals) and ecological, large-scale impacts, through effects on habitat-forming species. Contaminants can clearly reduce the functioning of many habitat-forming marine species.

However, magnetic susceptibility distortions caused by the organisms, along with sample complexity, lead to broad and overlapping 1D NMR spectra. As such, 2D NMR in combination with 13C enrichment (to increase signal) is a requirement for metabolite assignment and monitoring using high field in-vivo flow based NMR. Despite this, it is not clear which NMR experiment and probe combinations are the most appropriate for such studies. In terms of experiments, 1H–13C Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) and 13C–1H Heteronuclear Correlation Spectroscopy (HETCOR) experiments are logical choices for molecular fingerprinting. HSQC uses 1H for detection and thus will be the most sensitive, while HETCOR uses 13C for detection, which benefits from improved spectral dispersion (i.e. a larger chemical shift range) and avoids detection of the huge in-vivo water signal which can be problematic in HSQC. NMR probes are available in two variations, inverse (inner coil 1H) which is best suited to 1H detection and observe (inner coil 13C) which is ideal for 13C detection. To further complicate matters, the low biomass in many aquatic organisms makes cryoprobes desirable, however, changing cryoprobes is time prohibitive, requiring at least a day to warmup and cool down, meaning only a single probe can be used to monitor “real-time” in-vivo responses. The key questions become: Is it best to use HSQC on an inverse cryoprobe and accept a compromised HETCOR? Or is it best to use HETCOR on an observe cryoprobe and accept a compromised HSQC? Here these questions are explored using living 13C enriched Daphnia as the test case. The number of metabolites identified across the different probe/experiment combinations are compared over a range of experiment times. Finally, the probes/experiments are compared to monitor an anoxic stress response. Both probes and experiments prove to be quite robust, albeit HSQC identified slightly more metabolites in most cases. HETCOR did nearly as-well and because of the lack of water complications would be the most accessible approach for researchers to apply in-vivo NMR to 13C enriched organisms, both in terms of experimental setup and flow system design. This said, when using an optimized flow system, HSQC did identify the most metabolites and an inverse probe design offers the most potential for 1H-only approaches which are continuously being developed and have the potential to eventually overcome the current limitation that requires 13C enriched organisms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.aca.2020.09.065,,33161978,NA,inverse or direct detect experiments and probes which are best for invivo nmr research of 13c enriched organisms

Fluoxetine exposure resulted in a nonmonotonic decrease in anxiety-related behaviour (i.e. nonlinear with dose), with fish in the low-fluoxetine treatment being less responsive to shifts in light condition compared to unexposed fish. There was no such difference between unexposed and high-exposed fish. Further, we detected a significant interaction between exposure treatment and fish weight on general swimming activity, suggesting the presence of a mass-specific effect of fluoxetine. More broadly, contaminant-induced disruption of animal behaviour—as documented here—could have wide-reaching effects on population-level fitness. © 2020 The Authors",,10.1016/j.hazl.2020.100004,Anxiety;Antidepressive Agents,NA,NA,antidepressant exposure causes a nonmonotonic reduction in anxietyrelated behaviour in female mosquitofish

Environmental pollution by so-called persistent and bioaccumulative toxic substances (PBTS) poses significant risks for all of the world’s aquatic ecosystems, especially in countries with emerging economies, where environmental regulations are often poorly implemented. In Mexico, the development of industrial projects and the deficient application of environmental regulations, together with the rapid increase in population and the inefficient disposal of urban waste, have generated a severe problem of water pollution in the country. National environmental protection programs have not included the monitoring of PBTS, even though researchers have been monitoring the main aquatic ecosystems of the country for nearly three decades, generating valuable information that could help improve the protection and exploitation of these ecosystems. The present work reviewed a large portion of the available literature (~150 articles) on aquatic biomonitoring of the main PBTS (Hg, Cd, Pb, POCs, and PCBs) in Mexico. This work aims to collect, synthesize, and facilitate the management and interpretation of the reported data to improve the country’s aquatic ecosystems’ protection and management. © 2020, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar.

That is the case of alumina (Al) nanoparticles which are extensively employed as support in heterogeneous catalysis processes. However, these NMs can cause great toxicity because of their ubiquitous properties, such as extremely small size and high specific surface area. So, it is required to assess the potential deleterious effects of these NMs on living organisms. In the present study, we analyze the oxidative stress and genotoxic potential of a nanoceramic catalyst Ni/&lt;gamma&gt;-Al2O3 (NC) and the NMs involved in their synthesis, &lt;gamma&gt;-Al2O3 support (SPC) and NiO/&lt;gamma&gt;-Al2O3 precursor (PC) on Rhinella arenarum larvae. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and genotoxic damage were measured in tadpoles exposed to 5 and 25 mg/L of each NMs for 96 h. The results indicated an inhibition of catalase activity in tadpoles exposed to both concentrations of PC and to 25 mg/L of SPC and NC. Moreover, both exposure concentrations of PC and NC significantly inhibited superoxide dismutase activity. Exposure to the three NMs caused inhibition of glutathione S-transferase activity, but there were no significant variations in reduced glutathione levels. Oxidative stress damage (lipid peroxidation) was observed in tadpoles treated with 25 mg/L PC, while the other treatments did not produce alterations. The MNs frequency significantly increased in larvae exposed to 25 mg/L PC indicating irreversible genotoxic damage. The results show that these NMs exert genotoxic effects and antioxidant defense system disruption in R. arenarum larvae. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.etap.2020.103508,Oxidative Stress;DNA Damage,33011327,NA,oxidative stress and genotoxicity in rhinella arenarum anura bufonidae tadpoles after acute exposure to nial nanoceramics
