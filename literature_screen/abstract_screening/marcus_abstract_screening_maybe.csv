In our previous study, we found that neburon has strong aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist activity, but whether it causes reproductive toxicity is not clear. In the present study, zebrafish were conducted as a model organism to evaluate whether environmental concentrations of neburon (0.1, 1 and 10 pg/L) induce reproductive disorder in males. After exposure to neburon for 150 days from embryo to adult, that the average spawning egg number in high concentration group was 106.40, which was significantly lower than 193.00 in control group. This result was mainly due to the abnormal male reproductive behavior caused by abnormal transcription of genes associated with reproductive behavior in the brain, such as secretogranin-2a. The proportions of spermatozoa in the medium and high concentration groups were 82.40% and 83.84%, respectively, which were significantly lower than 89.45% in control group. This result was mainly caused by hormonal disturbances and an increased proportion of apoptotic cells. The hormonal disruption was due to the significant changes in the transcription levels of key genes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis following neburon treatment. Neburon treatment also significantly activated the AhR signaling pathway, causing oxidative stress damage and eventually leading to a significant increase in apoptosis in the exposed group. Together, these data filled the currently more vacant profile of neburon toxicity and might provide information to assess the ecotoxicity of neburon on male reproduction at environmentally relevant concentrations.

In testis, exposure dependent histological damage has been observedin terms of vacuolization, condensation of spermatogonic cells, distortion of tubular epithelium, shrinkage of interstitial cells and general inflammatory responses, Longest exposure of 45 days has resulted in peculiar starry-sky appearance of the testicular tissue. Gross histoanatomy of ovarian tissue reveals epithelial lesions, inflammatory responses, stromal hemorrhage, increased interstitium and shrinkage of yolk vesicles towards periphery. These findings are quite suggestive of reproductive impairments leading to delayed gonadal maturity and adversely affecting processes of sperm production and ovulation and thus, the fish production.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Marcus""=>""Excluded"", ""Kyle ""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: maye assess reproductive behaviours",,pyrethroids;cypermethrin;gonadal impairment;Channa punctatus;HISTOPATHOLOGICAL CHANGES;PYRETHROID INSECTICIDES;SUBLETHAL CYANIDE;RAINBOW-TROUT;CYPERMETHRIN;TOXICITY;TESTIS;VITELLOGENIN;REPRODUCTION;EXPOSURE;Gonads,NA,NA

Abnormal behaviour was observed in fish exposed to 70 μg/l from Day 14. Histological alterations were noticed only in liver in the groups exposed to 40 and 70 μg/l. Significant changes (P < 0.05) in almost all haematological indices were found, especially in the group exposed to the highest concentration of copper (70 μg/l). Biochemical analysis revealed various significant (P < 0.05) differences among the tested groups. Significant differences in copper tissue concentration (P < 0.05) among groups were found in liver, gills and kidney. Among antioxidative enzymes, significant changes were revealed mainly in catalase and glutathione-S-transferase activity (P < 0.05). In gills, metallothionein content increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the group exposed to the highest copper concentration (70 μg/l) compared with the other tested groups, including the control. A significant (P < 0.05) change in total glutathione content was recorded in liver and gills, although the reduced/oxidised ratio was not affected. Oxidative damage to lipids increased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing copper concentration in liver and kidney.

In this article, the effect of methyl parathion on the fighting behaviour of male Siamese fighting fish was investigated. The frequency and duration of opercular erection were taken as indicators of male aggressiveness towards another male. All male fish were housed in glass jars for 1-2 weeks prior to experiments. Sixteen naive males were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: methyl parathion (5 mg/L) and control. Males were placed in their respective treatment jars for 24 h, and then, each male was paired with another male of matching size in an 30x25x25 cm aquarium. The aquarium had an opaque divider to keep the two males separate for 10 min of acclimation period. The divider was then removed and behavioural measurements were taken for another 10 min. The results showed that fish placed in methyl parathion had significantly lower aggressive behavlour, as indicated by lower frequency and shorter duration of opercular erection.

In the acute test, juveniles of Tambaqui were divided into control group and five experimental groups with exposure from 0.1 to 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron for 96 h. Animals were also submitted to chronic toxicity test for four months in concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/L of lufenuron, the concentration used in the treatment of ectoparasites in fish and 50% of LC50 96 h, respectively. The presence of hemorrhages was observed in eyes, fins and operculum of fish exposed to 0.7 and 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron. Histological analysis showed changes in the morphology of fish gills submitted to acute toxicity test, as lamellar aneurysm and blood congestion inside lamellae. Lufenuron promoted damage in fish retina as in ability to respond to stimuli in photo-receptors and in ON-bipolar cells in acute test. In chronic test, blood glucose analysis and morphometric parameters showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). In general, Tambaqui exhibited behaviors associated with stress when exposed to lufenuron. Thus, lufenuron showed several toxic effects in relation to biological parameters in Tambaqui. This concerns about the use and discard of lufenuron, and indicates the requirement of environmental actions to prevent potential contamination of aquatic biota. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Tests of acute toxicity were conducted using 10 fish for each separate concentration and for the control group. The results were subjected to probit analysis to determine the 96h LC50 values. The 96h LC50 values of MP and CPF to P. reticulata were 8.48ppm/L (5.98-10.89) and 0.176ppm/L (0.313-0.224) respectively. In addition, behavioral changes at each concentration were observed for the individual fish. Fish were exposed for 96h to different sublethal concentrations of MP and CPF (1/4 LC50, 1/8 LC50 and 1/10 LC50) and their oxidative stress-induction potential was estimated in brain, liver and gills of fish. MDA content is induced in all tissues but maximum rise was observed in gills (161% and 153% for MP and CPF respectively). With regard to antioxidant defense system (ADS), GSH level decreased in the brain, liver and gills of tissues of MP treated fishes (22%, 6% and 13% respectively) and showed increase in brain and gills CPF treated (23% and 21% respectively). CAT, GST, GR and SOD levels fluctuated in all treatment groups relative to the control. Brain AChE showed dose-dependent inhibition in fish exposed to the higher concentrations reached 45% and 66% for MP and CPF respectively.
