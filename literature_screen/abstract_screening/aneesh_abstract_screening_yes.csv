The potential for FN to act as an anti-androgen (at exposures of 1, 50, and 200 mu g FN/l over a 26-day period) was assessed in male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring kidney spiggin concentration, nest-building, and courtship behavior. Spiggin is the glue protein that male sticklebacks use to build their nests and is directly controlled by androgens. FN exposure significantly reduced spiggin production as well as nest-building activity. It also adversely affected courtship-especially the 'zigzag dance' and biting behavior of the males. FN thus appears to have anti-androgenic effects on both the physiology and behavior of the male stickleback.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  36     Total Times Cited:  40     Cited Reference Count:  83 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10646-008-0265-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Fenitrothion;Anti-androgen;Stickleback;Spiggin;Nest-building behavior;Courtship behavior;BRAIN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;SECONDARY SEX CHARACTERS;ENVIRONMENTAL ANTIANDROGENS;ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION;MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS;ESTROGENIC CHEMICALS;KIDNEY HYPERTROPHY;MALE-PREFERENCE;SPERM COUNT;ANDROGEN;Pesticides;Reproductive Behavior,NA,NA

While fenpropathrin was found to have neurotoxic effects in mammals, it remains unclear whether it has similar effects on fish. Here, we used adult zebrafish to investigate the impacts of fenpropathrin on fish social behaviors and neural activity. Exposure of adult zebrafish to 500 ppb of fenpropathrin for 72 h increased anxiety levels but decreased physical fitness, as measured by a novel tank diving test and swimming tunnel test. Fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to spend more time in the conspecific zone of the tank, possibly seeking greater comfort from their companions. Although learning, memory, and aggressive behavior did not change, fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to have shorter fighting durations. The immunocytochemical results showed the tyrosine hydroxylase antibody-labeled dopaminergic neurons in the teleost posterior tuberculum decreased in the zebrafish brain. According to a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of the brain, exposure to fenpropathrin resulted in a decrease in the messenger (m)RNA expression of monoamine oxidase (mao), an enzyme that facilitates the deamination of dopamine. In contrast, the mRNA expression of the sncga gene, which may trigger Parkinson's disease, was found to have increased. There were no changes observed in expressions of genes related to antioxidants and apoptosis between the control and fenpropathrin-exposed groups. We provide evidence to demonstrate the defect of the neurotoxicity of fenpropathrin toward dopaminergic neurons in adult zebrafish.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106756,Fenpropathrin;Locomotion;Zebrafish;Dopaminergic neurons;MONOAMINE-OXIDASE;INSECTICIDES;CALIFORNIA;DOPAMINE;TOXICITY;WATER;PESTICIDE;SEDIMENT;EXPOSURE;VALLEY;Social Behavior,NA,NA

Four adult males and two ovulated females were placed in the aquarium together with eight mature male parr. Four of the parr were exposed during the previous 4 days to two concentrations (0.1 or 1.0 mu g l(-1)) of the pyrethroid pesticide cypermethrin (a disrupter of olfactory receptor function) and four of the parr to the solvent ethanol. The behaviour of all fish was followed for 24 h and then blood and milt was collected. Exposure to the higher concentration of cypermethrin disturbed the reproductive behaviour of the parr. They displayed fewer courting events, spent less time near the nesting females and had lower volumes of strippable milt. They also had significantly lower amounts of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) in the blood plasma than the control roup. The higher cypermethrin group also had significantly lower levels of all these variables than the 9 lower cypermethrin group, apart from strippable milt that showed no significant differences between two groups. No significant differences in non-reproductive behaviours were observed between any of the groups. In the control fish, there were significant positive Correlations between (a) the number of courting events and the amount of time spent near the female, (b) blood plasma levels of 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta-P) and time spent near the female and (c) plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P and the number of courting events. Further, in control fish, higher plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P were observed in part-interacting with a female compared to those with no female contacts. A priming experiment confirmed a previous study that cypermethrin damages olfactory reception. Parr exposed to cypermethrin had significantly lower blood plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P and 11-KT than control males after exposure to ovarian fluid and urine (known to contain reproductive priming pheromones). When ethanol-exposed males were exposed to ovarian fluid and urine they had significantly higher plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P compared to those exposed to water only. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Thirty-day laboratory chronic studies were conducted to determine the relative sensitivity of standard (e.g. survival and growth) and non-standard behavioral (e.g. swimming capacity, feeding efficiency, and aggression) endpoints in predicting concentrations of fonofos protective of bluegill growth and survival. The lowest observable effect concentration (LOECs) for the standard measures of survival and growth was 5.6 mu g/L. Two behavioral endpoints were of similar sensitivity to the standard measures: swimming capacity, LOEC of 5.6 mu g/L; and prey strike frequency, LOEC of 5.6 mu g/L. However, aggressive interactions were ten-fold more sensitive than swimming or feeding behavior with a LOEC occurring at 0.6 mu g/L. Lab results were compared to an aquatic mesocosm study which exposed adult and juvenile bluegill to a 9.41 mu g/L concentration of fonofos. The dissipation half-life of fonofos was 5 days in 0.1 hectare aquatic mesocosms. Significant mortality among caged bluegill occurred within 4 days of exposure at 9.41 mu g/L. However, the 9.41 mu g/L concentration of fonofos had no statistically significant effects on survival, growth, reproduction, or total biomass of free-ranging populations of bluegill. We conclude from these studies that laboratory data can accurately estimate concentrations that are Lethal in the field and that the use of behavioral endpoints can provide ecologically relevant, yet conservative estimates of concentrations that are protective of field populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""}",10.1520/STP15817S     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),bluegill;fonofos;insecticide;behavior;sublethal toxicity;mesocosm;ORGANOPHOSPHATE INSECTICIDE;TOXICITY TESTS;RESPONSES;EXPOSURES;HAZARD;FIELD;Endpoint Determination,NA,NA

These compounds have household and agricultural applications with different formulations. Two important compounds used as household insecticides are prallethrin and transfluthrin, both from the pyrethroid chemical group. With the mode of action centered on sodium channels, pyrethroids keep the ionic sodium channels open for a long time causing the death of the insect by nervous hyperexcitability. Given the increased use of household insecticides by humans and the incidence of disease outbreaks with unknown etiology such as autism spectrum disease, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease we investigate some physiological inputs of these compounds on zebrafish. In this study, we evaluated the social interaction, shoaling formation, and anxiety-like behavior of zebrafish exposed chronically to trans- fluthrin-and prallthrin-based insecticides (T-BI and P-BI). In addition, we quantified the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in different brain regions. We observed that both compounds caused anxiolytic behavior and reduced shoaling formation and social interaction. Their behavioral biomarkers indicated a harmful ecological effect on the specie as well as a possible impact of these compounds on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZP). In addition, the AChE activity would change its activity in different brain regions modulating the anxiety-like behavior and social behavior in zebrafish. We conclude that P-BI and T-BI make us alert about the relationship of these compounds with nervous diseases related to cholinergic signaling.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Aneesh""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.neuro.2023.02.011,Prallethrin;Transfluthrin;Acetylcholinesterase;Household insecticide;Behavior;AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER;NERVOUS-SYSTEM;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;ANXIETY;RECEPTORS;MODULATE;MODELS;Brain,NA,NA
