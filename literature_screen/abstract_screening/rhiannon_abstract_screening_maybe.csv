While some evidence supports this assumption in mammals and birds, exposure to certain pyrethroids can affect concentrations of hormones vital to reproduction in fish. Thus, we hypothesized that pyrethroid exposure impacts fish reproductive behavior and the expression of genes associated with reproduction. We tested our hypothesis by examining effects of the widely used pyrethroid pesticide, bifenthrin, on the reproductive behaviors of the broadly distributed livebearing western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis. We exposed sexually mature female fish to one of five environmentally relevant concentrations of bifenthrin and conducted behavioral assays to assess reproductive, social, and space use behaviors before and after exposure. We did not detect changes in behaviors measured in response to bifenthrin. However, exposure was associated with increased expression of an estrogen receptor gene (ER-α) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in brain tissue at bifenthrin concentrations at concentrations of 5.90 and 24.82 ng/L, and 5.90 and 12.21 ng/L, respectively. Our study supports the perspective that the use of multiple endpoints through integrative approaches is essential for understanding the cumulative impact of pollutants. Integrating physiological, morphological, and behavioral investigations of nonlethal concentrations of pollutants like bifenthrin may heighten our potential to predict their impact on individuals, populations, and communities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""Control group?""]}",10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.12.001,"Brain;Receptors, Glucocorticoid;Glucocorticoids;Estrogens",30769158,NA

ATZ is one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and a known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). The behavior of sailfin mollies is well documented in the scientific literature. Moreover, they are ecologically important indicators of environmental health, widely distributed among the mangroves along the Gulf Coast of the Southeastern US where significant amounts of ATZ are introduced via runoff and storm water drainage from coastal households, businesses, and farms. Four sets of experiments designed to assess ATZ’s impact on various aspects of male and female reproductive behavior, aggression, anxiety, and boldness were conducted following 12 weeks of exposure to 1 or 15 ppb water-borne ATZ, along with a no-exposure control group. Results indicated that the behavior of ATZ-exposed individuals differed from those of controls: ATZ exposure affected which stimulus fish (a male vs. a female) subject females preferred to associate with while also affecting female strength of preference for males of larger body size and their sexual receptivity to conspecific males in general. ATZ-exposed males also showed reduced overall responsiveness to conspecific stimuli and directed significantly less aggression toward their mirror image compared with controls. Finally, ATZ exposure affected multiple aspects of male and female behavior that are often used as proxies for boldness and anxiety. Overall, ATZ exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behaviors attributed to sexual receptivity, mate choice and motivation to mate, aggression, as well as boldness and anxiety. These ATZ-induced behavioral changes may adversely affect the long-term health of natural populations exposed to similar, environmentally realistic concentrations and add to a growing body of empirical data demonstrating substantial fitness consequences of exposure to sublethal concentrations of this known EDC. © 2023 by the author.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""Adult fish?""]}",10.3390/w15020306,"",NA,NA

This study exposed sexually mature male guppy (Poecilia reticulata) to 20, 200, and 2000 ng/L (PS)2 to explore the compromised effect of (PS)2 on reproductive behavior through a realistic competing scenario. The results showed that (PS)2 suppressed male guppies' sexual interest to stimulus females, reduced their competitive behavior frequencies toward rival males, and decreased their mating time and frequency. (PS)2 exposure did not affect male guppies' secondary sexual characteristics or induce estrogenic activity. Whole-brain transcriptome sequencing identified 1070 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with 872 up-regulated genes, which were functionally enriched into Gene Ontology terms pertaining to extracellular matrix (ECM) and extracellular region. KEGG enrichment for the DEGs uncovered that the activations of ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathways could be the underlying molecular mechanism implicated in the (PS)2 induced reproductive behavior impairment.

The presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the aquatic environment may affect fitness by changing morphology or altering behaviors like courtship and exploration. Most research on EDC-generated behavioral effects has focused on estrogen mimics and reproductive endpoints. Far fewer studies have examined the effects of other types of EDCs or measured non-reproductive behaviors. EDCs with antiandrogenic properties are present in waterways yet we know little about their effects on exposed individuals although they may produce effects similar to those caused by estrogen mimics because they act on the same hormonal pathway. To examine the effects of antiandrogens on boldness, this study exposed male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, to a high or low dose of one of two antiandrogens, vinclozolin or flutamide, and observed behavior in three boldness assays, both before and after exposure. Overall, antiandrogen exposure increased boldness behavior, especially following exposure to the higher dose. Whether or not antiandrogen exposure influenced boldness, as well as the nature and intensity of the effect, was assay-dependent. This demonstrates the importance of studying EDC effects in a range of contexts and, at least within this species, suggests that antiandrogenic compounds may generate distinct physiological effects in different situations. How and why the behavioral effects differ from those caused by exposure to an estrogen mimic, as well as the potential consequences of increased activity levels, are discussed. Exposure to an antiandrogen, regardless of dose, produced elevated activity levels and altered shoaling and exploration in male Siamese fighting fish. These modifications may have fitness consequences. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""Unsure if control group is used""]}",10.1016/j.envpol.2018.01.029,Androgen Antagonists,29366512,NA

Histopathological studies, mutagenic, genotoxic and Poecilia reticulata (Guppy) were motivated by the scarcity of data in the literature concerning the effects of the formulation of the herbicide Roundup Transorb®. With everything, we sought to ascertain the effects produced by this formulation that is widely used in the Midwest of the country. This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity and mutagenic and genotoxic herbicide R. Transorb® in liver, gill and erythrocytes of the guppy, calculating and applying the LC50 test micronucleus (MN) and Comet assay (AC). The toxicity bioassays were performed to calculate the LC50;12-96h, to evaluate the effects of sublethal concentrations of herbicide subjected to acute treatment. We used 36 adult fish, weighing on average 0.496 g ± 0.28 g to calculate the LC50 and 75 adult fish also carry the MN and AC. During exposure to the herbicide was observed fish behavior at all concentrations and controlled chemical and physical changes of water. The erythrocytes were obtained by centrifugation of the gills being added to precipitate fetal calf serum, and then dripped on the slides to make the smear and electrophoresis. For the analysis of plates, 75.000 cells were counted and stipulate the frequency of occurrence of Nuclear Morphological Changes (AMNs) and AC were analyzed for 100 cells per specimen. The LC50; 12, 24, 48, 72 e 96h of R. Transorb® were 11:24, 8:55, 6.5, 6.10 and 5.65μl/L, respectively, indicating that this species is very sensitive to the herbicide studied in relation to other tropical species analyzed. These factors may be related to different formulations of herbicides and their respective surfactants. It was found that the mortality rate of fish poisoned by the herbicide increased as exposure concentrations increased. The values of LC50,12-96h show a downward trend over time, suggesting that during periods of reduced exposure will require greater amounts of herbicide to cause mortality of 50% of the population of animals. Animals exposed to the herbicide showed behavioral changes varied, such as aggressiveness, irritability, loss of the escape reflex, darkening of the body surface and banging against the wall of the aquarium. In addition, R. Transorb® hitológicas induced liver changes appreciably impairing the normal functioning of this organ. In MN and EC was possible to detect significant genotoxic and mutagenic effects in erythrocytes and gill cells, occurring gradual increase in the number of cells with AMNs and ADN damage under higher concentrations,indicating concentration-dependent effect. This herbicide has acute toxicity to guppy, promoting behavioral changes, possibly acting in a manner damaging to the liver but also in the nervous system and gill. These results also suggest that the formulation of this herbicide has genotoxic and mutagenic in erythrocytes and gill cells detected by the MN and AC. Therefore, it confirms the high risk of herbicide to the environment, its contamination may present a strong threat to populations of fish and other organisms both vertebrates and invertebrates and human health. ; Os efeitos de substâncias tóxicas, mutagênicas e genotóxica sobre órgãos-alvos e o genoma de peixes tem sido objeto de muitos estudos, sobretudo daqueles que buscam estabelecer respostas destes órgãos e dos genes aos estímulos ambientais. Estudos histopatológicos, mutagênicos, genotóxicos e em Poecilia reticulata (Guppy) foram motivados pela escassez de dados na literatura referente aos efeitos provocados pela formulação do herbicida Roundup Transorb®. Com tudo, pretendeu-se conhecer os efeitos produzidos por essa formulação que é bastante utilizada no Centro-Oeste do país. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar a ação tóxica, mutagênica e genotóxica do herbicida R. Transorb® em fígado, brânquia e eritrócito do guppy, calculando a CL50 e aplicando Teste de Micronúcleo (MN) e Ensaio Cometa (EC). Os bioensaios de toxicidade foram realizados para calcular a CL50,12-96h, avaliar os efeitos das concentrações subletais do herbicida submetido a tratamento agudo. Utilizou-se 36 peixes adultos, pesando em média 0,496g ± 0,28g para cálculo da CL50 e 75 peixes também adultos para realizar o MN e EC. Durante a exposição ao herbicida observou-se o comportamento dos peixes em todas as concentrações e controlada as variações químicas e físicas da água. Os eritrócitos foram obtidos pela centrifugação das brânquias sendo adicionado soro fetal bovino ao precipitado, e posteriormente gotejado sobre as lâminas para realizar o esfregaço e eletroforese. Para a análise das lâminas, foram contadas 75.000 células e estipulada a frequência de ocorrência de Alterações Morfológicas Nucleares (AMNs), e para EC foram analisadas 100 células por espécime. A CL50; 12, 24, 48, 72 e 96 h do R. Transorb® foram de 11.24; 8.55; 6.5; 6.10 e 5.65μl/L, respectivamente, indicando que esta espécie é bastante sensível ao herbicida estudado em relação às demais espécies tropicais analisadas. Esses fatores podem estar relacionados às diferentes formulações dos herbicidas e seus respectivos surfactantes. Verificou-se que a porcentagem de mortalidade dos peixes intoxicados pelo herbicida aumentou à medida que as concentrações de exposição aumentaram. Os valores da CL50; 12- 96 h apresentam tendência de queda ao longo do tempo, sugerindo que em períodos de menor exposição serão necessárias quantidades maiores de herbicida para causar a mortalidade de 50% da população de animais. Os animais expostos ao herbicida apresentaram alterações comportamentais variadas, tais como: agressividade; irritabilidade; perda do reflexo de fuga; escurecimento da superfície corporal e choque contra a parede do aquário. Além disso, o R. Transorb® induziu alterações hitológicas hepáticas prejudicando de forma sensível o funcionamento normal deste órgão. No MN e EC foi possível detectar efeitos mutagênicos e genotóxicos significativos nos eritrócitos e células da brânquia, ocorrendo aumento gradual no número de células com AMNs e com danos ao DNA de acordo com aumento das concentrações, indicando efeito concentração-dependente. Este herbicida apresenta toxidade aguda para guppy, promovendo alterações comportamentais, agindo possivelmente de forma danosa não só no fígado, mas também no sistema nervoso e branquial. Tais resultados sugerem também que a formulação deste herbicida possui ação genotóxica e mutagênica em eritrócitos e células branquiais detectados através dos MN e EC. Por tanto, se confirma o alto risco deste herbicida ao meio ambiente, sua contaminação pode apresentar forte ameaça para as populações de peixes e outros organismos tanto vertebrados como invertebrados e saúde do homem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",,Poecilia reticulata;Herbicida;Glifosato;Ensaio cometa;Teste micronúcleo;Pesticides;Glyphosate;Comet assay;Micronucleos test;CNPQ::CIENCIAS BIOLOGICAS,NA,NA

Despite having the genome completely sequenced and the behavior and physiology well reported, there are some issues related to the housing and management of these animals that are still poorly understood. Considering the issues regarding the housing of the zebrafish, we aimed to investigate whether different cues, used alone or together, would interfere in zebrafish behavior. In this study, we detected that the animals have different behaviors when in the presence of isolated cues and together, therefore, we emphasize the importance of the description and detailing of the conditions of housing of these fish. After the development of this first article, we had the idea of working with imidacloprid (IMI). IMI is an insecticidal pesticide used globally in the treatment of seeds and leaves of crops such as vegetables, sugar beet, cotton and tobacco. The use of IMI is mainly due to its high insecticidal potential and low toxic potential in mammals, acting as a specific nicotinic acetylcholine agonist for invertebrate receptors. However, non-target species have been affected by this compound, which can cause from the mortality of these animals to endocrine and physiological changes in sublethal concentrations, mostly based on the LC50/LD50 (concentration/dose capable of killing 50% of the population tested), in chronic or acute exposures, within 96 hours. However, little is known about the effect that concentrations already detected in the environment and in periods shorter than 96 hours can have on non-target organisms. Therefore, our aim was to analyze whether an IBI (imidacloprid-based insecticide) alters behavior, cortisol levels and redox status in zebrafish, in a 30-minute exposure protocol and at environmentally relevant concentrations. In this second manuscript, we showed that IBI was able to reduce locomotion, social and aggressiveness behaviors of exposed fish, in addition to inducing a mild anxiolytic-like ...","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",,Pesticida;Neonicotinoides;Cortisol;Peixe-zebra;Estado redox;Pesticide;Neonicotinoids;Danio rerio;Status redox;CNPQ::CIENCIAS BIOLOGICAS::FARMACOLOGIA;Insecticides,NA,NA

In this aim, we exposed the goldfish to environmental relevant concentrations of herbicide and fungicide mixtures at two temperatures for 96 hours or 16 days. The fish responses were assessed from the molecular level to individual endpoints, including omic approaches (proteomic and metabolomic), biochemical analyses (cortisol, antioxidant defenses, cellular energy allocation), indexes (somatic and condition factors) and behavioral assays (sediment reworking, activity, exploration and feeding). Our results showed that individual chemical or thermal stresses induced a general stress response including biochemical, metabolic, physiological and behavioral compensations. The absence of deleterious effect on the global condition of fish suggested the implementation of an efficient and adaptive stress response, while the hypoactivity of fish exposed to pesticide mixtures could entrain a decreased performance and fitness into the wild. At the opposite, the combined chemical and thermal stresses induced reciprocal inactivation of the stress response, with antagonism effect on cortisol secretion, antioxidant defense induction and metabolic compensation. However, increased effect on behavioral traits and decreased global condition of fish were observed. Our study showed that temperature rising sensitized fish to pesticide exposure.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rams) are popular freshwater animal models. However, their behavioral use in aquatic toxicology research is generally ham pered by oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are not well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented a comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e.,anxiety-like behavior, novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory). We found that only medaka (d-rR) presented a weak or no response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus. In addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the three species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01% v/v carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and DMSO). In contrast to zebrafish and Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes in spatial memory after subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5 mu g/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead, a hyperactivity response in the open field test and reduced social time were induced by cpf and imidacloprid, respectively. Our results suggest that: (1) behavioral effects are negligible when using <0.01% v/v carrier solvents for behavioral assessment: (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be insufficient for estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other environmental contaminants.

Both compounds are highly neurotoxic to fish, but each with distinct biological target sites and mechanisms of action. We used common biochemical and physiological indicators of toxicity, and correlated these effects with potentially significant behavioral alterations. For chlorpyrifos, the mechanism of toxic action is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) throughout the peripheral and central nervous system. Here, we conducted biochemical assays of AChE activity in brain and muscle tissues after exposing steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (0. kisutch) to chlorpyrifos for 96 hours. We then correlated the AChE inhibition with behavioral impairment in swimming and feeding activities. In juvenile steelhead and coho exposed to 0.6-2.5 μg/L chlorpyrifos, AChE activity was inhibited between ~10-65%. This biochemical indicator was significantly correlated with changes in behavioral patterns. Spontaneous swimming rates were reduced ~30-80% in the exposed fish, and strikes at food items (brine shrimp) were reduced ~10-70%. For copper and some other neurotoxicants, the olfactory nervous system is a sensitive target site in fish. The highly-developed olfactory system in salmonids is particularly susceptible to toxic insult by dissolved chemicals since receptor neurons are in direct contact with the aquatic environment. Here, we used electrophysiological techniques to record odor-evoked responses from the sensory epithelium and the olfactory bulb as direct measures of olfactory function in juvenile coho salmon.

Global climate change, urbanization, habitat fragmentation, and pollutants are all contributing to rapid and extensive environmental change and posing significant challenges to many species. An anthropogenic impact of growing concern is exposure to a class of contaminants known as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). EDCs are natural or synthetic compounds that interfere in some way with endogenous hormones responsible for maintaining and regulating myriad phenotypic traits. These contaminants enter aquatic environments through agricultural runoff, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and sewage overflow. They have been shown to alter morphology, physiology, and behavior in exposed organisms. Mangrove ecosystems are often retrofitted with WWTPs due to their natural ability to cycle nutrients; however, little is known of how EDC exposure impacts the organisms that inhabit mangroves. The mangrove rivulus fish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, is a mangrove specialist and a suitable organism in which to study the effects of EDC exposure. Here, I use environmentally relevant concentrations of two prevalent EDCs - ethinyl estradiol, the main synthetic estrogen in contraceptive, and nonylphenol, a widespread compound used in plastics and pesticides - to assess how exposure can alter morphology, physiology, and behavior in juvenile and adult mangrove rivulus, in compound-, dose-, and route-specific ways. I also measure the extent to which exposure alters phenotypic variance-covariance structure, which can inform us about how EDCs trigger coordinated changes in many phenotypic traits, and allows us to better assess how anthropogenic activities might induce opportunities for natural selection to act and drive evolutionary change.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",,Biology;Ecology;Toxicology;Phenotype,NA,NA

Evidence exists that many non target animals in and around agricultural areas are at risk of being affected due to the mobile nature of pesticides and the intermittent nature of pesticide application. The extent to which non-target animals are affected by exposure to two organophosphates (azinphos-methyl and chlorpyrifos) was investigated through monitoring selected biomarker responses and life cycle effects under laboratory conditions in two selected test species. A representative species from both the aquatic and terrestrial environment was used as these two compartments of the environment are inevitably linked due to the mobility of pesticides from the area of application to surrounding areas. The earthworm Eisenia fetida was used as test organism in the terrestrial environment while the fish Oreochromis mossambicus served as representative of the aquatic environment. Juvenile life stages of both species were subjected to standard acute toxicity tests which showed that for both species, juvenile life stages were more sensitive to both pesticides than adults. It was also illustrated that azinphos-methyl is more toxic than chlorpyrifos to both species. Both test species were also subjected to an intermittent exposure regime in order to assess the effects of repeated pesticide application on biomarker, life-cycle and behaviour responses. The results indicated that for similar exposure regimes, azinphos-methyl was more toxic to E. fetida than chlorpyrifos and detrimentally affected all endpoints investigated. The present study suggests that exposure concentration may have a more pronounced effect in inducing a toxic response than exposure interval, irrespective of the pesticide used.

The major focus of the studies presented here is on the impairment of the relatively exposed olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), since their functionality is critical to several indispensable behaviours. The responses of OSNs to various behaviourally-relevant odorants were impaired following exposure to several pesticide classes, including triazine (e.g. atrazine), carbamate (e.g. IPBC), organophosphorus (e.g. dimethoate), and phenylurea (e.g. linuron) pesticides, as well as a pesticide formulation (i.e. Roundup). In many cases, within minutes of exposure to environmentally realistic (part per billion) concentrations, impairments of greater than 50% in OSN responses were noted. Pesticides can selectively affect different OSN classes, since one pesticide (linuron) negatively affected amino acid but not bile salt responses. Lengthy (four-day) exposure to a mixture of pesticides modelled after that found in the Nicomekl River (British Columbia) also reduced OSN responses, confirming that pesticide mixtures found in salmon-producing waterways may be injurious. In fact, the ability to discern a change in odorant intensity was reduced by 25%. This may have partially been due to inadequate neuroprotection, as glutathione-S-transferase, an enzyme that protects against cellular damage, was not upregulated to any greater of an extent than it was in fish given a 10-fold lower exposure concentration. To relate changes in OSN responses to behavioural responses, experiments were conducted on two olfactory-mediated behaviours: an amino acid-evoked searching behaviour, and an anti-predator alarm response. In the first case, exposure to three different pesticides disproportionately impacted searching behaviour with respect to neurological impairment, as the searching response was completely eliminated at greater than 60% impairment of neurological response. In the second case, the freezing behaviour salmon perform after detecting harm in a conspecific was progressively reduced with exposure to increasing concentrations of a carbamate. The work here endeavoured to assess how pesticides affect salmon neurophysiology, then relate the effects to altered behaviours, and finally place the findings within a context of environmental realism, regulations, and the status of salmon within Canada and the world.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",,Pesticides,NA,NA

In Chapter 1, I investigated the separate and combined effects of an acute 4 h exposure of the pyrethroid pesticide esfenvalerate and structural habitat complexity on the behavior and predation risk of larval topsmelt, Atherinops affinis. Larvae were exposed to four nominal esfenvalerate concentrations (control, 0.12, 0.59, 1.18 ppb) before placement into 12 L mesocosms with a predator, the three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Artificial eelgrass was manipulated to create a uniform and patchy distribution of vegetative structure at a low (500 shoots per m2 ) and high density (1000 shoots per m2 ), in addition to the absence of eelgrass. The capture success of predators and aggregative behavior of prey was quantified during the first 10 min of each trial, and mortality of prey was recorded after 60 min. I observed an increase in the proportion of swimming abnormalities of larvae exposed to esfenvalerate. Surprisingly, prey mortality did not increase linearly with pesticide exposure but increased with habitat structure (density of eelgrass), which may have been a consequence of compensating predator behavior. The degree of prey aggregation decreased with both habitat structure and iv pesticide exposure, suggesting that anti-predator behaviors by prey may have been hampered by the interactive effects of both of these factors.

I sought to characterize the impacts of chemical disturbance events occurring at multiple levels of biological organization in anthropogenically impacted freshwater ecosystems.I first evaluated the lethality and sublethal effects of two pesticides: imidacloprid (IMI) and chlorantraniliprole (CHL), as single compounds and binary mixtures, on invertebrates (Daphnia magna) and fish (Pimephales promelas). To explore the effects of complex mixtures, I also conducted exposures as described above on contaminated surface water samples collected near agricultural fields associated with the Salinas River Watershed CA (USA). Analytical chemistry data from surface water samples showed chemicals of emerging concern as common analytes at levels expected to cause detrimental effects on aquatic life. I measured acute toxicity in invertebrates exposed to field-collected surface water, and fish exposed to these water samples had significant changes in expression of genes (RT-qPCR) involved with detoxification and neuromuscular function. Exposure of fish to single compounds or binary mixtures of IMI and CHL led to increased relative gene expression of ryanodine receptors (RyR) in fish. Furthermore, IMI targeted the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in aquatic invertebrates and CHL caused overactivation of RyR in invertebrates and fish. Overall, high levels of invertebrate toxicity and impacts to neuromuscular health in fish are occurring, and pesticides of emerging concern result in detrimental effects in both invertebrates and fish.Based on these findings, I examined behavioral endpoints in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) after the surface water exposures outlined above. I detected differences in both light-induced startle responses and average total distance moved (mm/s), as well as the duration and/or frequency of cruising, bursting and freezing endpoints. These behaviors directly relate to factors influencing survival, feeding and growth, as well as potential for predator avoidance, and thus changes induced by chemical exposure contribute to ecological risk. I detected sublethal and environmentally relevant effects from exposure to contaminated surface waters, which would likely be missed in standard toxicology assessments based on mortality, illustrating the importance of incorporating sublethal endpoints in risk assessments. I then examined behavioral effects of exposure to contaminated surface water before and after a disturbance event (a “first flush” rainstorm at the end of a dry period). I postulated that the swimming behavior of D. magna would be a sensitive bioindicator of exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides of concern (IMI and CHL) under laboratory conditions as well as within complex mixtures in contaminated surface waters. I determined that average total distance moved is a sensitive endpoint for pesticide exposure. Daphnia magna response to light stimulus was the most sensitive endpoint measured. In exposures conducted before the first flush event, I detected strong dose-response patterns, with exposed organisms showing a significantly reduced response compared to controls. After first flush, I measured hypoactivity for all sites. I detected different response patterns to light stimulus for each site tested: negative dose-response, non-monotonic, and positive dose-response patterns, with significantly different responses from controls at all concentrations tested.Having determined sublethal and toxic effects from organismal exposure to water samples collected from the Salinas River Watershed, I sought to evaluate how aquatic biodiversity may be distributed across a chemically impacted watershed, and how diversity estimates obtained from both eDNA metabarcoding and morphological identification would correlate with biotic index scores. I collected eDNA from sediment at sites throughout the Salinas River Watershed, across a range of habitat qualities, and compared the resulting taxonomy with morphological data from a subset of high-diversity sites. I detected sensitive invertebrate taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera; EPT) from morphology and eDNA, with significant overlap (> 76.67%) between methods, but some taxa were missing from the sequence database, highlighting the importance of taxonomic database development. Sequencing detected more benthic macroinvertebrate taxa than morphology when compared at the genus and species levels of taxonomic resolution. Metabarcoding of sampled eDNA detected rare species of concern and invasive species. Impacted sites contained greater numbers of species known to be tolerant to poor water quality, whereas I only detected several sensitive EPT taxa from least impacted reference sites. Hydrologic distance (waterbody) and biotic index score both accounted for > 27% of the dissimilarity in taxa measured between sites. These findings suggest that biotic indices obtained from eDNA metabarcoding data can be effectively incorporated into watershed-wide, multitrophic assessments of freshwater biodiversity.Freshwater ecosystems in urban and agriculturally developed watersheds are simultaneously exposed to chemical mixtures often include new and emerging contaminants of concern, for which toxicological data may be limited. As the complexity of mixtures increases, non-targeted, effect-based evaluations become necessary for determining potential detrimental outcomes. Through my dissertation work I demonstrate that subcellular, organismal and community level effects are induced by pesticides of concern present in surface water.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

The intensive applications of glyphosate-based herbicides  and its half-life in water lead to its presence in many aquatic ecosystems.  Whereas recent studies have reported neurotoxic effects of glyphosate including  autism-related effects, most of them used extremely high (mg/L to g/L)  concentrations, so it is still unclear if chronic, low environmentally relevant  concentrations of this compound (ng/L to μg/L) can induce neurotoxicity. In this  study we analyzed the neurotoxicity of glyphosate in adult zebrafish after  waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 3 μg/L)  for two weeks. Our data showed that exposed fish presented a significant  impairment of exploratory and social behaviors consistent with increased anxiety.  The anterior brain of the exposed fish presented a significant increase in  dopamine and serotonin levels, as well as in the DOPAC/dopamine and homovanillic  acid/dopamine turnover ratios. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in the  dopaminergic system, as th1, th2, comtb, and scl6a3 was downregulated. Finally,  the brain of exposed fish presented a significant increase in the catalase and  superoxide dismutase activities, with a concomitant decrease of glutathione  stores. These changes in the antioxidant defense system are consistent with the  observed increase in oxidative stress, reflected by the increase in the levels of  lipid peroxidation in the brain. The presented results show that current  glyphosate concentrations commonly found in many aquatic ecosystems may have  detrimental consequences on fish survival by decreasing exploration of the  environment or altering social interactions. Furthermore, as zebrafish is also a  vertebrate model widely used in human neurobehavioral studies, these results are  relevant not only for environmental risk assessment, but also for understanding  the risk of chronic low-dose exposures on human health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",10.1016/j.envint.2020.106253,"*Herbicides/toxicity;*Water Pollutants, Chemical/toxicity;Animals;Anxiety/chemically induced;Behavioral impairment;Dopaminergic system;Ecosystem;Glycine/analogs & derivatives;Glyphosate;Humans;Neurotoxicity;Oxidative stress;Oxidative Stress;Zebrafish;Anxiety",NA,NA

Exposure to 10.0 μg/L DCZ significantly  inhibited the contact time between female and male fish, which was mainly  achieved by affecting male fish. The transcription of genes involved in the  hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis was significantly changed after treatment  with DCZ.

Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a  Parkinson’s disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical  spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses  through the blood−brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochondria.  Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the  present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination  with different potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive  behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material  and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT—2.5 µg/L, valproic acid (VPA)—0.5  mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)—250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics  (PROBIO)—3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti-social profile and mirror tests  and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We  observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a)  CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views,  this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal  intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05). Four out of  eight studied groups—(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA—displayed  an impaired, often antithetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on  distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p < 0.05, 0.005, and  0.0005). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT +  PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the  above groups (p > 0.05). Except for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a  normalized trend in terms of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental  groups exhibited exacerbated levels of aggression (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001)  not only near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p < 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001).  Conclusions: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement compared with  (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT-treated zebrafish (e−h).

Excessive and unrestricted use of pesticides is the most  serious threat to aquatic animals including amphibians and fishes. Among the  known pesticides, glyphosate based formulations have been shown to have lethal  effects on many aquatic organisms. However, negative effects of pesticides on  crucial ecological interactions such as prey-predator interactions are relatively  unknown from tropics. In many aquatic organisms, recognition of predators is  based on odor signatures; and therefore any anthropogenic alteration in water  chemistry has the potential to impair recognition and learning of predators.  Through a series of behavioral experiments we evaluated the effect of glyphosate  based herbicide (Roundup®) on the antipredator behavior of common spiny loach,  Lepidocephalichthys thermalis to understand the effects of pesticide-exposure on  recognition of conspecific alarm cues, and associative learning to avoid  predation. We exposed common spiny loach (for 3 h or 15 days) to sub-lethal  concentration (0.5 mg a.e./L) of Roundup® and subsequently with conspecific alarm  cues, signaling the proximity of a predator. Unexposed prey fish showed a  significant reduction in activity level in response to conspecific alarm cues.  Whereas such alarm response was not observed in prey fish that were exposed to  Roundup® either for 3 h or 15 days. Such lack of response could be associated  with alteration of olfactory function in prey individuals. However, this  inability to detect the conspecific alarm cues was found to be transient and  exposed fish recovered within 2 days. In subsequent experiments, we showed that  Roundup® deactivates the conspecific alarm cues thus making them unavailable for  prey to evoke the response. Furthermore, Roundup® mediated degradation of  conspecific alarm cues and diminished the associative learning necessary for  detection of the invasive/unknown/novel predators. Overall, due to the worldwide  occurrence of glyphosate in water bodies, glyphosate mediated behavioral  suppression exposes the prey animals to a considerable risk of predation, both by  native and non-native predators.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",10.1007/s10646-018-02011-z,"Animals;Association Learning/*drug effects;Chemical cues;Cues;Cypriniformes/*physiology;Food Chain;Glycine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives;Glyphosate;Herbicides/*adverse effects;Learning;Olfactory Perception/*drug effects;Pesticides;Recognition, Psychology/*drug effects;Sub-lethal;Tilapia;Time Factors;Prednisolone",NA,NA

Herein, the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was  continuously exposed to environmentally realistic levels of diuron from the  fertilised egg stage to the adult stage. Behavioural evaluation of adult marine  medaka indicated that exposure to diuron increased anxiety in the light-dark test  and increased predator avoidance. In addition, diuron exposure significantly  reduced aggression, social interaction, shoaling, and learning and memory  ability. However, only negligible variations in foraging behaviour and in  behaviour in the novel tank test were observed. Marine medaka chronically exposed  to diuron also showed decreased levels of dopamine in the brain, and changes were  observed in the transcription of genes related to dopamine synthesis, degradation  and receptors. Exposure to 5000 ng/L diuron caused significant downregulation of  the expression of the genes of tyrosine hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase and  significantly upregulated the expression of the genes of the D(5) dopaminergic  receptor. The relative expression of the D(4) dopaminergic receptor was  significantly upregulated in the 50, 500 and 5000 ng/L diuron-treated groups.

One  component frequently found in current products against harmful species to crops  is rotenone whose effect under prolonged exposure has been demonstrated to cause  neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The latest reports have  indeed revealed that rotenone promotes Parkinson's in humans, but studies aiming  to show congruent effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) are lacking. Material and  Methods. In this context, the aim of the present study was to demonstrate how  chronic administration of rotenone for 3 weeks impairs the locomotor activity and  sociability and induces oxidative stress in zebrafish. RESULTS: There were no  statistically significant differences following the analysis of their social  interaction and locomotor tests (p > 0.05). However, several exceptions have been  noted in the control, rotenone, and probiotics groups when we compared their  locomotor activity during the pretreatment and treatment interval (p < 0.05). We  further assessed the role of rotenone in disturbing the detoxifying system as  represented by three enzymes known as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione  peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Despite the fact that there were no  statistically significant changes within SOD and GPx levels between the control  group and rotenone, probiotics, and rotenone + probiotics (p > 0.05), relevant  changes have been observed between the analyzed groups (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005,  respectively). On the other hand, significant differences (p < 0.05) have been  observed for MDA when we analyzed the data between the control group and the  other three groups.

Adult fish were exposed  continuously for either two or 5 weeks (10-30 nM DDT, 0.3-3 μM CPF), with short-  and long-term effects assessed at 1-week post-exposure and at 14 months of age  respectively. The behavioral test battery included tests of locomotor activity,  tap startle, social behavior, anxiety, predator avoidance and learning. Long-term  effects on neurochemical indices of cholinergic function were also assessed. Two  weeks of DDT exposure had only slight effects on locomotor activity, while a  longer five-week exposure led to hypoactivity and increased anxiety-like diving  responses and predator avoidance at 1-week post-exposure. When tested at  14 months of age, these fish showed hypoactivity and increased startle responses.  Cholinergic function was not found to be significantly altered by DDT. The  two-week CPF exposure led to reductions in anxiety-like diving and increases in  shoaling responses at the 1-week time point, but these effects did not persist  through 14 months of age. Nevertheless, there were persistent decrements in  cholinergic presynaptic activity. A five-week CPF exposure led to long-term  effects including locomotor hyperactivity and impaired predator avoidance at  14 months of age, although no effects were apparent at the 1-week time point.  These studies documented neurobehavioral effects of adult exposure to chronic  doses of either organochlorine or organophosphate pesticides that can be  characterized in zebrafish.

Additive tests were run to  check the behavioral responses of previously unexposed goldfish to the flow of a  solution of atrazine- or diuron-contaminated water, at three concentrations (0.1,  1, 10 mg/L). Significant burst swimming reactions appeared in response to a 24-h  exposure to atrazine, at the lowest concentration tested (0.5 microgram/L). A  24-h exposure to 5 microgram/L atrazine or diuron was found to induce various  significant behavioral alterations in fish. At this concentration, both  herbicides decreased grouping behavior and atrazine also increased surfacing  activity. Herbicide-exposed fish showed a decreased grouping behavior during the  flow of the skin extract solution. Sheltering was also decreased during the flow  of the biological solution in fish exposed to atrazine. Moreover, fish exposed to  diuron clearly displayed attraction responses to the flow of the skin solution.  Previously unexposed fish showed a significant increase in burst swimming  reactions in response to the flow of a solution of atrazine- or  diuron-contaminated water, at all concentrations tested (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L).  Furthermore, the diuron-contaminated flow was found to be significantly  attractive at the highest concentration. These results indicate that a short-term  exposure to a relatively low concentration (5 microgram/L) of atrazine or diuron  can affect various behaviors of fish not only directly but also indirectly by  altering the chemical perception of natural substances of eco-ethological  importance.

However, in the  last 50 years, the effects of chemicals on the behavior of model species have  been actively investigated. Progressively, behavioral endpoints were incorporated  into neurotoxicological screening protocols, and these functional outcomes are  now routinely used to identify and determine the potential neurotoxicity of  chemicals. Behavioral assays in adult zebrafish provide a standardized and  reliable means to study a wide range of behaviors, including anxiety, social  interaction, learning, memory, and addiction. Behavioral assays in adult  zebrafish typically involve placing the fish in an experimental arena and  recording and analyzing their behavior using video tracking software. Fish can be  exposed to various stimuli, and their behavior can be quantified using a variety  of metrics. The novel tank test is one of the most accepted and widely used tests  to study anxiety-like behavior in fish. The shoaling and social preference tests  are useful in studying the social behavior of zebrafish. This assay is  particularly interesting since the behavior of the entire shoal is studied. These  assays have proven to be highly reproducible and sensitive to pharmacological and  genetic manipulations, making them valuable tools for studying the neural  circuits and molecular mechanisms underlying behavior. Additionally, these assays  can be used in drug screening to identify compounds that may be potential  modulators of behavior. We will show in this work how to apply behavioral tools  in fish neurotoxicology, analyzing the effect of methamphetamine, a recreational  drug, and glyphosate, an environmental pollutant.

Variations in  environmental conditions, as those caused by contaminants, may lead to  neurochemical impairments altering the pattern of the behavioural repertoire of  the species. Atrazine (ATZ) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture that is  frequently detected in surface water, affecting non-target species. The zebrafish  is a valuable model organism to assess behavioural and neurochemical effects of  different contaminants since it presents a robust behavioural repertoire and also  all major neurotransmitter systems described for mammalian species. The goal of  this study was to evaluate the effects of subchronic ATZ exposure in defensive  behaviours of zebrafish (shoaling, thigmotaxis, and depth preference) using the  split depth tank. Furthermore, to investigate a putative role of cholinergic  signalling on ATZ-mediated effects, we tested whether this herbicide alters  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain and muscle preparations. Fish were  exposed to ATZ for 14days and the following groups were tested: control (0.2%  acetone) and ATZ (10 and 1000μg/L). The behaviour of four animals in the same  tank was recorded for 6min and biological samples were prepared. Our results  showed that 1000μg/L ATZ significantly increased the inter-fish distance, as well  as the nearest and farthest neighbour distances. This group also presented an  increase in the shoal area with decreased social interaction. No significant  differences were detected for the number of animals in the shallow area, latency  to enter the shallow and time spent in shallow and deep areas of the apparatus,  but the ATZ 1000 group spent significantly more time near the walls. Although ATZ  did not affect muscular AChE, it significantly reduced AChE activity in brain.  Exposure to 10μg/L ATZ did not affect behaviour or AChE activity. These data  suggest that ATZ impairs defensive behaviours of zebrafish, which could be  related to its action on brain cholinergic neurotransmission. Moreover, the use  of the split depth tank could be an alternative strategy to assess group  behaviour and depth preference after exposure to chemical compounds.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""adults?""]}",10.1016/j.ntt.2014.05.006,"Acetylcholinesterase;Acetylcholinesterase/*metabolism;Animals;Atrazine;Atrazine/administration & dosage/*toxicity;Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Brain/*drug effects/enzymology;Exploratory activity;Herbicides/administration & dosage/*toxicity;Shoaling behaviour;Zebrafish;Brain",NA,NA

Zebrafish larvae aged 4 days  post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed for 24 h at 10 µg/L (0.01 ppm) and 100 µg/L  (0.1 ppm) of PBZ, respectively, and adults were incubated at 100 µg/L (0.1 ppm)  and 1000 µg/L (1 ppm) concentrations of PBZ, respectively, for fourteen days.  After incubation, the locomotor activity, burst, and rotation movement for the  larvae; and multiple behavioral tests such as novel tank exploration, mirror  biting, shoaling, predator avoidance, and social interaction for adult zebrafish  were evaluated. Brain tissues of the adult fish were dissected and subjected to  biochemical analyses of the antioxidant response, oxidative stress, superoxide  dismutase (SOD), and neurotransmitter levels. Zebrafish larvae exposed to PBZ  exhibited locomotion hyperactivity with a high burst movement and swimming  pattern. In adult zebrafish, PBZ resulted in anxiolytic exploratory behavior,  while no significant results were found in social interaction, shoal making, and  predator avoidance behaviors. Interestingly, high dose PBZ exposure significantly  compromised the innate aggressive behavior of the adult fish. Biochemical assays  for oxidative stress, antioxidant response, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed  significant reductions in their relative contents. In conclusion, for the first  time, our behavior assays revealed that chronic PBZ exposure induced behavioral  alterations in both larvae and the adult zebrafish.

In our current study, zebrafish, an ideal model  animal for behavioral studies, were exposed to cyprodinil from fertilization to  240 days postfertilization at 0.1 μg/L (environmentally relevant concentration)  and 1, 10 μg/L. Firstly, we observed that aggressive behavior of zebrafish was  significantly enhanced after exposure to 0.1-10 μg/L cyprodinil and antipredator  behavior was decreased after exposure. Cyprodinil exposure altered the  adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels, which regulate cortisol  homeostasis and were significantly reduced in all exposure groups (0.1-10 μg/L).  In addition, most of the key genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal gland  axis, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone and melanocortin 2 receptor, were  downregulated significantly in all exposure groups, which was consistent with the  hormone levels. In addition, in the hypothalamus, the number of apoptotic cells  increased in a dose-dependent manner in the cyprodinil exposure groups. Moreover,  these changes were potentially responsible for the increased aggression of  zebrafish during the mirror-like aggressive test and for the reduced antipredator  behavior during the predator avoidance test.

Environmental pollutants, notably endocrine disrupting compounds,  can interfere with the proper functioning of hormones, thereby impacting the  expression of hormonally regulated traits. Atrazine, one of the most widely used  herbicides, can alter sex hormone levels in exposed animals. I tested the effects  of environmentally relevant atrazine exposures on mating signals and behaviors in  male guppies, a sexually dimorphic freshwater fish. Prolonged atrazine exposure  reduced the expression of two honest signals: the area of orange spots  (ornaments) and the number of courtship displays performed. Atrazine exposure  also reduced aggression towards competing males in the context of mate  competition. In the wild, exposure levels vary among individuals because of  differential distribution of the pollutants across habitats; hence, differently  impacted males often compete for the same mates. Disrupted mating signals can  reduce reproductive success as females avoid mating with perceptibly suboptimal  males. Less aggressive males are at a competitive disadvantage and lose access to  females. This study highlights the effects of atrazine on ecologically relevant  mating signals and behaviors in exposed wildlife. Altered reproductive traits  have important implications for population dynamics, evolutionary patterns, and  conservation of wildlife species.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Rhiannon""=>[""control?

Behavioral data was acquired and analyzed  by idTracker and MATLAB. By comparing the effects of all treatments on behavior  parameters, we confirmed that the spatial distribution was more easily altered  rather than general locomotor parameters, e.g. 0.7-70 mg/L PTZ and 5-20 mg/L  paraquat being effective for altering spatial distribution but having little  effects on general locomotor parameters. Based on the heatmap, i.e., the  cumulative proportion of grids and that of frequency in grids, we calculated the  behavioral Gini coefficient (G(b)) for quantitative assessment of fish spatial  distribution. The Gini coefficient ranged from zero to 1, with larger values  meaning poorer evenness of spatial distribution. Of note, G(b) showed smaller  coefficient of variations (CV) with 3%-19% between replicate tanks in all  treatments than the highest frequency (4%-79%), displaying well robustness.

Overall, the behavioral Gini coefficient we established is an ideal  parameter to quantitatively assess spatial distribution of fish shoal, which is  expected to be applied in toxicity testing for chemicals and wastewater and  automatic quality monitoring for surface water and aquaculture water.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Maybe""}",10.1016/j.jes.2023.06.002,"*Wastewater;*Zebrafish;Animals;Behavior, Animal;Behavioral Gini coefficient;Behavioral test;Paraquat/pharmacology;Spatial distribution;Water;Zebrafish",NA,NA

D. and Andreu, E.",,eng,,,"The present communication deals with the effects of fenitrothion (0.02 mg/liter) on the energy metabolism of the European eel, Anguilla anguilla, and its recovery  from intoxication. Various parameters such as glycogen, lactate, proteins, and  glucose levels were measured in different eel tissues after 2, 8, 12, 24, 32, 48,  56, 72, and 96 hr of fenitrothion exposure. Subsequently, the fish were allowed  recovery periods of 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 144, and 192 hr in clean water, and  the same parameters were evaluated. Liver glycogen content showed no significant  changes during the exposure time, while blood glucose levels increased markedly.  Gill, liver, and blood lactate values increased during pesticide exposure, while  proteins decreased in comparison to unexposed controls. Most of the metabolic  disorders did not persist after eels were allowed to recover in clean water for  less than a week. The observed effects of fenitrothion on fish metabolism are  discussed in relation to a stress syndrome, as are probable reasons for  alterations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Maybe"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Excluded""}",10.1006/eesa.1996.1488,Analysis of Variance;Anguilla/*metabolism;Animals;Blood Glucose/analysis/metabolism;Blood Proteins/analysis/metabolism;Energy Metabolism/*drug effects;Fenitrothion/administration & dosage/metabolism/*toxicity;Gills/drug effects/metabolism;Glycogen/analysis/metabolism;Insecticides/administration & dosage/metabolism/*toxicity;Lactic Acid/blood/metabolism;Liver/drug effects/metabolism;Tissue Distribution;Organophosphates;Insecticides,NA,NA
