Fishes are affected by exposure to these pesticides. The present study was conducted to determine the toxicity of lambda cyhalothrin on the kidney, liver & testis and biochemical, hematological, behavioural parameters of Clarias batrachus. Control group fed with normal diet and kept for 15 and 30 days. The treated groups included normal diet along with 1.33µg L-1 of Lambda-cyhalothrin for 15 days and 30 days. The treatment group exhibited disrupted shoaling behaviour characterized by irregular, erratic, and darting swimming movements and loss of equilibrium. Administration of lambda cyhalothrin also causes damage to the tissues of the testes, kidney and liver. Marked changes in the histoarchitecture of these organs were observed. All these results suggest that the lambda cyhalothrin induced changes in C. batrachus directly or indirectly by modulating the physiological functions in the fishes. © 2015 Informatics Publishing Limited and The Society of Toxicology.

In the present experiment, reproductive behavior and milt volumes of precocious brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) male parr were studied in a large stream aquarium after exposure to the olfactory-disturbing fungicide 15 mu g l(-1) IPBC (iodocarb; 3-iodo-2-propynyl butyl carbamate) for 96 h. The statistical analyses did not reveal any significant differences for time attending females between controls and IPBC-exposed males. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in milt volumes. However, when taking all fish into consideration, there were significant differences in milt volumes between parr that had been attending females and those had not been attending females. Controls that had attended females had significantly higher milt volumes than controls or IPBC-exposed males that had not attended females. Taking all control and IPBC parr into consideration, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between time attended females and volume of milt and gonadosomatic index (GSI), respectively. In summary, 15 mu g l(-1) IPBC did not have any significant effects on mature male parr reproductive behavior and milt volumes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Marcus""=>""Included"", ""Kyle ""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10695-020-00803-x,Iodocarb;Milt volumes;Olfaction;Reproductive behavior;Salmo trutta;SPAWNING BEHAVIOR;PYRETHROID PESTICIDE;ENDOCRINE RESPONSES;OLFACTORY-BULB;CRUCIAN CARP;COPPER;PHEROMONES;TOXICITY;PROSTAGLANDINS;NEUROTOXICITY;Reproductive Behavior;Carbamates,NA,NA

Endpoints included swimming activity, social interaction within fish school and fish distribution. Results showed that the swimming speed of zebrafish increased significantly when exposed to the two toxicants. The swimming speed increased from 30~60 mm·s-1 to 60~85 mm·s-1 within the first thirty minutes exposure, and then immediately decreased to 20 mm·s-1. The swimming depth decreased after 12 minutes exposure. Under chronic exposure, the communication patterns between fish were changed, and the swimming distance and dispersion increased by 43.5% and 120.0%, respectively. Zebrafish preferred swimming and staying on the water surface with lower toxic concentration. The vision-based real-time zebrafish swimming pattern monitoring method combined the calculation of swimming speed, depth, distance between fish, dispersion and time spend in different areas, therefore is a more comprehensive and effective system than the traditional individual fish and single endpoint monitoring method to give the early warning signal of water contamination.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: J.
