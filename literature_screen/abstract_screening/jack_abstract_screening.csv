A third experiment in 2004 compared the effect on navel orangeworm damage to several almond varieties using one of these dispensing systems by itself or with phosmet, phosmet alone, and an untreated control. Additional data are presented estimating release rates from timed aerosol release devices (PuffersNOW, Suterra LLC, Bend, OR) and hand-applied membrane dispensers. In 2003, puffers placed peripherally around 16-ha blocks, evenly spaced Puffers, and hand-applied dispensers reduced males captured in virgin-baited traps by ≥95% and mating in sentinel females by &69%, with evenly placed Puffers showing greater reduction of males captured and females mated compared with the other dispensing systems. Mating disruption with gridded Puffers or hand-applied devices in almonds resulted in an ≈37% reduction of navel orangeworm damage (not significant), whereas peripheral Puffers resulted in a 16% reduction of navel orangeworm damage to almonds. In pistachios neither peripheral nor gridded Puffers reduced navel orangeworm damage, whereas insecticide reduced damage by 56%. In 2004, Puffers alone, insecticide alone, and both in combination significantly reduced navel orangeworm damage in Nonpareil almonds. In other, later harvested varieties, the insecticide treatments reduced damage, whereas the mating disruption treatment alone did not. We discuss application of these findings to management of navel orangeworm in these two crops.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 43; Correspondence Address: C.S.

European officials have turned to Duane Huggett, an assistant professor of biology at the University of North Texas, to develop a new, more-efficient screening process for potentially hazardous chemicals. At issue is whether a chemical will move up a food chain. The pesticide DDT, used widely in the 1940s and 1950s, is a prime example of a chemical that magnified in the food chain, possibly poisoning wildlife and the environment and endangering human health. The experiment accurately predicts whether chemicals will move up the food chain, but it is expensive, time consuming and uses a lot of fish.

The effects of different concentrations of the antifoulant Mexel®432 (0.5, 1 and 2 mg L-1) on osmoregulation (osmolality and Na+/K+-ATPase activity) and stress parameters (cortisol, glucose, and lactate) were assessed in juveniles of the flatfish Solea senegalensis. Gill histopathology and alterations due to oxidative stress (increased lipid peroxidation, LPO, levels) at branchial and hepatic levels were also considered. Other parameters tested were the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, CAT; glutathione peroxidase, GPX; and glutathione reductase, GR), xenobiotic metabolism defenses involved in detoxification (carboxylesterase, CbE; 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, EROD; and glutathione S-transferase, GST) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Significant variations in osmoregulatory parameters, histological lesions and decreased branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity were observed in exposed fish. Other gill biomarkers presented little or no significant variations in relation to controls. In contrast, hepatic parameters, such as CAT activity, were inhibited while EROD activity was initially elevated but after longer exposures it recovered basal values.

Research into the insidious effects of the dinoflagellates Pfiesteria piscicida (the fish killer) that thrive in waters over-enriched with nutrients, has received considerable attention by both the media and government agencies concerned with public and environmental health. After nearly two decades of research, the question of whether Pfiesteria can be regarded the 'causative agent' of massive fish kills in the estuaries of the US mid-Atlantic could not be scientifically settled. In contrast to policymakers, who attribute the absence of a scientific consensus to gaps in scientific knowledge and uncertainties regarding the identity and behavior of the potentially toxic dinoflagellates, I propose that an inseparable entanglement of Pfiesteria's identities and their toxic activities challenges conventional notions of causality that seek to establish a connection between independent events in linear time. Building on Karen Barad's framework of agential realism, I argue for a move from epistemological uncertainties to ontological indeterminacies that follow from Pfiesteria's contributions to agency, as the condition for responsible and objective science. In tracking discrepant experimental enactments of Pfiesteria that have been mobilized as evidence for and against their toxicity, I investigate how criteria for what counts as evidence get built into the experimental apparatuses and suggest that the joint possibilities of causality and responsibility vary with the temporalities of the objects enacted. This discussion seeks to highlight a thorough entanglement of epistemic/ontological concerns with the ecological/political relevance of particular experiments. Finally, I introduce a new kind of scientific object that - borrowing from Derrida - I call phantomatic. Phantoms don't emerge as such, but appear as traces and are associated with specific matters of concern. © The Author(s), 2010.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 90; Correspondence Address: A.

Wetland insect predators can structure aquatic prey communities via selective predation, but receive considerably less attention than vertebrate predators. We conducted laboratory experiments to test selective predation by two species of larval dytiscid beetles (Agabus; Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) and the potential contribution of these beetles to suppression of mosquito populations in constructed wetlands. 2. Agabus consumed copepods, ostracods and mosquito larvae in no-choice tests. When offered a choice, 76% of all prey consumed were mosquito larvae, indicating selective predation. Subsequent experiments revealed this preference was due to ease of capture of mosquito larvae over alternative prey. 3. Cannibalism and intraguild predation were common within and between species of Agabus, which may reduce the overall impact of the observed selective predation. 4. Agabus larvae selectively preyed on mosquito larvae over alternative prey, which is not characteristic of some fish used as biological control agents for mosquitoes. Predator exclusion or similar experiments in the field could document how these results translate into a natural setting. 5. The findings of this study suggest developing mosquito suppression strategies focused on conservation of native wetland predators.

In the former program, there were three or more applications of organophosphate per year for the control of codling moth. The latter program relies on applying codling moth pheromone dispensers (hand-applied dispensers or aerosol puffers) and selective insecticides to supplement mating disruption when needed. The reduction in use of broad-spectrum insecticides resulted in a decrease of pear psylla (Cacopsylla pyricola) and two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) populations with a decrease in pesticide use for these pests. However, there have been sporadic increases of the following secondary pests: oblique-banded leafroller (Choristoneura rosaceana), western boxelder bug (Boisea rubrolienata), consperse sting bugs (Euschistus conspersus), pear rust mite (Epitrimerus pyri), pear sawfly (Caliroea cerasi), and katydids (Phaneroptera nana and Scuderria furcata). We detailed the shift in insecticide use for the ten years of the program. Operating costs for each of the ten years studied in orchards under the mating disruption program declined compared to the conventional insecticide program. Savings were minimal during the first two years of transitioning into mating disruption program, but became significant beginning in the third year. From the third year on, savings were $247 to $511/ha per year.

Animals acquire new skills due to conditioned responses resulting from a sequence of neutral and unconditioned stimuli affecting their bodies; there is a constant time interval between the stimuli. Both stimuli become associated after a number of repetitions and animal bodies start to respond to the initially neutral stimulus as to the unconditioned one. The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure of fish to a pyrethroid-deltamethrin (an active ingredient in Decis 2.5 EC pesticide that disturbs the proper operation of the nervous system) affects the ability to learn in common carp. Materials and Methods. Production of new types of behaviour was triggered in fish by using the unconditioned stimulus (an irritating electric impulse) and the conditioned stimulus (light). The experiment was performed in a tank divided into two compartments where fish could swim freely from one compartment to another. The ability to learn was assessed on the basis of the following types of behaviour evoked in response to the conditioned stimulus: Locomotor agitation, preference to occupy or avoid certain areas in the tank, an escape response, etc. Results. In fish exposed to 0.35 μg · L-1 deltamethrin (for common carp concentration 10 times lower than lethal) for 35 min the ability to produce and remember the conditioned defence response was reduced and time interval since presenting the conditioned stimulus till occurring the initial signs of the conditioned response was prolonged. Conclusion. The classical conditioning method revealed that sublethal concentration of deltamethrin restricted ability to learn and retain information in common carp, despite absence of observable intoxication symptoms.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: R.

Any environmental exposure to toxaphene in this century is to environmentally degraded forms of toxaphene, termed weathered toxaphene. Several hundred chlorinated bornane congeners have been identified in technical toxaphene. The degradation of technical toxaphene to weathered toxaphene can result in various congener mixtures, but the primary mode of degradation is dechlorination. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) presently estimates the risk of exposure to toxaphene by relying upon rat and mouse toxicology studies performed on technical toxaphene. No adjustment is made for the dechlorination of toxaphene in the environment. The European Union (EU), however, has modeled toxaphene risks from eating fish with chlorinated bornane residues through a series of studies on toxaphene degraded by either ultraviolet light, or biodegradation in fish. The EU risk assessment relies upon rat liver studies in vivo and mouse in vitro studies on the inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC).

In contrast, rabbiteye blueberries, which comprise a large majority of the blueberry acreage in the Southeast, are native to the region and are well adapted to cope with its challenging climate, poor soils, and extensive pest complexes. Although rabbiteye blueberries are resistant to several important diseases affecting other blueberry species, all rabbiteye cultivars appear susceptible to mummy berry disease and most are affected by one or more foliar diseases such as Septoria leaf spot, Gloeosporium leaf spot, and/or leaf rust. This article briefly reviews old and new approaches for controlling these diseases organically. Mummy berry can be managed by pathogen exclusion, soil cultivation against overwintering primary inoculum, and application of a Bacillus subtilis-based biofungicide against secondary infection of flowers. For foliar diseases, host resistance is the first line of defense, whereas fish oil-based biofungicides have provided promising levels of disease suppression on susceptible cultivars.

Following the banning of DDT, this population exhibited significant spatial variation in growth rates, with the fastest and slowest rates occurring in the lowest and highest salinity areas, respectively. Because salinity can influence fish distributions, we quantitatively analyzed Osprey diet composition along the gradient in the Chesapeake Bay to determine if variation in foraging ecology contributed to this pattern of population recovery. We recorded >1800 hr of food-provisioning behavior for 25 pairs within nine study areas that were classified as either upper estuarine (<5 parts per thousand [ppt] salinity) or lower estuarine (>18 ppt). Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) and seatrouts (Cynoscion spp.) were dominant dietary components for pairs within lower-estuarine reaches, whereas gizzard shad (Darosoma cepedianum) and catfish (Ictaluridae) dominated upper-estuarine diets. Lower-estuarine prey fish averaged 6% shorter (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: D = 0.203, P = 0.004), 34% lighter (D = 0.305, P < 0.001), and 40% lower in energy content (D = 0.247, P < 0.001) than their upper-estuarine counterparts.

Survival was more severely reduced in the continuous than in the pulse exposure regimes. The lethal concentrations (3d median lethal concentration [LC50] values) were 233, 2.33, and 1.14 μg/L after 1-h, 24-h, and continuous exposure, respectively. The shapes of the concentration-response relationships for survival were significantly different after 1 h of exposure than after 24-h and continuous exposure. Indeed, the slopes of the curves defined by the ratios LC90/LC10 (ratio of 90 and 10% lethal concentrations) were 100, 1.74, and 1.97 for 1-h, 24-h, and continuous exposure, respectively. The large difference between 1 h and longer durations of exposure shows that the population is partially affected (10-90%) over a much broader range of concentrations when exposure is short. Negative effects on reproductive outputs occurred mostly at concentrations affecting partly the survival and therefore also over a broad range of concentrations after 1 h of exposure. However, these effects were only transient in the pulse exposure regimes as individual performances recovered. By contrast, reproductive outputs of survivors exposed continuously remained impaired. These results suggest that a refined risk assessment should consider exposure duration because it influences the magnitude of effects and recovery. © 2006 SETAC.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: S.

In the present study it was analysed the hepatic levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in males and females of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus exposed to paraquat (PQ), at 17 and 27 °C. Tilapia were exposed to a sublethal concentration of PQ (0.5 mg L-1) during 45 days. Condition factor and hepatosomatic index of males and females exposed to PQ were significantly higher when compared with the control group, except in females at 17 °C. SOD and GST activities were higher in males and females exposed to PQ than in the control group at 17 and 27 °C. The levels of both enzyme activities revealed that they are sex-dependent with males exposed to PQ showing higher SOD activity (5.05 ± 0.13 and 4.84 ± 0.23 U/g protein, respectively at 17 and 27 °C) than females (4.21 ± 0.07 and 3.87 ± 0.27 U/g protein, respectively at the same temperature). Similar results were observed in GST activity. A GR activity significantly higher (9.09 ± 0.44 and 7.97 ± 1.08 U/g protein at 17 and 27 °C, respectively) was observed in PQ-exposed females, but not in exposed males. Fish exposed to PQ showed higher values of SOD and GST activities than the control group at both temperatures. These results are gender-dependent, while GR activity was higher only in PQ-exposed females. No significant differences were found for SOD, GST and GR activities between fish exposed to 17 and 27 °C, although males and females showed higher values at 17 °C.

This includes Germany where lymphocytic choriomeningitis, hantavirosis, leptospirosis, tularemia, Haverhill fever, and salmonellosis (mainly food-borne) are endemic. Due to their medical impact and potential pathogenicity, human infections with hantavirosis, leptospirosis, tularemia, and salmonellosis are notifiable in Germany. Though human infections with RBD do occur, they presently are not ""epidemic"" in Germany. However, changes in environmental and/or social conditions have the potential to change this, for example epidemics of RBD have been associated with military conflicts, e. g. during the recent civil war in the Balkans hantavirosis, leptosprirosis and tularemia reaches epidemic proportions, partly because of the social upheaval resulting in a high abundance of rodents associated with the conflict. Outbreaks and epidemics of RBD also may occur during climatic changes, especially after heavy rainfall and floodings. Outbreaks of RBD can be very complex, and defining their chains of transmission, possible impacts on human health and means to control them requires an understanding of many factors, including: communicability and tenacity of the disease agent, the species-specific bionomics of the rodent vector, the host-pathogen relationship in the rodent reservoir, human behaviour(s) that may affect contact with rodent reservoirs and RBD and hygienic and climatic conditions. The German Infection Prevention Act, a public health regulation, defines responsibilities for notification of and countermeasures against infectious diseases, including RBD. § 17 of this regulation directs public health authorities to undertake activities to control infections, including through direct control of RBD and their reservoirs, and § 18 sets out the means by which control can be achieved. Actions taking under this regulation are directed by public health authorities, and may be particularly important where vulnerable populations are at risk, e. g., hospitals, schools, or retirement facilities. For RBD, one of the main countermeasures is the use of rodenticides to control rodent reservoir. Under direction from medical authority, rodenticides and application methods identified at § 18 must be used to mitigate the risk of RBD. Products and techniques identified on this list have demonstrated efficacy against rodent reservoirs. Despite the potential requirement to use these products, they are not often used by health or pest control professionals. It is not known whether this reflects poor knowledge of the law for the prevention of infection, poor knowledge of rodent-control products by health professionals, and/or a failure to recognize or fully elucidate the potential risks presented by RBD in Germany. To address these points requires several efforts, including: a national reference center for RBD and further scientific studies and education on rodents and RBD regarding transmission modes, risks to human health, and countermeasures that can be used to mitigate risk.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: M.K.

Data sources: Major electronic databases and three trials registers were searched from May to June 2005. Three conference abstract databases were searched in December 2005. Industry submissions. Review methods: Studies evaluating the clinical effectiveness of AIs against 5 years' tamoxifen treatment were included and critically appraised. The review of the health economics of AIs in early breast cancer in comparison with standard therapies included a review of existing economic evaluations of the relevant therapies, a critique of each of the economic evaluations submitted to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) by pharmaceutical manufacturers and a detailed explanation of the methodologies and results of the authors' economic model. The three treatment strategies (primary adjuvant therapy, unplanned switch therapy and extended adjuvant therapy) were considered separately within the authors' economic analysis. Results: A meta-analysis of three trials found a significant difference in overall survival when an unplanned anastrozole switching strategy was compared with 5 years' tamoxifen. Significant improvements in overall survival are yet to be demonstrated in other strategies. Compared with 5 years' tamoxifen, disease-free survival (disease recurrence or death from any cause) was significantly improved in the primary adjuvant setting with anastrozole and letrozole, and with an exemestane switching strategy. Other trials did not report this outcome. Breast cancer recurrence (censoring death as an event) was significantly improved with primary adjuvant anastrozole and letrozole, anastrozole switching, extended adjuvant anastrozole or letrozole. The AIs and tamoxifen have different side-effect profiles, with tamoxifen responsible for small but statistically significant increases in endometrial cancer and, sometimes, thromboembolic events and stroke. AIs show a trend towards increases in osteoporosis, the statistical significance of which increases with follow-up time. The absence of tamoxifen treatment also increases the risk of hypercholesterolaemia and cardiac events in postmenopausal women. There was no significant difference in overall health-related quality of life between standard treatment and either primary adjuvant anastrozole and extended adjuvant letrozole strategies. The cost-effectiveness results for AIs compared with tamoxifen in the primary adjuvant setting, are estimated to be between £21,000 and £32,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) based on an analysis over 35 years. There is currently no trial evidence for exemestane in this setting. The cost-effectiveness results for anastrozole and exemestane, compared with tamoxifen in the unplanned switching setting, are estimated to be £23,200 and £19,200 per QALY, respectively, based on an analysis over 35 years. There is currently no trial evidence for letrozole in this setting. In the extended adjuvant setting, the cost per QALY for letrozole compared with placebo is estimated to be £9800, based on an analysis over 35 years. All these results are considered to be conservative. In the base case it is assumed that the benefits of AIs over tamoxifen or placebo seen during the therapy period are gradually lost during the following 10 years. An alternative scenario, the 'benefits maintained' scenario, is tested in sensitivity analysis. Here it is assumed that following the treatment period the annual rate of recurrence in both arms is the same. This reduces the cost-effectiveness ratio by over 50%, to around £10,000-12,000, £5000 and £3000 in the primary adjuvant, unplanned switching and extended adjuvant setting, respectively. The limited evidence to date of benefits after the therapy period suggests that the 'benefits maintained' scenario may be realistic. The results from the economic analyses within the industry submissions are generally lower than the results from the authors' model and are close to or below £12,000 in all three settings. The authors' analyses generally produce a lower estimate of QALY gain for the aromatase inhibitors, due to the more conservative assumption regarding benefits, along with differences in the utility values used in the their analysis. Conclusions: On the basis of the current data and within their licensed indications, AIs can be considered clinically effective compared with standard tamoxifen treatment. However, their long-term effects, in terms of both benefits and harms, remain unclear. Under the conservative assumption that benefits gained by AIs during the treatment period are gradually lost over the following 10 years, the cost per QALY for AIs compared with tamoxifen is estimated to be between £21,000 and £2,000 in the primary adjuvant setting and around £20,000 in the unplanned switch setting. The cost per QALY for AIs compared with placebo in the extended adjuvant setting is estimated to be around £10,000. Under the less conservative assumption that rates of recurrence are the same in both arms after the therapy period is complete, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are typically at least 50% lower, suggesting that AIs are likely to be considered cost-effective in all three settings.

The harmful effects of pollutants on species inhabiting these estuarine zones are not well known. Among marine species, bivalve mollusks - particularly Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas - may serve a model of interest. The species is sedentary and filter-feeding, which favors bioaccumulation of pollutants in their tissues. Oysters may be suitable for studies on disturbance by pollutants of physiological activities, among which defense mechanisms are poorly documented in bivalves. In this study, effects of pollutants on hemocyte functions were monitored in Pacific oyster, C. gigas. Hemocytes were exposed in vitro to selected pollutants. The strategy for investigating the effects of pollutants on hemocyte functions is based on several biomarkers, which is more relevant than that of published papers based on single-endpoint experiments. Pollutants belonging to the most important groups of xenobiotics (PAHs, PCBs, and pesticides) were selected and their effect on hemocyte activities was analyzed using flow cytometry. Twenty-three pollutants were tested and eight of them showed significant modulation of hemocyte activities. PAHs and PCB 77 induced a decrease of hemocyte activity after an incubation periods of 4 and 24 h at 200 μmol/L. Three pesticides (2,4D, paraoxon, and chlorothalonil) modulated hemocyte activities. A mixture of eight pesticides also decreased phagocytotic activity. This study is one of the first to investigate the effects of so many pollutants on hemocyte functions at the same time and therefore allows a real comparison of different pollutant effects. © Springer 2006.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 100; Correspondence Address: T.

In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which dieldrin and p,p′-DDE cause endocrine disruption in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), fish were exposed subchronically through the diet to both contaminants. Following 120 days of exposure, p,p′-DDE decreased estradiol in females, but increased 11-ketotestosterone in both sexes. Dieldrin on the other hand, decreased estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone in both sexes. Both pesticides also altered steady state mRNA expression levels of a set of genes chosen to represent three possible mechanisms of endocrine disruption: (1) direct interaction with soluble sex steroid receptors, (2) biosynthesis of endogenous sex hormones, and (3) metabolism of endogenous hormones. p,p′-DDE acted as a weak estrogen, increasing the expression of vitellogenin and estrogen receptor α in the liver. p,p′-DDE also altered the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of endogenous hormones as well as their metabolism. Dieldrin, on the other hand, only altered expression of vitellogenin and not estrogen receptor α. Dieldrin also altered the expression of genes involved in hormone synthesis and metabolism, and it dramatically lowered plasma hormone levels.

The gills of the fish are the primary corridor for molecular exchange between the internal milieu of a fish and its environment. Gills perform numerous functions such as oxygen uptake and CO2 excretion, osmoregulation, acid-basic balance, excretion of nitrogenous compounds and taste. Hazardous chemicals present in water may alter the morphology of the epithelial cells of gills of the fish, which may affect the process of diffusion of gases and ultimately the overall health of the fish. To prove this fact Cyprinus carpio communis Linn. was kept in water for 30 days having low concentration of 0.038 ppm (1\10th of LC50) of monocrotophos and an attempt was made to study the different types of degenerations produced in the epithelial cells of gills as compared to the normal epithelial cells of gills of this culturable Fish using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) technique. The ultrastructural changes due to the toxic exposure at finer scale were thinning of microridges, upliftment of epithelial cells, development of hyperplasia, decrease in the density of mucous cells which are considered to be the first line of defence and total dystrophy of epithelial tissue. Thus, it is opined that a low concentration of monocrotophos has the potential to bring different type of degenerations at finer scale hence affecting the fish's health drastically and altering the fitness of the fish in water even having insignificant amount of this toxicant in the ambient water. © Triveni Enterprises.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 27; Correspondence Address: M.S.

By collecting and counting the number of sperm released during separate mating events we observed that gametes are released asynchronously. Sperms are released in the form of sperm trails laid on the nest surface; subsequently active spermatozoa leave the trails and move in the water for several minutes. Sperm trails consist of bands of viscous material in which sperm are embedded. The water samples for the estimation of sperm presence were collected gradually within 180min after 24h, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months of exposure. It was established that the reductions in count, activity of sperm, and average life span of sperm trails were significant (P<0.05) at the tested concentrations, 5 and 50μg/L after 1 month and 2 weeks of exposure to each chemical tested and to their mixture, respectively.

A new sample of 1,150 individuals of this brachiopod, measuring 3.1-22.0 mm long, from two new sites of the Lower Cambrian Yuanshan Formation was examined. The sample includes several with exceptional preservation of nonmineralized skeletons that reveal previously unknown features and fill a gap in our knowledge of the detailed anatomy of fossil discinids. It is here reinterpreted as a discinid brachiopod on the basis of its many distinctive, discinid anatomical features, such as a longitudinally oval pedicle foramen in the anterior region of the posterior sector of the ventral valve; inferred, short, but large pedicle descending ventrally from the ventral valve; inferred, paired rectus muscles in the large pedicle canal; elongate scars of paired anterior adductors; and a median septum connected to a U-shaped ridge on the ventral interior. The two growing zones of its exceptionally preserved, unique lophophore extend posteriorly instead of anteriorly as in all Recent inarticulate brachiopods. Its recognition as the first and earliest discinoidean extends its stratigraphic range from the Ordovician to the Lower Cambrian. This reassignment implies that the organophosphatic, pediculate lingulids and discinids evolved before the carbonate, nonpediculate craniopsids and craniids.

The CCPPT employs methods consistent with the herbicide modes of action when conducting herbicide efficacy studies in small-scale experimental systems. Results from these studies are verified in aquatic and wetland field sites throughout the US. Coordination with the US Environmental Protection Agency and state regulatory agencies is undertaken to support the review and registration of new aquatic herbicides and amendments to established labels. Information and technology developed via research efforts are transferred to natural resource managers, the private sector, and the general public.

Sediment cores from two additional lakes in the Tatra mountains, Starolesnianske Pleso and Dlugi Staw, have also been examined. DDTs (1.7-13 ngg-1) were the most abundant OC in soils followed by total polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs; 0.41-1.5 ngg -1) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB; 0.15-0.91 ngg-1). In sediments, the dominant OC were also DDTs (3.3-28 ngg-1) and PCBs (2.3-15 ngg-1). These concentrations are low, involving absence of major pollution sources in these high mountain regions. The downcore OC profiles in soils and sediments were similar but higher concentrations and steeper vertical gradients were observed in the latter. Radiometric determinations showed absence of significant OC transport from catchment to lake. The sediment-soil difference points therefore to a better retention of the OC load in sediments than soils which may be related to the low temperatures that are currently encountered at the bottom of the lake water column and the depletion of sediment bioturbation in these cold environments. Significant qualitative changes in the soil PCB distributions are observed downcore. These involve a dominance of the high molecular weight congeners in the top core sections and those of lower weight (i.e. less chlorinated) in the bottom. Anaerobic dechlorination of higher molecular weight congeners occurring in microsites, e.g. as observed in flooded or poorly drained soils, could be responsible for these changes. This process could be concurrent to bioturbation. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 128; Correspondence Address: J.O.

Much of the data currently known are from epidemiologic human studies or studies of animal models. Each of these modes is difficult to translate to individual clinical encounters. It is often difficult to state with certainty which of the numerous chemical or physical agents in our environment are neurotoxic. Basic scientists will help with advances in molecular biology and toxicology. Improved clinical understanding of these issues may help patients to understand the medical issues; allay feelings of anxiety, guilt, or fear; and avoid unnecessary testing. For exposures that manifest as threshold phenomena, such as lead, the risk to society is even greater than to an individual. Individual risk may be less of a concern than the population's risk because small elevations in the average BLL can cause profound shifts in the normative curve of intelligence, increasing the burden on our institutions and bankrupting the brain trust. Good scholarship and interpersonal judgment are vital when counseling patients on the potential consequences of chemical exposures and are no less important when making policy. The challenge for the clinician reading the research is to remain aware of the limitations and biases of our science. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Within the Great Barrier Reef region there are four different seagrass habitat types now recognised. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the different types of seagrass habitat is poorly understood. In general seagrass growth is limited by light, disturbance and nutrient supply, and changes to any or all of these limiting factors may cause seagrass decline. The capacity of seagrasses to recover requires either recruitment via seeds or through vegetative growth. The ability of seagrass meadows to recover from large scale loss of seagrass cover observed during major events such as cyclones or due to anthropogenic disturbances such as dredging will usually require regeneration from seed bank. Limited research into the role of pollutants on seagrass survival suggests there may be ongoing impacts due to herbicides, pesticides and other chemical contaminants.

Organochlorine residues, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-like activity (TCDD-EQ), and elemental contaminants were measured in composite samples of whole fish, grouped by species and gender, from each site. Selenium (Se) and mercury (Hg) concentrations in fish were elevated throughout the CRB, and pesticide concentrations were greatest in fish from agricultural areas in the Lower Colorado River and Gila River. Selenium concentrations exceeded toxicity thresholds for fish (> 1.0 μg/g ww) at all CRB sites except the Gila River at Hayden, Arizona. Mercury concentrations were elevated (> 0.1 μg/g ww) in fish from the Yampa River at Lay, Colorado; the Green River at Ouray National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Utah and San Rafael, Utah; the San Juan River at Hogback Diversion, New Mexico; and the Colorado River at Gold Bar Canyon, Utah, Needles, California, and Imperial Dam, Arizona. Concentrations of p,p′-DDE were relatively high in fish from the Gila River at Arlington, Arizona (> 1.0 μg/g ww) and Phoenix, Arizona (> 0.5 μg/g ww). Concentrations of other formerly used pesticides including toxaphene, total chlordanes, and dieldrin were also greatest at these two sites but did not exceed toxicity thresholds. Currently used pesticides such as Dacthal, endosulfan, γ-HCH, and methoxychlor were also greatest in fish from the Gila River downstream of Phoenix. Total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs; > 0.11 μg/g ww) and TCDD-EQs (> 5 pg/g ww) exceeded wildlife guidelines in fish from the Gila River at Phoenix. Hepatic ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity was also relatively high in carp from the Gila River at Phoenix and in bass from the Green River at Ouray NWR. Fish from some sites showed evidence of contaminant exposure as indicated by fish health indicators and reproductive biomarker results. Multiple health indicators including altered body and organ weights and high health assessment index scores may be associated with elevated Se concentrations in fish from the Colorado River at Loma, Colorado and Needles. Although grossly visible external or internal lesions were found on most fish from some sites, histopathological analysis determined many of these to be inflammatory responses associated with parasites. Edema, exophthalmos, and cataracts were noted in fish from sites with elevated Se concentrations. Intersex fish were found at seven of 14 sites and included smallmouth bass (M. dolomieu), largemouth bass (M. salmoides), catfish, and carp and may indicate exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds. A high proportion of smallmouth bass from the Yampa River at Lay (70%) was intersex but the cause of this condition is unknown. Male carp, bass, and catfish with low concentrations of vitellogenin were common in the CRB. Comparatively high vitellogenin concentrations (> 0.2 mg/mL) were measured in male bass from the Green River at Ouray NWR and the Colorado River at Imperial Dam and indicate exposure to estrogenic or anti-androgenic chemicals. Anomalous reproductive biomarkers including low GSI and gonadal abnormalities (calcifications, edema, and parasites) observed in fish downstream of Phoenix are likely related to the poor water-quality of the Gila River in this area.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 71; Correspondence Address: J.E.

The purpose of the present study was to compare three improvised types of traps (wood-glue, plastic bottle, double chamber) in combination with two different animal baits (fish and meat), free of insecticides, in order to control the populations of the wasps in apiaries. The experiments were conducted during the summers from 2001 to 2004. The traps were placed in three apiaries located in the Attica region of Greece. Trapped wasps were collected and the bait was replaced three times per week. The three types of traps are considered environmental friendly because they do not include insecticides that might pollute the environment, or result in the total destruction of wasp colonies and/or the death of non-target organisms, especially honey bees. The results showed that the use of the wood-glue trap in combination with the fish as a bait was a reliable solution for controlling the wasps in apiaries. Special attention should be paid to the time the fresh bait is placed because the performance of the traps is the best early in the day. Also the baits should be changed regularly (every 1-2 days) because the decomposition reduces the total number of wasps captured.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 14; Correspondence Address: N.

Teicoplanin-based chiral stationary phase (CSP) was used. The effect of the variation of mobile phase composition on retention and enantioselective separation was studied. The mobile phase composition suitable for enantioresolution of the various chiral compounds differed according to the interaction forces needed for chiral recognition. Mobile phases with high buffer portion (70-90 vol.%) were preferred for separation of enantiomers of profen non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chlorophenoxypropionic acid herbicides that require hydrophobic interactions, inclusion and π-π interactions for stereoselective recognition with teicoplanin. Higher concentration triethylamine in the buffer (0.5-1.0%) increased resolution of these acids. On the other hand, H-bonding and electrostatic interactions are important in stereoselective interaction mechanism of β-adrenergic antagonists with teicoplanin. These interaction types predominate in the reversed phase separation mode with high organic modifier content (95% methanol) and in polar organic mobile phases. For this reason β-adrenergic antagonists were best enantioresolved in the polar organic mode. The mobile phase composed of methanol/acetic acid/triethylamine, 100/0.01/0.01 (v/v/v), provided enantioresolution values of all the studied β-adrenergic antagonists in the range 1.1-1.9. Addition of teicoplanin to the mobile phase, which was suitable for enantioseparation of certain compounds on the CSP, was also investigated. This system was used to dispose of nonstereoselective interactions of analytes with silica gel support that often participate in the interaction with CSPs. Very low concentration of teicoplanin in the mobile phase (0.1 mM) resulted in enantioselective separation of 2,2- and 2,4-chlorophenoxypropionic acids. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of the herbicide oxyfluorfen on the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase were evaluated in freshwater fish Oreochromis niloticus. These were determined in tilapia liver exposed to sublethal concentrations (0.3 and 0.6 mg/L at 7, 14, and 21 days of exposure. This study also analyzed the effects of oxyfluorfen on the total fatty acid profile. The results showed that CAT activity was higher in tilapia exposed to oxyfluorfen at the sampling days, except at the highest concentration after 21 days. Similarly, the enhancing effect of the herbicide was observed on the GR activity. However, its effect was moderate at the highest dose. On the contrary, fish treated with oxyfluorfen at both doses displayed a decrease in the SOD activity. After 7 days of treatment at both concentrations tilapia showed a significant increase in GST levels, although the enzymatic activity decreased at 14 and 21 days of exposition when compared with the control. The major saturated fatty acids measured in tilapia liver were the palmitic acid (C16:0; 17.9%) and stearic acid (C18:0; 8.7%). The exposure to oxyfluorfen caused a significant increase of the oleic acid (C18:1), whereas the amount of nervonic acid (C24:1) increased at all sampling data.

Although entomologists have borrowed specific ideas or products from the military for use in pest management, such as sequential sampling (Wald, 1943, 1945; Waters, 1955), toxins used in pesticides (Ware, 1994), aerial pesticide applications (Akesson and Yates, 1974), radar (Wolf, 1979; Dunnigan and Nofi, 1994; Devereux, 1991), and global positioning systems (GPS) (Herring, 1996), perhaps we have truly neglected a gold mine of information in the form of strategy and tactics that could be applied to solve many challenges we face. This has been employed in other endeavors such as business (Musashi, 1982; Luecke, 1994; Krause, 1995) and medicine (Hartman, 1993) to enhance efficiency and productivity. Copyright © by Kevin M.

MXR inhibition with concomitant detrimental effects has been shown in several studies with aquatic organisms exposed to both model MXR inhibitors and environmental pollutants. The presence of MXR inhibitors has been demonstrated in environmental samples from polluted locations at concentrations that could abolish P-gp transport activity. However, it is not clear whether the inhibition observed after exposure to environmental samples is a result of saturation of MXR transport proteins by numerous substrates present in polluted waters or results from the presence of powerful MXR inhibitors. And are potent environmental MXR inhibitors natural or man-made chemicals? As a consequence of these uncertainties, no official action has been taken to monitor and control the release and presence of MXR inhibitors into aquatic environments. In this paper we present our new results addressing these critical questions. Ecotoxicological significance of MXR inhibition was supported in in vivo studies that demonstrated an increase in the production of mutagenic metabolites by mussels and an increase in the number of sea urchin embryos with apoptotic cells after exposure to model MXR inhibitors. We also demonstrated that MXR inhibitors are present among both conventional and emerging man-made pollutants: some pesticides and synthetic musk fragrances show extremely high MXR inhibitory potential at environmentally relevant concentrations. In addition, we emphasized the biological transformation of crude oil hydrocarbons into MXR inhibitors by oil-degrading bacteria, and the risk potentially caused by powerful natural MXR inhibitors produced by invasive species. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, women who eat relatively large amounts of this fish constitute a suitable study group when investigating a possible association between dietary exposure to POC and menstrual cycle disruption. Questionnaires were sent to the exposed women, as well as to a socioeconomically similar cohort of controls, and information was collected on their menstrual cycles. Since the exposed women tended to smoke more than the controls, all results were adjusted for smoking habits. A cohort comparison found that the exposed women on average had 0.46 (95% confidence interval: 0.03, 0.89) days shorter menstrual cycles than controls. However, within the exposed cohort no effects were found of the proxy variables early life exposure and high consumption of Baltic Sea fatty fish.

Arctic tundra soils contain large amounts of organic carbon, accumulated in thick soil layers and are known as a major sink of atmospheric CO2. These soils are totally frozen throughout the year and only a thin active layer is unfrozen and shows biological activity during the short summer. To improve the understanding of how the carbon fluxes in the active layer are controlled, detailed analysis of composition, functionality and interaction of soil microorganisms was done. The FISH analyses of the active layer showed large variations in absolute cell numbers and in the composition of the active microbial community between the different horizons, which is caused by the different environmental conditions (e.g., soil temperature, amount of organic matter, aeration) in this vertically structured ecosystem. Universal protein stain 5-(4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl)aminofluorescein (DTAF) showed an exponential decrease of total cell counts from the top to the bottom of the active layer (2.3×109-1.2×108 cells per gram dry soil). Using FISH, up to 59% of the DTAF-detected cells could be detected in the surface horizon, and up to 84% of these FISH-detected cells could be affiliated to a known phylogenetic group.

The balance between prooxidant endogenous and exogenous factors (i.e., environmental pollutants) and antioxidant defenses (enzymatic and nonenzymatic) in biological systems can be used to assess toxic effects under stressful environmental conditions, especially oxidative damage induced by different classes of chemical pollutants. The role of these antioxidant systems and their sensitivity can be of great importance in environmental toxicology studies. In the past decade, numerous studies on the effects of oxidative stress caused by some environmental pollutants in terrestrial and aquatic species were published. Increased numbers of agricultural and industrial chemicals are entering the aquatic environment and being taken up into tissues of aquatic organisms. Transition metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, and other xenobiotics play important roles in the mechanistic aspects of oxidative damage. Such a diverse array of pollutants stimulate a variety of toxicity mechanisms, such as oxidative damage to membrane lipids, DNA, and proteins and changes to antioxidant enzymes. Although there are considerable gaps in our knowledge of cellular damage, response mechanisms, repair processes, and disease etiology in biological systems, free radical reactions and the production of toxic ROS are known to be responsible for a variety of oxidative damages leading to adverse health effects and diseases. In the past decade, mammalian species were used as models for the study of molecular biomarkers of oxidative stress caused by environmental pollutants to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cellular oxidative damage and to study the adverse effects of some environmental pollutants with oxidative potential in chronic exposure and/or sublethal concentrations. This review summarizes current knowledge and advances in the understanding of such oxidative processes in biological systems. This knowledge is extended to specific applications in aquatic organisms because of their sensitivity to oxidative pollutants, their filtration capacity, and their potential for environmental toxicology studies. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

However, no further activity change was found with prolonged exposure. Cotreatment of BaP and TBT primarily inhibited the GST activity, which was similar to the effect of TBT. Cotreatment with BaP and TBT for 25 or 50 d potentiated the depletion of GSH (glutathione) by BaP or TBT alone. MDA (malondialdehyde) contents in spleen of S. marmoratus were not significantly altered compared with the control during the test period. Spleen, as an immune organ, is sensitive to exposure of BaP or TBT. It should have an effective mechanism to counteract oxidative damage. Antioxidative defense systems in spleen of S. marmoratus should be considered as potential biomarkers. Short-term exposure of BaP or TBT could result in induction of antioxidant defense system. A significant decrease of these indices, such as GSH, GST, GPx might indicate more severe contamination. © 2007 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 39; Correspondence Address: Z.-h.

""Technical"" toxaphene (TT) consists of a mixture of up to 800 different chemicals, known as congeners. TT weathers in the environment by both biotic and abiotic processes. The human body burden of toxaphene consists of only five persistent congeners that are not metabolized; three of these occur in considerably greater amounts than the other two. Because of the rapid metabolism and excretion of the non-persistent congeners, the persistent congeners that make up the human body burden most likely play a role in eliciting any potential adverse effects. EPA's toxicity assessment for TT is based on the occurrence of liver cancer in rodents, and considerable doubt exists whether this assessment is applicable to weathered toxaphene (WT). Using experimental results from European Union scientists, a reference dose (RfD) was developed for WT based on the three most persistent congeners that comprise the human body burden. The critical effect chosen was tumor promotion and this endpoint is considered protective for other endpoints as well. Although RfDs are typically derived for non-carcinogenic effects, the endpoint of tumor promotion is appropriate for RfD development because the experimental data suggest a dose threshold. The RfD for weathered toxaphene represented by the sum of the three major persistent congeners (∑3PC) is 2E-05 mg/kg-day. To apply this reference dose to a particular WT mixture, information is needed regarding the percentage of ∑3PC in the mixture.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: T.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a potent inducer of oxidative stress, is a prospective method for destruction of brain tumors. PDT induced functional inactivation and necrosis of neurons, necrosis, apoptosis, and proliferation of glial cells. The roles of calmodulin, calmodulin-dependent kinase II, phospholipase C, protein kinases A and C, and phosphodiesterase in these processes were studied by using their inhibitors: fluphenazine, KN-93, D-609, H89, staurosporine, and papaverine, respectively. PDT-induced firing abolishment was enhanced by H89 or papaverine, whereas staurosporine acted oppositely. Fluphenazine or KN-93 reduced necrosis of neurons and glial cells. H89 enhanced necrosis of neurons, whereas staurosporine enhanced necrosis of glial cells. Inhibition of protein kinases A and C enhanced PDT-induced glial apoptosis. Photodynamic gliosis was prevented by KN-93 or staurosporine. These data indicate possible involvement of calmodulin and calmodulin-dependent kinase II in photoinduced necrosis of neurons and glia. Protein kinase C could protect glial cells from necrosis and apoptosis and participate in photoinduced gliosis and loss of neuronal activity. Protein kinase A maintained neuronal firing and protected neurons from photoinduced necrosis and glial cells from apoptosis. Phosphodiesterase reduced necrosis of photosensitized neurons and glia.

It presented in detail the argument that many chemical contaminants in the environment interfere with the biological function of hormones by blocking, mimicking, displacing, or acting through a variety of other mechanisms to subvert their natural roles. Although the argument rested primarily on observations in wildlife and on laboratory experiments, its cogency for human health was undeniable: the same chemicals and hormones are found in humans. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include many types of substances encompassing many different chemical structures acting through diverse biological mechanisms to exert their effects. The latter include estrogenic, androgenic, and anti-estrogenic anti-androgenic effects, and altered thyroid function. Although disorders of reproductive function first brought these agents to our attention, their potential to interfere with brain development is now seen as at least equally significant for public health. All twelve of the chemicals listed as persistent organic pollutants, the ""dirty dozen,"" which were the subject of a global treaty to abolish their use, earned their labels, in part, because of their potency as endocrine disruptors. This list contained the following organochlorine compounds: dioxins, furans, PCBs, DDT, hexachlorobenzene, chlordane, toxaphene, dieldrin, aldrin, endrin, heptachlor, and mirex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2003) has published exposure data for 116 chemicals from NHANES 1999-2000. The data include statistics on the distribution of blood or urine levels for each environmental chemical. All have been shown, directly or indirectly, to modify endocrine function. They include:*Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)*Dioxins, furans, and coplanar PCBs*Non-coplanar PCBs*Phytoestrogens (e.g., soy)*Selected organophosphate pesticides*Organochlorine pesticides*Carbamate pesticides*Herbicides*Pest repellents and disinfectants*Metals (lead, mercury, cadmium)*Cotinine (nicotine metabolite)*Phthalates. This list illustrates a crucial principle: we now carry in our bodies a broth of chemicals to which our forebears were never exposed. Although we seek, by a variety of maneuvers, to isolate the contributions of individual agents in our research, we cannot totally extract them from this baseline confounding. We do not know which combinations are additive, which antagonistic, or which are synergistic. It challenges logic to accept the proposition that the sum of their biological effects is zero, the assumption that underlies the setting of current exposure standards. Hormones and Toxicology: Endocrine systems serve an essential function: they enable signals from a specific organ to evoke a dynamic, coordinated response in a distant target tissue. Their role, generally, is to maintain homeostasis. In some instances, however, the signal originates outside the body. This possibility is the core issue generating concerns about endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Three properties of EDCs claimed particular force. One arose from the roles played by hormones in fetal development. As we already knew from our experience with lead, mercury, alcohol, and other chemicals, exposure levels that exert minimal or transient effects in adults can produce lasting damage during development. Many toxic chemicals pass easily from mother to fetus and from breast milk to the neonate. The second concern arose from the tendency of many endocrine disruptors to persist in the environment because they resist degradation, bioaccumulate in the food chain as they ascend predator levels, and are stored in the body's fat depots, where they are slowly metabolized and excreted; the half-life in humans of the prototypical dioxin, tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin or TCDD, is 7 to 10 years. When fat is mobilized during pregnancy or lactation, the fetus or neonate may be exposed to substantially elevated levels. Other EDCs, such as phthalates, are so ubiquitous in the environment that exposure is constant although their half-lives may range from weeks to months. The third property generating concern was the geographical mobility of such agents. Arctic species, such as polar bears, are heavily contaminated with chemicals generated far from the original sites of discharge into the environment (Skaare et al., 2002). The contaminants are carried to the arctic by global weather patterns and by the toxic loads in the bears' customary prey. Hormones occupy a crucial role during development. Hormonal mechanisms act as arbiters of brain structure and neurochemistry. Gonadal hormones direct and modulate the processes underlying sexual differentiation of the brain. Thyroid hormones regulate neuronal and glial proliferation as well as cell migration and differentiation. Glucocorticoids play essential roles in several aspects of normal brain development, especially through their enduring effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its role in behavior. Basic research in neuroendocrinology provides the basis both for these linkages and for the health concerns evoked by EDCs. Because endocrine disruption is such a new aspect of environmental toxicology, however, our current knowledge of its scope and manifestations in human populations remains scattered. And, because of our incomplete grasp of these properties, this chapter provides a basic window on the EDC issue rather than a comprehensive survey of its role in human health. Much of it, necessarily, will come from animal experiments and observations in wildlife. We will cover only a few chemical classes, some of the implications of which for humans have at present to be hypothesized rather than confirmed. Furthermore, the mechanistic relevance of some EDCs to neurobehavioral toxicity has not been established; dioxin, for example, probably exerts such toxic effects by mechanisms apart from its hormonal effects. Perhaps the main reason EDCs became the subjects of such profound unease is their implications for human reproductive function, especially in males. Falling sperm counts (see Swan et al., 2000), along with rising rates of testicular cancer, cryptorchidism, and hypospadias, have generated questions about the possible contribution of environmental chemicals to these trends. Sharpe and Skakkebaek (1993) first proposed such a link. In 2003, Skakkebaek (2003) advanced the hypothesis more directly:There is evidence that poor semen quality, testicular cancer, undescended testes and hypospadias are symptoms of one underlying entity, testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS), which may be increasingly common due to adverse environmental influences. Experimental and epidemiological studies suggest that TDS is the result of disruption of embryonal programming and gonadal development during fetal life. Sources of endocrine disruptors abound. They can be found in the form of pesticides, such as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides used in agriculture, from where, as now recognized, they drift into homes or pollute drinking water supplies. They can leach out of plastic containers holding intravenous fluids or even food and water (the alkylphenols). They are present in can linings and in dental sealants (Bisphenol A). They have been found in toys that young children place into their mouths (phthalates). Dispersed into aquatic environments, they can contaminate fish. Table I is a list of the more prominent disruptors already identified and their primary hormonal targets. Neurobehavioral Toxicity as an Issue: Unambiguous connections between EDCs and human neurobehavioral function exist primarily for the PCBs, as described in the chapter by Vreugdenhil and Weisglas-Kuperus in this volume. The paucity of extensive human data on EDCs compels us to rely on animal models to gauge the relevance for human function. Yet, although hormones govern much of brain development and behavior, the literature devoted to neurobehavioral endpoints and EDCs, even for animal models, is dismayingly sparse. And, even for those, few have explored effects based on complex behavioral repertoires and brain morphometry. Fewer still have featured exposure levels consistent with those measured in human populations. Schantz and Widholm (2001), in a discussion of these issues, noted the wide gaps in our knowledge of how EDCs influence cognitive function. Links between impaired endocrine function and behavioral disorders are hardly a novel phenomenon. Sexual differentiation of the brain, for example, is known to be guided primarily by the actions of gonadal hormones (Fig. 1). Disturbing the appropriate balance of these hormones during development by exogenous agents is documented to produce morphological, neurochemical, and behavioral abnormalities. This delicate balance is persuasively illustrated by the behavioral correlates of the genetic virilizing disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Females with this disorder, which exposes them to high levels of androgens during gestation as well as postnatally, exhibit behavioral patterns indicating both masculinization and defeminization (Berenbaum, 1999). For example, as children, they tend to show male preferences for toys; they are more aggressive than normal girls; they show greater spatial abilities than normal girls; and they are less interested in feminine appearance. Over a broad range of behaviors, development becomes more prototypically male because of a shift in the balance of gonadal hormones. Vreugdenhil and Weisglas-Kuperus, in their chapter in this book, note a similar but less extreme tendency correlated, in girls, with PCB/dioxin exposure.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 6,10.1016/S0074-7750(05)30006-1,Intellectual Disability,NA,NA,endocrine disruptors as a factor in mental retardation

The Puffer® dispenser consists of a pressurized metal canister loaded with pheromone active ingredients dissolved in solvent and housed within a circuit-controlled, plastic dispensing cabinet programmed to release an aerosol spray of pheromone at regular intervals. Puffers® were deployed at the label-recommended rate of 2.5 ha-1 and released ca. 5-10 mg of pheromone (depending on treatment) per 15 min during a 12-h cycle beginning each day at 15:00 h for the duration of the season. In 2005, commercially-managed apple plots (3.2-4.9 ha) were treated with Puffers® releasing both species' pheromone simultaneously (dual-species) or with twice the number of adjacently-deployed Puffers® (4-6 m apart) releasing each individual species' pheromones (single-species), while maintaining comparable overall release rates of pheromone between these two treatments. Plots 100 m away and not treated with pheromone served as the control. Disruption of male C. pomonella and G. molestaorientation to pheromone-baited traps was 46-75 and 91-98%, respectively, in Puffer®-treated plots compared with untreated controls. There was no statistical difference in moth disruption between plots treated with dual-species and single-species Puffers®. Fruit injury was not statistically different between Puffer®-treated plots and control plots not receiving pheromone. In 2006, disruption of male moth orientation to traps was 24-26 and 84-97% in Puffer®-treated plots (2.9-5.7 ha) for C. pomonella and G. molesta, respectively, compared with untreated controls. During this season, fruit injury was lower in pheromone-treated plots compared with untreated controls at mid-season, but not at pre-harvest.

In this laboratory study, we tested the prediction that prior chemical exposure to a non-native predator feeding on conspecific tadpoles will subsequently allow tadpoles of the common toad (Bufo bufo) to recognize the chemical cues specifically released by this starved predator. Furthermore, we investigated the vulnerability of this chemically-mediated process to herbicide contamination. With these aims in view, groups of tadpoles were kept either unexposed or exposed for ten days to chemical cues from Turkish crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) previously fed on tadpoles, both in uncontaminated water and in the presence of four sublethal concentrations of amitrole (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.l-1). We then assessed the effects of the six conditioning treatments on general activity and behavioural response to chemical cues from starved crayfish. Larval treatments did not affect the general activity of the tadpoles. By contrast, the treatments had significant effects on the behavioural response to the test solution prepared form starved crayfish. The only tadpoles to show an antipredator behavioural response to the chemical stimulation from starved crayfish belonged to the groups derived from chemical exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in uncontaminated water and in contaminated water with the lowest concentration of amitrole (0.01 mg.l-1). Conversely, this chemical stimulation produced no behavioural change in the control group or in the groups derived from exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in contaminated water containing 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.l-1 of amitrole. This study demonstrates that chemical cues released during the predator's feeding activity can subsequently be used by common toad tadpoles in the recognition of an unfamiliar predator. In addition, our results show that the presence of sublethal amitrole concentrations can impair this recognition process. Such a pesticide effect might be especially detrimental for amphibian populations threatened by invasive predators. © 2006 Birkhäuser Verlag.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 37; Correspondence Address: P.

Inst. Environ. Sci. T., CH-8600 Dübendorf, Switzerland","An ecotoxicological test battery based on a mode-of-action approach was designed and applied to the hazard identification and classification of modes of action of six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ethinyl estradiol, ibuprofen, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole). The rationale behind the design of the battery was to cover the relevant interactions that a compound may have with biological targets. It is thus not comprehensive but contains representative examples of each category of mode of toxic action including nonspecific, specific, and reactive toxicity. The test battery consists of one test system for nonspecific toxicity (baseline toxicity or narcosis), two test systems for specific effects, and two test systems for reactive toxicity. The baseline toxicity was quantified with the Kinspec test, which detects membrane leakage via measurements of membrane potential. This test system may also be used to detect the specific effects on energy transduction, although this was not relevant to any compound investigated in this study. As examples of specific receptor-mediated toxicity, we chose the yeast estrogen screen (YES) as a specific test for estrogenicity, and the inhibition of chlorophyll fluorescence in algae to assess specific effects on photosynthesis. Reactive modes of action were assessed indirectly by measuring the relevance of cellular defense systems. Differences in growth inhibition curves between a mutant of Escherichia coli that could not synthesize glutathione and its parent strain indicate the relevance of conjugation with glutathione as a defense mechanism, which is an indirect indicator of protein damage. DNA damage was assessed by comparing the growth inhibition in a strain that lacks various DNA repair systems with that in its competent parent strain. Most compounds acted merely as baseline toxicants in all test systems. As expected, ethinylestradiol was the only compound showing estrogenic activity. Propranolol was baseline-toxic in all test systems except for the photosynthesis inhibition assay, where it surprisingly showed a 100-fold excess toxicity over the predicted baseline effect. The exact mode of toxic action could not be confirmed, but additional chlorophyll fluorescence induction experiments excluded the possibility of direct interference with photosynthesis through photosystem II inhibition. Mixture experiments were performed as a diagnostic tool to analyze the mode of toxic action. Compounds with the same mode of toxic action showed the expected concentration addition. In the photosynthesis inhibition assay, agreement between experimental results and prediction was best for two-stage predictions considering the assigned modes of action. In a two-stage prediction, concentration addition was used as a model to predict the mixture effect of the baseline toxicants followed by their independent action as a single component combined with the specifically acting compound propranolol and the reference compound diuron. A comparison with acute toxicity data for algae, daphnia, and fish showed generally good agreement for the nonspecifically acting compounds but also that the proposed test battery offered better diagnostic value in the case of the specifically acting compounds. © 2005 American Chemical Society.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 142; Correspondence Address: B.I.

In order to develop new treatments, it is necessary to characterize the antioxidant defense system in RPE cells to better define their vulnerabilities and how they can be remedied. In this study, we sought to investigate the effects of three different types of oxidative stress on cultured RPE cells. Carbonyl content in RPE cells increased with increasing concentrations of oxidants or increasing duration of exposure with high reproducibility, validating ELISA for carbonyl content as a valuable quantitative measure of oxidative damage. Compared to other cell types, RPE eel Is were able to survive exposure to H2O2 quite well and exposure to paraquat extremely well. Comparison of the total amount of oxidative damage at the IC50 for each type of stress showed a rank order of hyperoxia > paraquat > H2O2, and since these stressors primarily target different cellular compartments, it suggests that the endogenous defense system against oxidative damage in RPE cells protects well against damage to mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and is less able to handle oxidative damage at the cell surface. Supplementation of media with ascorbic acid provided significant protection from H2O 2-induced oxidative damage, but not that induced by paraquat or hyperoxia. Supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid or α-tocopherol significantly reduced oxidative damage from H2O2 or hyperoxia, but not that induced by paraquat. We conclude that exposure to different types of oxidative stress results in different patterns of accrual of oxidative damage to proteins in RPE cells, different patterns of loss of viability, and is differentially countered by antioxidants. This study suggests that multiple types of oxidant stress should be used to probe the vulnerabilities of the retina and RPE in vivo, and that ELISA for carbonyl content provides a valuable tool for quantitative assessment of oxidative damage for such studies. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 108; Correspondence Address: P.A.

Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common pet-related parasitic infections. Although toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic or mild, it may cause serious congenital infection if a woman is exposed during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. Common pet-borne fungal infections include tinea corporis/capitis (ringworm); campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis are among the most common bacterial infections associated with pet ownership. Less commonly, pets can transmit arthropod-borne and viral illnesses (e.g., scabies, rabies). Infection in a pet can provide sentinel warning of local vectors and endemic conditions, such as Lyme disease risk. Treatment is infection-specific, although many infections are self-limited. Prevention involves common sense measures such as adequate hand washing, proper disposal of animal waste, and ensuring that infected animals are diagnosed and treated. Special precautions are indicated for immunocompromised persons. Increased communication between primary care physicians and veterinarians could improve treatment and prevention of these conditions.

A cultural model is a simplified way of understanding a complex system, shared by members of a culture. Eighty-eight percent of respondents understood Pfiesteria using one of four previously existing cultural models: a disease in fish, a parasite in fish, a water pollutant, and a toxin or poison. These models are not used by marine biologists, who are more likely to refer to Pfiesteria taxonomically or, in its fish killing form, to call it a predator. Our survey shows that the cultural model a respondent holds is correlated significantly with his or her believed pathway of human harm (e.g., eating fish versus swimming) and is correlated significantly but weakly with his or her behavioral responses. We conclude that existing cultural models, as the public has applied them to Pfiesteria, have led people to avoid a range of coastal activities and seafoods, in virtually all cases unnecessarily. Cultural models appear to explain public reaction better than previously hypothesized factors such as inaccurate media coverage. These findings suggest an approach to developing a pedagogical and communications strategy which could provide the public with a cultural model better matched to Pfiesteria. © 2000 Taylor & Francis.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 28; Correspondence Address: W.

Fishes, soil and water samples were collected from the various test zones for the assessment of pesticidal accumulation in water, soil and fish muscles respectively. A comparative analysis of the toxic status of different selected wet lands based on pesticidal accumulation were done. Various organochlorine group of pesticides incurred were αHCH, βHCH, γHCH, Aldrin, Endosulfan, DDE, DDT etc. The presence in water bodies of aHCH varied from 0.146 mg/l to 1.100 mg/l while that of γHCH from 0.003 mg/l to 2.000 mg/l. Aldrin was prevalent ranging between 0.057 μg/l to 3.646 μg/l. Comparative survey of fish muscles of different test zones showed the variation in accumulation of αHCH, βHCH, γHCH, Aldrin and ppDDT. A control group of similar fishes were collected from pollution free water of Fish Hatchery, Bhusaula, Danapur, Pesticidal assessment of control group of fish showed almost negligible percentage of these organochlorine group of pesticides. Blood serum of both control and fishes of different test zones were assayed for thyroxine and testosterone by ELISA technique. A comparative analysis were done for serum hormonal imbalance due to synergistic effect of various accumulated pesticides. Gonadal tissues of both control and toxicated fishes of various selected wetlands were fixed for electron microscopy. A series of histopathological deteriorative changes were incurred in the testes of toxicated fishes especially in spermatozoa. Results show 25% reduction in testicular efficiency and ovarian atrophy due to synergistic effect of various accumulated pesticides. However, in the present investigation I have analysed only for organochlorine group of pesticides. The treatment of aqueous root extract of shankhpushpi (Convolvulus pleuricaulis) and Ashwagandha (Withenia somnifera) to these group of toxicated fishes brings down elevated serum TSH towards normalcy, minimizing pathological condition.

It was a case-control study conducted in Madrid, Spain, with 232 consecutive patients diagnosed between January 1 1990 and December 31, 1995, sex- and age-matched with 232 control individuals with no oncological disease or history. By means of an interviewer-administered questionnaire, seven different epidemiological areas were 'surveyed, namely: (1) sociodemographic variables, (2) familial all-site cancer history, (3) medical history, (4) lifestyle (habits), (5) diet, (6) occupational exposure, and (7) non-occupational exposure. Of the great number of factors within each epidemiological area, the following were found to be risk factors after adjustment for tobacco smoking and alcoholic beverage drinking: (1) tobacco smoking, (2) alcoholic beverage drinking, (3) low and low-middle socioeconomic background, (4) low educational level, (5) rural milieu, (6) working, or having worked, as a manual worker in agriculture, (7) working, or having worked as a manual worker in building industry, (8) having an upper aerodigestive tract cancer familial history, (9) having a medical history of alcholism, low weight/malnutrition, gastroesophageal reflux or chronic obstructive bronchopneumonia, (10) low dietary intake of fruit, fruit juice, uncooked vegetables, dietary fibre-containing foods, fish and milk and dairy products, (11) high dietary intake of meat and fried foods, (12) deficient oral and dental hygiene, (13) abuse of black coffee, (14) abuse of 'carajillo' (a typical Spanish drink composed of black coffee and flambéed brandy), (15) occupational exposure to pesticides, solvents and dust of different origins.

However, due to the small size of the nasopharyngeal cancer subsample (n = 35, 15.08 per cent), our results as well as the preventive measures are to considered as referring uniquely to oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers. In addition, from descriptive statistical data inspection one can conclude that nasopharyngeal cancer is likely to bear risk factors different from those for oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers, thus nasopharyngeal cancer warrants specific epidemiological investigation with a sufficiently large patient sample.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: A.E.

Clinical signs observed with fungal keratitis may include blepharospasm, epiphora, miosis, corneal opacity, and vascularization. Unfortunately, none of these signs is specific to fungal infection. If fungal keratitis is suspected or confirmed, then aggressive medical therapy should be instituted. Medications used include topical antifungals, parasympatholytics, anticollagenases, and antibacterials as well as systemic anti-inflammatory drugs.

The apple varieties 'Summerland' Mcintosh and 'Royal Court' Cortland each comprise 50% of the 3.5 ha study area. Within each of the two production systems, three vegetation management options, mowing, herbicides and organic mulch were evaluated for impact on horticultural attributes and potential to enhance populations of beneficial ground dwelling arthropods. Significant production input savings ($500.00/hectare) have been realized in the IFP system. Replicated pit fall traps have revealed a significant abundance & diversity of ground dwelling beneficial species.

Multidrug resistance is commonly due to the elevated expression of transmembrane P-glycoproteins (P-gp) which actively transport a wide variety of structurally and functionally diverse compounds. The purpose of this review is to place aquatic ecotoxicological data in context of the larger multidrug resistance field of study. Information on P-glycoproteins structure, mechanism of transport, and substrate specificity gained through traditional mammalian and cell culture models is examined in conjunction with recent work on aquatic species exposed to xenobiotics both in the field and in the laboratory. The physiological function of P-glycoproteins is explored through studies of gene knockout models and expression patterns in normal tissues and tumors. The effect of xenobiotic exposures on P-gp activity and protein titer is examined in wild and captive populations of aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates. Substrate overlap and evidence of co- expression of phase I detoxification enzymes (e.g. cytochromes P450) and P-gp are presented. The role of P-gp chemosensitizers as environmental pollutants and the ecotoxicological consequences of P-gp inhibition are highlighted. The overwhelming evidence suggests that P-glycoproteins provide aquatic organisms with resistance to a wide range of natural and anthropogenic toxins.

Among OCs, concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and DDTs (DDTs and its metabolites) were the highest in deep-sea organisms (maximum concentrations of 6700 and 13,000 ng/glipidwt, respectively). Chlordane compounds (CHLs) were the next most abundant OCs, and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were the lowest. BTs were also detected at maximum concentrations of 570 ng/gwetwt. Concentrations of PCBs, CHLs and BTs in deep-sea organisms collected from the western North Pacific, off-Tohoku, were generally lower than those in deep-sea and shallow water organisms from Japanese coastal waters. On the other hand, considerable variations in the concentrations of OCs were found among deep-sea organisms analyzed. Several carnivorous fishes such as snubnosed eel, lanternshark and grenadiers accumulated some OCs such as PCBs, DDTs and CHLs at high concentrations of up to a few μg/g levels. In addition, the residue pattern of OCs and BTs in fishes showed a specific trend according to the sampling depth; higher concentrations of PCBs, DDTs and CHLs and lower concentrations of HCHs, HCB and BTs were found in fishes collected from greater depth (∼1000 m) compared to those from shallower waters. This trend is consistent with the results of our earlier study on mesopelagic myctophid fishes.

The groundwater, which is contaminated with a variety of pesticides (organochlorine, organophosphorus, and carbamate insecticides) and pesticide adjuvants (spreading agents, emulsifiers, etc.) was sampled from an activated-carbon-based on-site remediation system before, during, and after the cleanup procedure. Toxicity was evaluated at each point using whole-organism (96-h acute Pimephales promelas, chronic 3-brood Ceriodaphnia dubia) and in vitro [submitochondrial particle (SMP) and Microtox ®] bioassays. Chemical indicator parameters [pentachlorophenol, gasoline-range organics (GROs), and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) were also measured to compare with bioassay responses. 50% effective concentrations (EC50)s from the different tests indicate that the whole-organism assays were slightly more sensitive than the in-vitro assays: the order of sensitivity was C. dubia> P. promelas > SMP > Microtox ®, but responses were quite similar. All assays showed decreasing toxicity as cleanup progressed, mimicking the concomitant decrease in chemical concentration parameters. A toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) analysis, conducted using the in-vitro bioassays, identified pentachlorophenol as the major contributor to toxicity in the samples with additional contributions likely from other less-prevalent compounds. Results suggest that these in-vitro tests can be credible alternatives to whole-organism bioassays for monitoring remediation of system effluents and that they can complement chemical analyses with useful effects-based toxicity data.

However, as use of hydroacoustics for stock assessment has become simpler, need for enumerative validation has increased, particularly for inland, multispecies systems. This study compared fish abundance estimated from 1-d rotenone surveys with estimates obtained from a 120-kHz Simrad split-beam acoustic system within lock chambers of the Ohio River. A total of five lock chambers were surveyed by both methods in fall 1997 and 1998. Abundance estimates ranged from 10, 340-17, 887 fish in the rotenone survey and from 11, 543-14, 962 fish in the hydroacoustic surveys. The two survey methods were highly and positively correlated (r = 0.938), and corrected lock rotenone estimates were within -12% to +20% of those derived from hydroacoustic surveys. Comparison of the size distributions showed significant differences in the size distributions offish between methods, but peak modes for both methods occurred at the same range (75-99 mm). Differences in abundance estimates between the two methods were small and can be accounted for by differences in variability in 1-d capture efficiency of the rotenone method. Differences in the size distributions may be attributable to fish behavior (schooling) that may cause underrepresentation of smaller targets. Processing acoustic data on small spatial scales, as is possible in the Digital Echo Visualization and Information System (DEVIS) and the Simrad EP500 software (using layers), should result in better precision in hydroacoustic estimates in large rivers such as the Ohio Riven The results of this study should provide further confidence to managers interested in acoustic stock assessment in large rivers.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8,10.1577/1548-8675(2000)020<1049:VOHEOF>2.0.CO;2,United States;abundance estimation;acoustic method;stock assessment;Ohio,NA,NA,verification of hydroacoustic estimates of fish abundance in ohio river lock chambers

Here we conducted 4 experiments to examine interactions between shellfish and toxic (actively toxic or TOX-A from finfish-killing cultures and potentially toxic or TOX-B from cultures without finfish) and non-inducible (NON-IND, apparently incapable of killing fish via a toxic effect) strains of P. piscicida. First (Expt 1), we documented direct physical attack by P. piscicida TOX-A, TOX-B, and NON-IND zoospores on larvae of the bay scallop Argopecten irradians (Lamarck, 1819) and the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791). Within 5 min zoospores swarmed around larvae that had discarded their vela, and attached with their peduncles. Within 15 min they had penetrated into the shellfish visceral cavity and had begun to feed aggressively; after 30 min all shellfish tissues except the adductor muscle had been consumed. Second, we tested the response of scallop larvae to P. piscicida (TOX-A or TOX-B) or cryptomonads (as controls) that were held in dialysis tubing (0.22 μm porosity) to prevent direct contact. After 60 min larval survival was 0% in the TOX-A treatment, 100% in the cryptomonad control, and intermediate in TOX-B and TOX-B + cryptomonad treatments. The data indicate a toxic effect of P. piscicida zoospores on the larvae, separate from the physical effect shown in Expt 1. Third, we compared grazing by juvenile and adult oysters on TOX-A, TOX-B, and NON-IND P. piscicida zoospores from the medium. After 60 min, grazing by juvenile oysters significantly differed as NON-IND ≫ TOX-B ≫ TOX-A. In contrast, adult oysters grazed significantly fewer TOX-A zoospores and maintained comparable grazing on TOX-B and NON-IND zoospores. Thus juvenile oysters, but not adults, were sensitive to residual toxicity of TOX-B zoospores, and both life-history stages were sensitive to TOX-A zoospores. The adverse effects of toxic strains on larval survival and juvenile grazing indicate that P. piscicida could potentially affect shellfish recruitment. Fourth, we assessed zoospore survival after passage through the digestive tract of adult oysters. The feces contained many temporary cysts from zoospores, and within 24 h > 75% of the cysts produced motile cells. The data indicate that adult oysters would be poor biocontrol agents of P. piscicida, given the high survival of ingested zoospores following gut passage and fecal elimination; and that oysters could act as vectors of toxic P. piscicida strains if transported from affected estuaries to other waters.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 41; Correspondence Address: J.J.

Shortly before the beginning of the first flight period ampoule-type pheromone dispensers were set up lining a 6.5-ha rectangular plot. Around the dispenser zone a protection belt was created where Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and selective insecticides were applied against the second and third generation larvae. The protection belt was 35 m wide and covered 3.5 ha. The rest of the vineyard was divided into the reference plot - where conventional insecticide treatments were implemented to control both carpophagous pest generations, and the untreated control plot - which measured 1 ha. Male catches within the dispenser zone were virtually zero. Nevertheless, no difference was apparent between the percentage of mated females from within and outside of the dispenser zone. Attractant was released from the dispensers throughout the season at a rather constant rate, but by the middle of the third flight period dispensers were found to be almost empty. During the 3 years of the survey pest pressure was often at exceptionally high levels. The effectiveness of the mating disruption technique (MDT) was found to vary with year and pest generation. MDT was used against the first (anthophagous) generation with rather poor results. In the following carpophagous generations results were comparable to control measures with insecticides used and sometimes slightly better. The density of the pest population in the pheromone-treated vineyard as compared with the untreated control, was reduced on average by 67% in the second and by 57% in the third generation.

This bacterium is also a key source of genes for transgenic expression to provide pest resistance in plants and microorganisms as pets control agents in so-called genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The potential effects on human health and the environment of GMOs involve several aspects that are only remotely or not at all related to Bt products, and they are therefore outside the scope of this monograph.1.1. Identity, biological characteristics and analytical methods. Bt is a facultative anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium that forms characteristic protein inclusions adjacent to the endospore. Bt subspecies can synthesize more than one parasporal inclusion. Bt is genetically indistinguishable from Bc, except for the ability of Bt to produce parasporal crystalline inclusions, which are toxic for certain invertebrates, especially species of insect larvae belonging to the insect orders Coleoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera. The parasporal inclusions are formed by different insecticidal crystal proteins (ICP). The crystals have various shapes (bipyramidal, cuboidal, flat rhomboid, spherical or composite with two crystal types), depending on their ICP composition. A partial correlation between crystal morphology, ICP composition, and bioactivity against target insects has been established. The basic phenotypic taxon is the subspecies, identified by the flagellar (H) serotype. By 1998, 67 subspecies had been described. The genes that encode the ICPs are mostly on plasmids. Each ICP is the product of a single gene. Most plasmids with ICP genes are readily transferred by conjugation between Bt strains and may be transferred to related species of bacteria. The phenotypic classification has now been complemented by molecular biological characterization, based on the sequence of the crystal (cry and cyt) genes rather than target organism specificity. Different domains of the ICP are responsible for host susceptibility (receptor recognition) and toxicity (pore formation). Techniques commonly used to characterize Bt strains or the ICP itself include cell wall fatty acid analysis, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide DNA probes, plasmid profiles, polymerase chain reaction PCR analysis, DNA fingerprinting and SDS-PAGE profiles. Beta-exotoxin, a heat-stable nucleotide, is produced by some Bt subspecies during vegetative growth and may contaminate the products. Beta-exotoxin is toxic for almost all forms of life including humans and the target insect orders. During vegetative growth, various Bt strains produce an assortment of antibiotics, enzymes, metabolites and toxins, including Bc toxins, that may have detrimental effects on both target organisms and non-target organisms (NTOs). Spore counts do not accurately reflect the insecticidal activity of a Bt strain or Bt product. The potency (ITU/mg) of each Bt product is bioassayed using an international standard that uses a specific test insect. 1.2. Mode of action on target insects. The sporulated Bt with ICP or spore-ICP complexes must be ingested by a susceptible insect larva. The efficacy of the ICP depends on the solubilization in the midgut, the conversion of the protoxin to the biologically active toxin by proteolytic enzymes, specific membrane receptor binding by the C-terminal domain of the active toxin, and pore formation by the N-terminal domain with subsequent lysis of the epithelial cells. Spore germination and proliferation of the vegetative cells into the haemocoel may result in a septicaemia, contributing to the cause of death. Receptor binding by the ICP is the major determinant of host specificity by the different Bt ICPs. 1.3. Habitats. Many different Bt subspecies have been isolated from dead or dying insects mostly from the orders Coleoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, but many subspecies have also been isolated from soil, leaf surfaces and other habitats. The carcasses of dead insects often contain large quantities of spores and ICPs that may enter the environment. The coleopteran-active and lepidopteran-active Bt subspecies are primarily associated with the soil and phylloplane (leaf surfaces), whereas the dipteran-active Bt subspecies are commonly found in aquatic environments. In the environment, the spores persist and vegetative growth may occur when conditions are favourable and nutrients are available.1.4 Commercial products, production and application. Conventional Bt products, which utilize naturally-occurring Bt strains, account for approximately 90% of the world MPCA market. Most Bt products contain ICP and viable spores, but in some Bti products the spores are inactivated. Each year some 13,000 tomes are produced using aerobic fermentation technology. Conventional Bt products have been targeted primarily against lepidopteran pests of agricultural and forestry crops; however in recent years, Bt strains active against coleopteran pests have also been marketed. Strains of Bti active against dipteran vectors of parasitic and viral diseases are being used in public health programmes. Commercial Bt formulations may be applied as an insecticide to foliage, soil, water environments or food storage facilities. After the application of a Bt subspecies to an ecosystem, the vegetative cells and spores may persist at gradually decreasing concentrations for weeks, months or years as a component of the natural microflora. The ICPs, however, are rendered biologically inactive within hours or days. 1.5 Effects of Ct on non-target organisms. Studies on mammals, particularly those on laboratory animals, have evaluated possible infectivity and toxicity of various Bt preparations, which include the ICPs, vegetative cells and spores. The ICPs, spores and vegetative cells of the Bt subspecies, which were administered by different routes, were mostly non-pathogenic and nontoxic to the various animal species tested. The vegetative cells and/or spores of Bt were demonstrated to persist for weeks without causing adverse effects. Bt has not been observed to adversely affect birds, fish or many other non-target aquatic vertebrates tested in a large number of laboratory and field studies. Relatively few species of aquatic invertebrates are susceptible to Bt under either laboratory or field conditions. Bt does not adversely affect earthworms. The Bt subspecies have generally been shown to be highly specific in their insecticidal activity for Coleoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera and have demonstrated little, if any, direct toxicity to nontarget arthropods. Most of the existing safety data on non-target arthropods has been generated using the Bt subspecies with activity against Diptera and Lepidoptera. Studies of Bti formulations free of toxic contaminants have not demonstrated deleterious effects on the vast majority of non-target arthropods. Some midges (Diptera: Chironomidae), which are closely related to mosquitos, have been shown to be susceptible to high dosages of Bti, but are not affected by mosquito larvicidal dosages. In field studies, transient decreases or increases in populations of some non-target arthropods have been reported. Many insect orders have been tested in either the laboratory or field, most of which have shown no effect from Btk. Mortality has been observed in honey-bees (Apis mellifera) after exposure to vegetatively growing Btt and Btk, but the effect does not seem to be related to spores or ICPs. In laboratory and field studies Btg demonstrated no adverse effect on honey-bees. Bte strains that produce beta-exotoxin have been shown to have adverse effects on non-target arthropods. 1.6. Exposure and effects of Bt on humans. The field application of Bt products can result in considerable aerosol and dermal exposure of workers. Agricultural uses of Bt can result in Bt contamination of potable water and food. With the exception of case reports on ocular and dermal irritation, no adverse health effects have been documented after occupational exposure to Bt products. Human volunteers ingested and inhaled large quantities of a Btk formulation but experienced no adverse health effects. Antibody titres to the vegetative cells, spores and spore-crystal complexes have been demonstrated in workers who spray Bt products; however, no adverse health effects were reported. There have been some case reports on the occurrence of Bt in patients with different infectious diseases. However,none of these studies unequivocally demonstrates an actual risk to human health from the use of Bt. Bt has not been reported to cause adverse effects on human health when present in drinking-water or food. 1.7. Conclusions. Owing to their specific mode of action, Bt products are unlikely to pose any hazard to humans or other vertebrates or to the great majority of non-target invertebrates provided that they are free from non-Bt microorganisms and biologically active products other than the ICPs. Bt products may be safely used for the control of insect pests of agricultural and horticultural crops as well as forests. They are also safe for use in aquatic environments including drinking-water reservoirs for the control of mosquito, black fly and nuisance insect larvae. However, it should be noted that vegetative Bt has the potential for the production of Bc-like toxins, the significance of which as a cause of human disease is not known.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 12; CODEN: EHCRD,,Animalia;Apinae;Apis mellifera;Apoidea;Arthropoda;Aves;Bacillus thuringiensis;Bacteria (microorganisms);Chironomidae;Coleoptera;Diptera;Hexapoda;Insecta;Invertebrata;Lepidoptera;Mammalia;Posibacteria;Simulium nigricoxum;Vertebrata;Bacillus thuringiensis toxin;bacterial protein;environmental chemical;exotoxin;insecticide;agriculture;bacterial spore;fermentation;health hazard;human;nonhuman;review;toxicity,NA,NA,microbial pest control agent bacillus thuringiensis

Box 140, Finland","Global change refers to all those changes that are taking place in the natural environment as a consequence of either natural processes or human activity as well as to the separate and combined effects of these changes on society and the economy. The most important aspects of global change is represented by climate change: the impacts of climate change are by definition universal, and indirectly they also have various effects on other spheres of the natural environment but also on industries, the social structure and indeed on all facets of social life (FIGARE 1999: http://figare.utu.fi/welcome.html) Contaminants are persistent in the environment and toxic to or bioaccumulative in biota. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs: e.g. PCBs, HCB, dioxins, pesticides and PAHs) and toxic, non-nutrient heavy metals are mainly regarded as contaminants. These compounds and elements are also typically long distances transported, e.g. from fossil fuel combustion. Many of them tend to re-volatilize from their initial site of deposition, thus enhancing their global distribution (Wania and Mackay 1993). The emissions and use of these substances have been banned on national level and international conventions have been agreed and ratified (CLRTAP 1998; www.unece.org/env/lrtap/ and UNEP 2001; http://irptc.unep.ch/pops and www.unep.org/GC 21st). Sustainable development should lead to controlled trade of these substances (Hylander 2001). The environmental fate of these substances have been studied and their distribution and effects are reasonably well understood (Mason et al. 1994, AMAP 1998; www.amap.no, Landers et al. 1998, Martinez-Cortizas et al. 1999). Still, several key questions remain unanswered as yet; the endocrine disrupting nature of POPs (Colborn et al. 1993), the elevated, harmful level of Hg in fish and mammals in background areas (AMAP 1998) and the Arctic as the ""ultimate"" sink for long-range transboundary contaminants (Schroeder et al. 1998, Schindler 1999, 2001). Alpine regions have been recognized as acingt as cold condensating systems as well (Blais et al. 1998). Global change may cause changes in the emission patterns of these substances; the general development of the third world countries, their energy demand and strategy (coal-Hg), changes in agriculture (pesticide use). Climate change may cause changes in the transport of contaminants: temperature affects the speciation (and degradation), air and ocean currents may change the transportation of substances. Drought and moisture levels affect the redox conditions in soils and sediments. Changes in biogeochemical cycling of carbon (food chains incl.) have importance in the behaviour and distribution of contaminants. Based on these assumptions, the prediction of the environmental fate of contaminants should be a logical component of the global change research. However, the recent IPCC report (IPCC 2001) and IGBP conference have paid only marginal attention on the biogeochemical cycling of contaminants (Int. Geosphere-Biosphere Programme 2001 ; http://sciconftalks.igbp.sr. unh.edu). Global change will find expression in different ways in different parts of the world, and the full effects of change will not necessarily be seen for decades or centuries to come. As far as the effects of global change are concerned, it is important to analyse both average changes and extreme phenomena (Grübler and Nakicenovic 2001). Until recently any effective response has been restricted to acute environmental effects at the regional or local level, where it has been possible to analyse causal relations and where economically viable solutions have been available (FIGARE 1999: http://figare.utu.fi/welcome.html). The regionalisation and modelling of the environmental fate of heavy metals (loading history, transport, transformation of, e.g., Hg and Cd) could be feasible cooperation topics for GTK and SYKE.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

Despite their widespread use, the impacts of these pesticides on the neurological health of wild salmon are not well understood. Of particular concern are the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides that block synaptic transmission by inhibiting neuronal acetylcholinesterase. Here we assess the effects of diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, on alarm pheromone induced antipredator responses and homing behavior in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Nominal exposure concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 μg·L-1) were chosen to emulate diazinon pulses in the natural environment. In the antipredator study, diazinon had no effect on swimming behavior or visually guided food capture. However, the pesticide significantly inhibited olfactory-mediated alarm responses at concentrations as low as 1.0 μg·L-1. Similarly, homing behavior was impaired at 10.0 μg·L-1. Our results suggest that olfactory-mediated behaviors are sensitive to anticholinesterase neurotoxicity in salmonids and that short-term, sublethal exposures to these insecticides may cause significant behavioral deficits. Such deficits may have negative consequences for survival and reproductive success in these fish.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 184; Correspondence Address: N.L.

Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity data submitted to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (US EPA's) Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) as part of the registration process are examined along with data from the open literature. Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity profiles are developed to provide a complete overview and to determine whether an association can be made between benomyl- and MBC-induced mouse liver tumors and aneuploidy. Since aneuploidogens are considered to indirectly affect DNA, the framework adopted by the Agency for evaluating any mode of action (MOA) for carcinogenesis is applied to the benomyl/MBC data. Both agents displayed consistent, positive results for aneuploidy induction but mostly negative results for gene mutations. Non-linear dose responses were seen both in vitro and in vivo for aneuploidy endpoints. No evidence was found suggesting that an alternative MOA other than aneuploidy may be operative. The data show that by 14 days of benomyl treatment, events associated with liver toxicity appear to set in motion the sequence of actions that leads to neoplasms. Genetic changes (as indicated by spindle impairment leading to missegregation of chromosomes, micronucleus induction and subsequent aneuploidy in bone marrow cells) can commence within 1-24h after dosing, well within the time frame for early key events. Critical steps associated with frank tumor formation in the mouse liver include hepatotoxicity, increased liver weights, cell proliferation, hypertrophy, and other steps involving hepatocellular alteration and eventual progression to neoplasms. The analysis, however, reveals weaknesses in the data base for both agents (i.e. no studies on mouse tubulin binding, no in vivo assays of aneuploidy on the target tissue (liver), and no clear data on cell proliferation relative to dose response and time dependency). The deficiencies in defining the MOA for benomyl/MBC introduce uncertainties into the analysis; consequently, benomyl/MBC induction of aneuploidy cannot be definitively linked to mouse liver carcinogenicity at this time. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Fertilized eggs (embryos) from a single mating were divided into three groups differing in de-adhesion and rearing media: 1) de-adhesed with suspended solids from the river and reared in unfiltered river water (SS-UFW), 2) de-adhesed with Fuller's Earth and reared in filtered river water (FE-FW, experimental control), and 3) de-adhesed with river bottom sediment and reared in filtered river water (SED-FW). Uptake of organochlorine pesticides, Aroclor 1200 series PCBs and metals and survival of embryos were assessed. Eight metals and two organochlorine compounds (DDE and PCB Aroclor 1260) were detected in embryos. Uptake of some metals was significantly different between and among treatments and controls (Kruskal-Wallace, Mann-Whitney U-tests, P < 0.05). The PCB Aroclor 1260 was not detected in embryos from the SS-UFW treatment, but it was detected in some replicates from the SED-FW treatment and the experimental controls (FE-FW). All embryos from the SS-UFW treatment developed heavy fungal growth and died within 8 d. Fungal growth was not associated with embryos in the SED-FW or FE-FW samples; however, the SED-FW embryos displayed significantly higher mortality (20.6%) than the FE-FW embryos (12.6%; P = 0.036). It was concluded that copper and Aroclor 1260 in the rearing media are potentially decreasing survival and incubation time of white sturgeon embryos.

Thus, as androgen receptor antagonists, the fungicide vinclozolin and the principal DDT metabolite p,p'-DDE have been demonstrated to induce demasculinization in rats. Whether this is also the case in fish remains to be demonstrated. For a period of 30 days, groups of adult male guppies were exposed to vinclozolin, p,p'-DDE, or the therapeutic antiandrogen flutamide (used as positive control) applied to the fodder at concentrations between 0.1 and 100 μg/g fodder. Subsequently, sexual characteristics of relevance to the male reproductive capacity were measured and compared with untreated control fish. All three chemicals caused profound alterations at increasing levels of biological organization, even in these fully matured males. At the cellular level, the three compounds induced a significant reduction in the number of ejaculated sperm cells. At the organ level, the sexually attractive orange-yellow coloration was reduced in area and discolored, and treated fish also had smaller testes. Further, at the organismal level, computer-aided behavior analyses demonstrated a severe disruption in male courtship behavior. We conclude that this demasculinization is consistent with an antiandrogenic action of vinclozolin and p,p'-DDE and is likely to compromise reproductive capability in this fish.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 166; Correspondence Address: E.

In this study, we exposed Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to o,p'-DDT using two exposure protocols: direct exposure of early life stages to aqueous solutions from 1 to 100 d posthatch and exposure of female medaka to aqueous solutions, followed by mating with unexposed males to produce offspring that were exposed through mechanisms of maternal transfer. In treatments with direct aqueous exposures, an intersex condition of the gonad (testisova) was observed in male medaka exposed at early life stages to nominal o,p'-DDT concentrations of 50, 10, and 5 μg/L, indicating that this estrogen agonist can alter gonadal development when exposure occurs continuously over the period of gonadal differentiation. Comparisons with previously published data on the induction of testis-ova by exposure to nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP) indicated that the relative potencies for induction of intersex in medaka are o,p'-DDT > NP = OP, which is not consistent with the relative estrogenic potencies of OP > NP > o,p'- DDT observed in the yeast estrogen screening (YES) assay. In the maternal transfer protocol, no testis-ova were observed in the offspring, although there was some delay in time to hatch of the offspring. Medaka exposed by maternal transfer showed no other toxicological responses during early life stages, but when treated fish reached sexual maturity, the females showed more advanced development of oocytes. In addition, when medaka exposed by maternal transfer were subsequently exposed at 10 months of age to 17β- estradiol (12 mg/L), there was a significantly greater induction of hepatic vitellogenin in DDT-exposed males in comparison to control males, indicating that exposure to estrogenic chemicals during early life stages may potentiate vitellogenin induction following exposure events later in the life of the fish.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 88; Correspondence Address: C.D.

However, this defence is very sensitive to the presence of different inhibitors present in many environmental pollutants, microbial products, or extracts from polluted river and marine water. Recently, interactions between P-glycoprotein and pesticides have also been reported. This possibility directed us to assess the MXR inhibitory potential of pesticides. Using both the in vitro (cell culture) and the in vivo (mussel Dreissena polymorpha) method, we tested 16 pesticides representing several chemical classes that are used commercially in Croatia. We also investigated the MXR modulating effect of binary combinations of pesticides, and classified observed effects as antagonism, additivity or synergism. Our results clearly demonstrate that several pesticides, in concentrations far below officially established LD50 values for fish, exhibit a strong MXR inhibitory effect.

This activity often takes place in areas subjected to various recurring pollutions. The recrudescent use of herbicides in agriculture including atrazine implies pollutant transfer towards aquatic environment in estuarine areas. Harmful effects of such substances on animals in marine environment, particularly on cultured bivalves, are poorly documented. Bivalve molluscs such as mussels and oysters have been postulated as ideal indicator organisms because of their way of life. They filter large volumes of seawater and may therefore accumulate and concentrate contaminants within their tissues. Moreover, development of techniques allowing effect analysis of such compounds on bivalve biology may lead to the development of diagnosis tools adapted to analyze pollutant transfer towards estuarine areas. In this context, influence of atrazine on defence mechanisms was analyzed in Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas. Atrazine was tested in vitro and in vivo on oyster haemocytes, and its effects were analyzed by flow cytometry. Haemocyte viability, cell cycle and cellular activities were monitored.

Sperm is released in the form of sperm trails laid on the nest surface; subsequently active spermatozoa leave the trails and move in the water for several minutes. Sperm trails consists of bands of viscous material in which sperm is embedded. The water samples for the estimation of sperm presence were collected gradually within 180 min after 24 hr, 2 weeks, 1 month and 2 months of exposure. It was established that the reduction in count, activity of sperm and the average life span of sperm trails were significant (p < 0.05) at the tested concentrations 5 μg/l and 50 μg/l DDT after 1 month of exposure.

A synthetic pyrethroid, cypermethrin, is licensed for use on fish farms to control sea lice infestations as a formulation called Excis®. In this study, uptake of cypermethrin from Excis® exposure is investigated through the use of gas chromatography with mass-spectrometry. The effects of Excis® on mussels are also examined by measuring the neutral red retention time of lysosomes, aerial survival and shell closure. The isomeric ratios of cis:trans cypermethrin measured in mussels are around 80:20; a marked increase from 40:60 to which the mussels were exposed. This is most likely due to preferential metabolism of trans-isomers, as the same response is seen in vertebrates. There is a pronounced behavioural effect of shell closure, where mussels exposed to 1000 μg/l cypermethrin shut their shells within an hour of exposure. Arguments are presented for this effect being either a voluntary response on recognition of cypermethrin, or an effect arising from an involuntary action of cypermethrin on the adductor muscle. Even at 1000 μg/l cypermethrin, neutral red retention time and aerial survival are not affected. The data suggest that the responses of mussels shown here are unlikely to occur in the field, even at the concentrations of cypermethrin used in fish cages, for the treatment of sea lice.

One of the host defense mechanisms that S. typhimurium encounters upon infection is superoxide produced by the phagocytes' NADPH-oxidase. Salmonella has evolved numerous ways of coping with superoxide in the extracellular environment. In addition, Salmonella has to defend itself against superoxide produced as a by-product of aerobic respiration. Over the last decade, research on bacterial mutants has led to the identification of Salmonella strains that differ from their parental strain in susceptibility to superoxide in vitro. However, the consequences of such mutations for bacterial virulence are highly variable, indicating that superoxide sensitivity per se is not a characteristic that renders Salmonella less virulent. By discussing various bacterial mutants classified according to their in vitro sensitivity to superoxide, we will exemplify the complex mechanisms that Salmonella has evolved to cope with superoxide stress. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

Eight species of carabids were collected in pitfall traps. The three most common beetles, Steropus gallega Fairmaire (65.8%), Pseudophonus rufipes (DeGeer) (18.2%) and Poecilus cupreus L. (14.6%), represented more than 98% of the total catches. The specific dominance depended on the sampling date. The soil management treatment significantly affected the following parameters. (1) The overall carabid catch: the plastic mulch (5.6% of the total catches) negatively affected total carabid collection, which was higher in the tilled (24.3%) and herbicide-treated (21.4%) plots, although not significantly different from the natural soil (16.5%), straw mulch (16.3%) and pine-bark mulch (15.9%) treatments. (2) The specific preferences of the three most common carabids: the plastic cover adversely affected the catches of S. gallega whilst P. rufipes was collected in greater numbers in tilled areas and P. cupreus in the herbicide treatments. (3) The structure of the carabid community: based on species richness, diversity and evenness indices, herbicide and tillage provided the most diverse carabid community and the straw mulch the poorest.

To investigate these multiple stressor impacts, the NRBS used a cumulative effects of assessment (CEA) based upon a weight of evidence approach. This CEA determined the exposure and effects of multiple stressors on these systems and included experimental verification of causality and linkage of this understanding to field data. Fish studies confirmed that dioxins and furans occur in the food web at low levels across the basins; detection frequencies for all 2,3,7,8-substituted dioxin/furan congeners (2,3,7,8 TCDD/TCDF) were highest near bleached kraft pulp mills. PCDD/Fs, rather than PCBs or organochlorine pesticides, were the chemicals of concern for human exposure. In addition, the recent decline in concentrations of dioxins and furans in fish was commensurate with improvements in pulp mill treatment technologies. Throughout the basins, enrichment occurred below pulp mill and municipal discharges. Multiple stressor effects of pulp mill effluent were separated from one another by using experiments that demonstrated that the primary impact of the mill effluent was nutrient enrichment. River state was also greatly influenced by hydrologic impacts. In particularly, the Bennett Dam changed the ecology of the Peace-Slave river-delta systems more than 1500 km downstream, while climate variability was an important contributing factor for these delta impacts. Notable contributions of the NRBS model were the cooperation among governments, aboriginal peoples, non-government organizations, industry and other stakeholders, and the two-way communications flow among the scientific community and these groups. NRBS science was also deemed relevant because 16 questions forwarded by stakeholders focused the Study's CEA on specific issues of importance within the basin. In summary, the NRBS model of CEA included four key components: (1) communication of stakeholder priorities to produce relevant science questions; (2) pursuit of the best available scientific understanding of ecosystem impacts by engaging interdisciplinary science teams; (3) assessment of future environmental condition through monitoring and follow-up investigation; and (4) communication of results to managers to produce appropriate regulatory change. This CEA model combines these elements with scientific rigor to generate meaningful information to stakeholders while also improving regional assessments of river basins.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 40; Correspondence Address: J.M.

Thirty-day laboratory chronic studies were conducted to determine the relative sensitivity of standard (e.g. survival and growth) and non-standard behavioral (e.g. swimming capacity, feeding efficiency, and aggression) endpoints in predicting concentrations of fonofos protective of bluegill growth and survival. The lowest observable effect concentration (LOECs) for the standard measures of survival and growth was 5.6 μg/L. Two behavioral endpoints were of similar sensitivity to the standard measures: swimming capacity, LOEC of 5.6 μg/L; and prey strike frequency, LOEC of 5.6 μg/L. However, aggressive interactions were ten-fold more sensitive than swimming or feeding behavior with a LOEC occurring at 0.6 μg/L. Lab results were compared to an aquatic mesocosm study which exposed adult and juvenile bluegill to a 9.41 μg/L concentration of fonofos. The dissipation half-life of fonofos was 5 days in 0.1 hectare aquatic mesocosms. Significant mortality among caged bluegill occurred within 4 days of exposure at 9.41 μg/L. However, the 9.41 μg/L concentration of fonofos had no statistically significant effects on survival, growth, reproduction, or total biomass of free-ranging populations of bluegill.

Despite the fact that total individual numbers of the carabid populations, total species numbers, and number of dominant species were clearly higher in the field under reduced management, Renkonen's Re showed only a slight difference between the fields with nearly three-quarter correspondence in dominance structure. The presence of five more carabid species on the field under reduced management is underlined by the low values of Jaccard's species identity and Wainstein's Kw index of similarity. On the other hand, according to Shannon-Weaver's Hs for species diversity and Shannon's Es for evenness, the differences between the fields are minor. Even if only the dominant species were taken into account, the similarity between both fields was obvious, despite the fact that in the field under reduced management two more dominant carabid species were found. In both fields, phytophagous Amara similata was the most abundant species. Nevertheless, a special oil seed rape carabid coenosis seems to exist as well, as one was found for cereal crops and for root crops, which might consist of A. similata, Amara aenea, Harpalus affinis, Poecilus cupreus, Pseudophonus rufipes, and Pterostichus melanarius. For P. cupreus, which was chosen as a typically predacious and beneficial carabid species in oil seed rape, biomass, fecundity and determination of the degree of gut filling also showed no differences for the fields. Even the length of elytrae as an indicator for nutritional situation in the preceding year showed no difference. Only the phenology of P. cupreus showed an obvious shift of the peak in activity-density in the intensively managed field, to a later date in the season, compared with the field under reduced management. The latter reflects the usual spring peak. No sufficient explanation was found for the peak 4 weeks later on the intensively managed field. It can be assumed that a less sufficient food supply (higher numbers of potential food, e.g. larvae of Meligethes spp. in the field under reduced management), due to insecticide input, or long-term biocide impact on P. cupreus, or a faster growth of rape plants due to high nitrogen input resulting in a less favourable microclimate on the intensively managed field, was responsible for this later peak in activity-density. To conclude, the relations between the predacious carabids, their potential prey, and the abiotic factors in the habitats seem to be much more complicated than assumed. There is a strong hint that the impact of single parameters such as field management influencing the phenology change obviously over the carabids activity period.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 25; Correspondence Address: W.

The strait is a shallow shelf with an average depth of about 40 m, but the southern quarter is steep. The Penghu Islands are located in the middle of the strait, the Taiwan Shoal in the southwest, and Kaoping (submarine) Canyon in the southeast. Seventeen rivers in Taiwan flow into the strait. Steady currents in the offshore area and tidal currents along the western coast of Taiwan are two major physical features. In winter, the NE monsoon drives the water in the north strait southward to encounter the northward current from a branch of the Kuroshio, and the merging current flows to the South China Sea. In summer, when the SW monsoon prevails, South China Sea water flows northward and passes all the way through the strait. Along the western coast of Taiwan, the tidal currents flow northward in the southern section and southward in the northern section during flood tides. The current direction reverses during ebb tides. The semi-diurnal tides dominate the currents along the coast. Five types of habitat, including estuaries, sandy beaches, mud flats, lagoons, and coral reefs, exist in the coastal areas of western Taiwan. Estuaries and lagoons are important nursery grounds for many commercial species of fishes, shrimps, and prawns. The wetlands have been exploited for aquaculture; oysters, hard clams and purple clams are the main cultured organisms. Coral reefs in the Penghu Islands and Hsiaoliuchiu are dominated by reef-building corals. The reef areas in the strait are the major fishing grounds of anchovy larval fishery, demersal fish and shrimps. The offshore areas are important fishing grounds for coastal fisheries; major target fishes are mackerel, jacks, grey mullet and clupeoid larvae. The grey mullet fishery is an important seasonal fishery in the strait, generally in December every year. On the other hand, clupeoid larvae are the most abundant fishes in the coastal waters; the peak fishing season of larval anchovies in March and April. Two popular methods for artisanal fishing are beach seine and spear fishing. Major wave directions in the strait induce longshore currents to flow southward in the north strait and northward in the south strait. Generally, Taiwan's coasts have been eroded in the north and south sections of the western coast, while in the middle section, sand is deposited reducing water depth, or even forming new land. In recent years, the impact of groundwater extraction for mariculture has caused serious land subsidence along the littoral zone. There are seven districts on the western coast which suffer from serious land subsidence problems. Most of the population on Taiwan resides on the western side bordering the strait; the western coast with dense population is therefore seriously affected by human activities. Over the last two to three decades, rapid industrialization and population concentration in cities have led to runoff of domestic, industrial and agricultural wastewater, thermal effluents from power plants, pesticides and garbage via rivers to the sea. This has seriously polluted the coastal environment of Taiwan, especially the western coast. In addition, increasing fishing intensity and improved fishing methods have over-exploited the coastal fishery resources, leading to resource degradation. The coastal zone is severely abused by both the private and public sectors, causing serious damage to existing land and water resources, environmental pollution, adverse geographical changes in coastal areas, etc. Currently a wide spectrum of measures, including preventive environmental impact assessment and environmental monitoring programs, have been employed. Coastal resources are protected under a special plan, and seven coastal conservation zones (CCZ) have been established. In addition, three societies are dedicated to promoting public awareness, environmental education, research and conservation activities in Taiwan.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1,,China;East China Sea;South China Sea;coastal zone management;environmental assessment;human activity;Taiwan,NA,NA,taiwan strait

It has more than 2000 islands and a complex coastline with numerous gulfs. The main physical characteristics of this system are the general cyclonic movement of surface water, the high salinity, the dissolved oxygen saturation, the low biomass and the low availability of nutrients. It is affected also by the Black Sea water which comes into the Aegean through the Dardanelles. Many human activities (urban, industrial, marine, rural, etc.) affect the water quality and threaten this fragile ecosystem. Most of the environmental problems are concentrated near the large cities where many scheduled works for pollution control are either delayed or are ineffectively designed. As a result, in many areas the level of heavy metals, organic pollutants and nutrient concentrations are significantly elevated. Some gulfs suffer seasonally from eutrophication and anoxic condition problems. Oil spills and litter have frequently been encountered on the beaches during the last few years. Furthermore, the excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides contributes significantly to the deterioration of many coastal ecosystems of the Aegean. The Aegean coastline is one of the most valuable natural resources, as it generates value from tourism, recreation, transport, fisheries, aquaculture and salt extraction, but it is managed without any serious planning both in Greece and in Turkey. Social pressures for better environment quality are still low, although numerous economic activities are directly dependent on improving the environmental condition. It is still not clear to many that high environment quality is directly related to socio-economic development and prosperity.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 7,,Mediterranean Sea;economic activity;environmental assessment;human activity;oceanography;pollution,NA,NA,the aegean sea

To examine whether altered VTG expression predicts reproductive impairment, we exposed medaka (Oryzias latipes) for 2 or 8 weeks posthatch to 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 7.5 ppb of the environmental estrogen o,p'-DDT. Fish were sampled 2, 4, and 8 weeks after hatch to examine VTG expression and gonad development. After exposure, fish were transferred to clean water, grown to sexual maturity, and placed in mating pairs. We collected eggs for 7 days and scored them for fecundity (number of eggs), fertility (percent fertilized), and hatching success (percent hatched). DDT had no effect on VTG expression after a 2-week exposure, whereas all doses induced VTG after 8 weeks. At both exposure durations, the highest doses of DDT caused a female-skewed sex ratio in adults. Gonadal feminization appeared to be progressive: some ovotestes were observed after 2- or 4-week exposure to the two highest doses, but the proportion of ovaries increased after 8 weeks. Both 2- and 8-week exposures significantly reduced fertility and hatching success at all doses, with lower doses having a greater effect after longer exposure. Fertility and hatching success were more sensitive to estrogenic disruption than were gonad differentiation and vitellogenin expression. We suggest that VTG expression may be interpreted as a warning of reproductive consequences, but absence of expression cannot be interpreted as absence of consequences.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 94; Correspondence Address: A.O.

Box 1050, Norway","A variety of organic chemicals have been documented to bind to and activate the estrogen receptor (ER) and consequently induce estrogenic effects in different animals. Although the function of the ER seems phylogenetically conserved in vertebrates, a considerable interspecies variation in the structure of the ER has been demonstrated. In this study, the hepatic ER from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhunchus rnykiss) were partly characterized, and the ligand-binding preference for a range of endogenous steroids and environmental estrogens (estrogen mimics) was determined by receptor-radio ligand studies. The results show that both Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout livers contain ERs that bind 1,2,4,6,7-[3H]estradiol ([3H]-E2) with high affinity and low capacity (Kd = 2.5-4.4 nM and Bmax = 27-97 fmol/mg protein). The Atlantic salmon ER (asER) and rainbow trout ER (rtER) exhibit similar [3H]-E2 binding characteristics, although livers from female fish contained a two to three times higher amounts of ER than the males in the two species. In competition studies with [3H]-E2, the asER and rtER were found to bind both native steroids (E2 > estrone > 17β-estradiol 17-glucuronide ≫ testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone) and putative estrogen mimics (diethylstilbestrol, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, ethynylestradiol > genistein, zearalenone > 4+octylphenol, 4-n-nonylphenol, and o,p′-DDT). The pesticides toxaphen and dieldrin, which are proposed to bind to and activate the human ER, did not display significant binding affinity for the fish ER, however. In general, the asER and rtER were found to bind both native steroids and estrogen mimics with similar affinity and specificity. The present results suggest that closely related species such as Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout display similar ER ligand-binding requirements, although interspecies differences in ER affinity and specificity between divergent species such as fish and humans may exist. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 76; Correspondence Address: K.-E.

The life‐cycle of Saprolegnia parasitica was considered in relation to the use of protective fungicides against it in salmonid fish hatcheries. Malachite green oxalate was the example fungicide, and all experiments were at 10°C. If the fungicide is to be used as a continuous addition to the water, as a protectant, then target stages of the fungus are identified as zoospores and secondary zoospore cysts: the latter, although physically sedimentary, have a remarkably high degree of buoyancy in the water and hence pose a constant threat to the fish. Continuous addition to the water, to give 0·25 mgl−1 malachite green oxalate, would be expected to kill zoospores and zoospore cysts, but 0·05 mgl−1, while allowing zoospore cyst germination, was a strong inhibitor to fungal growth and, aided by natural defences of the fish, might well succeed in disease prevention. If the fungicide is to be used as an intermittent addition to the water (every 24 h), then target stages of the fungus are small mycelia on the fish in addition to zoospores and zoospore cysts in the water. An experimental model was made to consider the vulnerability of these small mycelia, growing on the fish over the preceding 24 h, to malachite green oxalate. If mycelia are of narrow diameter, as expected, then 0·25 mgl−1 malachite green oxalate, applied for 15 min, should control their growth and protect the fish. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

While experts state that there is an excellent standard of food quality and that faulty dealing with foods ranks as the highest hazard, German people mostly fear ""chemicals in foods"". In order to investigate this complex information process, the Institute monitors German mass media (newspapers; magazines, TV) regarding food- and nutrition-related issues and, since 1992, trends in food-related consumer concerns by annual surveys. The results of these consecutive surveys indicate that nutrition-related concerns are rather stable. Overall they are higher in West Germany, but people in East Germany tend to adjust their perception, e.g. in 1994 they classified risks related to pesticides almost as highly as western people. Risks due to spoiled foods were ranked high in 1992, probably because of numerous media reports on Salmonellosis during that time; unfortunately this rating reversed subsequently. Risks attributed to gene technology in foods are increasing continuously. In conclusion, much has to be done in nutritional communication in order to improve the unsatisfactory perception of food-related risks.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; CODEN: APPTD,,Germany,NA,NA,trends in consumer concerns regarding foodrelated risks between 1992 and 1994 in germany

Eight therapeutic groups were studied: antiasthmatics, antidepressants, antimicrobials, benzodiazepines, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), hypoglycaemics, lipid-lowering agents and ulcer-healing drugs. Each group was then subdivided into its main chemical groups. The regional use of each chemical group was defined as the combined DDDs of its individual chemical entities per quarter year, from January 1989 until December 1994. (2) During this period, drug use increased in all eight therapeutic groups and in most of their constituent chemical groups: Increased use of newer drugs did not cause the expected decrease in use of established drugs. Use of all broad- spectrum antimicrobials increased by 314%. Use of sedative benzodiazepines decreased slowly and steadily (16%) throughout the study period but use of all hypnotics increased inexplicably by 21% in 1992 reaching a plateau in 1993 and 1994. SSRI antidepressant use increased sharply (5333%) following their introduction in 1989, accompanied by a 24% increase in use of tricyclic antidepressants. There was a 23626% increase in the use of proton pump inhibitors and a smaller but steady increase of 38% in use of histamine H2 antagonists; it is unlikely that much of the prescribing of anti-ulcer and antimicrobials was accurately targeted and rationally defensible.

To test this hypothesis, the ability of pronephric phagocytes from an estuarine fish, Fundulus heteroclitus, to produce reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) and kill a pathogenic strain of bacteria was studied following in vitro exposure to sublethal doses of pentachlorophenol (PCP). Enriched cultures of macrophages and eosinophils were exposed to 0-20 mg/liter PCP. The cells were then assayed for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and bactericidal activity against Listonella anguillarum, the etiological agent responsible for vibriosis in marine and estuarine fish. In the absence of PCP, the production of H2O2 and bactericidal capacity were significantly greater in eosinophils than in macrophages. Macrophage and eosinophil bactericidal activity was inhibited by PCP concentrations ≤ 5 mg/liter and ≤ 10 mg/liter, respectively, at 20 mg/liter, bactericidal activity was essentially eliminated in both cell types. Although changes in H2O2 production were not detected in either phagocyte population following exposure to PCP, previous studies have shown such treatment significantly inhibits phagocytosis and the production of superoxide. Taken with the current results, these data indicate that suppression of these activities by chronic PCP exposure could result in decreased cell-mediated protective capacity against pathogens.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 13; CODEN: MERSD,10.1016/0141-1136(95)00024-0,Fundulus heteroclitus;Listonella anguillarum;hydrogen peroxide;pentachlorophenol;reactive oxygen metabolite;superoxide;estuarine fish;organochlorine;phagocytosis;pollution;pollution effects;animal cell;antimicrobial activity;article;bactericidal activity;bacterium;biosynthesis;cell culture;cell type;controlled study;defense mechanism;eosinophil;fish;macrophage;nonhuman;phagocyte;Hydrogen;Phagocytes;Hydrogenation,NA,NA,hydrogen peroxide production and bactericidal activity in pronephros phagocyte subpopulations from fundulus heteroclitus following exposure to pentachlorophenol

L7R 4A6, P.O. Box 5050, Canada","Pollution from persistent toxic substances, interpreted as downward causation from the Biosphere, was the primary factor causing the integration of human and ecosystem health in the Great Lakes Basin. Institutional measures that set the political stage for integration were the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreements of 1972 and 1978 (the latter with an accent on an ecosystem approach and persistent toxic substances). Fish and wildlife biologists played a crucial role as ""eco-catalysts"" in alerting the public and the International Joint Commission (IJC) to reproductive and developmental health problems associated with persistent toxic substances in fish, reptiles, birds, mammals, and - by implication - humans. The rationale for the recommendation to sunset industrial chlorine stemmed from the IJC's conclusion that persistent toxic substances, including many organochlorines, are harmful to humans and the Biosphere. It is conjectured that the focus on chlorinated chemicals arose from the fact that more than half of the 373 persistent toxic substances identified in the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem were organochlorines; the uncontrollability of many organochlorines in the production phase, in long-range transport in air and water, in chemical transformations in the environment, and in bioaccumulation in food chains; and the need for a strategic spearhead to break the dysfunctional, after-the-fact, one-by-one approach to regulating persistent toxic substances. Generic controls are necessary whenever public health or property is threatened by environmental conversion from harmless to harmful forms (as in the case of phosphorus, lead, mercury, and PCBs). Attention is drawn to the rarity of organochlorines in vertebrates and their general use in defense also to the bypassing of lower halogens in favor of iodine (as thyroxine) in regulating basal metabolism in vertebrates. The sunsetting of industrial chlorine is considered essential to the protection of human and biospheric health; however, because of the current requirement for proof of harm, chemical by chemical, the process is likely to take decades.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3,10.1111/j.1526-0992.1997.00056.pp.x,"North America, Great Lakes;chlorine;ecosystem health;health impact;human health;industrial emissions;organochlorine;pollution policy;Humanities;Humanism;Humans",NA,NA,integrating human and ecosystem health in the great lakes basin the rationale for sunsetting industrial chlorine

Overall low levels of population differentiation were evident among populations. Nei's genetic distances between population pairs ranged from 0.003 to 0.054, with an overall species mean of 0.019, with slightly greater divergence among the three R populations. Most of the total gene diversity was found within populations for both S and R populations. A mean of 3.7% of the variation occurred among S populations, with a higher value of 12.1% distributed among the R populations. A comparison of observed levels of heterozygosity with expected levels under random mating, provided evidence for significant departures from random mating, as lower mean values than expected were observed for both the R populations (0.133 vs. 0.153) and S populations (0.159 and 0.184), suggesting that a low level of selfing may be occurring in these populations. The distribution of genetic variation among and within populations of B. rapa was consistent with predicted pattems for predominantly allogamous species. The reduced levels of genetic variation observed for the three R populations were not as striking as that previously reported for triazine‐resistant auto‐gamous species.

Pine River Rd, United States""]","The objective of this risk assessment was to determine the probability and significance of effects of chlorpyrifos [O,O-diethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2- pyridyl) phosphorothioate)]on aquatic ecosystems in North America. The primary focus of the risk assessment was agricultural ecosystems, especially row crops and, in particular, the ""corn-belt"" agroecosystems. Where data were available, other major crop and noncrop uses of chlorpyrifos were also assessed for their potential contribution to effects. Exposure and effects in freshwater and saltwater environments were considered. Aquatic invertebrates and fish were included in the assessment but amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals were not. The assessment endpoints were selected on the basis of the pathways of chlorpyrifos exposure, patterns of chlorpyrifos toxicity, and judgments about the ecological, economic, and social importance of ecosystem components at risk. The assessment endpoint for fish was population persistence (a function of survival, growth, and recruitment), while for invertebrates it was community productivity. Measures of effect were survival, growth, or reproduction of individual organisms, as determined in laboratory toxicity tests, and fish survival and invertebrate population abundance in field mesocosm tests. For this risk assessment, acute toxicity values for freshwater and saltwater organisms (fish and invertebrates) constituted the most important set of measurement endpoints. Chronic toxicity, either measured directly or extrapolated from acute toxicity values, was also considered. The risk assessment used a ""lines of evidence"" approach and expert judgment to integrate laboratory toxicity measurements and mesocosm results into a reference value for ecological effects of chlorpyrifos. Laboratory toxicity data were used to support a quantitative probabilistic assessment, and the mesocosm studies supported a more qualitative evaluation of ecological significance. The environmental transformation products of chlorpyrifos are more water soluble than chlorpyrifos, and the environmental fate and significance of the products are dramatically altered because of this difference. Not only are they more easily eliminated by organisms, but they are also less likely to be partitioned into organisms. None of the transformation products of chlorpyrifos is sufficiently toxic or persistent in the environment to be of toxicological concern. Biomagnification of chlorpyrifos or its metabolites in the food chain was judged not to be relevant to the risk assessment. The only molecule judged to be relevant in an ecological risk assessment was the parent molecule, chlorpyrifos. Estimates of exposure concentrations were developed using two parallel approaches: simulation modeling, and analysis of surface water monitoring data. For the use of chlorpyrifos in corn, spray drift was judged to be a minor route of entry to aquatic systems; the modeling addressed runoff from T-band applications in this use. The modeling effort proceeded through three phases, or tiers. Tier I was a simplistic, generic calculation of concentrations in a pond receiving water running off a generalized agricultural field after a single application of chlorpyrifos, using EPA's GENEEC model. Tier II involved simulation of two representative sites, selected to represent extreme environmental conditions and median values over multiple years, using current renditions of the GLEAMS and EXAMS models. In Tier III, multiple sets of input parameters for GLEAMS and EXAMS were selected from their respective probability distributions, and the model output was, in turn, presented as probability distributions of chlorpyrifos concentrations. Environmental concentration data for chlorpyrifos in surface waters have been collected from a number of sites in the U.S. These data were the basis for the Tier IV risk assessment, and the sites included Lake Erie, the U.S. Midwest, California, and various agricultural and urban watersheds sampled under the National Water Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA). Sites where monitoring data had been collected coincided with areas identified to be at greater risk for contamination with chlorpyrifos because of magnitude of use and the characteristics of the environment. Thus, the monitoring data were judged to represent areas where greater exposures would likely occur, and risk assessments in these regions would be protective of other areas where use was less prevalent or climatic conditions were such as to minimize runoff or contamination of streams and other bodies of water. The distribution analysis of 48-hr LC50/EC50S for all freshwater organisms (including rotifers, mollusks, and other insensitive organisms) demonstrated a wide range of sensitivity to chlorpyrifos, spanning five orders of magnitude, and resulted in a 10th centile intercept of 102 ng/L. Freshwater and saltwater vertebrates exhibited a narrower range of sensitivity with 10 th centile intercepts of 5358 and 832 ng/L, respectively. Freshwater (FW) and saltwater (SW) arthropods were consistently more susceptible than the vertebrates, and there was a small difference between those species from freshwater and saltwater with 10th centile intercepts of 55 and 15 ng/L, respectively. Final acute and chronic values (FAVs and FCVs) were calculated using the methods to derive water quality standards prescribed by the Great Lakes Initiative (GLI). Using the four least genus mean acute values (GMAVs), a chlorpyrifos FAV of 148 ng/L was calculated. The mean acute-to-chronic ratio (ACR) for chlorpyrifos in saltwater and freshwater organisms was 8, with an observed range from 1.4 to 181. Application of the average chlorpyrifos ACR of 8 to the FAV of 148 ng/L gave an FCV of 18 ng/L. Although data on sediment toxicity and concentrations of chlorpyrifos in sediments are sparse, the available data do not suggest that the sediment route of exposure represents a widespread and significant risk. However, where water column concentrations were deemed to be potentially toxic, concentrations in the sediments may also present a risk. The results of microcosm and mesocosm studies indicate that exposure to chlorpyrifos concentrations <100 ng/L affect few, if any, aquatic taxa. At concentrations of >200 ng/L, effects on invertebrates were more widespread, but nearly all populations recovered within 2-8 wk. At 500 ng/L and greater, survival and growth of some fish species were affected. A concentration of 100 ng/L can be taken as a conservative no-observed-adverse-effect concentration (NOAEC) for overall ecosystem response, and exposures to greater concentrations result in a variety of direct and indirect ecological effects. This NOAEC needs to be judged in the context of the microcosm exposures which were, in many cases, greater than the commonly observed field duration of 48 hr in streams and rivers. Crustaceans (notably cladocerans, copepods, ostracods, and amphipods) and some emergent insects (mayflies) were typically the most sensitive taxa, while other insects, rotifers, and snails were typically more tolerant. Almost invariably, some tolerant taxa increased in abundance when their more sensitive competitors were reduced. Populations of affected species generally recovered rapidly as chlorpyrifos disappeared from the water. The sources for population recovery varied among taxa, but included resistant resting stages, internal réfugia, and external ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems vary considerably in their sensitivity and response to anthropogenic inputs as the result of differences in use patterns, species composition, flow patterns, geography, climate, and watershed characteristics. It is therefore not the mission of this risk assessment to attempt to force-fit a single acceptable level of effect to all aquatic systems, but rather suggest a maximum allowable toxicant concentration (MATC) for chlorpyrifos to be used as a guide in decision making. This process allows risk assessors to prioritize the potential risks and to eliminate from further consideration species and locations that are unlikely to be at risk. To do this for a particular site, an ""exceedence profile"" may be constructed by combining the exposure probability distribution with the species impact probability distribution to generate a graphical expression of the percent exceedence of LC50/EC50 values against the probability of a species being affected. This joint probability of exposure and response provides an overall estimate of the probability of a particular level of response being achieved at a given location. The probability of exceedence derived from such a plot may then be interpreted in the context of the natural ecology of the potentially affected species, such as habitat requirements, reproduction/development periodicity, and geographic distribution. The nature of probability distributions is such that the rate of change in exposure concentration to cause a particular response increases asymptotically as the cumulative frequency of including a sensitive species increases. That is, exposure concentrations would have to become infinitely small to include virtually 100% of the possible species. The 10th centile species sensitivity level was chosen, in part, because it lies near the inflection point for many such distributions. In this region, the MATC can be more accurately defined, and there is where the greatest discrimination of concentration and affect can be achieved. The use of the 10th centile of species response in single-species, acute-toxicity tests of lethality was substantiated as the no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) in field mesocosm studies with chlorpyrifos. © Springer-Verlag 1999.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 186; Correspondence Address: J.P.

Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan","This CICAD on triphenyltin compounds was based on a review prepared by the National Committee for Concise International Chemical Assessment Documents of Japan (CICAD National Committee, 1997). Many critical studies on health effects in this review were cited from monographs on pesticide residues prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO, 1991a,b) and the World Health Organization (WHO, 1992). These monographs report summaries of the many studies submitted to WHO by manufacturers for evaluation, in addition to summaries of published papers. In the case of studies submitted by manufacturers, original papers are proprietary and were not available to authors of the review prepared by the CICAD National Committee (1997), to authors of the CICAD draft, or to the CICAD Final Review Board. Therefore, this CICAD inevitably relies on the evaluations made by the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) for those studies cited from summaries of proprietary data. Extensive information on environmental effects was obtained from a review of the environmental effects of triorganotin compounds, prepared by the Advisory Committee on Pesticides of the Health and Safety Executive of the United Kingdom (HSE, 1992). Additional data were obtained through a search of Medline and Toxline Plus databases up to October 1997. Information on the nature of the review processes and the availability of the source documents is presented in Appendix 1. Information on the peer review of this CICAD is presented in Appendix 2. This CICAD was approved as an international assessment at a meeting of the Final Review Board, held in Tokyo, Japan, on 30 June - 2 July 1998. Participants at the Final Review Board meeting are listed in Appendix 3. The International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC 1283) for triphenyltin hydroxide (TPTH), produced by the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS, 1996), has also been reproduced in this document. Triphenyltin compounds are triphenyl derivatives of tetravalent tin. They are colourless solids with low vapour pressures. They are lipophilic and have low solubility in water. Triphenyltin and tributyltin compounds have been used extensively as algicides and molluscicides in antifouling products since the 1960s. Use of triorganotins in antifouling paints has been restricted in many countries because of their catastrophic effects on the oyster industry and more general effects on the aquatic ecosystem. Triphenyltin is used as a non- systemic fungicide with mainly protective action. Triphenyltin is strongly adsorbed to sediment and soil, and little desorption occurs. Its half-life in water has been estimated to be several days in June and 2-3 weeks in November. Although triphenyltin compounds can be degraded by stepwise dephenylation and excreted in conjugated forms, they bioaccumulate in fish and snails, with bioconcentration factors (BCFs) ranging from several hundred to 32 500 (in the intestinal sac of Lymnaea stagnalis). Environmental concentrations of triphenyltin compounds vary depending upon how, when, and where the compounds were used. Concentrations ranging from 0 ng/litre to nearly 200 ng/litre have been detected in bay areas or marinas as a result of leaching from ships treated with triphenyltin-based antifouling paints. Environmental concentrations of triphenyltin compounds have decreased in recent years as a result of tightening restrictions on their use in antifouling paints. Triphenyltin compounds given orally to rats are not readily absorbed and are excreted primarily in faeces and partly in urine. They are metabolized to diphenyltin, monophenyltin, and non-extractable bound residues. Absorbed triphenyltin compounds accumulate in kidney and liver to the greatest extent, with smaller amounts in other organs. Triphenyltin compounds applied dermally can penetrate through the skin in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Triphenyltin exerts a variety of health effects in various animal species, including effects on the immune system, reproductive/developmental effects at levels near those that are maternally toxic (most lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels, or LOAELs, are in the several mg/kg range or lower), hyperplasia/adenomas in endocrine organs, apoptosis in thymus cells, calcium release in sarcoplasmic reticulum cells, and eye irritation. The underlying mechanisms of these effects are under investigation; a common mechanism may explain this toxicity profile. Triphenyltin compounds are moderately acutely toxic to rats. They are not carcinogenic, but some data show that they are co-clastogenic. Reproductive and developmental effects include a decrease in the number of implantations and live fetuses (at 1.0 mg triphenyltin acetate [TPTA]/kg body weight per day in a rabbit gavage study), reduction in litter size/pup weight and in relative thymus or spleen weight in the weanlings (at 1.5 mg TPTH/kg body weight per day in the diet in a two-generation reproduction study in rats; no-observed-adverse-effect level, or NOAEL, 0.4 mg/kg body weight per day), and abortion and reduction in fetal weight (at 0.9 mg TPTH/kg body weight per day in a rabbit gavage study). The lowest NOAEL detected in the toxicity tests was 0.1 mg TPTH/kg body weight per day for maternal toxicity in a rabbit gavage study, based on decreased food consumption and body weight gain at 0.3 mg/kg body weight per day. The same value was obtained in an early 2- year rat study in which a slight decrease in white blood cells was seen at higher doses. In a 52-week dog study, the NOAEL was estimated to be 0.21 mg TPTH/kg body weight per day based on a decrease in relative liver weight in females at higher doses. Triphenyltin compounds affect the immune system. A decrease in immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations (even at the lowest dose level, i.e., 0.3 mg TPTH/kg body weight per day in a 2-year feeding study in rats), lymphopenia (at 0.3 mg TPTH/kg body weight per day in another 2-year feeding study in rats or at 0.338 mg TPTH/m3 in a 13-week inhalation study in rats), thymus atrophy (at 1.5 mg triphenyltin chloride [TPTC1]/kg body weight per day in a 2-week feeding study with weanling rats), and splenic atrophy (at 5 mg TPTH/kg body weight per day in a 28-day feeding study in mice) have been observed. Females are generally more susceptible than males. Several end-points were taken into consideration by JMPR in establishing the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of triphenyltin for oral exposure (FAO, 1991b; WHO, 1992). First, a 200-fold uncertainty factor was applied to the no- observed-effect level (NOEL) of 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day (based on a finding of reduced white blood cell counts at higher doses in a 2-year study in rats) to arrive at an ADI of 0-0.5 μg/kg body weight. Secondly, a 500- fold uncertainty factor was applied to a LOAEL of 0.3 mg/kg body weight per day in a 2-year study in rats in which increased mortality and reduced serum immunoglobulin levels were noted. Other NOAELs that were taken into consideration together with the above effect levels are 0.4 mg/kg body weight per day in a two-generation reproduction study with rats (a dose-related decrease in spleen and thymus weights in F1 and F2 male and female weanlings was observed at higher levels), 0.3 mg/kg body weight per day in a short-term study in rats (reduction in white blood cells, decrease in IgG, and increase in relative testes weight were seen at higher levels), 0.21 mg/kg body weight per day in a short-term dog study (increase in relative liver weight and decrease in serum albumin/globulin ratio were seen at higher levels), and 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day in a teratology study in rabbits (maternal toxicity was seen at higher levels). There are no data concerning occupational exposure to triphenyltin compounds. A few poisoning case reports describe neurotoxic effects, which appeared to persist. Exposure of the general public to triphenyltin compounds occurs mostly from ingestion of contaminated seafood, which in some cases has been found to contain triphenyltin levels as high as 1 μg/g (in muscle of some fish species). Triphenyltin intake from contaminated foods in Japan in 1997 was estimated to be around 11% of the ADI (i.e., 2.75 μg/day for a 50-kg person) established by JMPR. Triphenyltin compounds exert deleterious effects on aquatic organisms at very low concentrations. For example, imposex of rock shells (Japanese gastropods) was seen at around 1 ng/litre (no-observed-effect concentration, or NOEC, not determined), and chronic toxicity to fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) larvae was observed at 0.23 μg/litre (lowest- observed-effect concentration, or LOEC). Triphenyltin is considered to be an endocrine disruptor, because imposex, a phenomenon in which female gastropods develop male sex organs, is probably caused by hormonal disturbance. No NOEC for triphenyltin has been established for imposex in molluscs. Experimentally, by injection, triphenyltin has a potency similar to that of tributyltin in the genus Thais. Triphenyltin is less potent than tributyltin in Nucella; however, triphenyltin shows greater bioaccumulation than tributyltin. From this, it can be estimated that the NOEC for triphenyltin will be a few ng/litre or lower. The observed prevalence of imposex in Thais in the field with ambient concentrations supports this estimate. Because residues of triphenyltin and tributyltin occur together in the environment, their relative contribution to observed imposex cannot be assessed for Thais species. Use of either triphenyltin or tributyltin in antifouling paint would lead to population declines of marine invertebrates on this basis.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4; CODEN: CCADF,,Animalia;Apogon brachygrammus;Canis familiaris;Gastropoda;Invertebrata;Lymnaea stagnalis;Mollusca;Nucella;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Ostreidae;Phoxinus phoxinus;Pimephales promelas;Thais;clastogen;immunoglobulin g;pesticide residue;tin derivative;tributyltin;triphenyltin acetate;triphenyltin chloride;triphenyltin hydroxide;animal experiment;animal model;article;carcinogenicity;chemical analysis;environmental exposure;fish;genotoxicity;human;immune system;marine environment;mollusc;mouse;neurotoxicity;nonhuman;rabbit;rat;reproductive toxicity;thymus atrophy;toxicity testing;toxicokinetics,NA,NA,triphenyltin compounds foreword

Environ. Protection Agency, S-106 48 Stockholm, Sweden","Adequate methods and knowledge exist to monitor the coastal environment for nutrient pollution and effects on primarily primary production and subsequent impact in the form of eutrophication. Metal contamination is readily traced from monitoring the levels in water, sediments and biota. Adequate analytical methods are available. The potential impact of the metals can, to some extent, be assessed from the basic knowledge on how metals are transported, their binding and distribution in the aquatic environment, and finally, on the toxicity to organisms singly or in combination. When it comes to stable organic contaminants, the situation is much worse. The number of potential contaminants is large and increasing. Specific chemical analysis of every potential organic pollutant is unrealistic in practice. We are lacking adequate methods to characterize the degradability of organic substances in the environment. They behave differently and exert their primary toxic effect differently. It is thus difficult to properly assess the impact from environmental chemical monitoring of organic substances except for a limited number of cases. The use of eco-epidemiological methodology offers a promising complement to the traditional ecological indicators addressing structure and function of populations and communities. This tool should form one important component in integrated ecological monitoring programmes. Apart from retrospective environment monitoring, there is certainly a great need for stronger activities to control the production and use of stable organic chemicals in order to reduce their input into the environment. Experience from cases of environmental impact by pollution has resulted in the development of methods for predictive testing and hazard assessment of chemicals. These assessments are, or should rather be used for simultaneous international product control regulations and national efforts to control the emissions from all responsible sectors. To guide and support this work and to function as an additional defense barrier, regular chemical and biological field monitoring, as well as an unprejudiced search for harmful known and 'unknown' substances in the environment, is necessary. However, in the light of the existing deficiencies in methodology to predict the environmental impact from use of chemicals and to monitor impact in the environment, we have all reasons to follow the precautionary principle concerning the use of stable organic substances. Until we know that a specific compound is harmless or can be controlled properly, we should discourage their use.; Adequate methods and knowledge exist to monitor the coastal environment for nutrient pollution and effects on primarily primary production and subsequent impact in the form of eutrophication.

The ecotoxicological properties of chlorinated fatty acids are different from ‘traditional’ environmental pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls and DDT.

The chlorinated fatty acids are not persistent in the traditional sense that they resist strong oxidising agents. Still they can be considered ‘biologically stable’ as they may persist within an organism incorporated into depot- and membrane lipids. Chlorinated fatty acids are accumulated by biota with high efficiency from food and they are therefore most probably being transferred in the food web. This transfer from prey to predator may be comprised in the suggested term, biological stability. These compounds have been shown to exhibit adverse effects in several toxicity tests using a variety of species as well as in mammalian cell cultures. For example, sperm motility has been impaired at concentrations as low as 0.057 mg l-1. Despite their toxicity, chlorinated fatty acids do not induce enzyme systems such as P450 and EROD in fish, nor do they seem to induce other elimination efforts. Thus, they are apparently accumulated and otherwise treated as normal fatty acids. This lack of organism recognition of chlorinated fatty acids as xenobiotic compounds gives a new perspective on the risk assessment of these compounds, concerning both the modelling of their ecosystem fate and the design of test-systems for detection of their ecosystem effects. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd and the Aquatic Ecosystem Health & Management Society.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8,10.1080/14634989908656940,Bioaccumulation;Biological stability;Chlorohydrins;Chloroorganics;Food chain transfer;Toxicity,NA,NA,ecotoxicological aspects of chlorinated fatty acids

In all species, total concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) attained the highest concentration of the OC compounds quantified in both study years. DDT and metabolites attained the second highest concentration of OC compounds, in those species in which these compounds were quantified, followed by chlordane and its constituents and dieldrin, respectively. The relative concentrations of PCBs and OC pesticides remained constant between study years in all species, except for brook trout as limited 1990 data prevented analysis. For the mean lengths of each species of salmonines taken by anglers in 1985, lake trout showed the highest concentrations of OC compounds followed by brown trout, chinook salmon, brook trout, rainbow trout, and coho salmon, respectively. In 1990 lake trout again had the highest concentration of OCs followed by chinook salmon, brown trout, rainbow trout, and coho salmon. Brook trout were not in the analysis. Chinook salmon contributed the greatest proportion of OCs to the 1985 sport catch because of its dominance in total biomass of fish harvested. Lake trout contributed the greatest proportion of OCs to the 1990 sport catch, although the second highest in biomass harvested, because of the higher concentration of OC compounds in this species. The concentrations of PCBs declined between study years in all species except brook trout becaused limited 1990 data prevented this comparison.

A prevalent flagellated form, the nontoxic zoospore stage, has a proficient grazing ability, especially on cryptophyte prey. Although P. piscicida zoospores lack the genetic capability to synthesize chloroplasts, they can obtain functional chloroplasts from algal prey (i.e. kleptoplastidy), as demonstrated here with a cryptophyte prey. Zoospores grown with Rhodomonas sp. Karsten CCMP757 (Cryptophyceae) grazed the cryptophyte population to minimal densities. After placing the cultures in near darkness where cryptophyte recovery was restricted and further prey ingestion did not occur, the time-course patterns in growth, prey chloroplast content·zoospore-1, and prey nucleus content, zoospore-1 were followed. Ingested chloroplasts were selectively retained in the dinoflagellate, as indicated by the decline and, ultimately, near absence of cryptophyte nuclei in plastid-containing zoospores. Chloroplasts retained inside P. piscicida cells for at least a week were photosynthetically active, as indicated by starch accumulation and microscope-autoradiographic measurements of bicarbonate uptake. Recognition that P. piscicida can function as a phototroph broadens our perspective of the physiological ecology of the dinoflagellate because it suggests that, at least during part of its life cycle, P. piscicida's growth and survival might be affected by photoregulation and nutritional control of photosynthesis.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 115; Correspondence Address: A.J.

We used congener-specific and total Aroclor quantitative approaches, both of which involved gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (electron ionization mode), we confirmed the presence of PCBs in the combined serum samples and in the aliquots of bluefish and lobsters. In measuring the PCB levels in serum, we found good agreement between the two electron capture detector approaches (r ≥ 0.97) when the serum of specific congeners was compared to total Aroclor. We used univariate and multivariate quality control approaches to monitor these analyses. Analytical results for bluefish showed a better agreement between the two techniques than did those for lobsters; however, the small number of samples precluded any statistical comparison. We also measured levels of chlorinated pesticides in the serum samples of two groups of New Bedford residents, those with low PCB levels (< 15 ng/ml) and those with high PCB levels (≥ 15 ng/ml). We found that residents with high PCB levels also tended to have higher levels of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-di-(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p′-DDE). The higher concentration of all three analyses appears to be influenced by employment in the capacitor industry, by seafood consumption, or both. Using Jaccard measures of similarity and principal component analysis we compared the gas chromatographic patterns of PCBs found in the serum of New Bedford area residents with high serum PCBs with the patterns found in homogenates of lobsters (inclusive of all edible portions except the roe), in homogenates of bluefish fillets taken from local waters, and in serum from goats fed selected technical Aroclors (e.g. Aroclors 1016, 1242, 1254, or 1260). The patterns found in human serum samples were similar to the patterns found in lobster homogenates. Both of these patterns closely resembled patterns found in the serum samples of the goat fed aroclor 1254, as demonstrated by both pattern recognition techniques.

This study examined the symptom and psychological profiles of 263 older adults (aged 60-90 y, 71% women, 29X men); 57% reported that at least one chemical and 17% reported that at least four of five chemicals (pesticide, automobile exhaust, paint, new carpet, perfume) made them feel ill. Cacosmia ratings correlated weakly and negatively with age (r = - 0.19, p = .001) over the whole sample. Cacosmia correlated significantly with self-reported illness from foods that may mobilize or generate opioid peptides (wheat, dairy, eggs) (r = 0.32, p < .0001) and with illness from opiate drugs (r = 0.23, p < .0001). When the sample was divided into four cells on the basis of above- versus below-median total chemical-induced illness score (CI) and total food-induced illness score (FI), the high CI and high FI, high CI only, and high FI only groups had more frequent indigestion, and the high CI group had more frequent difficulty concentrating than the groups below median for illness from both chemicals and foods (NOILL), even after covarying for age and anxiety. The most cacosmic subjects noted higher prevalence of physician- diagnosed allergies and irritable bowel than did noncacosmic subjects. In contrast with previous young adult cohort studies, the older illness groups did not differ with regard to sex distribution, depression, shyness, or repressive defensiveness. When considered with prior surveys of young adults, the present findings are consistent with the presence of previously established, timedependent sensitization to multiple xenobiotic agents in susceptible individuals for whom psychological variables do not explain the symptom of cacosmia. If cacosmia is a symptom of TDS, then the neuropharmacology literature suggests the possibility of excitatory amino acid, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, dopaminergic, and/or opioid involvement.

Cumulative effects are the additive and interactive impacts that may result from human activities that are repeated over time and space. In many cases, numerous small, independent actions considered to be individually insignificant can eventually lead to substantial and sometimes irreversible changes in the environment. Public awareness of such impacts is often minimal, until such time as a critical point or threshold is exceeded. By this time the environmental and social consequences may be considerable. Habitat loss and fragmentation, climate modification, soil loss, declines in water quantity and quality, and pesticide accumulation are just a few of the areas in which cumulative effects have become a major concern. Recently proclaimed Canadian environmental assessment laws impose new requirements to identify and address cumulative effects. So far, however, considerable uncertainty exists as to how these statutory requirements will or should be carried out. This uncertainty is compounded by the constitutional requirement to recognize and protect various traditional aboriginal rights. The Canadian Constitution recently has been interpreted to protect the right of aboriginal people to engage in traditional sustenance-oriented hunting, fishing, trapping, and gathering activities. Moreover, following a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in late 1997, aboriginal people are now entitled to assert rights of exclusive use and occupation to land under the emerging legal concept of aboriginal title. The struggle by aboriginal peoples for legal recognition of these rights has been long and difficult. A growing number of aboriginal communities have voiced concerns that these newly recognized rights are being threatened by the cumulative environmental effects of resource development and human settlement. Paradoxically, just as the quest for traditional rights recognition is coming to fruition, the ability of aboriginal peoples to exercise these rights appears to be eroding. The purpose of this article is to examine how the concept of cumulative effects, together with the legal imperative to protect traditional aboriginal rights, can and must transform environmental decision-making. It is in four parts. Part 1 explores the meaning and policy implications of the concept of cumulative environmental impacts. Part II is an introduction to the legal and historical basis for aboriginal rights. Part III seeks to illustrate the challenges, and the necessity, of reforming environmental decision-making by use of a case-study involving a controversy over logging in traditional aboriginal territory. In Part IV we offer some concluding observations in the implications of our analysis for environmental assessment and decision-making.; Canadian environmental assessment laws impose requirements to identify and address cumulative environmental effects. However, considerable uncertainty exists as to how these statutory requirements will or should be carried out. This uncertainty is compounded by the constitutional requirement to recognize and protect various traditional aboriginal rights. The implications on how the concept of cumulative effects, together with the legal imperative to protect traditional aboriginal rights, can and must transform environmental decision-making are discussed.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 29; Correspondence Address: C.

Pfiesteria piscicida and Cryptoperidinopsoid sp. are heterotrophic dinoflagellates, purportedly pathogenic to fish, and A. ocellatum, a major fish pathogen, has caused extensive economic losses in both the aquarium and aquaculture industries. The pathogenicity of the Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellate is unknown at this time, but its growth characteristics and in vitro food preferences are similar to those of P. piscicida. The SSU sequences of these species were aligned with the other full-length dinoflagellate sequences, as well as those of representative apicomplexans and Perkinsus species, the groups most closely related to dinoflagellates.

Serological assays with different rabbit antisera demonstrated a high level of antigenic similarity among strains, with cross-agglutination titers of 20,480 to 40,960. This serological homogeneity was supported by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and membrane protein profiles.

Western blot (immunoblot) analysis with LPS and protein indicated that all the P. piscicida strains are immunologically related. In addition, the chromosomal DNA fingerprint patterns obtained for the European strains with the enzymes EcoRI and BamHI were practically identical to those of the Japanese and U.S. strains. Although some differences were found in the plasmid profiles of P. piscicida, a large number of strains possessed in common plasmid bands of 20 and 7 MDa.

Herbicide performance was highly variable, with significant effects on weed survival only in single seasons. In most cases, seed bank densities declined monotonically from an initial level of 1900 m−2. Seed banks decreased after seasons when E. australis contributed less than 25% to pasture dry matter. The annual decay rate of the seed bank was estimated to be 70%. Owing to the unreliability of the herbicides when applied at rates low enough to protect pasture legumes, the potential for tactical chemical control of E. australis is limited. Furthermore, it is argued that the potential for strategic chemical control is low, since the species can tolerate periods of population decline. E. australis could be managed more effectively by maintaining high densities of annual grasses and legumes, against which it is a poor competitor.  Efficacité herbicide et lutte contre Emex australis dans une pâture annuelle Des herbicides ont été appliqués chaque année pendant trois ans sur une population d' Emex australis Steinh. dans une pâture. L'efficacité herbi‐ cide était très variable, et les effets significatifs sur la survie des mauvaises herbes ne furent que des évènements uniques, observés lors de saisons isolées. Dans la plupart des cas, les stocks semenciers ont décru de façon monotone à partir d'un niveau initial 1900 m−2. Us décrurent après les saisons oùE. australis contribuait pour moins de 25%à la matière sèche de la pâture. Le taux de décroissance annuel du stock semencier était estiméâ 70%. En raison du manque de fiabilité des herbicides lorsqu'ils sont appliqués â des doses suffisamment basses pour respecter les légumineuses de la pâture, leur intérêt pour la lutte chimique à court terme contre E. australis est limité. Leur intérêt à moyen terme est égale‐ment faible car cette espece peut supporter des périodes de déclin démographique. On pourrait lutter plus efficacement contre E. australis en maintenant de fortes densités de graminées annuelles et de légumineuses, à l'égard desquelles cette mauvaise herbe est un com‐pétiteur médiocre.  Herbizidwirkung und die Bekämpfung von Emex australis auf einjährigem Weideland Bei jährlicher Anwendung von Herbiziden über 3 Jahre hin zur Bekämpfung von Emex australis Steinh. war die Wirkung sehr variabel; eine sig‐nifikante Wirkung auf das Überleben des Unkrauts gab es nur in einzelnen Vegetations‐perioden. Die Bodensamenbank nahm meistens gleichförmig von einem Ausgangsbestand von 1900 m−2 ab. Die Samendichte sank in den Jahren, wo Emex australis weniger als 25% der Trockenmasse der Weidepflanzen ausmachte. Der jährliche Rückgang der Lebensfähigkeit der Samen im Boden wurde auf 70% geschätzt. Wegen der Unzuverlässigkeit von Herbiziden, wenn sie zum Schutz der Weide‐pflanzen niedrig dosiert werden, sind die Aussichten für eine chemische Bekämpfung dieser Art begrenzt. Außerdem sind langfristige Erfolge auf diese Weise kaum zu erreichen, da die Art zeitweiligen Populationsrückgang übersteht. Die Verbreitung von Emex australis sollte durch hohe Dichten einjähriger Gräser und Leguminosen wirkungsvoller zurückgedrängt werden können, weil sie gegenüber diesen Arten ein schlechter Konkurrent ist.

This paper makes the case for why these dangerous contaminants from nonpoint sources must urgently be addressed. The nature and significance of these contaminants are reviewed and the complex, multimedia sources of the releases are identified including 'donations' and export of hazardous materials to developing countries. Examples are cited from North America, Europe, the former Soviet Union and Asia of the enormous extent of contamination of soil, groundwater, surface water, fish, and wildlife from these persistent toxic chemicals. They are persistent in the environment, build up in fish through food chains, and contaminate human food. These chemicals mimic hormones and disrupt the development of offspring as they cause complex reproductive, metabolic, neurological, and behavioral changes as well as cancer risks.

Dept. of Public Works, St. Paul, MN, 3377 N. Rice St., United States","Como Lake, a shallow hypereutrophic 29-ha lake, located in St. Paul, MN, was biomanipulated by fisheries renovation using rotenone in September 1985, to reduce algal standing crop, improve aesthetics, and increase recreational use. Long-term monitoring (1982–97) indicates a cyclic water quality and biologic response following the initial biomanipulation. Algal standing crop, as measured by chlorophyll a (CHLA), varied positively with total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) for the post-biomanipulation years (1986–97), with marked changes in phytoplankton community composition and population abundance. Nutrient-phytoplankton (“bottom-up”) interactions are a strong and consistent force in Como Lake following biomanipulation due to continued high normalized areal phosphorus loading (~735 mg m−2 yr−1). “Top-down” influences have not yet stabilized, but appear to have dampened with time due to decreased effectiveness of sportfishing regulations and fish stocking, along with partial winterkill due to aerator failure, to maintain piscivore abundance. Planktivorous fish abundance and size-selective feeding pressure on large-bodied herbivorous zooplankton grazers, as well as Daphnia biomass, have fluctuated cyclically over the study period. Recent decreased macrophyte abundance suggests a return to phytoplankton dominance as the long-term stable state for Como Lake. Monitoring results suggest that future management efforts in Como Lake should include renewed emphasis on fisheries and watershed management to promote the presence of macrophyte growth and a reduction in the magnitude of “bottom-up” forces, particularly nutrients, that effect the size of the algal population. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4,10.1080/07438149809354113,Biomanipulation;Daphnia;Macrophytes;Urban lake;Minnesota,NA,NA,como lake minnesota the longterm response of a shallow urban lake to biomanipulation

Statistical data on the degree of infestation relating to socio-economic and cultural variables were also updated. Therapeutic effects and educational impact were evaluated. Methods: An educational and motivational program was designed for pupils, parents, and teachers: 326 children and 15 adults were subjected to clinical and parasitologic evaluation. The recorded parameters included the age, sex, hair style and length, presence of other dermatologic diseases, degree of infestation, clinical remission, parasitologic remission, dwelling type and features, need to share a bed with co-dwellers, availability of home tap water supply, level of family income, and periodic medical controls. The entire population received treatment with neutral shampoo and rinsing cream containing 1% permethrin. Exclusion criteria were the presence of acute scalp inflammation and a history of pyrethrin and/or pyrethroid sensitivity. Statistical analysis was performed as required on data expressed as frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations by chi-square ana Fisher exact tests. Results: The overall infestation prevalence rate was 81.5%, the highest values corresponding to children from 6 to 11 years of age, with a slight predominance in males (55.4% vs. 44.6%). A significantly greater rate of clinical remission was observed in subjects enjoying home tap water supplies (p<0.01). Conclusions: The model of research plus action adopted allows the following conclusions to be drawn: (i) individual and isolated treatments for pediculosis are useful but will not by themselves allow for the epidemiologic control of this parasitosis; (ii) massive, complete, and simultaneous treatments lead to a significant decrease in infestation prevalence; (iii) educational measures tending to foster collective awareness enable greater epidemiologic surveillance to be achieved; (iv) careful inspection of the entire scalp is essential with the use of a powerful light source and lenses with high magnification, as the parasite has no predilection for any given area; (iv) socio-economic and cultural conditions are not relevant for infestation, although a good home tap water supply is essential for treatment.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 38; CODEN: IJDEB,10.1046/j.1365-4362.1997.00177.x,adolescent;Argentina;article;endemic disease;ethnic group;female;human;infestation;major clinical study;male;parasitosis;pediculosis capitis;Pediculus;prevalence;public health;school child;social class;socioeconomics;water supply,NA,NA,head louse infestations epidemiologic survey and treatment evaluation in argentinian schoolchildren

During 3 years of sampling, biomarkers at all levels of biological organisation from the molecular to the ecosystem level were applied and tested on 742 individual fish of body lengths between 18 and 25 cm. At the ecosystem level, the fish were taken as a habitat for the parasite assemblage. The hypothesis was that changes in the environment might lead to changes in the species diversity of parasites and in the infection intensity of single species, as well as between heteroxenic and monoxenic parasite species (H/M ratio). At the molecular level, activity of the CYP1A-dependent monooxygenase ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) was used as a biomarker of exposure. At the subcellular level, the integrity of lysosomal membranes in hepatocytes was taken as an indicator of non-specific acute and chronic toxic effects. Both biomarkers are recommended by the ICES Advisory Committee on the Marine Environment for the application in biological effects monitoring programmes. In addition, neutral lipid content in the liver was used as a marker for pathologically induced fat accumulation. In the same individual fish, a new method for the measurement of macrophage aggregate activity in the liver was tested for its application and reliability in reflecting immunosuppression. Tests were accompanied by chemical analysis of standard organochlorine and heavy metal residues in flounder tissue. A total of 33 parasite species were found. As an indicator species, the mean abundance of Trichodina sp. reflected best the pollution gradient observed with highest infection intensity at the most polluted location. Species diversity was significantly higher in fish caught near the reference site and significantly lower in fish from the polluted Elbe estuary. The use of the heteroxenous/monoxenous species ratio as a marker was not useful at the locations investigated because of the dominance of heteroxenous species at all habitats. Since EROD activity and macrophage aggregate activity were dependent on sex and maturity of female flounder, only male fish were taken into consideration for the integrated evaluation of data. All biochemical and histochemical tests were able to reflect accurately the site-specific differences, as well as an observed pollution event at the end of 1995 as determined by chemical analyses. The correlation analysis revealed a connection not only between the single parasitological and biochemical parameters but also within these groups. The non-specific immune response and Trichodina infection intensity were correlated with all other parameters, leading to the assumption that these may serve as links between the lowest and the highest levels of biological organisation. The simultaneous use of metabolic and parasitological results facilitated the interpretation of the observed variations of the data and the distinction between natural variation and pollution-mediated effects. © Springer-Verlag and AWI 1999.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 95; Correspondence Address: K.

The survey included 105 fish from 18 lakes in 10 counties in northern Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan. Fourteen lakes yielded walleye fillets with greater than 0.5 ppm mercury, and six lakes yielded samples in excess of 1.0 ppm mercury. Fourteen fish were collected in the spring and prepared as fillets ground up as either skin-on or skin-off samples. The difference in Hg was significant (T14=-3.26,p=0.006) with skin-on fillets, resulting in an approximately 10% decrease in mercury concentrations. Results of this study suggest that by leaving the skin on the sample, mercury concentrations will be reported 10% lower than if the skin is removed. Obviously, consumption advisories based on skin-off samples could provide more protection for Ojibwa people eating the spring harvest of walleye. In the fall, the difference in Hg samples between skin-on versus skin-off, was less and not statistically significant.

Design - The Central Statistics Office of Ireland provided computer analysis of all deaths coded as cancer of the brain, ICD 191, and of lymphatic and haematopietic cancers, ICD codes 200-208, by socioeconomic, sex, and age groups, from 1971 to 1987. The deaths were then analysed by socioeconomic group and compared with the expected number of deaths in the general population. Setting- A cluster of four deaths from primary brain cancer, three from leukaemia, and one from Hodgkin's disease, occurred in the research and technical staff of the former Agricultural Institute of the Republic of Ireland in men under the age of 65. This raised the question, were farmers more likely to get these forms of cancer due to exposure to herbicides or fertilisers? Subjects- All deaths in the Republic of Ireland from 1971 to 1987 by socioeconomic group. Main results - Although deaths reported as due to primary brain cancers had increased in all socioeconomic groups in the two time periods studied, there was no greater increase in farmers and a smaller increase in other agricultural workers and fishermen. Deaths from Hodgkin's disease and multiple myeloma, and to a smaller extent from leukaemia, had also increased. The increase in reported mortality of these haematopoietic cancers in farmers was no greater and in other agricultural workers it was less than in the general population. Conclusion- There was no evidence that farmers had any greater increase in mortality from these cancers than the general population. The cluster of brain and haematopoietic cancers in research and technical staff at the Agricultural Institute of the Republic of Ireland does not reflect a high risk of these cancers among the general farming population, but strongly supports the need for a compilation of a register of causes of death of laboratory workers in a number of countries.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 19; CODEN: JECHD,10.1136/jech.48.4.364,Ireland;herbicide;agricultural workers;cancer mortality;mortality pattern;adolescent;adult;age;aged;agricultural worker;article;brain cancer;comparative study;female;gender;Hodgkin disease;human;leukemia;major clinical study;male;multiple myeloma;occupational exposure;social class;Brain;Brain Neoplasms,NA,NA,deaths from primary brain cancers lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers in agricultural workers in the republic of ireland

Observed changes in schooling, swimming, and respiration were studied in more detail utilizing progressively more complex and ecologically relevant experimental designs. Laboratory troughs (600 litre) were used to quantify innate shelter-seeking behaviour and susceptibility to predation during salinity stress. Swimming speed, schooling behaviour and responses to salinity and hypoxia were studied in a 4500-litre Water Column Simulator under vertically stratified conditions (fresh water overlying sea water). Finally a similarly stratified 15,500-litre outdoor tank was designed to compare susceptibility to predation during a volitional salinity challenge. Relative to controls, TCMTB-exposed underyearling salmon exhibited a reduction in cover response, were slower to seek shelter from bright light, were more erratic in their swimming behaviour and more likely to be eaten by marine predators. Videotape analyses confirmed that TCMTB reduced exploratory behaviour and swimming speed under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in the WCS. The ecological consequences of these overt behavioural changes were experimentally linked to a clear increase in risk from predation by yellowtail rockfish (Sebastes flavidus) inhabiting the marine zone below the halocline of the 15,500-litre tank.

Sixty-six percent of 643 students reported feeling ill from one or more of the five chemicals; 15% identified the smell of at least four chemicals as making them ill. Ratings of illness from pesticide correlated weakly but significantly with ratings for the largest number of individual symptoms (9 of 11); daytime tiredness and daytime grogginess both correlated at high levels of significance with illness ratings (on a 5-point scale) for four of the five chemicals. The most cacosmic group (CS) included significantly more women (79%) than the noncacosmic group (NS) (49%); women overall were more cacosmic than men (p <.001), even with the significant covariate of depression. Ratings of cacosmia correlated only weakly with scores for depression (r = 0.16), anxiety (r = 0.08), and trait shyness (r = 0.18) in the total sample. On stepwise multiple regression with cacosmia score as the dependent measure, shyness accounted for 5.8% of the variance, while depression, anxiety, sense of mastery, and repression did not enter the equation. Histories of physician-diagnosed hay fever, but not asthma, were more frequent in the CS (16%) than in the NS group (5%).

Progeny clones were analysed for karyotype, esterase (E4, FE4 or S) gene type and activity, and amplified E4 and FE4 genes were located on their chromosomes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Amplified FE4 genes of resistant parent clones (800F and French R) were inherited according to expectations. Chromosomal locations of these genes (on autosomes 1 and 3 in 800F, and on 1 and 2 in French R) were confirmed by FISH analysis of progeny that had inherited an autosome 2 marker (a dissociation) from the susceptible parent (DS). Inheritance of amplified E4 genes could not be studied directly as none of the available clones was able to produce mating females. Males from two clones with amplified E4 genes (and with the A1,3 translocation that is common to all E4-producing genotypes) were therefore mated with females from clones with amplified FE4 genes at known chromosomal locations. Progeny were obtained with both E4 and FE4 genes, a combination not yet found in nature. Analysis of F1 and subsequent generations confirmed that the amplified E4 site on autosome 3(T) is close to the translocation breakpoint, and apparently coallelic with the amplified FE4 site on the normal autosome 3 inherited from 800F. One of the translocated parent clones (4156) had two additional E4 sites, unlinked to the translocation, which were inherited according to expectation. Esterase activities of progeny clones, measured by immunoassay, mostly corresponded to the number of amplified sites inherited, with some discrepancies which could be attributed to copy number differences between sites, inheritance of partially methylated genes from French R, or position effect variegation at the site on 3(T).

This study characterizes a periplasmic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and a cytoplasmic catalase in P. damselae. Purification and partial amino-terminal sequencing confirmed the SOD to be iron-cofactored, with a high degree of homology to other bacterial FeSODs. The SOD was common to all strains analysed in terms of type, location and activity, whilst the catalase varied in activity between strains. The catalase was constitutively expressed, but the SOD appeared to be repressed under low oxygen conditions. In spite of the presence of a periplasmic SOD, P. damselae was susceptible to killing by exogenous superoxide anion generated in a cell-free system. Addition of exogenous SOD to this system did not abolish the bactericidal effect; however, addition of catalase was protective.

The importance of this task arises from the ubiquity of genotoxic compounds in the environment and the need to identify the sources of contamination so that efforts aimed at control and minimization can be implemented. Of even greater significance is the immediate concern for the welfare of human health and the environment. Subheadings of this document include a description of the genetic bioassays that have been used to test industrial wastes, a compendium of methods commonly used to prepare crude waste samples for bioassay, and a review of the genetic toxicity of wastes and effluents. Wastes and effluents have been grouped according to industrial source. Major categories include chemical and allied products, pulp and paper manufacturing, defense and munitions, petroleum refining, primary metal industries, and miscellaneous industrial manufactures. Within each industrial category, a synopsis of individual genetic toxicity studies is presented, followed by an interpretation of results on a comprehensive, industry-wide basis. In this evaluation, a discussion of the types and extent of genotoxic damage caused by a particular set of wastes is presented, and potential sources of genotoxic activity are identified. Concluding the document is a commentary, which discloses potential shortcomings in the way in which current legislation protects human heath and the environment from the release of genotosic substances via industrial wastes and effluents. It also provides an assessment of the genotoxic burden that industrial wastes place on the environment. © 1992.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 284; CODEN: MRRTE,10.1016/0165-1110(92)90001-P,Genetic bioassays;Hazardous wastes;Industrial effluents;Industrial wastes;Industrial Waste;Mutagenicity Tests;Mutagens;Animalia;Cricetinae;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Salmonella typhimurium;Typhimurium;detergent;drug;dye;industrial chemical;metal;pesticide;plastic;resin;rubber;soap;animal cell;effluent toxicity;genotoxicity;hamster;industrial waste;mutagenicity;nonhuman;priority journal;review;saccharomyces cerevisiae;salmonella typhimurium,NA,NA,the genotoxicity of industrial wastes and effluents a review

In earlier times they were a protection against fungi and insect pests. The great increase in the use of pesticides occurred with the development of new organic chemicals following World Wars I and II. In addition to chemicals for the control of fungi and insects, new developments were nematocides, herbicides, rodenticides, avicides, defoliants, wood preservatives, etc. The use of chemicals helped increase productivity, but caused great concern about their effect on human health and safety. On the other hand, chemicals did help tremendously from the standpoint of protecting against diseases that were carried by insects, especially mosquitoes. Adverse publicity has caused great concern about pesticides and this is especially so since our society has undergone great changes from an agricultural society to an industrial society and finally to a communications society. Unfortunately, publicity relating to the use of pesticides has seldom been balanced from the standpoint of the good and the bad. In fact, the communications media has and does usually stress the potential adverse effects of pesticides without reference to the good. This has caused concern on the part of advocates and the average person to the extent that it has placed heavy constraints on agriculture. There is a need for the dissemination of balanced information on the good as well as the bad of pesticides. © 1984.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4; CODEN: RTOPD,10.1016/0273-2300(84)90004-7,"Agricultural Workers' Diseases;Agriculture;Animal;Antinematodal Agents;Egg Shell;Environmental Pollutants;Fishes;Food Contamination;Human;Legislation, Drug;Oryza sativa;Pesticides;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Species Specificity;United States;Vegetables;pesticide;ecology;human;intoxication;public health;review",NA,NA,pesticides the good and the bad

Daily observations were made of courtship and parental behaviors. Circulating levels of androgens, estrogens, progesterone, thyroxine, and prolactin were measured in the appropriate sex at selected points in the breeding cycle. The organochlorine mixture altered the nature and duration of courtship behavior in a dose-related fashion resulting in marked asynchrony in the breeding cycle. Alterations were apparently mediated through the female. Incubation and brooding behavior was altered in a dose-related fashion and the median incubation period of the high dosage group was extended by three days. Pairs receiving the high dosage spent less time feeding their young. Androgen levels of males, and the estrogen and progesterone levels of females were altered in a dose-related fashion. Thyroxine levels were increased in both sexes in a dose-related fashion and there was an alteration of prolactin levels. Correlations were obtained between behavior and some hormones. There was a marked dose-related decrease in fledging success, resulting in reductions of 15 and 50% in the number of squabs fledged per nesting attempt. Squabs of pairs receiving the high dosage were of lower weight. The results suggest that behavioral anomalies in breeding synchrony, nest construction, incubation attentiveness and parental care induced in a wild bird population by a mixture of organochlorine pollutants could alter reproductive success, increase the energetic cost to the population, and alter the reproductive fitness of contaminated individuals.

It is on the continental shelf and in the upwelling areas of the nearshore zone, constituting 10% of the world oceans, that over 90% of world marine fish are taken. The species most sensitive to depradation by man are those dependent on streams, lakes and estuaries for spawning and early-life feeding and those which dwell in the intertidal zone. Marine life may be damaged by pollution and the consequences of other activities of man in a number of ways: (1) destruction of habitat; (2) acute poisoning by toxic wastes; (3) adverse alteration of water quality; (4) sub-lethal effects of pollutants causing impairment of feeding, growth, migration, resistance to disease and parasites, and interference with reproduction; (5) bacteriological and viral contamination; (6) bioaccumulation of toxic metals and organic substances; and (7) tainting and/or discoloration of the flesh by organic and/or metallic substances. The economic effects of pollution and other environmental changes introduced by man on the world fisheries are difficult to assess at the present time. However, the elimination of shellfish resources alone by sewage can involve hundreds of millions of dollars per year. This can only be overcome by costly cleanup of sewage and industrial waste disposal in contaminated areas, depuration (purification) of shellfish by transplanting to clean areas, or artificial depuration with ultra-violet light or chlorine in an installation designed for the purpose. The rejection of fish products because of high metals content, e.g., mercury in swordfish, of high chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration, e.g., DDT in California jack mackerel, can pose a hardship to fishermen, an economic burden on governments which may have to pay compensation to fishermen for their losses, and of course, a loss of protein urgently needed in a hungry world. It is obvious that in spite of the most aggressive conservation policies, backed by strong national legislation, many of the productive coastal areas will be lost to fisheries. Either factors of national importance, other than marine conservation, will outweigh fisheries needs to support preservation, or costs will be too high to warrant full-scale restoration. Yet the demand for protein will not diminish. Hence, the only recourse is mitigation with: (1) intensification of fish propagation by enhancement techniques, e.g., hatcheries and spawning channels, in areas still unpolluted and generally unaltered by man, with a potential for higher fish production; (2) transplantation of desirable species into waters suitable for their propagation; (3) aquaculture with protected water quality in partially enclosed areas of the sea, or in enclosures with controlled seawater input; and (4) environmental improvement, e.g., artificial reefs, in those areas which could be attractive for fish, but at present are unproductive because of the nature of the bottom, lack of food and undesirable water characteristics. In regard to (4) above, it is conceivable that some of the wastes of man, which are now pollutants, could be put to productive use in the sea. These include: (a) sewage, which might be used for controlled fertilization of unproductive coastal waters; (b) cooling waters for increasing water temperatures in temperature regions, where certain introduced warm-water species could thrive, or indigenous species living at the bottom of their temperature range, could increase their productivity; (c) selected solid refuse for building reefs in flat-bottomed sea areas; and (d) suitable pulverized solid wastes, e.g., mine tailings, for developing bottom material of a desirable character for burrowing molluscs, such as clams and cockles. © 1974.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 10,10.1016/0302-184X(74)90009-2,BEACHES - Sanitation;FISHERIES;INDUSTRIAL WASTES - Analysis;environmental health;CONTINENTAL SHELF;WATER POLLUTION;Military Personnel,NA,NA,coastal marine pollution and fish

In the course of diagnostic works about bacterial infections of yellowtail in Tokushima Prefecture from 1976 to 1978, it was found that an additional bacterial disease, i.e. vibriosis, had been causing considerable mortalities for those three years in addition to the above-mentioned two diseases. The occurrences of the three diseases or the three pathogens in 1977 was demonstrated in a table, where it was shown that the vibriosis took place in the young fish (Body weight 3.7-42.5 g) from late May to early July. The external sign of the vibriosis was characterized by opaque or congested eyes, eroded fins, darkened body color, and hemorrhagic or necrotic lesions on body surface and musculature. Vibrio sp. was isolated from these diseased fish, and submitted to characterization tests, agglutination tests with anti-V. anguillarum sera, and a pathogenicity test with healthy yellowtail. Putting all the results together, the etiological agent of the disease was identified as Vibrio anguillarum. This is the first record of V. anguillarum infection in yellowtail, though another vibriosis, the causative agent of which was reported as Vibrio sp. by Kusuda (1985), has been known. © 1979, The Japanese Society of Fish Pathology.

A simple and effective evaporator was developed for this purpose which permitted monitoring of attractant evaporation in the field. From the low numbers of males caught with sex traps and the low resulting plum fruit moth attack, as compared with a third orchard receiving conventional insecticide treatment, it is concluded that communication disruption between sexes by evaporation of sex attractant was effective and that this method may be a feasible way of plum fruit moth control. Additional experiments showed that in this insect, as in other Grapholitha species, addition of a small amount of the trans isomer (3 to 5%) to cis‐8‐dodecenyl acetate is necessary for best attraction.

Un diffuseur simple est construit à cet effet; il permet de mesurer directement la quantité de produit libérée dans le verger. Comparativement à une parcelle traitée aux insecticides, les captures de mâles aux pièges sexuels dans les deux parcelles considérées sont très peu nombreuses et l'attaque du ver sur fruits est fortement diminuée. Il est par conséquent indéniable que la diffusion d'attractif a provoqué une interruption du rapprochement des sexes.

But lately, public attitudes towards chemical pesticides have been changing and the recognition has grown that certain applications by their very nature demand biological methods. Biological methods may require only a fraction of the cost of chemical and mechanical methods, and their effects commonly last much longer. In Dutch waterways, rapid summer plant growth often blocks water flow. Mechanical means of removing this living and dead plant material are very costly; chemical means poison the water, yet leave essential foodstuffs intact to begin the growth cycle over. Several biological solutions have been tried in different parts of the world, ranging from the introduction of 'sea cows' to that of insects. Many of these methods are not applicable in the Netherlands because of the climate or the selectivity of the plant predators concerned. Methods more or less applicable in the Netherlands are: the planting of trees and bushes over canals to reduce light levels in the water; the introduction of bullrushes, which form a solid layer over the bottom, inhibiting other plants' root growth; and the introduction of a Chinese fish, the grass carp. This fish consumes great quantities of all varieties of water plants, is suited to the Dutch climate, and offers good possibilities for plant control.

Although acenaphthene and acenaphthylene were non-mutagenic, all the 1,2-ring fused acenaphthenes were found to be indirect frameshift mutagens in strain TA1537. The chemical nature of the 1,2-fused ring did not appear to be important for mutagenic activity against TA1537, however its nature did affect the mutagenesis of strain TA1538. Only acenaphthenes fused with a pyrimidine or pyrazine ring were capable of mutating the hisD 3052 locus of TA1538. Substitution at the 8-position of the ring system with an amino group rendered the molecule inactive against TA1538, whilst substitution at the 10-position only reduced, but did not eliminate the mutagenic effect against TA1538. Methyl substitution at various sites on the molecule modified the mutagenic activity against TA1537, and indicated the formation of an electrophilic species (epoxide) at the 2,3-position of the acenaphthene nucleus. The incorporation of a competitive substrate for ring hydroxylation (naphthalene) reduced the mutagenic effect of acenaphthopyrimidine against TA1537 and confirmed this assumption. However, naphthalene did not reduce the mutagenic effect of the compound against TA1538, indicating the possible formation of a second metabolite by an alternative enzymic pathway.

Bioaccumulation of these contaminants in the aquatic ecosystem frequently contributes to elevated concentrations of organic substances in fish, exceeding recommended guidelines for human consumption. Although often surrounded by considerable controversy, the effects of acute human exposure to toxic organic substances are reasonably well-documented, chiefly as a result of occupational exposure or catastrophic accident. Less well-understood are the effects of small, repeated, or chronic additions of these materials on the health of humans. This study reports efforts to understand human exposure to organochlorine compounds resulting from consumption of fish. Human experience of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is analyzed in the light of data acquired from extensive epidemiological studies in the North American Great Lakes of two marched cohorts of exposed individuals consisting of: (a) sports fishermen, and (b) mothers and their newborn infants. These groups were chronically exposed to significant quantities of PCBs via consumption of freshwater fish from Lake Michigan. Health effects in chronically exposed sports fishermen included an increase of circulating blood titer of contaminant in direct relation to quantities of fish consumed and duration of exposure. Maternal health effects observed among individuals in the highly exposed category included tendencies toward increases in anemia, edema, and susceptibility to infectious disease. Transplacental transmission of the contaminant was confirmed, along with subsequent exposure of infants, both in utero and postpartum, via maternal milk. Effects observed among infants born to mothers in the high fish-consumption categories include delays in developmental maturation at birth. These infants were smaller in physical size, had reduced head circumferences, altered lability of state, increased startle reflexes, and were classified by attending physicians within the 'worrisome' neonatal category. Subsequent testing of these infants at the age of seven months demonstrated substantial alterations in fixation to novelty. The tendency to respond to a new stimulus decreased in direct proportion to the level of maternal exposure to contaminants in fish consumed, suggesting a more than ten percent decline in visual recognition memory. This observation suggests an effect of contaminants upon the centers of higher integration in infants secondarily exposed via maternal circulation. © 1988.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 31,10.1016/0166-445X(88)90084-7,Freshwater ecosystem;Human health;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Toxic organic substances;polychlorinated biphenyl;anemia;ecosystem;edema;fetus;fish;food contamination;health hazard;human;infant;infection;newborn;teratogenicity;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,NA,NA,human health consequences of consumption of fish contaminated with organochlorine compounds

These highly active chemical attractants have been synthesized for some of the most important insect pests, including the boll weevil, gypsy moth, codling moth, tobacco budworm, European corn borer, and several bark beetles. While none of the synthetic sex attractants have yet been developed for use in insect control, they offer opportunities for the future both as control agents and to greatly improved insect detection. Investigations are underway on insect trapping systems employing the pheromones and on air permeation techniques to disrupt insect reproduction. The pheromones are generally highly species specific and are not likely to pose hazards to nontarget organisms in the environment. Toxicological studies indicate that they are low in toxicity to mammals, birds, and fish, but adequate toxicological data are necessary before they can be registered for use in insect control. Another new class of compounds called kaironomes has been discovered. These chemicals are involved in the detection of hosts or prey by insect parasites and predators.

Since 1978 a long-term national research program has been conducted by the Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (NTNF). In this program several whole lake manipulations of the fish stocks have been performed to test hypotheses about trophic interactions. It was predicted that manipulations of planktivorous fish populations, might also improve water quality in lakes undergoing eutrophication. Two examples are given to illustrate the achieved results. I: Whole lake fertilization experiment (1974-1978) carried out by Langeland and Reinertsen. The results revealed the importance of top-down effects in the lake ecosystem. When cladocerans dominated, the zooplankton community was able to maintain a more or less constant phytoplankton biomass and a rather low phytoplankton production even when nutrient levels were increased. During years with rotifer dominance, algal biomass and productivity increased, despite the low amounts of added nutrients. II: Experiment performed by Reinertsen, Jensen, Koksvik, Langeland and Olsen in the eutrophic Lake Haugatjern, total elimination of the fish populations by rotenone in late 1980, resulted in a 4-fold decrease in the algal biomass. The species composition changed from the dominance of large-sized Anabaena flos-aquae and Staurastrum luetkemuelleri to smaller, fastgrowing species and gelatinous green algae. The results are discussed in relation to management of inland waters by combined techniques of biomanipulation and reduced external nutrient supply which increase food-chain efficiency. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 14; CODEN: HYDRB,10.1007/BF02530370,"biomanipulation;lake management;Norway;Norway, Lake Haugatjern;fertilization",NA,NA,biomanipulation development in norway

Anglers were interviewed in 1972 before treatment, and again in 1974, to obtain comparative data on the social changes as well as the fishery. There were no significant changes in the amount of fishing, degree of satisfaction, income and sex ratio of the anglers.

A creel census of catch and fishing satisfaction would not have detected the change in composition of anglers. Managers need to survey angler composition to accurately analyze census results.

The median of the time-weighted average concentration was about 1 ppm, and the mean duration of exposure was 10 years among the exposed. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for formaldehyde exposure (1.44), peak exposure to formaldehyde (1.26), and exposure to formaldehyde-containing wood dust (1.22).

Western methods of building cities are too expensive and resource-consuming, so an ecological design that integrates with both the environment and the income expectations should be explored. This investigation considers growth on the downstream side of Dhaka. New technologies have evolved recently that contribute to an economical new community design. Sunlight can be used to convert sewage flows into algae, which become fishfood, and the water surface is available for growing waterfowl. Composting garbage produces soil for vegetables. A 3-year gardening cycle obtains high yields with minimal use of pesticides. Solar cookers can now be home-built. Cycle technology, appropriate to the flatness of terrain, is improving in various ways, both in vehicle design and traffic management. So a new community can produce as much food as the agricultural area it displaces - an important consideration in a country that sometimes cannot grow enough to feed itself. The financing of self-help housing has been innovated in Bangladesh by the Grameen Bank. It achieves truly remarkable repayment rates when lending to the very poor. Land acquisition is the biggest hurdle, because the size of parcels run from 0.1 to 0.3 ha, and official land acquisition procedures require many years to complete. Speculators presently pick them up one at a time and create a chaotic unserviced fringe. We propose that each family and agency having a socially just claim to the profits from converting rural land into urban settlement should be given a share in the profit accumulated by the community corporation. We have also found a newly available source of appropriately trained management for such cooperative ventures. An exercise in design creates a dense community on a bund away from the road. Initially of 5000 people, it should grow to 15 000-20 000 people (the limit for face-to-face interaction) and about 20 ha. a cost of $1000-1200 per dwelling unit of 24 m2 area and so hit the middle of the market - the stratum now settling in the downstream periphery. The goal is a sustainable urban ecosystem with population at equilibrium, and human resources able to make a living as comfortable and convenient as in the West, about three generations hence. Fuel and water consumption would then be 10-20% of Western levels. This design strategy would be a feasible and affordable first step in the right direction. © 1991.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; CODEN: LUPLE,10.1016/0169-2046(91)90019-I,"Bangladesh;Bangladesh, Dhaka;design strategy;developing country;ecological urban design;ecosystem approach;estuarine area;estuary development;land acquisition;planning process;settlement design;sustainable development;urban area;urban settlement planning",NA,NA,planning and designing new urban settlement on estuaries bangladesh

N-Bromosuccinimide also destroyed the signal from N-4 but without inhibiting rotenone-sensitive electron transfer to quinone, suggesting a branched pathway for electron transfer. Diethylpyrocarbonate caused oxidation of N-3 and N-4 in the steady state without changing N-1, suggesting N-1 is before N-3 and N-4. Difluorodinitrobenzene and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibited oxidation of all Fe-S centers and tetranitromethane inhibited reduction of all Fe-S centers. Titrations of the rate of superoxide (O2-) generation in rotenone-treated submitochondrial particles were similar with the ratio [NADH]/[NAD] and that of 3-acetyl pyridine adenine nucleotide in spite of different midpoint potentials of the two couples. On reaction with inhibitors the inhibition of O2- formation was similar to that of ferricyanide reductase rather than quinone reductase. The rate of O2- formation during ATP-driven reverse electron transfer was 16% of the rate observed with NADH. The presence of NAD increased the rate to 83%. The results suggest that bound, reduced nucleotide, probably E-NAD., is the main source of O2- in NADH dehydrogenase. The effect of ATP on the reduction levels of Fe-S centers in well-coupled ETPH was measured by equilibrating with either NADH/NAD or succinate/fumarate redox couples. With NADH/NAD none of the Fe-S centers showed ATP induced changes, but with succinate/fumarate all centers showed ATP-driven reduction with or without NAD present. The effect on N-2 was smaller than that on N-1, N-3, and N-4. These observations indicate that the major coupling interaction is between N-2 and the low potential centers, N-1, N-3, and N-4.

Hans Mental Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark""]","Abstract:  The γ‐aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor of codfish brain has been purified to homogeneity and contains a single polypeptide band of 56 kDa molecular mass. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS‐PAGE) of codfish GABA receptor photoaffinity‐labeled by both [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]Flu) and [3H]muscimol showed a single radioactive peak with molecular mass of 56 kDa, in contrast to the multiple subunits found in other vertebrate species. The codfish receptor, purified using benzodiazepine (BZ, Ro 7‐1986/1) affinity chromatography, contains an apparent single band both by isoelectric focussing and on a silver‐stained SDS gel. The receptor density and affinity constants for [3H]muscimol and [3H]Flu binding are comparable to those in mammalian brain, and the specific activity (>1,000 pmol/mg of protein) is comparable to that of preparations purified from those sources. The pharmacological specificity of the codfish GABA–BZ receptor is generally similar to that of mammalian brain, including GABA–BZ coupling. The BZ binding exhibits homogeneous kinetic properties resembling those of the mammalian BZ2 receptor type, and shows strong GABA enhancement of [3H]Flu binding and weaker pentobarbital potentiation. This is consistent with other observations of an earlier phylogenetic, as well as ontogenetic, emergence in mammals of the BZ2 receptor subtype than the BZ1. Codfish GABA receptor is postulated to be a homo‐oligomer in which the conformation of GABA and BZ recognition sites is very similar to that in the mammalian hetero‐oligomeric GABAA receptor. The codfish receptor appears to be encoded by an ancestral gene and indicates an early development of BZ–GABA coupling. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

Presence of plasmid in HCH+ culture and loss of degradative pathway and physical presence of plasmid upon curing indicate the extrachromosomal location of HCH degradative genes in CFT1. Furthermore, the HCH+ degradation determinant of strains CM and CFT4 could be transferred to cured or to other HCH- Pseudomonads by conjugation without the transfer of any chromosomal marker of cooxidation of organochlorides. The metabolic activity, however, does not match the enormous quantity of the pesticides accumulated in nature over the years (Rajchengappa and Rajghatta, 1989,). It is, therefore, imperative to identify such gene clusters and clone these, after appropriate manipulations, so that better recombinants are developed. Plasmids specifying biodegradation of a number of aromatics, including chlorinated compounds, are now known (Rheinwald et al.1973Fisher et al., 1978Chatterjee et al., 1981). The degradative pathway for the organochlorides like 3 chlorobenzoate (3-CBA), 4-chlorobiphenyl, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) have been found to be controlled and expressed by an extrachromosomal gene cluster and plasmids bearing such clusters have been named 'degradative plasmids' (Chatterjee et al., 1981Furukawa and Chakrabarty, 1982Pemberton and Fisher, 1977). Such degradative plasmids have been identified mainly in strains of Pseudomonas species which are already known for nutritional versatility (Harayama and Don, 1979). The degradative plasmids are, by and large, conjugative types and their molecular sizes range from 40 to > 300 MDs (Hardman et al., 1986). The large molecular size of these plasmids contributes to the difficulty associated with their isolation in covalently closed circular form. Furthermore, due to the low copy number of these plasmids, in situ identification of plasmid bands in agarose gel preparations is generally not possible. Special care is, therefore, necessary for obtaining consistent results with regard to identification of the degradative plasmids. Inter- and/or intra-generic conjugational transfer of these degradative plasmids have often been taken as a confirmation of the presence of such plasmids in a bacterial species. In the present communication two bacterial species of Pseudonionas, capable of complete degradation of HCH, have been studied for the presence of plasmids and their conjugative character. © 1991.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8; CODEN: JBITD,10.1016/0168-1656(91)90036-U,Conjugation;Curing;Dechlorinase;Hexachlorocyclohexane;Plasmid;Pseudomonas;Pseudomonas putida;dechlorinase;hexachlorocyclohexane;unclassified drug;article;nonhuman;plasmid;priority journal;pseudomonas,NA,NA,evidence of plasmid mediated dechlorinase activity in pseudomonas sps

Conversely, densities of larvae and young of year increased (nonsignificantly) during this period. In the 1970s, year-class strength was variable, but high young-of-year densities resulted in increased abundance and angler catch rates when the cohorts reached adult sizes. During the 1980s, reproductive success and survival through the first summer were adequate, but few white crappies reached harvestable size. Expansion of aquatic vegetation and resulting changes in fish and invertebrate community structures appeared to be the most important factors affecting survival of young white crappies in Chickamauga Reservoir. Also, low dissolved oxygen conditions associated with a 1985–1988 drought may have limited survival of age-1 and older white crappies. Prior to 1988, white crappies were the predominant Pomoxis species (over 90%) in Chickamauga Reservoir; in 1988 and 1989, however, juvenile black crappies P. nigromaculatus made up over 80% of crappies collected. This shift in dominance was judged to be related to the expansion of aquatic macrophytes. White crappies have continued to dominate angler catches. Continuing creel and population surveys will be required to determine if the harvest of black crappies will offset the decline in white crappie stocks, or if high juvenile mortality also will affect black crappies. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 47,10.1577/1548-8675(1991)011<0513:FAAOWC>2.3.CO;2,Tennessee;European Continental Ancestry Group;Fibrinogen,NA,NA,factors affecting abundance of white crappies in chickamauga reservoir tennessee 19701989

Lower fireweed density resulted from higher herbage production or changes in botanical composition from carpet grass to the more competitive paspalum (Paspalum dilatatum) and kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum). These changes were rapidly achieved by the application of nitrogen fertilizer. Super phosphate application and management for clover development favoured invasion by fireweed in the initial stage. Subsequently the effect of superphosphate was similar to that of nitrogen fertilizer due to the response of more productive grasses to nitrogen fixed by clover. Under grazing, the density of fireweed was increased by high stocking rates, but was reduced markedly by a change to kikuyu grass dominance even under heavy grazing. Fireweed density was negatively related to per cent kikuyu grass.

The determination of the permissible maximal quantities and analyses of the food by the competent authorities, that still needs to be on a wider scale, should assure that in the foreseeable future no damage to health need be feared. Nevertheless, there is certainly no room for complacency, as possible physiological and toxicological action of small quantities of single, or of several, noxae to which we may be exposed over many years, may exist, and we know little about them. There is, therefore, no possibility of laying down a definite threshold value of innocuity. This applies in particular to the presence of small quantities of cancerogenic substances in the food or the use of nitrites for the preservation of meat. This problem can be solved only by further animal experiments and epidemiological researches. Furthermore, it must be constantly borne in mind that most of the residues that are found in foodstuffs, such as pesticides or heavy metals, can, in high doses, cause acute intoxications; and poisonings of humans are the consequence of pollution of food or drinking water by accident or negligence. Itai-itai disease, minimata disease or sudden death of fish after chemicals have got into streams are examples of chronic or acute toxicity.

A fivefold increase in the activity of heatstable, organophosphate-resistant esterase in tolerant serum was shown to be associated with the low-density lipoprotein fraction. The response of tolerant rabbits to challenge with endotoxin was immediate and was manifested by a sharp drop in ionized calcium in serum and a rapid formation of endotoxin-lipoprotein (esterase) complexes in the circulation. Tolerant rabbits were capable of effecting a rapid intravascular detoxification of endotoxin in spite of total occlusion of blood flow to the liver and spleen.

We have undertaken an intensive study of the genetic effects of some commonly used chemicals using Drosophila, Salmonella and plant test systems. In this communication we report the mitotic effects of the insecticides: summithion, lannate, carbicron, thiodan and kelthane, the fungicides: benlate, diathane M-45 and aladrin and the herbicides: lasso, ramrod, round up and grammoxone. In another communication we report their genetic effects on Drosophila and Salmonella (Gopalan and Njagi 1979, Njagi and Gopalan 1981a and b). In E. coli, summithion, kelthane and diathane M-45 have been shown to induce revertants without metabolic activation (Shirasu et al. 1976). At the histidine loci of Salmonella typhimurium, reversion mutations restoring prototrophy were induced by the same 3 chemicals (Shirasu 1976). In fungi and mammalian systems, information on genetic activity of these chemicals is relatively scarce. Toxicological data shows the Lasso is lethal in rats (LD50 = 1200 mg/kg) and ramrod (LD50 = 380 mg/kg) and round up LD50 = 4900 mg/kg) in rabbits.

Durch die Reizsignale dieser Initialassoziation werden männliche Zecken attraktiert und zur Migration sowie Aggregation veranlaßt. In Reaktion auf das durch Kombination männlicher und weiblicher Komponenten in seiner Reizintensität verstärkte Pheromongemisch werden schließlich auch präimaginale Stadien zur gezielt orientierten Zuwanderung und endgültigen Etablierung einer Terminalassoziation aktiviert. In den Untersuchungen zur biologisch‐chemischen Bekämpfung und Kontrolle von Argas (Persicargas) walkerae mit Pheromon‐Flumethrin‐Gemischen konnten zwar stets unmittelbare Pheromon‐spezifische Reaktionen nachgewiesen werden, doch bestanden deutliche durch die verwendete Flumethrinmenge bestimmte, gleichzeitig aber auch stadienbedingte quantitative Unterschiede in den Aggregationsraten. Durch die Akarizidkomponente wurden dabei zwar alle aggregierten Zecken, wenn auch stadien‐ und konzentrationsbedingt zeitlich unterschiedlich, abgetötet, eine maximale Kontrolle der exponierten Testzecken wurde aber nicht erreicht. Der Anteil aggregierter Zecken war im Verlauf der gesamten Pheromonexposition stets umgekehrt zur Flumethrinmenge korrehert und erreichte nach 24stündiger Einwirkungszeit maximale Aggregationsraten von 80% für Larven bei 0,0001 ppm, jeweils 100% für I. und II. Nymphen sowie männliche Imagines bei 0,1 ppm und ebenfalls 100% für weibliche Adultzecken bei 0,1—1 ppm Pyrethroid‐Beimischung. In Auswertung aller exponierten Zecken war der Kontrollerfolg bei Larven und I. Nymphen in den niedrigen Konzentrationsbereichen mit 80% bei 0,0001 ppm bzw. 90% bei 0,1 ppm insgesamt jeweils größer als mit 30—75% bzw. 30—85% in allen höheren Abstufungen, da, obwohl prozentual weniger abgetötet wurden, mehr Zecken aggregierten. Aufgrund der verminderten Flumethrinsensitivität sowie des niedrigeren Anteils aggregierter Zecken waren II. Nymphen sowie männliche und weibliche Imagines maximal lediglich zu 50% und dabei nur in den hohen Konzentrationen von 10—50 ppm zu kontrollieren. Ein mittelbarer Flumethrineffekt war stets auszuschließen. In den Untersuchungen zur biologisch‐chemischen Bekämpfung und Kontrolle von Argas (Persicargas) walkerae mit Guanin‐Flumethrin‐Gemischen war Guanin für nüchterne I. Nymphen attraktiv und induzierte eine gezielt orientierte Migration und selektive Aggregation, doch zeigte die Reizqualität im Vergleich mit natürlichen Pheromonen deutliche zeitliche Unterschiede in der Reaktivität, die wiederum von der Konzentration dieser bioanalogen Substanz reguliert und gesteuert wurde. Prinzipiell beantworteten I. Nymphen diesen Stimulus initial und unabhängig von der Konzentration immer um 1 Stunde verzögert und optimal lediglich im Bereich von 1 ppm. Bei zusätzlicher Imprägnation der Guanin‐behandelten Filterpapierscheibe mit Flumethrin in Dosierungen von 1000 und 100 ppm eines Volumenverhältnisses 1:1 reagierten nüchterne I. Nymphen mit prinzipiell analogem Reaktionsmuster und dabei mit zeitlich und quantitativ gleich abgestuften Aggregationswerten, doch war die Attraktivität der Reizquelle insgesamt deutlich reduziert und auch die Reizantwort wesentlich verzögert. Lediglich im Konzentrationsbereich von 1 ppm bei gleichanteiliger Beimischung von 100 und 1000 ppm Flumethrin wurden nach zweitägiger Exposition Aggregationswerte von jeweils 100% erreicht. Die aggregierten I. Nymphen wurden, wenn auch Pyrethroid‐konzentrationsbedingt zeitlich unterschiedlich, insgesamt abgetötet. On pheromonal induced communication of Argas (Persicargas) walkerae and biological‐chemical control using a pheromone or a pheromone analogous substance with flumethrine In a pilot experiment simulating the conditions of the natural biotype the behaviour and aggregation reactions of Argas (Persicargas) walkerae were investigated. It could be demonstrated that engorged female imagines always determine the location of the association and challenge with a primary pheromonal stimulus. Attracted by the signals of these initial associations the male ticks migrate and aggregate. The mixture of female and male pheromones activates the immature stages which also migrate and aggregate, establishing the terminal association. In the investigations on biological‐chemical control of Argas (Persicargas) walkerae with pheromone‐flumethrine mixtures a direct pheromone‐specific reaction could always be shown, however, there were quantitative differences in the aggregation rates caused by the amount of pyrethroid used, as well as stage‐related. Through the acaricide component all aggregated ticks were thereby killed, although, due to the differences in stages and concentrations, at different times. However, maximal control of exposed ticks was not obtained. The number of aggregated ticks was in the course of the entire pheromone exposure always inversely proportionally correlated to the flumethrine amount and reached after 24 hours' exposure maximal aggregations data of 80% for larvae at 0.0001 ppm, 100% for I. and II. nyphms and male imagines at 0.1 ppm and, likewise, 100% for female adults at 0.1—1 ppm pyrethroid mixture. In the evaluation of all exposed ticks, the control success was on the whole larger for larvae and I. stage nymphs in the lower concentrations with 80% control at 0.0001 ppm or 90% control at 0.1 ppm, respectively, than for the higher concentrations, which showed 30—75% and 30—85% control rates. This is due to the fact that, although percentwise fewer were killed, more ticks aggregated. Because of the diminished flumethrine sensitivity as well as the smaller number of aggregated ticks, it was possible to control II. nymphs and male and female imagines only to a maximum of 50% and thereby only with those higher concentrations of 10—50 ppm. An indirect flumethrine effect could always be discounted. In the investigations of the biological‐chemical control of Argas (Persicargas) walkerae with guanine‐flumethrine mixtures, guanine was attractive for unfed I. nymphs and induced a definitely oriented migration to and selective aggregation. The stimulant quality, compared with the natural pheromones, showed clear time differences in the reactivity, which in turn was regulated and steered by the concentration of this bioanalogous substance. Principally, the I. stage nymphs reacted to this stimulus initially and independent of the concentration with a 1‐hour delay, and optimally, only in the 1 ppm area. By additional impregnation of the guanine‐treated filter paper discs with flumethrine in dosages of 1.000 and 100 ppm of a volume ratio of 1:1, unfed I. nymphs showed a basically analogous reaction pattern, with timely and quantitatively equally graduated aggregation values. However, the attraction of the stimulus source was clearly reduced and the stimulus reaction considerably delayed. Only at concentrations of 1 ppm with equal parts of 100 and 1.000 ppm flumethrine additive aggregation values of 100% were reached after two days exposure. The aggregated I. nymphs were all killed, however, with time differences caused by pyrethroid concentration differences. A propos de communication induite par phéromone d'Argas (Persicargas) walkerae et de lutte chimique biologique par l'emploi combiné d'une phéromone et d'un analogue de phéromone avec du flumethrin On a examiné et établi les réactions de comportement et d'agglomération d'Argas (Persicargas) walkerae dans un modèle avec biotope simulé si bien que des images femelles replètes déterminaient le lieu de coilonisation et donnaient l'excitation phéromonale primaire. Les tiques mâles furent attirés par les signaux d'excitation de cette association initiale qui provoquèrent une migration et une agglomération. Des mélanges renforcés de phéromones ont enfin aussi activé des stades de pré‐images dans leur migration et dans l'établissement d'une association terminale en réaction à la combinaison des composants mâles et femelles selon l'intensité. Dans les recherches pour la lutte chimique biologique et les contrôles d'Argas (Persicargas) walkerae avec des mélanges de phéromone‐flumethrin, des réactions immédiates spécifiques à la phéromone ont pu être mises en évidence, mais il y a eu en même temps des différences quantitatives dues aux stades dans les taux d'agglomération. Tous les tiques en aggrégat furent tués par les composants acaricides même avec des stades et des concentrations différentes dans le temps, mais un contrôle maximum des tiques exposés du test n'a pas été possible. La proportion des tiques agglomérés fut plutôt inversée durant toute l'exposition à la phéromone par rapport à la quantité de flumethrin et a ateint après 24 heures d'action des taux d'aggrégat de 80% por les larves avec 0,0001 ppm, 100% pour les nymphes I et II et pour les images mâles avec 0,1 ppm et 10% pour les tiques femelles adultes avec 0,1—1 ppm e mélange pyrethroïde. En considérant tous les tiques exposés, le succès du contrôle s'est situé chez les larves et les nymphes I dans les concentrations les plus basses avec 80% à 0,0001 ppm et respectivement 90% à 0,1 ppm alors que l'on obtenait 30—75% et respectivement 30—85% à tous les degrés plus élevés étant donné que le pourcentage des péri fut plus faible, mais que plus de tiques furent agglomérés. Sur la base de la sensibilité diminuée à la flumethrin et de la faible proportion de tiques agglomérés, les nymphes II ainsi que les images mâles et femelles n'ont pu être contrôlés au maximum qu'à 50% et seulement aux concentrations élevées de 10—50 ppm. Un effet moyen du flumethrin a toujours été exclu. Dans les recherches pour la lutte chimique biologique et le contrôle d'Argas (Persicargas) walkerae avec un mélange guanine‐flumethrin, la guanine fut attractive pour les nymphes I à jeun et a obtenu une migration orientée et un aggrégat sélectif, mais la quanlité de l'excitation a montré de nettes différences temporelles dans la réaction par rapport à la phéromone naturelle, effet de réaction qui fut reglé et modifié en fonction de la concentration de ces substances bioanalogues. Les nymphes I ont répondu principalement au début à ce stimulus avec toujours un retard d'une heure indépendemment de la concentration et de façon optimale à la dose de 1 ppm. En ajoutant une imprégnation au moyen de papier filtre traité à la guanine avec une dose de flumethrin de 1000 et 100 ppm d'un rapport de volume 1:1, les nymphes I à jeun ont réagi de façon analogue avec des valeurs d'agglomération échelonnées égales dans le temps et quantitativement, mais l'attraction de la source d'excitation fut dans l'ensemble nettement diminuée et la réponse à l'excitation nettement retardée. Uniquement à la concentration de 1 ppm avec un mélange identique de 100 et 1000 ppm de flumethrin, des valeurs d'agglomération à 100% furent atteintes après deux jours d'exposition. Les nymphes I agglomérées furent toutes tuées même avec une concentration de pyrethroïde différente dans le temps. Sobre la comunicación feromonal inducida de Argas (Persicargas) walkerae y la lucha quimiobiológica mediante el empleo combinado de una feromona y un análogo de feromona con flumetrina En un ensayo modelar con un biotopo simulado, se examinaron las reacciones de comportamiento y agregación, comprobándose que las imágenes hembra, repletadas siempre, determinan el lugar de implantación y que así colocan el estímulo feromonal primario. Mediante las señales de estímulo de esta asociación inicial son atraídas las garrapatas machos, ocasionando la migración y agregación. En reacción a la mezcla de feromonas, reforzada por combinación de componentes masculinos y femeninos en su intensidad de estímulo, también se activan, por fin, estadios preimaginales para la inmigracion orientada y establecer definitivamente una asociación terminal. En los estudios sobre la lucha quimiobiológica y el control de Argas (Persicargas) walkerae con mezclas de feromona‐flumetrina, eso sí, siempre se pudieron poner en evidencia reacciones específicas inmediatas de feromona, empero existían diferencias claras determinadas por la cantidad utilizada de flumetrina, pero al mismo tiempo también diferencias cuantitativas condicionadas por los estadios en las tasas de agregación. Así se mataron mediante la componente acaricida todas las garrapatas agregadas, aunque de forma diferente en el tiempo, condicionada por los estadios y concentraciones, aunque no se logró un control máximo de las garrapatas de prueba expuestas. La cuota de garrapatas agregadas correlacionaba inversamente en el curso de toda la exposición a la feromona con la cantidad de flumetrina y alcanzaba tras un tiempo de actuación de 24 horas datos máximos de agregación de 80% par larvas 0,0001 ppm, cada vez 100% para ninfas primarias y secundarias así como imágenes masculinas con 0,1 ppm e igualmente 100% para garrapatas hembras adultas con 0,1—1 ppm mezcla de piretroide. En evaluación de todas las garrapatas expuestas era el éxito del control cada vez mayor en las larvas y ninfas primarias en los ámbitos bajos de concentración con 80% con 0,0001 ppm resp. 90% con 0,1 ppm que con 30—75% resp. 30—85% en todas las gradaciones superiores, pues aunque porcentualmente se mataron menos, se agregaban más garrapatas. En consequencia de la sensitividad disminuida a la flumetrina así como de la cuota reducida de garrapatas agregadas, se pudieron controlar solo las ninfas secundarias así como las imágenes masculinas y femeninas como máximo en un 50% y solo en concentraciones elevades de 10—50 ppm. Siempre se pudo destacar un efecto mediato de la flumetrina. En los estudios sobre la lucha y el control quimiobiológicos contra Argas (Persicargas) walkerae con mezclas a base de guanina‐flumetrina era la guanina atractiva para ninfas primarias en ayunas e inducía una migración dirigida y agregación selectiva, pero la calidad del estímulo mostraba en comparación con las feromonas naturales diferencias temporales claras en la reactividad, la cual era, a su vez, timoneada por la concentración de esta substancia bioanáloga. Por principio, respondían siempe las ninfas primarias a este estímulo initial e independientes de la concentración con el retraso de 1 hora y de forma óptima solo en el ámbito de 1 ppm. Al impregnar aditivamente el disco de papel chupón tratado con guanina con flumetrina en dosificaciones de 1.000 y 100 ppm de una relación volumétrica 1:1 reactionaban ninfas primarias en ayunas con un modelo de reacción análogo por principio y con ello con valores de agregación graduados igual en el tiempo y cantidad, pero la atractividad de la fuente de estímulo se halla reducida claramente en conjunto y también está diferida de forma esencial la respuesta al estímulo. Nada más en el ámbito de concentración de 1 ppm con mezcla a partes iguales de 100 y 1.000 ppm flumetrina se consiguieron tras exposición durante dos días valores de agregación de cada vez 100%. Las ninfas primarias agregadas son destruidas en su totalidad, aunque también de forma temporal diferente, hecho condicionado por la concentración de piretroide. © 1984 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 9,10.1111/j.1439-0450.1984.tb01292.x,"Animal;Behavior, Animal;Drug Combinations;English Abstract;Guanine;Human;Insecticides;Male;Pheromones;Pyrethrins;Tick Control;Ticks;flumethrin;guanine;pheromone;animal experiment;drug efficacy;invertebrate;nonhuman",NA,NA,zur pheromonal induzierten kommunikation von argas persicargas walkerae und biologischchemischen bekämpfung durch kombinierten einsatz eines pheromons und pheromonanalogons mit flumethrin

As both the Ames test and the DSI test correlate well with chemical carcinogenicity, urea herbicides in general might be suspected of carcinogenic activity. In order to investigate the potential carcinogenic mode of action of these substances we looked for possible activation mechanisms. The reaction sequence N-oxidation-esterification-carbonium ion formation seemed the only one able to fit the observed structure-activity relationships. Chemical synthesis of the proposed N-acetoxy compounds provided the means for testing this hypothesis. Only the N-acetoxy-, but neither the N-hydroxy- nor the unchanged parent ureas, exhibited a direct alkylating action as measured by the NBP-assay. The DSI reactivity pattern of several positional isomers could be shown to coincide with the theoretical predictions, as did the stability of the chloroisomers in aqueous solution at pH 7. Furthermore the N-acetoxy derivatives could be demonstrated to behave in the Ames test as directly acting mutagens, while the activity of the parent compounds is dependent on the metabolic activation by an S-9-liver fraction. The enhancing action of Acetyl-CoA on the S-9 mediated mutagenicity of these ureas can then be regarded as the final proof for the proposed reaction sequence. © 1979.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 13; CODEN: PCBPB,10.1016/0048-3575(79)90083-X,monuron;ames test;animal experiment;bone;bone marrow cell;chemical carcinogenesis;dna synthesis;drug comparison;drug synthesis;male genital system;mouse;mutagenicity;n acetoxymonuron;n hydroxymonuron;preliminary communication;structure activity relation;testis;Herbicides,NA,NA,herbicidal phenylalkylureas as possible mutagens ii chemical basis of mutagenic activity

Inhibition of the binding of [35S]TBPS by deltamethrin, a Type II pyrethroid, was modulated by GABA; both the affinity and the efficacy of this insecticide increased with incremental concentrations of GABA. Deltamethrin also enhanced the potency of GABA as an inhibitor of the binding of [35S]TBPS. The interaction of 4′-chlorodiazepam (Ro5-4864) with [35S]TBPS was dependent on GABA: in the absence of GABA, Ro5-4864 inhibited up to 40% of the binding: in the presence of 10 μM GABA, Ro5-4864 enhanced binding to a maximum value of 170% of control. However, the same absolute amount of binding was observed with both of these effects at micromolar concentrations of Ro5-4864. Also, Ro5-4864 caused a rtghtward shift in GABA dose-response curves, increasing the IC50 value for GABA more than 6 fold. These results indicate the reciprocal allosteric interactions between a binding site for pyrethroids, a binding site for Ro5-4864, the GABA recognition moiety and the binding site for TBPS in the brain of trout. The similarity of these findings to previous results in preparations of rodent brain highlight the conservation of the modulation of GABAA receptor function during the evolution of vertebrates. © 1990.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 13; CODEN: NEPHB,10.1016/0028-3908(90)90025-M,"4′-chlorodiazepam;GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor;PK 11195;pyrethroid;TBPS;trout;Animal;Benzodiazepinones;Bicyclo Compounds;Binding, Competitive;Brain;Bridged Compounds;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;Kinetics;Pyrethrins;Receptors, GABA-A;Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.;Trout;4 aminobutyric acid;4 aminobutyric acid a receptor;4' chlorodiazepam;deltamethrin;flumazenil;n sec butyl 1 (2 chlorophenyl) n methyl 3 isoquinolinecarboxamide;picrotoxinin;radioisotope;tert butylbicyclophosphorothioate;allosterism;animal cell;article;brain;drug binding;drug concentration;fish;neurotoxicity;nonhuman;priority journal",NA,NA,dependence on γaminobutyric acid of pyrethroid and 4chlorodiazepam modulation of the binding of t35s butylbicyclophosphorothionate in piscine brain

Adult males and females were collected from an Experiment Station, and were exposed to 600 ppb ThiodanR. Since the aqueous solubility of endosulfan (active ingredient of ThiodanR) is very low, the actual concentration of 2, 10, 15 and 600 ppb ThiodanR in tap water was determined by electron-capture gas chromatography. The amount of endosulfan I and II in 2 ppb ThiodanR was 0.8 and 0.32 ppb, respectively; 10 ppb = 3.8 and 1.52; 15 ppb = 6.3 and 2.52; and 600 ppb = 284 and 113.6 endosulfan I and II, respectively. Male and female crayfish were exposed to 600 ppb ThiodanR for 20 weeks during which mating occurred. The mean number of eggs produced by control crayfish (N=10) was 288 and by treated crayfish (N=10) was 225, which did not differ significantly. Hatchlings from unexposed crayfish were used to determine the effects of ThiodanR on weight, length and molting frequency. Sixty hatchlings were exposed to 2, 10 and 15 ppb ThiodanR for a period of 9, 23 and 27 weeks during which they achieved a mean weight (gain) of 0.64, 0.19 and 0.17g, respectively. Control hatchlings gained 0.82, 0.30 and 0.19g during the same period. These differences were also insignificant statistically. The length (gain) by these hatchlings (control and treated) over the same time period did not differ significantly. There was a slight increase (insignificant) in the molting frequencies of treated hatchlings. Comparative data on the chronic effects of ThiodanR for crayfish are not available. Based on the reported LC50 values for grass shrimp, mysid shrimp and Korean shrimp, we conclude that Louisiana crayfish, P. clarkii is more tolerant to this insecticide than the ocher decapod crustaceans. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Box 2503, Ullandhaug, Norway","In September 1987 the shallow, eutrophic, Lake Mosvatn was treated with rotenone to eliminate planktivorous fish (mainly whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus, L.), and the effects were studied. The first summer after treatment the zooplankton community changed markedly from rotifer dominance and few grazers, to a community with few rotifers and many grazers. Accordingly there was a fivefold increase in the biomass of Daphnia galeata. Adult females of D. galeata approximately doubled in weight. The decrease in rotifer biomass was probably mainly due to a loss of food by competition with the daphnids. The phytoplankton community was also markedly affected. Prior to treatment Secchi depth was 1.7 m and Chl-a 23 μg l-1 in the summer. After treatment there was an increase in the proportion of small and gelatinous algae and the mean chlorophyll concentration fell to 7 μg Chl-a l-1. Secchi depth increased to>2.3 m (bottom-sight most of the season). After the treatment there were also fewer cyanobacterial blooms. This seems to be related to oligotrophication caused indirectly by increased grazing by the zooplankton. Total nutrient concentrations were affected. Prior to treatment the mean summer concentration of total phosphate was 44 μg P l-1. This decreased to 29 μg P l-1 in the first summer and 23 μg P l-1 the second summer after the treatment. Total nitrogen decreased from 0.68 mg N l-1 before treatment to 0.32 mg N l-1 the first summer after the treatment.

Moderate levels of such compounds were found in various species prior to the restricted use of DDT in 1972. A subsequent precipitous decline in organochlorine besidues was attributed to decreased upland usage, major flushing of the river basin in early 1973, and various factors associated with estuarine function. No mirex was found in sediments or aquatic organisms. Apparently, the half-life of organochlorines is relatively short in this bay system. Various statistical methods were used to test the relationships of different physico-chemical and biological parameters. During the 4-year study period, seasonal river flow fluctuations dominated water color, turbidity, salinity, nutrients (NO3), chlorophyll a, and the temporal succession of fishes in the bay. Certain long-term trends of fish associations were noted; relative dominance of key fish species declined and stabilized while bay-wide species richness and diversity increased with time. Qualitative changes in species representation determined the long-term pattern of community variability. This was consonant with a distinctive fish fauna during the first year of sampling. The bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli was dominant during 9 of the first 12 monts of the project; this influenced the time-related changes in community indices. Temporally clustered fish associations reflected the importance of river flow in the estuarine environment. Direct correlation of fish distribution with the rapid disappearance of organochlorine compounds was complicated by aperiodic natural phenomena such as storms and river fluctuations. Population and community trends appeared consistent with other studies showing similar patterns of dominance of stress-resistant fish populations and related changes in community parameters. In this case, the relatively predictable annual succession of fish associations allowed an appraisal of key forcing functions. Due to the high level of seasonal and annual biological variability in this estuary, there were some problems in the application of linear statistical models to the data base. Although the long-term trend of relative species representation is useful as an index of stress, new techniques are needed to analyze extensive field data so that functions such as trophic interactions are included in the estimation of causal relationships. There are indications that such effects could be related to the impact of organochlorine compounds on estuarine systems. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 14; CODEN: MBIOA,10.1007/BF00391408,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethane;1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene;chlorphenotane;mirex;polychlorinated biphenyl;estuary;fish;geographic distribution;statistics;united states;Florida",NA,NA,longterm variation of organochlorine residues and assemblages of epibenthic organisms in a shallow north florida usa estuary

The terms 'agricultural chemicals' and 'animal remedies' are used for the pesticides controlled by these two Acts. In addition to the principal Acts there are Amendment Acts, Regulations, and Notices. No agricultural chemical may be sold by the packer or by the importer if imported into New Zealand already packed unless registered by the Agricultural Chemicals Board appointed under the Agricultural Chemicals Act. The extent to which an agricultural chemical may be sold or used varies according to the type of registration. The type of registration and the restrictions placed on provisional registration may depend on the adequacy and nature of the toxicity and residue data and evidence of biological efficiency under New Zealand conditions submitted with the application for registration. The current policy regarding the issue of permits is to phase out the use of persistent organochlorine insecticides in agriculture and horticulture. The conditions under which permits are issued are continually revised in the light of the availability of alternatives to organochlorine insecticides. Similarly, the Animal Remedies Act provides that no animal remedy may be manufactured in New Zealand or imported except under the authority of a licence or provisional licence issued by the Animal Remedies Board and in accordance with any conditions specified in the licence. Agricultural chemicals and animal remedies may not be sold except under labels accepted by the respective Boards.

Belgrade, Belgrade Zemun","The effect of small quantities of various toxic materials on fish, although less apparent than sudden fish kills, may be even more harmful; therefore it is difficult to speak about a maximum safe concentration of a toxic substance for fish. To demonstrate the effect of sublethal concentrations it is necessary to define a very vague concept of sublethal effects. In this paper the concept covers the effects of all those conentrations which are not necessarily lethal for individuals, even at prolonged exposures, but increase the population mortality, decrease its size or change its composition. Among the factors considered here are: those reflected in the growth rate, metabolism, reproduction or which impair the defence mechanism of fish, caused by the deterioration of the environmental conditions in a water ecosystem by the changes of physical, chemical and biotic factors. The author presents a review of the literature pertaining to the effects of short term exposure of fish to various toxic substances, such as phenols, detergents, heavy metals and pesticides.

pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) can have negative effects on the health of ecosystems and humans. While numerous studies have monitored APIs in rivers, these employ different analytical methods, measure different APIs, and have ignored many of the countries of the world. This makes it difficult to quantify the scale of the problem from a global perspective. Furthermore, comparison of the existing data, generated for different studies/regions/continents, is challenging due to the vast differences between the analytical methodologies employed. Here, we present a global-scale study of API pollution in 258 of the world's rivers, representing the environmental influence of 471.4 million people across 137 geographic regions. Samples were obtained from 1,052 locations in 104 countries (representing all continents and 36 countries not previously studied for API contamination) and analyzed for 61 APIs. Highest cumulative API concentrations were observed in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and South America. The most contaminated sites were in low- to middle-income countries and were associated with areas with poor wastewater and waste management infrastructure and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The most frequently detected APIs were carbamazepine, metformin, and caffeine (a compound also arising from lifestyle use), which were detected at over half of the sites monitored. Concentrations of at least one API at 25.7% of the sampling sites were greater than concentrations considered safe for aquatic organisms, or which are of concern in terms of selection for antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, pharmaceutical pollution poses a global threat to environmental and human health, as well as to delivery of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  403     Total Times Cited:  414     Cited Reference Count:  41,10.1073/pnas.2113947119     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),pharmaceuticals;aquatic contamination;antimicrobials;global pollution;wastewater;ESSENTIAL MEDICINES;ANTIBIOTICS;ENVIRONMENT;AFFORDABILITY;AVAILABILITY;POPULATION;EXPOSURE;MIDDLE;INCOME;FISH,NA,NA,pharmaceutical pollution of the worlds rivers

Consistent inter-individual variation in 'sociability' is considered one of the major axes of personality variation in animals along with aggressiveness, activity, exploration and boldness. Not only is variation in sociability important in terms of animal personalities, but it holds particular significance for, and can be informed by, two other topics of major interest: social networks and collective behaviour. Further, knowledge of what generates inter-individual variation in social behaviour also holds applied implications, such as understanding disorders of social behaviour in humans. In turn, research using non-human animals in the genetics, neuroscience and physiology of these disorders can inform our understanding of sociability. For the first time, this review brings together insights across these areas of research, across animal taxa from primates to invertebrates, and across studies from both the laboratory and field. We show there are mixed results in whether and how sociability correlates with other major behavioural traits. Whether and in what direction these correlations are observed may differ with individual traits such as sex and body condition, as well as ecological conditions. A large body of evidence provides the proximate mechanisms for why individuals vary in their social tendency. Evidence exists for the importance of genes and their expression, chemical messengers, social interactions and the environment in determining an individual's social tendency, although the specifics vary with species and other variables such as age, and interactions amongst these proximate factors. Less well understood is how evolution can maintain consistent variation in social tendencies within populations. Shifts in the benefits and costs of social tendencies over time, as well as the social niche hypothesis, are currently the best supported theories for how variation in sociability can evolve and be maintained in populations. Increased exposure to infectious diseases is the best documented cost of a greater social tendency, and benefits include greater access to socially transmitted information. We also highlight that direct evidence for more sociable individuals being safer from predators is lacking. Variation in sociability is likely to have broad ecological consequences, but beyond its importance in the spread of infectious diseases, direct evidence is limited to a few examples related to dispersal and invasive species biology. Overall, our knowledge of inter-individual variation in sociability is highly skewed towards the proximate mechanisms. Our review also demonstrates, however, that considering research from social networks and collective behaviour greatly enriches our understanding of sociability, highlighting the need for greater integration of these approaches into future animal personality research to address the imbalance in our understanding of sociability as a personality trait.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  37     Total Times Cited:  42     Cited Reference Count:  185,10.1111/brv.12823,behavioural syndromes;behavioural types;collective behaviour;division of labour;personality variation;repeatability;social networks;social structure;sociality;temperament;DIVISION-OF-LABOR;YELLOW-BELLIED MARMOTS;SOCIAL NETWORKS;BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES;LONG-TERM;INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;INVASIVE MOSQUITOFISH;PRENATAL STRESS;WILD POPULATION;GROUP-DYNAMICS;Animal Shells;Animals,NA,NA,sociability as a personality trait in animals methods causes and consequences

Targeted analytical measurement data directly sup-port risk assessment activities, as well as downstream risk management and compliance monitoring efforts. Yet, targeted methods have struggled to keep pace with the demands for data regarding the vast, and growing, number of known chemicals. Many contemporary monitoring studies therefore utilize non-targeted analysis (NTA) methods to screen for known chemicals with limited risk information. Qualitative NTA data has enabled identification of previously unknown compounds and characterization of data-poor compounds in support of hazard identification and exposure assessment efforts. In spite of this, NTA data have seen limited use in risk -based decision making due to uncertainties surrounding their quantitative interpretation. Significant efforts have been made in recent years to bridge this quantitative gap. Based on these advancements, quantitative NTA data, when coupled with other high-throughput data streams and predictive models, are poised to directly support 21st-century risk-based decisions. This article highlights components of the chemical risk assessment process that are influenced by NTA data, surveys the existing literature for approaches to derive quantitative estimates of chemicals from NTA measurements, and presents a conceptual framework for incorporating NTA data into contemporary risk assessment frameworks.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  31     Total Times Cited:  35     Cited Reference Count:  141,10.1016/j.envint.2021.107011,Non-targeted analysis;Risk characterization;Exposure modeling;Quantitation;IONIZATION-MASS-SPECTROMETRY;DISINFECTION BY-PRODUCTS;EFFECT-DIRECTED ANALYSIS;N-LINKED GLYCANS;ELECTROSPRAY-IONIZATION;ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS;SEMI-QUANTIFICATION;ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS;EMERGING CONTAMINANTS;EFFICIENCY SCALE,NA,NA,quantitative nontargeted analysis bridging the gap between contaminant discovery and risk characterization

When a population experiences the same conditions, we might expect all individuals to adjust their trait expression to the same, optimal, value, thereby minimising phenotypic variation. Instead, variation abounds. Individuals substantially differ not only from each other, but also from their former selves, with the expression of labile traits varying both predictably and unpredictably over time. A powerful tool for studying the evolution of phenotypic variation in labile traits is the mixed model. Here, we review how mixed models are used to quantify individual differences in both means and variability, and their between-individual correlations. Individuals can differ in their average phenotypes (e.g. behavioural personalities), their variability (known as 'predictability' or intra-individual variability), and their plastic response to different contexts. We provide detailed descriptions and resources for simultaneously modelling individual differences in averages, plasticity and predictability. Empiricists can use these methods to quantify how traits covary across individuals and test theoretical ideas about phenotypic integration. These methods can be extended to incorporate plastic changes in predictability (termed 'stochastic malleability').

Nonetheless, individual variation in fine-scale movement behaviours is rarely examined even though animal tracking devices offer the long-term, high-resolution, repeatable data in natural conditions that are ideal for studying this variation. Furthermore, of the few studies that consider individual variation in movement, even fewer also consider the internal traits and environmental factors that drive movement behaviour which are necessary for contextualising individual differences in movement patterns. In this study, we GPS tracked a free-ranging population of sleepy lizards Tiliqua rugosa, each Austral spring over 5 years to examine consistent among-individual variation in movement patterns, as well as how these differences were mediated by key internal and ecological factors. We found that individuals consistently differed in a suite of weekly movement traits, and that these traits strongly covaried among-individuals, forming movement syndromes. Lizards fell on a primary movement continuum, from 'residents' that spent extended periods of time residing within smaller core areas of their home range, to 'explorers' that moved greater distances and explored vaster areas of the environment. Importantly, we also found that these consistent differences in lizard movement were related to two ecologically important animal personality traits (boldness and aggression), their sex, key features of the environment (including food availability, and a key water resource), habitat type and seasonal variation (cool/moist vs. hot/drier) in environmental conditions. Broadly, these movement specialisations likely reflect variation in life-history tactics including foraging and mating tactics that ultimately underlie key differences in space use. Such information can be used to connect phenotypic population structure to key ecological and evolutionary processes, for example social networks and disease-transmission pathways, further highlighting the value of examining individual variation in movement behaviour.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  82,10.1111/1365-2656.13616,animal personality;animal telemetry;behavioural syndrome;behavioural type;GPS tracking;movement ecology;spatiotemporal variation;INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES;BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES;ANIMAL MOVEMENTS;SOCIAL NETWORKS;PREDATION RISK;DISPERSAL;REPEATABILITY;PATTERNS;EVOLUTIONARY;Lizards,NA,NA,personality spatiotemporal ecological variation and residentexplorer movement syndromes in the sleepy lizard

Shoaling propensity and shoal choice (choice of groups with different densities) were assessed in a Y-maze under the presence of a predatory or nonpredatory heterospecific, with guppies tested individually and in male-female pairs. When tested individually, no effect of fluoxetine was seen on shoaling behavior. However, in paired trials, high-fluoxetine-exposed fish exhibited a significantly greater shoaling propensity.

A variety of ecological and evolutionary processes are dependent on social interactions, such as movement, disease spread, information transmission, and density-dependent reproduction and survival. Social interactions, like any behaviour, are context dependent, varying with environmental conditions. Currently, environments are changing rapidly across multiple dimensions, becoming warmer and more variable, while habitats are increasingly fragmented and contaminated with pollutants. Social interactions are expected to change in response to these stressors and to continue to change into the future. However, a comprehensive understanding of the form and magnitude of the effects of these environmental changes on social interactions is currently lacking. Focusing on four major forms of rapid environmental change currently occurring, we review how these changing environmental gradients are expected to have immediate effects on social interactions such as communication, agonistic behaviours, and group formation, which will thereby induce changes in social organisation including mating systems, dominance hierarchies, and collective behaviour. Our review covers intraspecific variation in social interactions across environments, including studies in both the wild and in laboratory settings, and across a range of taxa. The expected responses of social behaviour to environmental change are diverse, but we identify several general themes. First, very dry, variable, fragmented, or polluted environments are likely to destabilise existing social systems. This occurs as these conditions limit the energy available for complex social interactions and affect dissimilar phenotypes differently. Second, a given environmental change can lead to opposite responses in social behaviour, and the direction of the response often hinges on the natural history of the organism in question. Third, our review highlights the fact that changes in environmental factors are not occurring in isolation: multiple factors are changing simultaneously, which may have antagonistic or synergistic effects, and more work should be done to understand these combined effects. We close by identifying methodological and analytical techniques that might help to study the response of social interactions to changing environments, highlight consistent patterns among taxa, and predict subsequent evolutionary change. We expect that the changes in social interactions that we document here will have consequences for individuals, groups, and for the ecology and evolution of populations, and therefore warrant a central place in the study of animal populations, particularly in an era of rapid environmental change.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  34     Cited Reference Count:  400,10.1111/brv.12772,climate change;communication;dominance;environmental variation;habitat fragmentation;mating systems;pollution;social interactions;social network;HALICTUS-RUBICUNDUS HYMENOPTERA;SPIDER ANELOSIMUS-STUDIOSUS;CRYPTIC GENETIC-VARIATION;RED-SPOTTED NEWT;AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR;ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION;CLIMATE-CHANGE;HABITAT FRAGMENTATION;ANTHROPOGENIC NOISE;SEXUAL SELECTION;Interpersonal Relations,NA,NA,anticipated effects of abiotic environmental change on intraspecific social interactions

Most studies aimed at evaluating the intergenerational effects of CECs have focused exclusively on single chemicals. By comparison, little is known about the effects of complex CEC mixtures on the behavior of organisms, or how these effects might manifest in subsequent generations. In this study, we exposed three generations of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to environmentally relevant concentrations of a complex CEC mixture representative of urban-impacted waterways and assessed the growth and behavior of larval and adult fish in life-stage-relevant fitness contexts (foraging, boldness, courtship). We found that (i) multigenerational exposure to a complex mixture of CECs altered the behavior of both larvae and adults in different fitness contexts; (ii) concentration-dependent patterns of behavioral impairment were consistent across fitness contexts and life stages; and (iii) the effects of exposure were magnified in the F1 and F2 generations.

Assessing larval responsiveness across multiple mechanisms is vital to test the translational power of this approach, as well as assessing its validity for detecting unwanted drug-induced seizures and testing antiepileptic drug efficacy.        Experimental Approach Using light-sheet imaging, we systematically analysed the responsiveness of 4 days post fertilisation (dpf; which are not considered protected under European animal experiment legislation) transgenic larval zebrafish to treatment with 57 compounds spanning more than 12 drug classes with a link to seizure generation in mammals, alongside eight compounds with no such link.        Key Results We show 4dpf zebrafish are responsive to a wide range of mechanisms implicated in seizure generation, with cerebellar circuitry activated regardless of the initiating pharmacology. Analysis of functional connectivity revealed compounds targeting cholinergic and monoaminergic reuptake, in particular, showed phenotypic consistency broadly mapping onto what is known about neurotransmitter-specific circuitry in the larval zebrafish brain. Many seizure-associated compounds also exhibited altered whole brain functional connectivity compared with controls.

We tested how three types of exposure duration to 4 degrees C warming (acute, developmental and transgenerational exposure to 24 degrees C vs 20 degrees C) shape the effect of the pesticide chlorpyrifos on two ecologically relevant fitness-related traits of mosquito larvae: heat tolerance and antipredator behaviour. Transgenerational (from the parental generation) and developmental (from the egg stage) warming appeared energetically more stressful than acute warming (from the final instar), because (i) only the latter resulted in an adaptive increase of heat tolerance, and (ii) especially developmental and transgenerational warming reduced the diving responsiveness and diving time. Exposure to chlorpyrifos decreased the heat tolerance, diving responsiveness and diving time. The impact of chlorpyrifos was lower at 24 degrees C than at 20 degrees C indicating that the expected increase in toxicity at 24 degrees C was overruled by the observed increase in pesticide degradation. Notably, although our results suggest that transgenerational warming was energetically more stressful, it did reduce the chlorpyrifos-induced negative effects at 24 degrees C on heat tolerance and the alarm escape response compared to acute warming. Our results provide important evidence that the exposure duration to warming may determine the impact of a pesticide under warming, thereby identifying a novel temporal aspect of stressor interactions in risk assessment.

Such animals also frequently coil, resulting in complicated shapes whose ambiguity presents difficulties for standard pose estimation methods. Efficiently solving coiled shapes in C. elegans, exhibited in a variety of important natural contexts, is the primary limiting factor for fully automated high-throughput behavior analysis. WormPose provides pose estimation that works across imaging conditions, naturally complements existing worm trackers, and harnesses the power of deep convolutional networks but with an image generator to automatically provide precise image-centerline pairings for training. We apply WormPose to on-food recordings, finding a near absence of deep delta-turns. We also show that incoherent body motions in the dwell state, which do not translate the worm, have been misidentified as an increase in reversal rate by previous, centroid-based methods. We expect that the combination of a body model and image synthesis demonstrated in WormPose will be both of general interest and important for future progress in precise pose estimation in other slender-bodied and deformable organisms.        An important model system for understanding genes, neurons and behavior, the nematode worm C. elegans naturally moves through a variety of complex postures, for which estimation from video data is challenging. We introduce an open-source Python package, WormPose, for 2D pose estimation in C. elegans, including self-occluded, coiled shapes. We leverage advances in machine vision afforded from convolutional neural networks and introduce a synthetic yet realistic generative model for images of worm posture, thus avoiding the need for human-labeled training. WormPose is effective and adaptable for imaging conditions across worm tracking efforts. We quantify pose estimation using synthetic data as well as N2 and mutant worms in on-food conditions.

However, such frequent interactions also have the potential to mask or suppress behavioural differences if individuals conform towards a group behavioural norm (i.e. the social conformity hypothesis) by either synchronizing their behaviour or shifting their behaviour towards that of influential group members. Both of these predictions hinge on the notion that social feedback among group members plays a key role in modulating consistent behavioural variation; thus, in the absence of such feedback, it could be expected that such consistent variation will be reduced. Here, we investigated how a 1-month housing with a stable social group, as opposed to being socially isolated, affected consistent individual differences in the shoaling tendencies of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aceluteus. Specifically, we repeatedly tested the tendency of individual sticklebacks to shoal with conspecifics before and after their social experience. In support of the social conformity hypothesis, we observed a four-fold increase in among-group differences, but no change in among-individual differences, in the shoaling tendencies of sticklebacks housed in groups. A post hoc analysis revealed that the increase in among-group differences may have been driven by the most ?social? pretreatment group member. Conversely, fish that were housed in isolation, expressed a notable, albeit nonsignificant, decrease in individual shoaling variation and repeatability. This decrease in shoaling variation corresponded with an increase in the average shoaling tendencies of solitary fish post-treatment, suggesting that solitary fish converged towards a similarly high level of shoaling tendencies post-treatment. For both treatment groups, however, we found amongindividual positive correlations in pre- and post-treatment shoaling tendencies, suggesting that individuals may inherently differ in their shoaling tendencies, but that the social environment plays an important role in mediating the expression of these differences. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Although a whole range of studies have documented pollutant-induced changes in behaviour, natural daily variability in behaviour is rarely taken into account. This is surprising because biological rhythms may affect the outcome of experiments, are adaptive and are expected to be sensitive to neurochemical exposure. Here, we exploit daily behavioural variation in the fish model Nothobranchius furzeri to examine if behavioural effects of chronic exposure (74 days) to an environmentally relevant level (28 ng/L) of the neurochemical fluoxetine depend on the time of day. Fluoxetine exposure induced an increase in anxiety-related behaviour that was slightly more pronounced in the evening compared to the morning. Moreover, open-field locomotor activity was disrupted and daily patterns in activity lifted upon exposure to the compound. These results imply that short-term behavioural variability should be considered both to standardise ecological risk assessment of neuroactive chemicals as well as to better understand the environmental impact of such compounds in aquatic ecosystems.

Exposures can influence prey-predator interactions, courtship and other vital behaviors, leading to individual or population disruption at toxicant levels well below those producing morphological or physiological changes. The few behavioral studies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on fish behavior have yielded highly inconsistent results, likely relating to chronic vs. acute treatment. A few studies report lethargy and decreased exploratory behavior, while others indicate increased anxiety and greater exploratory behavior with PAH exposure. In our study on zebrafish (Danio rerio), we hypothesized that even relatively brief (30 min) exposure to the PAH benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) would impact group shoaling and individual behaviors in open field and novel object exploration tests. Exposures comprised measured concentrations of 1.0 pM, 10 pM, or 100 pM, B[a]P.

In aquatic ecosystems, contamination by trace metals has deleterious effects on fish health and commonly co-occurs with pathogens, which affect similar physiological and behavioral traits. However, the combined effects of metal contamination and parasitism are still poorly known. In addition, the sensitivity to multiple stressors could be highly variable among different fish populations depending on their evolutionary history, but this intraspecific variability is rarely taken into account in existing ecotoxicological studies. Here, we investigated i) the interactive effects of metal contamination (i.e., realistic mixture of Cd, Cu and Zn) and immune challenge mimicking a parasite attack on fish health across biological levels. In addition, we compared ii) the physiological and behavioral responses among five populations of gudgeon fish (Gobio occitaniae) having evolved along a gradient of metal contamination. Results show that single stressors exposure resulted in an increase of immune defenses and oxidative stress at the expense of body mass (contamination) or fish swimming activity (immune challenge). Multiple stressors had fewer interactive effects than expected, especially on physiological traits, but mainly resulted in antagonistic effects on fish swimming activity. Indeed, the immune challenge modified or inhibited the effects of contamination on fish behavior in most populations, suggesting that multiple stressors could reduce behavioral plasticity. Interestingly, the effects of stressors were highly variable among populations, with lower deleterious effects of metal contamination in populations from highly contaminated environments, although the underlying evolutionary mechanisms remain to be investigated. This study highlights the importance of considering multiple stressors effects and intraspecific variability of sensitivity to refine our ability to predict the effects of environmental contaminants on aquatic wildlife.

We compiled a database of two-dimensional movies for very different biological and physical systems spanning a wide range of length scales and developed a general-purpose, optimized, open-source, cross-platform, easy to install and use, self-updating software called FastTrack. It can handle a changing number of deformable objects in a region of interest, and is particularly suitable for animal and cell tracking in two-dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce the probability of incursions as a new measure of a movie's trackability that doesn't require the knowledge of ground truth trajectories, since it is resilient to small amounts of errors and can be computed on the basis of an ad hoc tracking. We also leveraged the versatility and speed of FastTrack to implement an iterative algorithm determining a set of nearly-optimized tracking parameters-yet further reducing the amount of human intervention-and demonstrate that FastTrack can be used to explore the space of tracking parameters to optimize the number of swaps for a batch of similar movies. A benchmark shows that FastTrack is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, with a comparable tracking accuracy.

To validate this approach, we compiled a dataset from various fields of Physics, Biology and human activities to serve as a benchmark for general-purpose tracking softwares. This dataset is open and accepts new submissions. We also developped a software called FastTrack that is able to track most of the movies in the dataset by proposing standard image processing tools and state-of-the-art implementation of the matching algorithm, which is at the core of the tracking task.

Lab-based studies with individual bees or bees in small groups have highlighted many negative effects of miticides on bee behaviour and physiology; hence, there is an urgent need to better understand the consequences of miticides on honey bee colonies in an apicultural setting. Here we compared effects of commercial treatments of the miticides tau-fluvalinate and thymol, and controls, on honey bee colonies and bee foraging behaviour over five months, from autumn through winter in Sydney, Australia. Since V. destructor does not occur in Sydney, in this study, we could isolate the direct effects of the miticides from indirect effects resulting from reduced mite load. We found the autumn treatment of either miticide caused no significant change in bee adult or brood population or size of food stores.

Such tests are informative, but cannot ascertain effects of long-term and multigenerational mixed-stressor exposure with which organisms are often confronted in their natural environment. Therefore, full lifecycle and multigenerational tests are needed. Yet, these are hampered due to long lifespans and generation times of many standard laboratory species, in particular for vertebrates such as fish. With a typical lifespan of 6 months and a generation time of about 3 months, the turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) may be an ideal model for multigenerational testing. In this study, we assessed the impact of full life-cycle exposure to the emerging pollutant fluoxetine (0, 0.5 mu g/L) in combination with chronic exposure during adulthood to the pesticide 3,4-dichlomaniline (0, 50, 100 mu g/L) over two successive generations of N. furzeri. Overall, both life-history and behaviour were affected by exposure to fluoxetine and 3,4-DCA. Inhibitory effects of single chemical exposure on growth and fecundity were generation-dependent, while enhanced swimming acceleration and feeding in response to fluoxetine were dependent on the presence of 3,4-DCA. Together, these findings show the relevance of a multi-stressor approach across successive generations. Although full life-cycle and multigenerational tests are typically assumed to be impractical and costly for fish, we deliver an effective demonstration that such studies are possible within a timespan of less than 6 months with the killifish N. furzeri as a model organism.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  66,10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105743,"Nothobranchius;Emerging pollutants;Fluoxetine;3,4-dichloroaniline;Behavior;Pollutant mixture;AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY;FLUOXETINE;BEHAVIOR;3,4-DICHLOROANILINE;ENVIRONMENT;ZEBRAFISH;SEROTONIN;TOXICITY;IMPACTS;FATE;Pesticides;Antidepressive Agents",NA,NA,generationspecific and interactive effects of pesticide and antidepressant exposure in a fish model call for multistressor and multigenerational testing

Just as any environmental factor, contamination can make a habitat less attractive or even unsuitable to accommodate life, conditioning to some degree the decision of organisms to stay in, or move from, an ecosystem. If we consider that contamination is not always spatially homogeneous and that many organisms can avoid it, the ability of contaminants to repel organisms should also be of concern. Thus, in this critical review, we have discussed the dual role of contamination: toxicity (disruption of the physiological and behavioral homeostasis) vs. repellency (contamination-driven changes in spatial distribution/habitat selection). The discussion is centered on methodologies (forced exposure against non-forced multi-compartmented exposure systems) and conceptual improvements (individual stress due to the toxic effects caused by a continuous exposure against contamination-driven spatial distribution).

Consequently, critical conservation questions may be answered too slowly to support decision-making. Recent studies demonstrated the potential for computer vision to dramatically increase efficiency in image-based biodiversity surveys; however, the literature has focused on projects with a large set of labelled training images, and hence many projects with a smaller set of labelled images cannot benefit from existing machine learning techniques. Furthermore, even sizable projects have struggled to adopt computer vision methods because classification models overfit to specific image backgrounds (i.e. camera locations).        In this paper, we combine the power of machine intelligence and human intelligence via a novel active learning system to minimize the manual work required to train a computer vision model. Furthermore, we utilize object detection models and transfer learning to prevent overfitting to camera locations. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply an active learning approach to camera trap images.        Our proposed scheme can match state-of-the-art accuracy on a 3.2 million image dataset with as few as 14,100 manual labels, which means decreasing manual labelling effort by over 99.5%. Our trained models are also less dependent on background pixels, since they operate only on cropped regions around animals.

Specific complications arise when the effect sizes of covariates vary on multiple levels (e.g. within vs. among subjects). Mean centring of covariates within subjects offers a useful approach in such situations, but is not without problems.        A statistical model represents a hypothesis about the underlying biological process. Mean centring within clusters assumes that the lower level responses (e.g. within subjects) depend on the deviation from the subject mean (relative) rather than on the absolute scale of the covariate. This may or may not be biologically realistic. We show that mismatch between the nature of the generating (i.e. biological) process and the form of the statistical analysis produce major conceptual and operational challenges for empiricists.        We explored the consequences of mismatches by simulating data with three response-generating processes differing in the source of correlation between a covariate and the response. These data were then analysed by three different analysis equations. We asked how robustly different analysis equations estimate key parameters of interest and under which circumstances biases arise.        Mismatches between generating and analytical equations created several intractable problems for estimating key parameters. The most widely misestimated parameter was the among-subject variance in response. We found that no single analysis equation was robust in estimating all parameters generated by all equations. Importantly, even when response-generating and analysis equations matched mathematically, bias in some parameters arose when sampling across the range of the covariate was limited.        Our results have general implications for how we collect and analyse data. They also remind us more generally that conclusions from statistical analysis of data are conditional on a hypothesis, sometimes implicit, for the process(es) that generated the attributes we measure.

In areas that are too large to be fully covered by the limited detection ranges of receivers or acoustic listening stations, researchers generally assume that animals are residing in an area when they are detected frequently at specific receivers. There is, however, no consensus on how this area and frequency should be spatially and temporally defined respectively, thereby introducing some unaccounted uncertainty of this residency-at-receivers. In longitudinal aquatic systems such as rivers or estuaries, strategically placed receivers are often used as gates or curtains through which tagged animals have to pass. Rather than being a proxy for the time spent near receivers, the detections can serve as boundary conditions to delineate the durations that animals spent between receivers (i.e. residency-between-receivers). As such, providing a spatial and temporal context to the detections and enabling the quantification of epistemic uncertainty. To assess the usefulness of this approach, we analyzed telemetry data for migrating eel in a longitudinal estuarine acoustic tracking network of 21 gates. Results revealed a logarithmic relationship between epistemic uncertainty and gate network resolution, which indicates that transferring information from the spatial to the temporal level has a positive effect on the epistemic uncertainty. The poor correlation between the at-receivers and the between-receivers approach indicates that the latter, although less precise, may be more accurate. It should be noted that the suggested approach assumes that the gates of receivers are perfect detectors. If tagged animals are able to pass these gates undetected the uncertainty will actually be higher than assumed. Our approach is therefore less suited for large open areas such as lagoons or seas where gates with high detection probabilities are logistically challenging. This approach allows the quantification and reduction of epistemic uncertainty by providing a spatiotemporal context to the detections. Since establishing and maintaining passive telemetry networks is generally expensive and the results these networks generate are often used in decision making, an assessment of the network quality and data uncertainty is vital.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  36,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101133     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Epistemic uncertainty;Estuary;Fish;Gates;Network design;Passive acoustic telemetry curtains;ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA;DETECTION RANGE;RESIDENCE TIME;FISH;DESIGN;POSITIONS;BEHAVIOR;ANIMALS;ARRAY;Telemetry;Acoustics,NA,NA,quantifying and reducing epistemic uncertainty of passive acoustic telemetry data from longitudinal aquatic systems

The mixed-effects model is not, however, a panacea for poor experimental design, and should be used with caution when inferring or deducing the importance of both fixed and random effects. Here we describe a selection of the perils and pitfalls that are widespread in the biological literature, but can be avoided by careful reflection, modelling and model-checking. We focus on situations where incautious modelling risks exposure to these pitfalls and the drawing of incorrect conclusions. Our stance is that statements of significance, information content or credibility all have their place in biological research, as long as these statements are cautious and well-informed by checks on the validity of assumptions. Our intention is to reveal potential perils and pitfalls in mixed model estimation so that researchers can use these powerful approaches with greater awareness and confidence.

Particle source, Lagrangian trajectories and arrivals over time (1, 6, and 10 days) were used as a proxy to determine the exposure potential and vulnerability of different habitats to an array of pharmaceuticals with different environmental degradation rates and half-lives. Then, exposure potential was combined with information on sensitive habitats to identify vulnerable areas in the estuary. Three different freshwater inflow scenarios were considered simulating Medium flow, No flow and flood conditions (High flow). Model results for areas with higher particle density were concordant with concentration hotspots of pharmaceuticals. Higher potential exposure in a larger area of the estuary was observed for the High freshwater flow; yet reduced particles export to adjacent coastal areas highlights the potential of estuaries and bays as particle sinks. In all modeled scenarios, vulnerable areas were predominantly located in the southern bays up to day 6, and later in eastern areas, which include a nature reserve. These areas are largely composed of intertidal soft substratum and salt marshes habitats, and thus warrant prioritization for monitoring and risk assessment of pharmaceuticals exposure in the Tagus estuary due to the higher risk of exposure of a wealth of vertebrate and invertebrate species that use them.

In these data, movement ecologists often view unexplained variation around the mean as ""noise"" when studying patterns at the population level. In the field of behavioral ecology, however, focus has shifted from population means to the biological underpinnings of variation around means. Specifically, behavioral ecologists use repeated measures of individual behavior to partition behavioral variability into intrinsic among-individual variation and reversible behavioral plasticity and to quantify: a) individual variation in behavioral types (i.e. different average behavioral expression), b) individual variation in behavioral plasticity (i.e. different responsiveness of individuals to environmental gradients), c) individual variation in behavioral predictability (i.e. different residual within-individual variability of behavior around the mean), and d) correlations among these components and correlations in suites of behaviors, called 'behavioral syndromes'. We here suggest that partitioning behavioral variability in animal movements will further the integration of movement ecology with other fields of behavioral ecology. We provide a literature review illustrating that individual differences in movement behaviors are insightful for wildlife and conservation studies and give recommendations regarding the data required for addressing such questions. In the accompanying R tutorial we provide a guide to the statistical approaches quantifying the different aspects of among-individual variation. We use movement data from 35 African elephants and show that elephants differ in a) their average behavior for three common movement behaviors, b) the rate at which they adjusted movement over a temporal gradient, and c) their behavioral predictability (ranging from more to less predictable individuals). Finally, two of the three movement behaviors were correlated into a behavioral syndrome (d), with farther moving individuals having shorter mean residence times. Though not explicitly tested here, individual differences in movement and predictability can affect an individual's risk to be hunted or poached and could therefore open new avenues for conservation biologists to assess population viability. We hope that this review, tutorial, and worked example will encourage movement ecologists to examine the biology of individual variation in animal movements hidden behind the population mean.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  107     Total Times Cited:  121     Cited Reference Count:  149,10.1186/s40462-020-00216-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Animal personality;Behavioral reaction norms;Behavioral specialization;Behavioral syndromes;Behavioral type;Biologging;Predictability;PACE-OF-LIFE;ANIMAL PERSONALITY;LONG-TERM;INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;NATAL DISPERSAL;SITE FIDELITY;OPEN-FIELD,NA,NA,a guide for studying amongindividual behavioral variation from movement data in the wild

For resource managers to develop the most effective conservation strategies, it is especially important to examine how turtles use and select for habitats within their developmental foraging grounds. Here, we examine the space use and relative habitat selection of immature green turtles (Chelonia mydas) using acoustic telemetry within the marine protected area, Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands.ResultsSpace use by turtles was concentrated on the southern side of Buck Island, but also extended to the northeast and northwest areas of the island, as indicated by minimum convex polygons (MCPs) and 99%, 95%, and 50% kernel density estimations (KDEs). On average space use for all categories was<3 km(2) with mean KDE area overlap ranging from 41.9 to 67.7%. Cumulative monthly MCPs and their proportions to full MCPs began to stabilize 3 to 6 detection months after release, respectively. Resource selection functions (RSFs) were implemented using a generalized linear mixed effects model with turtle ID as the random effect. After model selection, the accuracy of the top model was 77.3% and showed relative habitat selection values were highest at shallow depths, for areas in close proximity to seagrass, and in reef zones for both day and night, and within lagoon zones at night. The top model was also extended to predict across BIRNM at both day and night.ConclusionMore traditional acoustic telemetry analyses in combination with RSFs provide novel insights into animal space use and relative resource selection. Here, we demonstrated immature green turtles within the BIRNM have small, specific home ranges and core use areas with temporally varying relative selection strengths across habitat types. We conclude the BIRNM marine protected area is providing sufficient protection for immature green turtles, however, habitat protection could be focused in both areas of high space use and in locations where high relative selection values were determined.

Increased accessibility to underwater recording equipment such as action cameras and unmanned underwater devices has allowed footage to be captured efficiently and safely, without the logistical difficulties manual data collection often presents. It has, however, led to immense volumes of data being collected that require manual processing and thus significant time, labor, and money. The use of deep learning to automate image processing has substantial benefits but has rarely been adopted within the field of aquatic ecology. To test its efficacy and utility, we compared the accuracy and speed of deep learning techniques against human counterparts for quantifying fish abundance in underwater images and video footage. We collected footage of fish assemblages in seagrass meadows in Queensland, Australia. We produced three models using an object detection framework to detect the target species, an ecologically important fish, luderick (Girella tricuspidata). Our models were trained on three randomized 80:20 ratios of training:validation datasets from a total of 6,080 annotations. The computer accurately determined abundance from videos with high performance using unseen footage from the same estuary as the training data (F1 = 92.4%, mAP50 = 92.5%) and from novel footage collected from a different estuary (F1 = 92.3%, mAP50 = 93.4%). The computer's performance in determining abundance was 7.1% better than human marine experts and 13.4% better than citizen scientists in single image test datasets, and 1.5 and 7.8% higher in video datasets, respectively. We show that deep learning can be a more accurate tool than humans at determining abundance and that results are consistent and transferable across survey locations.

Particular attention has been given to the strategies of visual predators that actively pursue their prey, but sit-and-wait predators have been largely overlooked, their strategies often characterized as stereotyped. Praying mantids are primarily sit-and-wait predators that often employ crypsis to catch their prey using a raptorial strike produced by their highly modified forelimbs. Here, we show that the raptorial strike of the Madagascan marbled mantis (Polyspilota aeruginosa) varies in duration from 60 to 290 ms due to the tibial extension alone; slower strikes involve slower tibial extensions that may also be interrupted by a pause. The success of a strike is independent of its duration or the presence of these pauses. However, prey speed affects the duration of tibial extension and the probability of a pause occurring, both increasing at slower prey speeds. Adjusting the duration of the tibial extension according to prey speed allows mantids to time the final downward sweep of the tibia to their prey's approach. The use of visual inputs to adjust the motor pattern controlling forelimb movements shows that not all aspects of the strike are stereotyped and that sit-and-wait predators can produce behavioural flexibility.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  52,10.1098/rsbl.2020.0098     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),praying mantis;strike kinematics;predation;behavioural flexibility;prey capture;SPHODROMANTIS-LINEOLA BURMEISTER;RANGING PRAYING-MANTISES;FLIGHT SPEED;CAPTURE;INTERCEPTION;FLEXIBILITY;MECHANICS;STRATEGY;BEHAVIOR;INSECTA;Prednisolone,NA,NA,prey speed influences the speed and structure of the raptorial strike of a sitandwait predator

Experiments exposing fishes and invertebrates to constant concentrations of microplastics often yield high variation in particle ingestion rates among individuals. Yet, despite an increasing interest in microplastic ingestion in the wild, the potential intrinsic drivers of inter-individual variation have received little attention so far. Here we assessed individual-level ingestion of Polyethylene microspheres by laboratory-reared juvenile anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris, in relation to (a) ambient particle concentrations and (b) repeatable behavioural traits. We show that microplastic ingestion is highly variable at all tested particle concentrations and that this variation can partially be explained by individual activity levels. Moreover, the relationship between ingestion and behavioural variation increased notably when only the most behaviourally consistent individuals (n = 40 out of 60) were considered in the analysis. Our findings indicate that microplastic ingestion rates in juvenile reef fishes may be less dependent on ambient concentrations than expected; instead they are to some degree phenotype-dependent. Care should thus be taken when reporting mean responses to microplastic exposure treatments, because some individuals may not be affected in the same way as others due to differential ingestion behaviour. We also discuss potential ramifications of non-random ingestion variability on population- and community-level responses. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The creative use and placement of sensors on both biologging and biotelemetric platforms can greatly expand the amount of information that can be garnered from ecological studies.ResultsSophisticated transmitters and data loggers, which once were built by the biologists that used them, are available off the shelf from many commercial manufacturers. The ability to purchase a wide variety of electronic tags has allowed for a wider adoption of electronic tags across ecology, but has resulted in many biologists utilizing them with little understanding of how they function. The purpose of this review is to provide a reader-friendly description of the many sensors available to monitor the behavior, physiology, and environment of both terrestrial and aquatic animals. Our approach here is firstly to describe the electrical and mechanical principles behind each type of sensor and secondly to present one or two classic examples of how they have been used to provide insights into the biology of species from a diversity of taxa. Behavioral sensors that record the speed, acceleration, tilt angle, and direction of movement of an animal as well as its swimming depth or flight altitude will be described. Additional sensors are mentioned that detect feeding and spawning behavior as well as the proximity to conspecifics, prey, and predators. Physiological sensors will be described that monitor muscular, sensory, brain, gastric activity as well as body temperature, and sound production. Environmental sensors will be described that measure irradiance, dissolved oxygen, and magnetic field intensity.

To redress this, we investigated the impacts of two environmentally realistic concentrations of a pervasive antidepressant pollutant, fluoxetine, on foraging behaviour in fish (Gambusia holbrooki), tested individually or in a group. Fluoxetine did not alter behaviour of solitary fish. However, in a group setting, fluoxetine exposure disrupted the frequency of aggressive interactions and food consumption, with observed effects being contingent on both the mean weight of group members and the level of within-group variation in weight.

Video analysis across a broad range of locomotor speeds revealed several differences to C. fortis. Shorter leg lengths are compensated for by high stride frequencies, ranging beyond 40 Hz. This is mainly achieved by a combination of short stance phases (down to 7 ms) and fast leg swing movements (up to 1400 mm s(-1)). The legs of one tripod group exhibit almost perfect synchrony in the timings of their lift-offs and touchdowns, and good tripod coordination is present over the entire walking speed range (tripod coordination strength values around 0.8).

For fish, a large proportion of species spend all or part of their lives in groups, with group coordination playing an important role in the emergent benefits of group-living. Group cohesion can be altered by an array of factors, including exposure to toxic environmental contaminants. Oil spills are one of the most serious forms of pollution in aquatic systems, and while a range of effects of acute oil exposure on animal physiology have been demonstrated, sub-lethal effects on animal behavior are relatively under-studied. Here we used an open-field behavioral assay to explore influence of acute oil exposure on social behavior in a gregarious fish native to the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). We used two oil concentrations (0.7% and 2% oil dilution, or 6.0 +/- 0.9 and 32.9 +/- 5.9 mu gl(-1) Sigma PAH(50) respectively) and assays were performed when all members of a group were exposed, when only one member was exposed, and when no individuals were exposed. Shoal cohesion, as assessed via mean neighbor distance, showed significant impairment following acute exposure to 2% oil. Fish in oil-exposed groups also showed reduced voluntary movement speed. Importantly, overall group cohesion was disrupted when even one fish within a shoal was exposed to 2% oil, and the behavior of unexposed in mixed groups, in terms of movement speed and proximity to the arena wall, was affected by the presence of these exposed fish.

Thus, the time is right to establish and harmonize screening methods, train staff, and record HRMS data for samples from regular monitoring events and surveys. This will strongly enhance the value of chemical monitoring data for evaluating complex chemical pollution problems, at limited additional costs. Collaboration and data exchange on a European-to-global scale is essential to maximize the benefit of chemical screening.

Here, we explore the possibility of modulating behavioural and life-history responses of mosquitofish by varying the degree of biomimicry of a robotic predator, whose appearance and locomotion are inspired by natural mosquitofish predators. Our results support the prediction that real-time interactions at varying swimming speeds evoke a more robust antipredator response in mosquitofish than simpler movement patterns by the robot, especially in individuals with better body conditions that are less prone to take risks. Through an information-theoretic analysis of animal-robot interactions, we offer evidence in favour of a causal link between the motion of the robotic predator and a fish antipredator response. Remarkably, we observe that even a brief exposure to the robotic predator of 15 min per week is sufficient to erode energy reserves and compromise the body condition of mosquitofish, opening the door for future endeavours to control mosquitofish in the wild.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  32     Total Times Cited:  35     Cited Reference Count:  81,10.1098/rsif.2019.0359     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),animal personality;bioengineering;biomimetics;body condition;invasive species;predation risk;GAMBUSIA-AFFINIS;LARGEMOUTH BASS;MICROPTERUS-SALMOIDES;FISH;RECOGNITION;AVOIDANCE;ECOLOGY;PERSONALITY;DECISIONS;SURVIVAL;Robotics;Prednisolone,NA,NA,behavioural and lifehistory responses of mosquitofish to biologically inspired and interactive robotic predators

Assessment of the effect of chemical contaminants on behaviours relating to fitness and trophic interactions for example, requires incorporating predator-prey interactions to create impact assessments. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a controlled substance but is still regularly used as a form of mosquito control. There is little explicit information on the effect of DDT on animal behaviour and the consequent effects upon trophic interactions. This study uses a 3 x 2 factorial design to assess the feeding behaviour of Xenopus laevis toward Culex sp. larvae when supplied with different prey cues. We also assess the behavioural responses of mosquito larvae when supplied with no threat cue and predator threat cues when exposed to 0 mu g/L, 2 mu g/L and 20 mu g/L DDT. There was a significant ""DDT exposure"" x ""prey cue"" interaction whereby DDT significantly decreased the foraging behaviour of X. laevis towards live prey cues, however there was no effect of DDT on X. laevis response to olfactory prey cues. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane exposure caused mosquito larvae to appear hyperactive regardless of DDT concentration. Mosquito larvae anti-predator response was significantly dampened when exposed to 2 mu g/L DDT, however when exposed to 20 mu g/L the anti-predator responses were not impaired. Our results indicate a complex interplay in trophic interactions under DDT exposure, wherein effects are mediated depending on species and concentration. There are possible implications regarding reduced anti-predator behaviour in the prey species but also reduced foraging capacity in the predator, which could drive changes in ecosystem energy pathways. We demonstrate that in order to quantify effects of pesticides upon trophic interactions it is necessary to consider ecologically relevant behaviours of both predator and prey species.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  71,10.1007/s10646-019-02075-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane;Xenopus laevis;Foraging;Trophic interactions;Contaminants;Pesticides;LATERAL-LINE;FEEDING-BEHAVIOR;FISH BEHAVIOR;RESPONSES;FROG;EXPOSURE;INSECTICIDES;CONTAMINANTS;PESTICIDES;POLLUTANTS;Prednisolone,NA,NA,assessing predatorprey interactions in a chemically altered aquatic environment the effects of ddt on <i>xenopus laevis<i> and <i>culex<i> sp larvae interactions and behaviour

We present results from a global survey of camera-trappers working across a diversity of institutions and habitats, and using camera traps for a range of purposes. We show that: (1) the major current constraints on effective camera-trapping are cost, theft and sensor performance (with 66%, 50% and 42% of respondents respectively classifying those as important or extremely important barriers for camera-trapping); (2) the most-needed technological developments are related to sensor performance (faster triggering responses and higher sensitivity), resistance to extreme environmental conditions (extreme temperatures and high humidity) and automated filtering of blank images; and (3) there is considerable variation among camera trap manufacturers in user-rated performance, and none of the manufacturer ratings exhibited a trend over time, despite improvements in the technology. Our results serve as valuable market research for both open-source and commercial camera trap developers. On the basis of our survey of camera-trappers, we foresee a transition towards camera-trapping 3.0 in the near-future, consisting of both more effective camera trap units, but also greater use of wireless data transmission, sensor networks, automation of processes using algorithms and better, more collaborative tools for managing and analysing camera trap data.

Methods: The concept of a systematic evidence map (SEM) is defined and contrasted to the function and limitations of systematic review (SR) in the context of risk management decision-making. The potential for SEMs to facilitate evidence-based decision-making are explored using a hypothetical example in risk management priority-setting. The potential role of SEMs in reference to broader risk management workflows is characterised.        Results: SEMs are databases of systematically gathered research which characterise broad features of the evidence base. Although not intended to substitute for the evidence synthesis element of systematic reviews, SEMs provide a comprehensive, queryable summary of a large body of policy relevant research. They provide an evidence-based approach to characterising the extent of available evidence and support forward looking predictions or trendspotting in the chemical risk sciences. In particular, SEMs facilitate the identification of related bodies of decision critical chemical risk information which could be further analysed using SR methods, and highlight gaps in the evidence which could be addressed with additional primary studies to reduce uncertainties in decision-making.        Conclusions: SEMs have strong and growing potential as a high value tool in resource efficient use of existing research in chemical risk management. They can be used as a critical precursor to efficient deployment of high quality SR methods for characterising chemical health risks.

Objective: To provide a comprehensive analysis of all regulatory compliant aquatic ecotoxicity data and evaluate the current triggers and effects-based environmental assessments to facilitate the development of more efficient approaches for pharmaceuticals toxicity testing.        Methods: Publicly-available regulatory compliant ecotoxicity data for drugs targeting human proteins was compiled together with pharmacological information including drug targets, Cmax and lipophilicity. Possible links between these factors and the ecotoxicity data for effects on, growth, mortality and/or reproduction, were evaluated. The environmental risks were then assessed based on a combined analysis of drug toxicity and predicted environmental concentrations based on European patient consumption data.        Results: For most (88%) of the of 975 approved small molecule drugs targeting human proteins a complete set of regulatory compliant ecotoxicity data in the public domain was lacking, highlighting the need for both intelligent approaches to prioritize legacy human drugs for a tailored environmental risk assessment and a transparent database that captures environmental data. We show that presence/absence of drug-target orthologues are predictive of susceptible species for the more potent drugs. Drugs that target the endocrine system represent the highest potency and greatest risk. However, for most drugs ( > 80%) with a full set of ecotoxicity data, risk quotients assuming worst-case exposure assessments were below one in all European countries indicating low environmental risks for the endpoints assessed.        Conclusion: We believe that the presented analysis can guide improvements to current testing procedures, and provide valuable approaches for prioritising legacy drugs (i.e. those registered before 2006) for further ecotoxicity testing.

As ecological datasets are becoming larger and more complex, we believe these methods can be useful to ecologists as well. In this paper, we review existing implementations and show that deep learning has been used successfully to identify species, classify animal behaviour and estimate biodiversity in large datasets like camera-trap images, audio recordings and videos. We demonstrate that deep learning can be beneficial to most ecological disciplines, including applied contexts, such as management and conservation. We also identify common questions about how and when to use deep learning, such as what are the steps required to create a deep learning network, which tools are available to help, and what are the requirements in terms of data and computer power. We provide guidelines, recommendations and useful resources, including a reference flowchart to help ecologists get started with deep learning.

At the individual level, variations in migratory behavior may lead to differences in fitness and subsequently influence the population's demographic dynamics. Using lifetime GPS bio-logging data from 169 white storks (Ciconia ciconia), we explore whether the recently shortened migration distance of storks affects their survival during different stages of their juvenile life. We also explore how other variations in migratory decisions (i.e., time, destination), movement activity (measured using overall body dynamic acceleration), and early life conditions influence juvenile survival. We observed that their first autumn migration was the riskiest period for juvenile white storks. Individuals that migrated shorter distances and fledged earlier experienced lower mortality risks. In addition, higher movement activity and overwintering ""closer-to-home"" (with 84.21% of the tracked individuals stayed Europe or North Africa) were associated with higher survival.

One group of bees was exposed to a trace concentration (5 mu g/kg, ppb) of imidacloprid in sugar syrup while in the larval stage. The imidacloprid residues caused bees to start foraging when younger as adults and perform fewer orientation flights, and reduced their lifetime foraging flights by 28%. The magnitude of the effects of a trace imidacloprid concentration delivered only during larval stage highlights the severity of pesticide residues for bee foraging performance.

In addition, we focused on diurnal activity change as a behavioral trait that remains understudied in ecology. Our results demonstrate sex-specific variation in adult body size and diurnal activity change among populations that originate from ponds with differences in permanence. However, there was no pond permanence-dependent divergence in maturation time, juvenile growth rate, fecundity and average activity level. With regard to behavior, individuals differed consistently in locomotor activity and diurnal activity change while, in contrast with POLS predictions, we found no indications for life-history and behavioral covariation at any level. Overall, this study illustrates that diurnal activity change differs consistently between individuals, sexes and populations although this variation does not appear to match POLS predictions.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  67,10.7717/peerj.7177     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Nothobranchius;Behavior;Rhythmicity;Diurnal;Pace-of-life;Animal personality;Killifish;Life history;POLS;SLEEP BEHAVIOR;CIRCADIAN PERIOD;SLOW PACE;NOTHOBRANCHIUS;PERSONALITY;RISK;MODEL;RHYTHMS;FITNESS;FISHES,NA,NA,population sex and individual level divergence in lifehistory and activity patterns in an annual killifish

Using replicated temperate pond communities, we evaluate effects of 12 pesticides, nested in four pesticide classes (chloroacetanilides, triazines, carbamates organophosphates) and two pesticide types (herbicides, insecticides) applied at standardised environmental concentrations on larval amphibian exposure and susceptibility to trematode parasites. Most of the variation in exposure and susceptibility occurred at the level of pesticide class and type, not individual compounds. The organophosphate class of insecticides increased snail abundance (first intermediate host) and thus trematode exposure by increasing mortality of snail predators (top-down mechanism). While a similar pattern in snail abundance and trematode exposure was observed with triazine herbicides, this effect was driven by increases in snail resources (periphytic algae, bottom-up mechanism). Additionally, herbicides indirectly increased host susceptibility and trematode infections by (1) increasing time spent in susceptible early developmental stages and (2) suppressing tadpole immunity.

Automated tracking also improves replicability by avoiding observer bias and allowing reproducible workflows. However, few automated tracking programs exist that are open access, open source and capable of tracking unmarked organisms in noisy environments. Tracktor is an image-based tracking freeware designed to perform single-object tracking in noisy environments, or multi-object tracking in uniform environments while maintaining individual identities. Tracktor is code-based but requires no coding skills other than the user being able to specify tracking parameters in a designated location, much like in a graphical user interface. The installation and use of the software is fully detailed in a user manual. Through four examples of common tracking problems, we show that Tracktor is able to track a variety of animals in diverse conditions. The main strengths of Tracktor lie in its ability to track single individuals under noisy conditions (e.g. when the object shape is distorted), its robustness to perturbations (e.g. changes in lighting conditions during the experiment), and its capacity to track multiple unmarked individuals while maintaining their identities. Additionally, summary statistics and plots allow measuring and visualising common metrics used in the analysis of animal movement (e.g. cumulative distance, speed, acceleration, activity, time spent in specific areas and distance to conspecific, etc.).

Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide.

Moreover, despite the increasing interest for the toxicity of pesticide mixtures how this is influenced by temperature has been largely ignored. We tested whether daily temperature variation (DTV) magnifies the toxicity of two pesticides with a different mode of action, the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and the biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti), and of their mixture in the vector mosquito Culex pipiens. Single exposure to CPF and Bti increased mortality and reduced female development time, and exposure to CPF also increased female wing length. DTV was not lethal and did not change the toxicity of the individual pesticides. Yet, a key novel finding was that high DTV increased the mortality of the mixture by changing the interaction between both pesticides from additive to synergistic. Given that in nature daily temperature variation is omnipresent, this is important both for vector control and for ecological risk assessment. The higher toxicity of the mixture at high DTV compared to the typically used constant test temperatures in the laboratory urges caution when evaluating the environmental impact of pesticide mixtures.

Modern tracking technologies allow unprecedented opportunities to monitor the mortality of individuals for years. However, the methods employed to separate actual deaths from transmitter failures have rarely been validated. Here, we review these previous methods and exploit an intensive satellite-tagging programme on raptorial black kites Milvus migrans to examine through tree models whether any tag-parameter indicators could reliably separate 18 confirmed deaths (recovered corpse) from 32 confirmed cases of radio-failure (tagged individual subsequently observed alive). Classification keys were validated on 21 confirmed deaths or radio-failures from an independent tagging study on two other raptor species. Review of tracking studies on mortality showed that they are exponentially increasing and using a wide variety of indicators (e.g., battery charge, stationary locations, fix frequency/quality, sudden tag disappearance, or common sense), with no preponderance of any. Few studies confirmed enough deaths or radio-failures to validate such methods. For GPS-satellite tags, we found a reliable classification key that correctly classified 100% of the deaths and radio-failures in both the calibration and validation datasets through three simple dichotomous indicators: (a) whether GPS locations were stationary or not; (b) whether background Doppler data confirmed them as stationary or not; and (c) whether GPS-locations' frequency gave indication of transmitter malfunctioning or not (Figure 3). For tags recording Doppler locations alone, we failed to find a reliable classification key and advise future researchers to use Doppler data very cautiously (e.g., by censoring any uncertain terminal events) because misclassification rates are likely to be high. Synthesis and applications. Refining the death surveillance function of satellite and GPS-tags will improve the capability of management practitioners to: (a) uncover under-reported casualties provoked by illegal or conflictual causes (e.g., poisoning, shooting, collision with windmills); and (b) calibrate demographic models which form the basis of management plans (e.g., population viability or sustainable harvest models).

Although a widespread behavior, few investigators have studied the nocturnal roosting behavior of birds. Studies conducted to date have either focused on species that roost communally or used radio-telemetry to locate sleeping individuals of a few focal species. Portable thermal cameras capable of detecting infrared (IR) heat signals may provide a more efficient and less invasive means of detecting nocturnal-roosting endotherms such as birds. Our objective was to assess the efficacy of using thermal cameras to detect roosting birds in a woodland bird community in southeastern Australia. To better understand the limitations of using thermography to detect roosting birds, paired bird surveys were conducted along 44 transects from May to September 2016 using both traditional survey techniques during the day and surveys with a thermal camera at night. We detected 195 birds representing 21 species at nocturnal roosts using IR thermography, with the detection rate of birds during nocturnal surveys approximately one-third (29.1%) that during diurnal surveys. Detection rates during nocturnal surveys declined more steeply with distance from observers than for diurnal surveys. Detection rates were significantly higher during diurnal surveys for 14 species of woodland birds, but did not differ between diurnal and nocturnal surveys for eight other species. Roost height, roost visibility, bird mass, and cluster size (i.e., two or more birds in physical contact) did not differ between species categorized as having high or low detectability during nocturnal surveys. Variability among species in nocturnal-detectability could not be attributed to roost-site visibility, roost height, or bird size. Positive detection biases associated with diurnal behavior, such as movement and vocalizations, and limitations of current IR technology, e.g., low resolution, likely contributed to overall lower detection rates during nocturnal surveys.

Along this line of reasoning, effect-based methods are recommended for Water Framework Directive (WFD) monitoring to cover the major modes of action in the universe of environmentally relevant chemicals so as to evaluate improvements of water quality upon implementing the measures. To this end, a minimum battery of bioassays has been recommended including short-term toxicity to algae, Daphnia and fish embryos complemented with in vitro and short-term in vivo tests on mode-of-action specific effects as proxies for long-term toxicity. The likelihood of adverse impacts can be established with effect-based trigger values, which differentiate good from poor water quality in close alignment with Environmental Quality Standards for individual chemicals, while taking into account mixture toxicity.

A promising framework to study this is the pace of life syndrome (POLS), which predicts the integration of life history, behavioral, and physiological traits along a fast-slow continuum. Using an integrative multi-trait approach, we evaluated the presence of a POLS both within and across latitudes and how POLS patterns are affected by warming and metal pollution.

Across latitudes, life history, behavior, and physiology covaried in accordance with the POLS, with the fast-paced low-latitude damselflies characterized by a fast growth rate, high activity, and more explorative and risk-taking behavior, fast metabolic rate, and low investment in immune function (activity of phenoloxidase). This fast POLS strategy was associated with a higher sensitivity to metal exposure and a higher vulnerability to predation. Warming caused opposite responses between the latitudes consistent with differential thermal adaptation in growth rate, behavior, and oxidative stress parameters. Despite this, damselflies of both latitudes showed a consistent pattern in phenotypic correlations among traits that, moreover, was not affected by warming and metal exposure. Within latitudes, there was no full support for the POLS. More active larvae were more explorative and risk taking, which aligned with the fast-slow life history axis, but less strong than at the across-latitude level. Physiological traits were also integrated within latitudes, yet there was no unambiguous coupling with the fast-slow life history continuum. The consistent syndrome structure, if underpinned by genetic correlations, may restrict the independent evolution of individual traits, yet may not necessarily constrain adaptive evolution of integrated trait sets. This is because the covariance pattern was to a large extent similar across latitudes and within latitudes, suggesting adaptive trait integration guiding adaptive evolution of trait sets along the fast-slow continuum.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  53     Total Times Cited:  56     Cited Reference Count:  159,10.1002/ecm.1332     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioral syndromes;boldness;correlational selection;geographical variation;gradual thermal evolution;life history trade-offs;phenotypic integration;physiological syndrome;space-for-time substitution;structural equation modeling;OXIDATIVE STRESS;METABOLIC-RATE;TRADE-OFFS;ENERGY-STORAGE;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;ANTIPREDATOR DEFENSES;COMPENSATORY GROWTH;PERSONALITY-TRAITS;ANIMAL PERSONALITY;PREY COMMUNITIES,NA,NA,pace of life syndrome under warming and pollution integrating life history behavior and physiology across latitudes

In particular, the recent boom in passive acoustic sensors has provided efficient, noninvasive, and taxonomically broad means to study wildlife populations and communities, and monitor their responses to environmental change. However, until recently, technological costs and constraints have largely confined research in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to a handful of taxonomic groups (e.g., bats, cetaceans, birds), often in relatively small-scale, proof-of-concept studies. The arrival of low-cost, open-source sensors is now rapidly expanding access to PAM technologies, making it vital to evaluate where these tools can contribute to broader efforts in ecology and biodiversity research. Here, we synthesise and critically assess the current emerging opportunities and challenges for PAM for ecological assessment and monitoring of both species populations and communities. We show that terrestrial and marine PAM applications are advancing rapidly, facilitated by emerging sensor hardware, the application of machine learning innovations to automated wildlife call identification, and work towards developing acoustic biodiversity indicators. However, the broader scope of PAM research remains constrained by limited availability of reference sound libraries and open-source audio processing tools, especially for the tropics, and lack of clarity around the accuracy, transferability and limitations of many analytical methods. In order to improve possibilities for PAM globally, we emphasise the need for collaborative work to develop standardised survey and analysis protocols, publicly archived sound libraries, multiyear audio datasets, and a more robust theoretical and analytical framework for monitoring vocalising animal communities.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  275     Total Times Cited:  308     Cited Reference Count:  108,10.1111/2041-210X.13101     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acoustic indices;bioacoustics;biodiversity monitoring;deep learning;ecoacoustics;ecological monitoring;machine learning;passive acoustic monitoring;IMPERFECT DETECTION;DENSITY-ESTIMATION;BIODIVERSITY;INDEXES;CONSERVATION;POPULATION;IMPACT;CLASSIFICATION;IDENTIFICATION;COMMUNITIES;Acoustics,NA,NA,emerging opportunities and challenges for passive acoustics in ecological assessment and monitoring

Among these pharmaceuticals, antihistamines are commonly found, and these substances have the potential to influence the physiology of aquatic invertebrates. Previous studies have focused on how antihistamines may affect behaviours of aquatic invertebrates, but these studies probably do not capture the full consequences of antihistamine exposure, as traditional recording techniques do not capture important animal movements occurring at the scale of milliseconds, such as prey escape responses. In this study, we investigated if antihistamine exposure can impact escape responses in aquatic insect, by exposing damselfly (Coenagrion hastulatum) larvae to two environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1 and 1 mu g L-1) of diphenhydramine. Importantly, we used a highspeed imaging approach that with high-time resolution captures details of escape responses and, thus, potential impacts of diphenhydramine on these behaviours. Our results show overall weak effects of antihistamine exposure on the escape behaviours of damselfly larvae. However, at stage 2 of the C-escape response, we found a significant increase in turning angle, which corresponds to a reduced swimming velocity, indicating a reduced success at evading a predator attack. Thus, we show that low concentrations of an antihistamine may affect behaviours strongly related to fitness of aquatic insect prey - effects that would have been overlooked using traditional recording techniques. Hence, to understand the full consequences of pharmaceutical contamination on aquatic wildlife, high-speed imaging should be incorporated into future environmental risk assessments.

An automatic background filtering method based on the point distribution was applied to exclude background but keep the deer (and road users if they exist) in the space. A modified density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was used for object clustering. Adaptive searching parameters were applied in the vertical and horizontal directions to cluster the points. The cluster groups were further classified into three groups-deer, pedestrians, and vehicles, using three different algorithms: naive Bayes, random forest, and k-nearest neighbor. The testing results showed that the random forest (RF) can provide the highest accuracy for classification among the three algorithms. The results of the field test showed that the developed method can detect the deer with an average distance of 30 m far away from the LiDAR. The time delay is about 0.2 s in this test.

We quantified the effects of short-term (21 days) exposure to 17 beta-oestradiol (E2) on the antipredator escape performance of larval fathead minnows (Pinrephales promelas) and the probability of predation by a natural predator, the bluegill sunfish (Leponris niacrochirus).

Incorporating these data into a stage-structured population model demonstrated that enhanced predation mortality at the larval stage can result in population declines.

It was discovered that bees can solve a task that is generally viewed as spatial concept learning in primates, specifically the concept of ""above"" and ""below."" In these works, two pairs of visual stimuli were shown in the two arms of a Y-maze. Each arm displayed a ""referent"" shape (e.g., a cross, or a horizontal line) and a second geometric shape that appeared either above or below the referent. Bees learning the ""concept of aboveness"" had to choose the arm of the Y-maze in which a shape-any shape-occurred above the referent, while those learning the ""concept of belowness"" had to pick the arm in which there was an arbitrary item beneath the referent. Here, we explore the sequential decision-making process that allows bees to solve this task by analyzing their flight trajectories inside the Y-maze. Over 368 h of high-speed video footage of the bees' choice strategies were analyzed in detail. In our experiments, many bees failed the task, and, with the possible exception of a single forager, bees as a group failed to reach significance in picking the correct arm from the decision chamber of the maze. Of those bees that succeeded in choosing correctly, most required a closeup inspection of the targets. These bees typically employed a close-up scan of only the bottom part of the pattern before taking the decision of landing on a feeder.

We investigate the ability to automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collect such data, which could help catalyze the transformation of many fields of ecology, wildlife biology, zoology, conservation biology, and animal behavior into ""big data"" sciences. Motion-sensor ""camera traps"" enable collecting wildlife pictures inexpensively, unobtrusively, and frequently. However, extracting information from these pictures remains an expensive, time-consuming, manual task. We demonstrate that such information can be automatically extracted by deep learning, a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence. We train deep convolutional neural networks to identify, count, and describe the behaviors of 48 species in the 3.2 million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our deep neural networks automatically identify animals with >93.8% accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, if our system classifies only images it is confident about, our system can automate animal identification for 99.3% of the data while still performing at the same 96.6% accuracy as that of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving >8.4 y (i.e., >17,000 h at 40 h/wk) of human labeling effort on this 3.2 million-image dataset. Those efficiency gains highlight the importance of using deep neural networks to automate data extraction from camera-trap images, reducing a roadblock for this widely used technology.

Recent advances in technology allow researchers to automate the measurement of animal behaviour. These methods have multiple advantages over direct observations and manual data input as they reduce bias related to human perception and fatigue, and deliver more extensive and complete datasets that enhance statistical power. One major challenge that automation can overcome is the observation of many individuals at once, enabling whole-group or whole-population tracking.        2. We provide a detailed description of an automated system for tracking birds. Our system uses printed, machine-readable codes mounted on backpacks. This simple, yet robust, tagging system can be used simultaneously on multiple individuals to provide data on bird identity, position and directionality. Furthermore, because the backpacks are printed on paper, they are very lightweight. We show that our method is reliable, relatively easy to implement and monitor, and with proper handling, has proved to be safe for the birds over long periods of time.        3. We describe the deployment procedure of this system for a captive population of songbirds. We test different camera options, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, we highlight how using single-board computers to control the frequency and duration of image capture makes this system affordable and adaptable to a range of study systems and research questions.        4. The ability to automate the measurement of individual positions has the potential to significantly increase the power of both observational and experimental studies. The system can capture both detailed interactions (using video recordings) and repeated observations (e.g. once per second for the entire day) of individuals over long timescales (months or potentially years).

The cost, usability and power efficiency of available wildlife monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers.        2. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: ""AudioMoth."" The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384 kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems.        3. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1 km with continuous recording.        4. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of similar to US$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys.

For example, globally, seabird populations are under threat and animal movement data can identify key at-sea areas and provide valuable information on the state of marine ecosystems. To date, in order to locate these areas, studies have used global positioning system (GPS) to record position and are sometimes combined with time-depth recorder (TDR) devices to identify diving activity associated with foraging, a crucial aspect of at-sea behaviour. However, the use of additional devices such as TDRs can be expensive, logistically difficult and may adversely affect the animal. Alternatively, behaviours may be resolved from measurements derived from the movement data alone. However, this behavioural analysis frequently lacks validation data for locations predicted as foraging (or other behaviours). Here, we address these issues using a combined GPS and TDR dataset from 108 individuals by training deep learning models to predict diving in European shags, common guillemots and razorbills. We validate our predictions using withheld data, producing quantitative assessment of predictive accuracy. The variables used to train these models are those recorded solely by the GPS device: variation in longitude and latitude, altitude and coverage ratio (proportion of possible fixes acquired within a set window of time). Different combinations of these variables were used to explore the qualities of different models, with the optimum models for all species predicting non-diving and diving behaviour correctly over 94% and 80% of the time, respectively. We also demonstrate the superior predictive ability of these supervised deep learning models over other commonly used behavioural prediction methods such as hidden Markov models. Mapping these predictions provides useful insights into the foraging activity of a range of seabird species, highlighting important at sea locations. These models have the potential to be used to analyse historic GPS datasets and further our understanding of how environmental changes have affected these seabirds over time.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  57     Total Times Cited:  63     Cited Reference Count:  54,10.1111/2041-210X.12926     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),common guillemot;European shag;foraging;machine learning;prediction;razorbill;time-depth recorder;TRACKING DATA;MOVEMENT;HABITAT;TORTUOSITY;INDICATORS;MODELS;TIME;Diving;Animals;Animal Shells,NA,NA,predicting animal behaviour using deep learning gps data alone accurately predict diving in seabirds

Increased contamination is a well-known result of urbanization, and its effect on behaviour has been extensively studied. Yet, animal personality, consistent behavioural variation between individuals, has rarely been investigated in the context of anthropogenic contaminants. Changes in personalities may affect the viability of populations, and even alter community dynamics. We investigated the effects of exposure to a sublethal dose of the commonly used pesticide esfenvalerate on two personality traits, activity and boldness, and compared these effects between replicated rural and urban populations using larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella. We tested for effects on behaviour at three distinct levels: the average levels of behaviours, the consistency of behaviours (repeatability), and the structure of the behavioural correlations (behavioural syndrome). We found that the pesticide treatment changed the average activity and the behavioural covariation (activity and boldness), but not the behavioural repeatability. Importantly, these pesticide-induced patterns depended strongly on urbanization level. The average activity reduction due to pesticide exposure was only present in urban individuals. Moreover, while a behavioural correlation between activity and boldness in rural larvae appeared only after the pesticide treatment, this activity-boldness syndrome was consistently present in the urban larvae. These differential responses of urban and rural populations may be explained by the apparently more efficient coping mechanism with contaminants of urban populations, as well as the generally more stressful urban habitats. These results highlight the importance of measuring behavioural expressions at various levels when assessing contaminant effects, and not just the means. Further, we suggest that pollution may play an important role in understanding the evolution and maintenance of animal personalities in natural populations.

Intra-class correlations (ICC) and repeatabilities (R) are fundamental statistics for quantifying the reproducibility of measurements and for understanding the structure of biological variation. Linear mixed effects models offer a versatile framework for estimating ICC and R. However, while point estimation and significance testing by likelihood ratio tests is straightforward, the quantification of uncertainty is not as easily achieved.        2. A further complication arises when the analysis is conducted on data with non-Gaussian distributions because the separation of the mean and the variance is less clear-cut for non-Gaussian than for Gaussian models. Nonetheless, there are solutions to approximate repeatability for the most widely used families of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs).        3.Here, we introduce the R package rptR for the estimation of ICC and R for Gaussian, binomial and Poisson-distributed data. Uncertainty in estimators is quantified by parametric bootstrapping and significance testing is implemented by likelihood ratio tests and through permutation of residuals. The package allows control for fixed effects and thus the estimation of adjusted repeatabilities (that remove fixed effect variance from the estimate) and enhanced agreement repeatabilities (that add fixed effect variance to the denominator). Furthermore, repeatability can be estimated from random-slope models. The package features convenient summary and plotting functions.        4.Besides repeatabilities, the package also allows the quantification of coefficients of determination R-2 as well as of raw variance components.

YAPS avoids the sequential positioning-filtering-approach applied in alternative tools by using all available data in a single model, and offers better accuracy and error control. Feasibility and performance of YAPS was rigorously tested in a simulation study and by applying YAPS to data from an acoustic transmitter towed in a receiver array. Performance was compared to an alternative positioning model and proprietary software. The simulation study and field test revealed that YAPS performance was better and more consistent than alternatives. We conclude that YAPS outperformed the compared alternative methods, and that YAPS constitute a vast improvement to currently available positioning software in acoustic telemetry.

We reach this conclusion using simulated data and home range estimates derived from empirical tracking data for green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) equipped with Argos linked Fastloc-GPS tags at three different foraging areas (western Indian Ocean, Western Australia, and Caribbean). Poor-quality Argos locations (e.g., location classes A, B) produced home range estimates ranging from 10 to 100 times larger than those derived from Fastloc-GPS data, whereas high-quality Argos locations (location classes 1-3) produced home range estimates that were generally comparable to those derived from Fastloc-GPS data. However, the limited number of Argos class 1-3 locations obtained for all three turtles-an average of 14.6 times more Fastloc-GPS locations were obtained compared to Argos class 1-3 locations-resulted in blurred patterns of space use. In contrast, the high volume of Fastloc-GPS locations revealed fine-scale movements in striking detail (i.e., use of discrete patches separated by just a few 100 m).

While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions.

This paper reviews the current state of camera-trap-based ethological studies, describes new and emerging directions in camera-based conservation behaviour, and highlights a number of limitations and considerations of particular relevance for camera-based studies. Three promising areas of study are discussed: (1) documenting anthropogenic impacts on behaviour; (2) incorporating behavioural responses into management planning and (3) using behavioural indicators such as giving up densities and daily activity patterns. We emphasize the importance of reporting methodological details, utilizing emerging camera trap metadata standards and central data repositories for facilitating reproducibility, comparison and synthesis across studies.

Furthermore, oil exposure alters habitat settlement and antipredator behaviours, causing reduced sheltering, shoaling and increased risk taking, all of which exacerbate predator-induced mortality during recruitment.

In social bees, which are crucial pollination service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect colony development. Studies under laboratory conditions can control levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure landscape; yet typically such findings are limited to correlative results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides when colonies are placed in the field. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin, provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over 5weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. In contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated colonies after 5weeks.Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field methods and should be considered when considering improvements to current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.

In untreated larvae, regions associated with autonomic functionality, sensory processing and stress-responsiveness, consistently exhibited elevated spontaneous activity. The application of drugs targeting different convulsant mechanisms (4-Aminopyridine, Pentylenetetrazole, Pilocarpine and Strychnine) resulted in distinct spatiotemporal patterns of activity. These activity patterns showed some interesting parallels with what is known of the distribution of their respective molecular targets, but crucially also revealed system-wide neural circuit responses to stimulation or suppression. Drug concentration-response curves of neural activity were identified in a number of anatomically-defined zebrafish brain regions, and in vivo larval electrophysiology, also conducted in 4dpf larvae, provided additional measures of neural activity.

The AUVs have been equipped with stereo-hydrophones that receive signals broadcasted by the acoustic transmitter tags to enable real-time calculation of bearing-to-tag and distance-to-tag measurements. These measurements are shared between AUVs via acoustic modem and fused within each AUV's particle filter for estimating the target's position. The AUVs use a leader/follower multi-AUV control system to enable the AUVs to drive toward the estimated target state by following collision-free paths. Once within the local area of the target, the AUVs circumnavigate the target state until it moves to another area. The system builds on previous work by incorporating a new SmartTag package that can be attached to an individual's dorsal fin. The SmartTag houses a full inertial measurement unit (INU), video logger, acoustic transmitter, and timed release mechanism. After real-time AUV tracking experiments, the SmartTag is recovered. Logged IMU data are fused with logged AUV-obtained acoustic tag measurements within a particle filter to improve state estimation accuracy. This improvement is validated through a series of multi-AUV shark and boat tracking experiments conducted at Santa Catalina Island, California. When compared with previous work that did not use the SmartTag package, results demonstrated a decrease in mean position estimation error of 25-75%, tag orientation estimation errors dropped from 80 degrees to 30 degrees, the sensitivity of mean position error with respect to distance to the tag was less by a factor of 50, and the sensitivity of mean position error with respect to acoustic signal reception frequency to the tag was 25 times less. These statistics demonstrate a large improvement in the system's robustness when the SmartTag package is used.

Radio-telemetry has been a cornerstone of tracking studies for over 50 years, and because of current limitations of geographic positioning systems (GPS) and satellite transmitters, has remained the primary means to track movements of small animals with high temporal and spatial precision. Automated receivers, along with recent miniaturization and digital coding of tags, have further improved the utility of radio-telemetry by allowing many individuals to be tracked continuously and simultaneously across broad landscapes. Motus is novel among automated arrays in that collaborators employ a single radio frequency across receiving stations over a broad geographic scale, allowing individuals to be detected at sites maintained by others. Motus also coordinates, disseminates, and archives detections and associated metadata in a central repository. Combined with the ability to track many individuals simultaneously, Motus has expanded the scope and spatial scale of research questions that can be addressed using radio-telemetry from local to regional and even hemispheric scales. Since its inception in 2012, more than 9000 individuals of over 87 species of birds, bats, and insects have been tracked, resulting in more than 250 million detections. This rich and comprehensive dataset includes detections of individuals during all phases of the annual cycle (breeding, migration, and nonbreeding), and at a variety of spatial scales, resulting in novel insights into the movement behavior of small flying animals. The value of the Motus network will grow as spatial coverage of stations and number of partners and collaborators increases. With continued expansion and support, Motus can provide a framework for global collaboration, and a coordinated approach to solving some of the most complex problems in movement biology and ecology.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  125     Total Times Cited:  153     Cited Reference Count:  43,10.5751/ACE-00953-120108     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),automated radio-telemetry;behavior;full life-cycle biology;migration;migratory connectivity;movement biology;movement ecology;stopover;MIGRATORY SONGBIRDS;RADIO-TRANSMITTERS;STOPOVER;DEPARTURE;TIME;GEOLOCATORS;HARNESS;HABITAT;FLIGHTS;ROUTES;Movement,NA,NA,the motus wildlife tracking system a collaborative research network to enhance the understanding of wildlife movement

Although zebrafish swim in a three-dimensional (3D) space, their behavior in the lab is almost exclusively scored in two dimensions, whereby zebrafish are recorded using a single camera providing 2D videos. Whether this dimensional reduction preserves the reliability of data has not been addressed. Here we show that, compared to a 3D observation, 2D data are flawed by over-reporting and under-reporting of locomotory differences. Specifically, we first reconstructed 3D trajectories through the integration of synchronous information derived from two cameras, and then compared them with the original 2D views in classical experimental paradigms assessing shoaling tendency, fear, anxiety, and general locomotion. Our results suggest that traditional behavioral scoring of individual zebrafish performed in 2D may undermine data integrity, thereby requiring a general reconsideration of scoring zebrafish behavior to incorporate a 3D approach. We then demonstrate that, compared to 2D, a 3D approach requires a reduced number of subjects to achieve the same degree of validity.

Two-current choice flumes have seen the greatest increase in popularity, perhaps because of their potential to address the broadest range of research questions. Here, we review the literature on two-current choice flumes and show that there is a clear absence of standardized methodologies that make comparisons across studies difficult.

Particularly concerning are pharmaceutical pollutants that can adversely impact exposed wildlife, even at extremely low concentrations. One such contaminant is the widely prescribed antidepressant fluoxetine, which can disrupt neurotransmission and behavioural pathways in wildlife. Despite this, relatively limited research has addressed the behavioural impacts of fluoxetine at ecologically realistic exposure concentrations. Here, we show that 28-day fluoxetine exposure at two ecologically relevant dosages one representing low surface water concentrations and another representing high effluent flow concentrations alters antipredator behaviour in Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We found that fluoxetine exposure at the lower dosage resulted in increased activity levels irrespective of the presence or absence of a predatory dragonfly nymph (Hemianax papuensis). Additionally, irrespective of exposure concentration, fluoxetine-exposed fish entered the predator 'strike zone' more rapidly. In a separate experiment, fluoxetine exposure reduced mosquitofish freezing behaviour a common antipredator strategy following a simulated predator strike, although, in females, this reduction in behaviour was seen only at the lower dosage. Together, our findings suggest that fluoxetine can cause both non-monotonic and sex-dependent shifts in behaviour. Further, they demonstrate that exposure to fluoxetine at environmentally realistic concentrations can alter antipredator behaviour, with important repercussions for organismal fitness.

Phenotypic variation exists in and at all levels of biological organization: variation exists among species, among-individuals within-populations, and in the case of l within-populations abile traits, within-individuals. Mixed-effects models represent ideal tools to quantify multilevel measurements of traits and are being increasingly used in evolutionary ecology. Mixed-effects models are relatively complex, and two main issues may be hampering their proper usage: (i) the relatively few educational resources available to teach new users how to implement and interpret them and (ii) the lack of tools to ensure that the statistical parameters of interest are correctly estimated. In this paper, we introduce Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences (SQuID), a simulation-based tool that can be used for research and educational purposes. SQuID creates a virtual world inhabited by subjects whose phenotypes are generated by a user-defined phenotypic equation, which allows easy translation of biological hypotheses into quantifiable parameters. Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences currently models normally distributed traits with linear predictors, but SQuID is subject to further development and will adapt to handle more complex scenarios in the future. The current framework is suitable for performing simulation studies, determining optimal sampling designs for user-specific biological problems and making simulation-based inferences to aid in the interpretation of empirical studies. Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences is also a teaching tool for biologists interested in learning, or teaching others, how to implement and interpret linear mixed-effects models when studying the processes causing phenotypic variation. Interface-based modules allow users to learn about these issues. As research on effects of sampling designs continues, new issues will be implemented in new modules, including nonlinear and non-Gaussian data.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  36     Total Times Cited:  39     Cited Reference Count:  47,10.1111/2041-210X.12659     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),individual differences;linear mixed-effects modelling;model fitting;multilevel data;personality;phenotypic equation;phenotypic plasticity;reaction norm;repeatability;variance components;PRACTICAL GUIDE;EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY;BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES;REACTION NORMS;PLASTICITY;POPULATIONS;POWER;REGRESSION;VARIANCE;VARY;Phenotype,NA,NA,statistical quantification of individual differences squid an educational and statistical tool for understanding multilevel phenotypic data in linear mixed models

The assessment of exposure is tightly interlinked with hazard assessment. Here, we explore if mechanistit understanding of the causal links between exposure and adverse effects on human health and the environment can be improved by integrating the exposome approach with the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept that structures and organizes the sequence of biological events from an initial molecular interaction of a chemical with a biological target to an adverse outcome. Complementing exposome research with the AOP concept may facilitate a mechanistic understanding of stress-induced adverse effects, examine the relative contributions from various components of the exposome, determine the primary risk drivers in complex mixtures, and promote an integrative assessment of chemical risks for both human and environmental health.

Consequently, these compounds are frequently identified in global waterways where they may pose a hazard to aquatic biota. Evidence demonstrates these compounds to be capable of influencing the behaviour of fish, but the relevance of many reported behavioural endpoints is unclear and the value of some findings has been questioned. Since these compounds act on neuroendocrine-mediated pathways in vertebrates, the present study explored how exposure to two representative SSRIs (fluoxetine and sertraline) and an SNRI (venlafaxine) affect circadian rhythms in fish. Male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were exposed to 1, 10 and 100 mu g/L concentrations of these compounds individually and when present as a full mixture, for a period of one week. Neither fluoxetine nor sertraline had an impact on diurnal activity patterns when fish were exposed to these compounds alone at any concentration, whereas venlafaxine significantly disrupted normal circadian rhythmicity but only at 100 mu g/L. When fish were exposed to the full mixture, significantly altered diurnal activity patterns were rapidly observed at nominal concentrations of 1 and 100 mu g/L, but there was no effect at 10 mu g/L. This sort of non-monotonic dose relationship is not altogether unusual for fish exposed to antidepressants, but it poses a problem when attempting to evaluate potential risks to the aquatic environment. To evaluate the possibility for misinterpretation when collecting behavioural data over short temporal scales, the data for each day of the experiment was analysed separately. The outcomes demonstrate the importance of longer periods of data collection, which may be necessary to capture the full range of natural behavioural variability that exists both amongst and within individual fish. More importantly, these findings may help reveal why discrepancies are commonly being reported in the literature with regards behavioural effects in fish exposed to antidepressants. It is thus suggested that research be aimed at documenting behavioural variability in fish species used in toxicity testing, to establish guidelines for quality control and where possible inform the development of standardised methodologies so that behavioural analysis can be more appropriately applied to the broad field of aquatic toxicology.

Individual differences in movement and space-use, fundamental to many personality traits (e.g. activity, boldness and exploratory behaviour) have been documented across many species and contexts, for instance personality-dependent dispersal syndromes. Yet, insights from the concurrently developing movement ecology paradigm are rarely considered and recent evidence for other personality-dependent movements and space-use lack a general unifying framework. We propose a conceptual framework for personality-dependent spatial ecology. We link expectations derived from the movement ecology paradigm with behavioural reaction-norms to offer specific predictions on the interactions between environmental factors, such as resource distribution or landscape structure, and intrinsic behavioural variation. We consider how environmental heterogeneity and individual consistency in movements that carry-over across spatial scales can lead to personality-dependent: (1) foraging search performance; (2) habitat preference; (3) home range utilization patterns; (4) social network structure and (5) emergence of assortative population structure with spatial clusters of personalities. We support our conceptual model with spatially explicit simulations of behavioural variation in space-use, demonstrating the emergence of complex population-level patterns from differences in simple individual-level behaviours. Consideration of consistent individual variation in space-use will facilitate mechanistic understanding of processes that drive social, spatial, ecological and evolutionary dynamics in heterogeneous environments.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  251     Total Times Cited:  289     Cited Reference Count:  80,10.1111/ele.12708     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Animal personality;behavioural syndromes;fractal landscapes;home range;movement ecology;optimal foraging;population structure;search strategies;social networks;spatial ecology;TITS PARUS-MAJOR;INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES;HABITAT USE;HOME-RANGE;STRUCTURED POPULATIONS;SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;NATAL DISPERSAL;PASSERINE BIRD;Animals;Animal Shells,NA,NA,whats your move movement as a link between personality and spatial dynamics in animal populations

Animals often respond behaviorally to environmental change, and multiple stressors can have both population-level and community-level effects. However, the individual, not combined, effects of stressors on animal behavior are commonly studied. There is a need to understand how animals respond to the more complex combinations of stressors that occur in nature, which requires a systematic and rigorous approach to quantify the various potential behavioral responses to the independent and interactive effects of stressors. We illustrate a robust, systematic approach for understanding behavioral responses to multiple stressors based on integrating schemes used to quantitatively classify interactions in multiple-stressor research and to qualitatively view interactions between multiple stimuli in behavioral experiments. We introduce and unify the two frameworks, highlighting their conceptual and methodological similarities, and use four case studies to demonstrate how this unification could improve our interpretation of interactions in behavioral experiments and guide efforts to manage the effects of multiple stressors. Our unified approach: (1) provides behavioral ecologists with a more rigorous and systematic way to quantify how animals respond to interactions between multiple stimuli, an important theoretical advance, (2) helps us better understand how animals behave when they encounter multiple, potentially interacting stressors, and (3) contributes more generally to the understanding of ""ecological surprises"" in multiple stressors research.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  34     Total Times Cited:  38     Cited Reference Count:  33,10.1002/ece3.2609     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antagonism;cue;ecological surprise;effect size;interaction;multiple stressor;sensory pollution;synergism;RISK-ASSESSMENT;CUES;COMMUNICATION;MOSQUITOFISH;ANTAGONISM;PERCEPTION;PREDATION;SYNERGISM,NA,NA,describing and understanding behavioral responses to multiple stressors and multiple stimuli

Of primary interest when deploying MHK devices is gaining an understanding of potential harmful interactions between marine animals and equipment at proposed development sites. Therefore, a high priority regulatory expectation exists to observe marine life interaction with such devices. Underwater video observation of MHK scenes is typically accomplished with optical or acoustical cameras. Traditional optical cameras are most effective when significant ambient light is present and in low turbidity. Even the most sophisticated commercially-available underwater camera technologies require artificial white light to illuminate low light scenes. This approach is not desirable for MHK monitoring because artificial light can alter the behavior of the animals being monitored. For example, it has been observed that marine life are attracted to light-emitting sources of wavelengths within their visual light frequency range. However, unlike active acoustic solutions, the primary advantage of using optical approaches is high resolution contrasted scene descriptions essential for object classification and detailed observations. Because red laser illuminators can be configured below the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) limit for humans, which is conservative with regard to marine wildlife due to the lower visual acuity of the eye, and also beyond the wavelength range that is visible to marine wildlife, such systems can be designed to be eye-safe, unobtrusive, and allow for 24/7 operations.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  10,,underwater imaging;LiDAR;underwater detection;laser;ocean optics;image processing;Military Personnel,NA,NA,undersea lidar imager for unobtrusive and eye safe marine wildlife detection and classification

At the same time, photo and video cameras can store a large number of video recordings and are often used to monitor the subjects remotely. Researchers frequently face the need to code considerable quantities of video recordings with relatively flexible software, often constrained by species-specific options or exact settings. BORIS is a free, open-source and multiplatform standalone program that allows a user-specific coding environment to be set for a computer-based review of previously recorded videos or live observations. Being open to user-specific settings, the program allows a project-based ethogram to be defined that can then be shared with collaborators, or can be imported or modified. Projects created in BORIS can include a list of observations, and each observation may include one or two videos (e.g. simultaneous screening of visual stimuli and the subject being tested; recordings from different sides of an aquarium). Once the user has set an ethogram, including state or point events or both, coding can be performed using previously assigned keys on the computer keyboard. BORIS allows definition of an unlimited number of events (states/point events) and subjects. Once the coding process is completed, the program can extract a time-budget or single or grouped observations automatically and present an at-a-glance summary of the main behavioural features. The observation data and time-budget analysis can be exported in many common formats (TSV, CSV, ODF, XLS, SQL and JSON).

The web-based Sequence Alignment to Predict Across Species Susceptibility (SeqAPASS; https://seqapass.epa.gov/seqapass/) application was developed to simplify, streamline, and quantitatively assess protein sequence/structural similarity across taxonomic groups as a means to predict relative intrinsic susceptibility. The intent of the tool is to allow for evaluation of any potential protein target while remaining amenable to variable degrees of protein characterization, in the context of available information about the chemical/protein interaction and the molecular target itself. To accommodate this flexibility in the analysis, 3 levels of evaluation were developed. The first level of the SeqAPASS analysis compares primary amino acid sequences to a query sequence, calculating a metric for sequence similarity (including detection of orthologs); the second level evaluates sequence similarity within selected functional domains (eg, ligand-binding domain); and the third level of analysis compares individual amino acid residue positions of importance for protein conformation and/or interaction with the chemical upon binding. Each level of the SeqAPASS analysis provides additional evidence to apply toward rapid, screening-level assessments of probable cross species susceptibility. Such analyses can support prioritization of chemicals for further evaluation, selection of appropriate species for testing, extrapolation of empirical toxicity data, and/or assessment of the cross-species relevance of adverse outcome pathways. Three case studies are described herein to demonstrate application of the SeqAPASS tool: the first 2 focused on predictions of pollinator susceptibility to molt-accelerating compounds and neonicotinoid insecticides, and the third on evaluation of cross-species susceptibility to strobilurin fungicides.

Few studies have investigated these predicted life-history/personality associations among species and between sexes. Furthermore, whether and how contaminants interfere with POLS patterns remains unexplored.        We tested for covariation patterns in life history and in behaviour, and for life-history/personality covariation among species, among individuals within species and between sexes. Moreover, we investigated whether pesticide exposure affects covariation between life history and behaviour and whether species and sexes with a faster POLS strategy have a higher sensitivity to pesticides.        We reared larvae of four species of Ischnura damselflies in a common garden experiment with an insecticide treatment (chlorpyrifos absent/present) in the final instar. We measured four life-history traits (larval growth rate during the pesticide treatment, larval development time, adult mass and life span) and two behavioural traits (larval feeding activity and boldness, each before and after the pesticide treatment).        At the individual level, life-history traits and behavioural traits aligned along a fast-slow and a proactive-reactive continuum, respectively. Species-specific differences in life history, with fast-lived species having a faster larval growth and development, a lower mass at emergence and a shorter life span, suggested that time constraints in the larval stage were predictably driving life-history evolution both in the larval stage and across metamorphosis in the adult stage. Across species, females were consistently more slow-lived than males, reflecting that a large body size and a long life span are generally more important for females. In contrast to the POLS hypothesis, there was only little evidence for the expected positive coupling between life-history pace and proactivity. Pesticide exposure decreased larval growth rate and affected life-history/personality covariation in the most fast-lived species.        Our study supports the existence of life-history and behavioural continua with limited support for life-history/personality covariation. Variation in digestive physiology may explain this decoupling of life history and behaviour and provide valuable mechanistic insights to understand and predict the occurrence of life-history/personality covariation patterns.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  56     Total Times Cited:  59     Cited Reference Count:  79,10.1111/1365-2656.12499     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bateman's principle;behavioural syndromes;complex life cycle;consistent individual differences;coping style;hydroperiod;life-history theory;personality-productivity hypothesis;sexual size dimorphism;voltinism;SEXUAL SIZE DIMORPHISM;RISK TRADE-OFF;BODY-SIZE;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;SLOW PACE;SELECTION;ODONATA;GROWTH;PREDATION;BOLDNESS;Pesticides,NA,NA,integrating the paceoflife syndrome across species sexes and individuals covariation of life history and personality under pesticide exposure

However, even sublethal concentrations of pollutants could be harmful if they combined with other factors to cause high mortality in amphibians. Here we show that sublethal concentrations of pollutants can disrupt the ability of amphibian larvae to recognize predators, hence increasing their risk of predation. This effect is indeed much more important since very low amounts of pollutants are ubiquitous, and environmental efforts are mostly directed towards preventing lethal spills. We analyzed the effects of two common contaminants (humic acid and ammonium nitrate) on the ability of tadpoles of the western spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes) to recognize chemical cues from a common predator, nymphs of the dragonfly Anax imperator. We compared the swimming activity of tadpoles in the presence and absence of water-borne chemical cues from dragonflies at different concentrations of humic acid and ammonium nitrate. Tadpoles reduced swimming activity in response to predator cues in the absence of pollutants, whereas they remained unresponsive to these cues when either humic acid or ammonium nitrate was added to the water, even at low concentrations. Moreover, changes in tadpole activity associated with the pollutants themselves were non-significant, indicating no toxic effect. Alteration of the natural chemical environment of aquatic systems by pollutants may be an important contributing cause for declines in amphibian populations, even at sublethal concentrations.

It is also one of the main steps in drug design. Animal models have been used for a long time for toxicity testing. However, in vivo animal tests are constrained by time, ethical considerations, and financial burden. Therefore, computational methods for estimating the toxicity of chemicals are considered useful. In silico toxicology is one type of toxicity assessment that uses computational methods to analyze, simulate, visualize, or predict the toxicity of chemicals. In silico toxicology aims to complement existing toxicity tests to predict toxicity, prioritize chemicals, guide toxicity tests, and minimize late-stage failures in drugs design. There are various methods for generating models to predict toxicity endpoints. We provide a comprehensive overview, explain, and compare the strengths and weaknesses of the existing modeling methods and algorithms for toxicity prediction with a particular (but not exclusive) emphasis on computational tools that can implement these methods and refer to expert systems that deploy the prediction models. Finally, we briefly review a number of new research directions in in silico toxicology and provide recommendations for designing in silico models.

We investigated the effects of the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos and the trematode parasite Euhaplorchis californiensis on three important traits of California killifish (Fundulus parvipinnis): neurotransmitter activity, release of the stress hormone cortisol, and behavior. Killifish were collected from a population without E. californiensis, and then half of the fish were experimentally infected. Following a 30 day period for parasite maturation, infected and uninfected groups were exposed to four concentrations of chlorpyrifos (solvent control, 1-3 ppb) prior to behavior trials to quantify activity, feeding behavior, and anti-predator responses. Water-borne cortisol release rates were measured non-invasively from each fish prior to infection, one-month post-infection, and following pesticide exposure. Killifish exposed to 3 ppb chlorpyrifos exhibited a 74.6 +/- 6.8% and 60.5 +/- 8.3% reduction in brain and muscle acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity relative to controls. The rate of cortisol release was suppressed by each chlorpyrifos level relative to controls. Killifish exposed to the medium (2 ppb) and high (3 ppb) pesticide concentrations exhibited reduced activity and a decrease in mean swimming speed following a simulated predator attack. Muscle AChE was positively related to swimming activity while brain AChE was positively related to foraging behavior. No effects of the parasite were observed, possibly because of low metacercariae densities achieved through controlled infections. We found that sublethal pesticide exposure has the potential to modify several organismal endpoints with consequences for reduced fitness, including neurological, endocrine, and behavioral responses in an ecologically abundant fish.

Acoustic telemetry is a technology to monitor movement and behaviour of aquatic organism in oceans, lakes, and rivers. The technology allows for tracking of multiple individuals simultaneously with very high temporal and spatial resolution, with the option to incorporate sensors to measure various physiological and environmental parameters. Although frequently used in fisheries research, aquatic ecotoxicology has been slow to adopt acoustic telemetry as a tool in field-based studies.

However, it is unclear how behavioral modifications recorded in laboratory assays are expressed in natural ecosystems, a limitation that makes it difficult to evaluate the predictive power of laboratory-based measurements. In this study, we hypothesized that exposure to a benzodiazepine (i.e., oxazepam) increases boldness and activity in laboratory assays as well as in field assays-that is, laboratory results can be used to predict field results. Moreover, we expected the modified behavior to affect other important ecological measures such as habitat selection and home range. To test our hypothesis, we exposed European perch (Perca fluviatilis) to oxazepam and measured subsequent changes in behavioral trials both in laboratory assays and in a lake ecosystem populated with a predatory fish species, pike (Esox lucius). In the lake, the positions of both perch and pike were tracked every 3 min for a month using acoustic telemetry. In the laboratory assay, the oxazepam-exposed perch were bolder and more active than the non-exposed perch. In the lake assay, the oxazepam-exposed perch were also more bold and active, had a larger home range, and used pelagic habitats more than the non-exposed perch. We conclude that ecotoxicological behavioral assays are useful for predicting the effects of exposure in natural systems. However, although individual responses to exposure were similar in both the laboratory and field trials, effects were more obvious in the field study, mainly due to reduced variability in the behavioral measures from the lake.

Whereas parasite exposure is acknowledged as an important cause of these losses, the role of insecticides is controversial. Parasites and neonicotinoid insecticides reduce homing success of foragers (e.g. by reduced orientation), but it is unknown whether they negatively affect flight capacity. We investigated how exposing colonies to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid affect flight capacity of foragers. Flight distance, time and speed of foragers were measured in flight mills to assess the relative and interactive effects of high V. destructor load and a field-realistic, chronic sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid. Foragers from colonies exposed to high levels of V. destructor flew shorter distances, with a larger effect when also exposed to imidacloprid. Bee body mass partly explained our results as bees were heavier when exposed to these stressors, possibly due to an earlier onset of foraging. Our findings contribute to understanding of interacting stressors that can explain colony losses. Reduced flight capacity decreases the food-collecting ability of honeybees and may hamper the use of precocious foraging as a coping mechanism during colony (nutritional) stress. Ineffective coping mechanisms may lead to destructive cascading effects and subsequent colony collapse.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  51     Total Times Cited:  55     Cited Reference Count:  46,10.1098/rspb.2015.1738     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Apis mellifera;flight performance;body mass;wing dimensions;pollination;BEE APIS-MELLIFERA;BEHAVIORAL-DEVELOPMENT;HYMENOPTERA;NEONICOTINOIDS,NA,NA,interaction between <i>varroa destructor<i> and imidacloprid reduces flight capacity of honeybees

Five years later, a substantially larger body of literature has solidified our understanding of plausible mechanisms underlying EDC actions and how exposures in animals and humans-especially during development-may lay the foundations for disease later in life. At this point in history, we have much stronger knowledge about how EDCs alter gene-environment interactions via physiological, cellular, molecular, andepigenetic changes, thereby producing effects in exposed individuals as well as their descendants. Causal links between exposure and manifestation of disease are substantiated by experimental animal models and are consistent with correlative epidemiological data in humans. There are several caveats because differences in how experimental animal work is conducted can lead to difficulties in drawing broad conclusions, and we must continue to be cautious about inferring causality in humans. In this second Scientific Statement, we reviewed the literature on a subset of topics for which the translational evidence is strongest: 1) obesity and diabetes; 2) female reproduction; 3) male reproduction; 4) hormone-sensitive cancers in females; 5) prostate; 6) thyroid; and 7) neurodevelopment and neuroendocrine systems. Our inclusion criteria for studies were those conducted predominantly in the past 5 years deemed to be of high quality based on appropriate negative and positive control groups or populations, adequate sample size and experimental design, and mammalian animal studies with exposure levels in arange that was relevant to humans. We also focused on studies using the developmental origins of health and disease model. No report was excluded based on a positive or negative effect of the EDC exposure. The bulk of the results across the board strengthen the evidence for endocrine health-related actions of EDCs. Based on this much more complete understanding of the endocrine principles by which EDCs act, including nonmonotonic dose-responses, low-dose effects, and developmental vulnerability, these findings can be much better translated to human health. Armed with this information, researchers, physicians, and other healthcare providers can guide regulators and policymakers as they make responsible decisions.

Previously utilized mainly in developmental biology and genetics, the zebrafish has turned out to possess a complex behavioral repertoire. For example, it is a highly social species, and individuals form tight groups, a behavior called shoaling. Social isolation induced changes in brain function and behavior have been demonstrated in a variety of laboratory organisms. However, despite its highly social nature, the zebrafish has rarely been utilized in this research area. Here, we investigate the effects of chronic social isolation (lasting 90 days) on locomotor activity and anxiety-related behaviors in an open tank. We also examine the effect of chronic social isolation on levels of whole-brain serotonin and dopamine and their metabolites. We found that long-term social deprivation surprisingly decreased anxiety-related behavious during open-tank testing but had no effect on locomotor activity. We also found that serotonin levels, decreased significantly in socially isolated fish, but levels of dopamine and metabolites of these neurotransmitters 5HIAA and DOPAC, respectively, remained unchanged. Our results imply that the standard high density housing employed in most zebrafish laboratories may not be the optimal way to keep these fish, and open a new avenue towards the analysis of the biological mechanisms of social behavior and of social deprivation induced changes in brain function using this simple vertebrate model organism.

Yet, the specific sampling schemes that optimize the power of an experiment to detect differences in random effects by treatment/group remain unknown. In this paper we develop a blueprint for conducting power analyses for GLMMs focusing on detecting differences in variance by treatment. We present parameterization and power analyses for random-intercepts and random-slopes GLMMs because of their generality as focal parameters for most applications and because of their immediate applicability to emerging questions in the field of behavioral ecology. We focus on the extreme case of hierarchically structured binomial data, though the framework presented here generalizes easily to any error distribution model. First, we determine the optimal ratio of individuals to repeated measures within individuals that maximizes power to detect differences by treatment in among-individual variation in intercept, among-individual variation in slope, and within-individual variation in intercept. Second, we explore how power to detect differences in target variance parameters is affected by total variation. Our results indicate heterogeneity in power across ratios of individuals to repeated measures with an optimal ratio determined by both the target variance parameter and total sample size. Additionally, power to detect each variance parameter was low overall (in most cases >1,000 total observations per treatment needed to achieve 80% power) and decreased with increasing variance in non-target random effects. With growing interest in variance as the parameter of inquiry, these power analyses provide a crucial component for designing experiments focused on detecting differences in variance.

Recent innovations in tracking technology have allowed researchers to collect large and highly accurate datasets on animal spatiotemporal position while vastly decreasing the time and cost of collecting such data. One technique that is of particular relevance to the study of behavioral ecology involves tracking visual tags that can be uniquely identified in separate images or movie frames. These tags can be located within images that are visually complex, making them particularly well suited for longitudinal studies of animal behavior and movement in naturalistic environments. While several software packages have been developed that use computer vision to identify visual tags, these software packages are either (a) not optimized for identification of single tags, which is generally of the most interest for biologists, or (b) suffer from licensing issues, and therefore their use in the study of animal behavior has been limited. Here, we present BEEtag, an opensource, image-based tracking system in Matlab that allows for unique identification of individual animals or anatomical markers. The primary advantages of this system are that it (a) independently identifies animals or marked points in each frame of a video, limiting error propagation, (b) performs well in images with complex backgrounds, and (c) is low-cost. To validate the use of this tracking system in animal behavior, we mark and track individual bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) and recover individual patterns of space use and activity within the nest.

As environments are mostly unstable, it is now often assumed that genetic parental information is in many cases not sufficient for offspring to become optimally adapted to the environment and that early environmental cues, either indirectly via the parents or from direct experience, are necessary to prepare them for a specific environment later in life. To study whether these early developmental processes are adaptive and through which mechanism, not only the early environmental cues but also how they impinge on the later-life environmental context has therefore to be taken into account when measuring the animal's performance. We first discuss at the conceptual level six ways in which interactions between influences of different time windows during development may act (consolidation, cumulative information gathering and priming, compensation, buffering, matching and mismatching, context dependent trait expression). In addition we discuss how different environmental factors during the same time window may interact in shaping the phenotype during development. Next we discuss the pros and cons of several experimental designs for testing these interaction effects, highlighting the necessity for full, reciprocal designs and the importance of adjusting the nature and time of manipulation to the animal's adaptive capacity. We then review support for the interaction effects from both theoretical models and animal experiments in different taxa. This demonstrates indeed the existence of interactions at multiple levels, including different environmental factors, different time windows and between generations. As a consequence, development is a life-long, environment-dependent process and therefore manipulating only the early environment without taking interaction effects with other and later environmental influences into account may lead to wrong conclusions and may also explain inconsistent results in the literature.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  65     Total Times Cited:  67     Cited Reference Count:  93,10.1186/1742-9994-12-S1-S6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),LIFE-HISTORY TRAJECTORIES;MALE ZEBRA FINCHES;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;ENVIRONMENTAL PREDICTABILITY;TAENIOPYGIA-GUTTATA;SOCIAL-ENVIRONMENT;SEXUAL PREFERENCES;PRENATAL STRESS;OFFSPRING SIZE;MATERNAL-CARE,NA,NA,introducing biological realism into the study of developmental plasticity in behaviour

This hierarchy produces some fundamental challenges to clearly defining biological phenomena and constructing a consistent explanatory framework. We use a heuristic statistical model to explore two consequences of this hierarchy. First, although the variation existing among individuals within populations has long been of interest to evolutionary biologists, within-individual variation has been much less emphasized. Within-individual variance occurs when labile phenotypes (behaviour, physiology, and sometimes morphology) exhibit phenotypic plasticity or deviate from a norm-of-reaction within the same individual. A statistical partitioning of phenotypic variance leads us to explore an array of ideas about residual within-individual variation. We use this approach to draw attention to additional processes that may influence within-individual phenotypic variance, including interactions among environmental factors, ecological effects on the fitness consequences of plasticity, and various types of adaptive variance. Second, our framework for investigating variation in phenotypic variance reveals that interactions between levels of the hierarchy form the preconditions for the evolution of all types of plasticity, and we extend this idea to the residual level within individuals, where both adaptive plasticity in residuals and canalization-like processes (stability) can evolve.

Although sublethal doses of insecticides are known to alter behaviour, current studies on the relationship between toxicants and behaviour tend to ignore effects on individual variation. Our objective was to determine whether sublethal exposure to an organophosphate insecticide could affect the consistency of individual behaviour and disrupt behavioural correlations, in a jumping spider occurring in agroecosystems. Adults of the jumping spider Eris militaris (Araneae: Salticidae) were scored by an open-field and a prey-capture assay, each conducted pre- and post- exposure to the organophosphate insecticide phosmet. Half of the individuals received no exposure to the insecticide to provide a control group. We then estimated the changes in repeatability, a measure of the extent of personality differences, and in behavioural correlations between control and insecticide-treated groups. Although insecticide exposure had no discernable effects on the population's average behaviours, insecticide-exposed individuals showed an average of 23% lower repeatability and the correlation between activity and prey capture was more strongly collapsed in females. Our results provide clear evidence that exposure to sublethal doses of insecticides on an important arthropod predator in agroecosystems causes substantial alteration of personality differences even in absence of a population-wide shift in behaviour. This suggests that insecticide effects are more complex than previously thought and indicates high variation in the way individuals coped with insecticidal exposure. By altering the consistency of behavioural traits and their correlations, exposure to sublethal concentrations of insecticides can have subtle effects on behavioural expression, which may ultimately affect biocontrol performance in an important arthropod predator in agroecosystems.

Most studies on anthropogenic pollution address the impact of pollutants in unimodal sensory domains. High levels of anthropogenic noise, for example, have been shown to interfere with acoustic signals and cues. However, animals rely on multiple senses, and pollutants often co-occur. Thus, a full ecological assessment of the impact of anthropogenic activities requires a multimodal approach. We describe how sensory pollutants can co-occur and how covariance among pollutants may differ from natural situations. We review how animals combine information that arrives at their sensory systems through different modalities and outline how sensory conditions can interfere with multimodal perception. Finally, we describe how sensory pollutants can affect the perception, behaviour and endocrinology of animals within and across sensory modalities. We conclude that sensory pollution can affect animals in complex ways due to interactions among sensory stimuli, neural processing and behavioural and endocrinal feedback. We call for more empirical data on covariance among sensory conditions, for instance, data on correlated levels in noise and light pollution. Furthermore, we encourage researchers to test animal responses to a full-factorial set of sensory pollutants in the presence or the absence of ecologically important signals and cues.

The causes of these declines are diverse and not well understood. In some cases multiple stressors and complex causal mechanisms have been identified. Experimental studies have shown that contaminants can cause the failure of Lithobates sylvaticus tadpoles to initiate predator avoidance behaviors, potentially leading to increased tadpole capture and injury. Copper is a contaminant known to negatively affect amphibians and other aquatic organisms at sub-lethal levels. Mining waste, certain pesticides, vehicle exhaust and brake pad dust are sources of copper, which can enter hydrologic systems through runoff. Additionally, temperature is known to influence predator-prey interactions of ectotherms and is predicted to rise in some areas as climate changes. We examined how copper and temperature affected behavior and predation dynamics between an odonate predator (Aeshna sitchensis) and larval L. sylvaticus prey. We found that sublethal concentrations of copper near the analytical detection limits for this element (1.85 mu g Cu/L) significantly reduced tadpole and odonate activity. Above-average temperatures (22 degrees C) significantly increased tadpole activity and decreased dragonfly activity, compared with ambient-temperature treatments (17 degrees C). These behavioral responses culminated in an approximately three-fold increase in the number of dragonfly attacks on tadpoles in the elevated-temperature, copper-exposed treatments.

Endangered species may be particularly at risk because inbreeding depression and stochastic fluctuations in male and female numbers are often observed in the small populations that typify these taxa. Here, we assessed the interactive effects of water temperature and EDC exposure on sexual development and population viability of inbred and outbred zebrafish (Danio rerio). Water temperatures adopted were 28 degrees C (current ambient mean spawning temperature) and 33 degrees C (projected for the year 2100). The EDC selected was clotrimazole (at 2 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L), a widely used antifungal chemical that inhibits a key steroidogenic enzyme [cytochrome P450(CYP19) aromatase] required for estrogen synthesis in vertebrates. Elevated water temperature and clotrimazole exposure independently induced male-skewed sex ratios, and the effects of clotrimazole were greater at the higher temperature. Male sex ratio skews also occurred for the lower clotrimazole exposure concentration at the higher water temperature in inbred fish but not in outbred fish. Population viability analysis showed that population growth rates declined sharply in response to male skews and declines for inbred populations occurred at lower male skews than for outbred populations. These results indicate that elevated temperature associated with climate change can amplify the effects of EDCs and these effects are likely to be most acute in small, inbred populations exhibiting environmental sex determination and/or differentiation.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  59     Total Times Cited:  63     Cited Reference Count:  94,10.1073/pnas.1416269112     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),stressors;additive;interaction;population;viability;DEPENDENT SEX DETERMINATION;DANIO-RERIO;GONADAL DIFFERENTIATION;INBREEDING DEPRESSION;NATURAL STRESSORS;WASTE-WATER;FISH;RATIO;TEMPERATURE;AROMATASE,NA,NA,climate change and pollution speed declines in zebrafish populations

Meta-analysis has become a standard way of summarizing empirical studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges' d or the response ratio.        2. However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition to or instead of the mean.        3. In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution.        4. Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and ln x (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with ln x =""false"" overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis.        5. Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  174     Total Times Cited:  183     Cited Reference Count:  54,10.1111/2041-210X.12309     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),systematic reviews;meta-regression;effect size;variability;dispersion;parasite behaviour manipulation;sex chromosomes;coefficient of variation;EFFECT SIZE;VARIABILITY;VARIANCE;MODELS;TRAIT;MANIPULATION;DIVERSITY;PARASITES,NA,NA,metaanalysis of variation ecological and evolutionary applications and beyond

Personality differences can arise, for example, from differences in permanent environmental effects-including parental and epigenetic contributors- and the effect of additive genetic variation. Although several studies have evaluated the heritability of behaviour, less is known about general patterns of heritability and additive genetic variation in animal personality. As overall variation in behaviour includes both the among-individual differences that reflect different personalities and temporary environmental effects, it is possible for personality to be largely genetically influenced even when heritability of behaviour per se is quite low. The relative contribution of additive genetic variation to personality variation can be estimated whenever both repeatability and heritability are estimated for the same data. Using published estimates to address this issue, we found that approximately 52% of animal personality variation was attributable to additive genetic variation. Thus, while the heritability of behaviour is often moderate or low, the heritability of personality is much higher. Our results therefore (i) demonstrate that genetic differences are likely to be a major contributor to variation in animal personality and (ii) support the phenotypic gambit: that evolutionary inferences drawn from repeatability estimates may often be justified.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  264     Total Times Cited:  282     Cited Reference Count:  37,10.1098/rspb.2014.2201     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),personality;additive genetic variation;among-individual variation;QUANTITATIVE GENETICS;BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES;PHENOTYPIC GAMBIT;EVOLUTIONARY;POPULATIONS;SELECTION;TRAITS;REPEATABILITY;PLASTICITY;FRAMEWORK;Genetic Variation,NA,NA,the contribution of additive genetic variation to personality variation heritability of personality

Although aggregates can be functional under certain circumstances, this process often leads to the disruption of the cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis), eventually leading to devastating diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).

Many aspects of animal behaviour differ consistently between individuals, giving rise to the growing field of animal personality research. While between-individual variation has long been of interest to biologists, the role of within-individual variation has received less attention. Indeed, many models assume that the extent of within-individual variation is the same across individuals despite the fact that individuals may often differ in their variability. Recently, the importance of within-individual variability or predictability has been recognized within the field of animal behaviour. However, there is a lack of a consensus on how best to quantify it. This situation, in turn, has led to the development of a variety of different methods aimed at assessing how variable or predictable different individuals are. Here, we review the indices that have been proposed as proxies of individual predictability. We then introduce existing techniques called hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLMs) and double-hierarchical generalized linear models (DHGLMs) as general tools for quantifying predictability. HGLMs and DHGLMs are extensions of random intercept mixed models that exploit the fact that variation in variances as well as variation in means can be modelled within a single overarching framework. Explicit modelling of the within-individual residual variation by (D)HGLMs makes more efficient use of the data, performs better on unbalanced data sets and captures more of the uncertainty involved in modelling within-individual variation than other proposed indices. In addition, (D)HGLMs yield an estimator of population-wide variation in predictability, which can serve as a standardized effect size for comparisons across traits and studies. We call this estimator CVP, the coefficient of variation in predictability. The different methods described here and the standardized effect size CVP should open new avenues for studying individuality in animal behaviour. Since sound understanding of individual variation is central to many studies in ecology and evolution, these methods have wide application both in the field of animal personality research and beyond.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  110     Total Times Cited:  119     Cited Reference Count:  54,10.1111/2041-210X.12281     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),animal personality;behavioural consistency;coefficient of variation;dispersion models;intra-individual variability;mixed models;residual variance;GENETIC-HETEROGENEITY;RESIDUAL VARIANCE;PERSON VARIATION;SELECTION;ECOLOGY;VARIABILITY;PATTERNS;GUIDE,NA,NA,quantifying the predictability of behaviour statistical approaches for the study of betweenindividual variation in the withinindividual variance

We assessed the accuracy of Fastloc-GPS locations using fixed trials of tags in which >45000 locations were obtained. Procedures for determining the speed of travel and heading were developed by simulating tracks and then adding Fastloc-GPS location errors. The levels of detail achievable for speed and heading estimates were illustrated by using empirical Fastloc-GPS data for a green turtle (Chelonia mydas, Linnaeus, 1758) travelling over 3000km across the Indian Ocean. The accuracy of Fastloc-GPS locations varied as a function of the number of GPS satellites used in the location calculation. For example, when Fastloc-GPS locations were calculated using 4 GPS satellites, 50% of locations were within 36m and 95% within 724m of the true position. These values improved to 18 and 70m, respectively, when 6 satellites were used. Simulations indicated that for animals travelling around 25kmh(-1) (e.g. turtles, penguins and seals) and depending on the number of satellites used in the location calculation, robust speed and heading estimates would usually be obtained for locations only 1-6h apart. Fastloc-GPS accuracy is several orders of magnitude better that conventional Argos tracking or light-based geolocation and consequently will allow new insights into small-scale movement patterns of marine animals.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  124     Total Times Cited:  133     Cited Reference Count:  58,10.1111/2041-210X.12286     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),satellite telemetry;animal tags;sensitivity analysis;positioning error;HOME-RANGE;SEA-TURTLES;MEASUREMENT ERROR;TURNING ANGLES;LIGHT-LEVEL;MOVEMENT;NAVIGATION;MIGRATION;ORIENTATION;PINNIPEDS;Animal Shells;Animals,NA,NA,the accuracy of fastlocgps locations and implications for animal tracking

By combining biotelemetry and Hg and stable isotope analyses, we studied the seasonal Hg contamination of little auks (Alle alle, the most abundant Arctic seabird) in relation to their distribution and marine foraging habitat, as well as its potential impacts on bird reproduction. We show that little auks were similar to 3.5 times more contaminated when outside the breeding season, and that Hg that accumulated during this nonbreeding non-Arctic period was related to egg size the following season, with females having more Hg laying smaller eggs. Our results highlight that ecotoxicological studies should be expanded to yield a comprehensive understanding of contamination risks and associated threats to top predators over their entire annual cycle.

Here, we review the available literature on insect telemetry using active (battery-powered) radio transmitters and compare this technology to harmonic radar and radio frequency identification (RFID) which use passive tags (i.e. without a battery). The first radio telemetry studies with insects were published in the late 1980s, and subsequent studies have addressed aspects of insect ecology, behaviour and evolution. Most insect telemetry studies have focused on habitat use and movement, including quantification of movement paths, home range sizes, habitat selection, and movement distances. Fewer studies have addressed foraging behaviour, activity patterns, migratory strategies, or evolutionary aspects. The majority of radio telemetry studies have been conducted outside the tropics, usually with beetles (Coleoptera) and crickets (Orthoptera), but bees (Hymenoptera), dobsonflies (Megaloptera), and dragonflies (Odonata) have also been radio-tracked. In contrast to the active transmitters used in radio telemetry, the much lower weight of harmonic radar and RFID tags allows them to be used with a broader range of insect taxa. However, the fixed detection zone of a stationary radar unit (< 1 km diameter) and the restricted detection distance of RFID tags (usually < 1-5 m) constitute major constraints of these technologies compared to radio telemetry. Most of the active transmitters in radio telemetry have been applied to insects with a body mass exceeding 1 g, but smaller species in the range 0.2-0.5 g (e. g. bumblebees and orchid bees) have now also been tracked. Current challenges of radio-tracking insects in the field are related to the constraints of a small transmitter, including short battery life (7-21 days), limited tracking range on the ground (100-500 m), and a transmitter weight that sometimes approaches the weight of a given insect (the ratio of tag mass to body mass varies from 2 to 100%). The attachment of radio transmitters may constrain insect behaviour and incur significant energetic costs, but few studies have addressed this in detail. Future radio telemetry studies should address (i) a larger number of species from different insect families and functional groups, (ii) a better coverage of tropical regions, (iii) intraspecific variability between sexes, ages, castes, and individuals, and (iv) a larger tracking range via aerial surveys with helicopters and aeroplanes equipped with external antennae. Furthermore, field and laboratory studies, including observational and experimental approaches as well as theoretical modelling, could help to clarify the behavioural and energetic consequences of transmitter attachment. Finally, the development of commercially available systems for automated tracking and potential future options of insect telemetry from space will provide exciting new avenues for quantifying movement and space use of insects from local to global spatial scales.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  147     Total Times Cited:  171     Cited Reference Count:  128,10.1111/brv.12065     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),automated telemetry;body size;dispersal;invertebrates;landscape ecology;radio tag;radio tracking;receiver;satellite;BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS HYMENOPTERA;HARMONIC RADAR;FORAGING RANGE;HABITAT USE;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;RADIO TELEMETRY;OSMODERMA-EREMITA;ANABRUS-SIMPLEX;TRACKING SYSTEM;HOMING ABILITY;Telemetry,NA,NA,challenges and prospects in the telemetry of insects

Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed for 6 weeks to 10 mu g L-1 of carbamazepine (CBZ) and gemfibrozil (GEM), two commonly prescribed drugs. Embryos were collected, reared in clean water until sexual maturity and then assessed for reproductive output, courtship, sperm function and organ histology. While 34% of the control pairs produced clutches, only 11% of the fish with CBZ exposed parents or 17% of the fish with GEM exposed parents produced clutches. Reciprocal crosses indicated that exposure in males had more profound reproductive effects. When a control F-1 male was crossed with either a F-1 female whose parents were CBZ or GEM exposed: no differences were observed in embryo production compared to controls. However, when a control F-1 female was crossed with either a CBZ or GEM F-1 male, 50% less embryos were produced. Male courtship was reduced in both CBZ and GEM F-1 fish but the deficits in courtship displays were drug specific. Compared to control males, the sperm from GEM F-1 males had shorter head lengths and midpieces whereas sperm from CBZ F-1 males had longer midpeices. Although it remains unclear how specifically these morphological differences influenced sperm velocity, the sperm from GEM F-1 males and from CBZ F-1 males swam faster than the sperm of control F-1 at 20 s post activation. No significant differences were observed in the histology of the liver, kidney and gonads across treatment groups. These data are important as they show that chronic, low dose pharmaceutical exposure of parental fish is sufficient to cause significant reproductive effects in offspring. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

With improved visual and non-visual assessment tools and increased knowledge of the importance of behavior for organism health and fitness, interest in behavioral analysis has increased in recent years. However, to our knowledge there has never been a quantitative assessment of the available techniques for organismal toxicity testing, so it is not clear whether behavioral studies represent valuable additions to environmental monitoring. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the relative sensitivities and average durations of behavioral studies to those assessing acute lethality, development and reproduction. Results demonstrate that the average duration of behavioral studies is consistently less than developmental or reproductive studies, and that behavioral endpoints are generally more sensitive than those assessing development or reproduction. We found effect sizes to be lower but power to be higher in behavioral and reproductive studies compared to studies assessing development, which likely relates to low sample sizes commonly used in developmental studies. Overall, we conclude that behavioral studies are comparatively fast and sensitive, and therefore warrant further attention as tools for assessing the toxicological effects of environmental contaminants. We suggest that research aimed at developing and optimizing techniques for behavioral analysis could prove extremely useful to the field of toxicology, but that future work must be directed at determining what specific behaviors are most sensitive to various classes of contaminants, and at understanding the relevance of changes to discrete behaviors for influencing organismal and population-level health and fitness.

The rapidly evolving nature of these efforts allows substantial room for the development of novel experimental paradigms suited to this freshwater species. The field of ethorobotics may prove particularly beneficial, due to its ability to convey fully controllable and easily reproducible experimental tools. In this study, we addressed the possibility of using a biologically inspired robot to investigate the emotionally related properties of ethanol in a preference task in zebrafish. To this aim, we evaluated wild-type zebrafish preference toward a robotic stimulus and addressed whether ethanol administration (0.25% and 1.00% ethanol/water concentration) may alter such preferences.

Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models.

Here, we review some examples and present hypotheses on relationships between personality (or behavioural syndromes) and individual differences in cognitive style. Our hypotheses are based largely on a connection between fast-slow behavioural types (BTs; e.g. boldness, aggressiveness, exploration tendency) and cognitive speed-accuracy trade-offs. We also discuss connections between BTs, cognition and ecologically important aspects of decision-making, including sampling, impulsivity, risk sensitivity and choosiness.

The resulting software package is a stand-alone, multiplatform application implemented in Java. Our program employs the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) operator that extracts distinctive features invariant to image scale and rotation. 3. We applied this system to a population of Masai giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) in the Tarangire Ecosystem in northern Tanzania. Over 1200 images were acquired in the field during three primary sampling periods between September 2008 and December 2009. The pattern information in these images was extracted and matched resulting in capture histories for over 600 unique individuals. 4. Estimated error rates of the matching system were low based on a subset of test images that were independently matched by eye. 5.

We determined toxicity parameters of the fungicide trifloxystrobin (TFS) and examined its effects on predation rate, using a fish predator (Synbranchus marmoratus) and four anuran tadpole species as prey (Rhinella arenarum, Physalaemus santafecinus, Leptodactylus latrans, and Elachistocleis bicolor). TFS was not equally toxic to the four tadpole species, E. bicolor being the most sensitive species, followed by P. santafecinus, R. arenarum, and L latrans. Predation rates were evaluated using different treatments that combined predator and prey exposed or not to this fungicide. TFS would alter the outcome of eel-tadpole interaction by reducing prey movements; thus, prey detection would decrease and therefore tadpole survival would increase. In addition, eels preyed selectively upon non-exposed tadpoles avoiding the exposed ones almost all throughout the period evaluated. Predation rate differed among prey species; such differences were not due to TFS exposure, but to interspecific differences in behavior. The mechanism that would explain TFS-induced reduction in predation rates remains unclear; however, what is clear is that sublethal TFS concentrations have the potential to alter prey behavior, thereby indirectly altering predator-prey interactions. In addition, we consider that predator-prey relationships are measurable responses of toxicant exposure and provide ecological insight into how contaminants modify predator-prey interactions.

However, the ecological consequences of such behavioral changes, such as effects on toxicant transfer in foodwebs, are far less well understood, complicated in part by the short-term nature of laboratory experiments and the lack of complementary field studies where the nature of toxicant exposure is more complex. Here we examine whether naturally exposed individuals of the round goby, a benthic, site-loyal fish, move in a manner similar to conspecifics from less contaminated habitats. In the laboratory, round goby from a relatively cleaner site showed greater activity and exploration than goby from two highly contaminated sites. Male fish were more active than females but the site effects were similar in both sexes. In contrast to laboratory findings, a field mark-recapture study of 881 round goby showed that fish from the cleaner site did not move greater distances or exhibit shorter residence times within the site than round goby from highly contaminated sites. Our results indicate that while behavioral changes in the laboratory may be one of several useful diagnostics of toxicant exposure of wild-exposed animals, they do not necessarily translate readily into measurable differences in a natural context. Thus, the potential fitness consequences of toxicant exposure based on behavioral changes need to be assessed carefully.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  58,10.1007/s10646-012-0854-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Locomotion;Activity level;Lake Ontario;Mark-recapture;Behavioral ecotoxicology;SWIMMING BEHAVIOR;LAKE-ERIE;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS;FUNDULUS-HETEROCLITUS;TROPHIC TRANSFER;HAMILTON HARBOR;EXPOSURE;GROWTH;IMPACT;FISH;Biological Markers,NA,NA,behavior as biomarker laboratory versus field movement in round goby neogobius melanostomus from highly contaminated habitats

There is an extensive literature on laboratory behavioral assays, with many chemicals impairing feeding or predator avoidance. However, there is not extensive work on fishes that live in contaminated environments. Therefore, we then review our recent research on feeding and trophic relations of populations from contaminated estuaries compared with relatively unpolluted sites. The mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, is a non-migratory fish; those from more contaminated areas are poor predators and slower to capture active prey (grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio). In the field, they consume much detritus and sediment, which is not nutritious. They are less active than fish from cleaner sites and more vulnerable to predation. They have altered thyroid glands and neurotransmitter levels, which may underlie altered behaviors. Fish from the reference site kept in tanks with sediment and food from the polluted site showed bioaccumulation and reduced prey capture after two months, although fish from the polluted site did not show significant improvement when maintained in a clean environment. Poor nutrition and predator avoidance may be responsible for their being smaller and having a shorter life span than reference fish. Bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix, are a marine species in which the young-of-the-year spend their first summer in estuaries. We found bioaccumulation of contaminants and reduced activity, schooling, and feeding in young-of-the-year bluefish from a relatively unpolluted site that were fed prey fish from a contaminated site. They also had altered thyroid glands and neurotransmitter levels. Many field-caught specimens had empty stomachs, which is rare in this species. In the fall, when they migrate back out to the ocean, they are smaller, slower, and more likely to starve or to be eaten than those that spent their summer in cleaner estuaries [Current Zoology 58 (1): 9-20, 2012].",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  60     Total Times Cited:  73     Cited Reference Count:  78,10.1093/czoolo/58.1.9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Predator;Feeding;Prey;Pollution;Activity;Trophic;MUMMICHOGS FUNDULUS-HETEROCLITUS;MINNOWS PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS;THE-YEAR BLUEFISH;TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS;PREY CAPTURE ABILITY;ZEBRAFISH DANIO-RERIO;FATHEAD MINNOWS;POMATOMUS-SALTATRIX;FEEDING-BEHAVIOR;RAINBOW-TROUT;Prednisolone,NA,NA,pollutants and fish predatorprey behavior a review of laboratory and field approaches

Both killifish and bluefish have altered thy mid glands and neurotransmitters, which may underlie behavioral changes. Shrimp in contaminated environments show unchanged levels of predator avoidance; compensatory energetic partitioning favors growth and reproduction despite reduced feeding. With less predation pressure, shrimp are larger and more numerous. Fiddler crabs tend to spend more time in burrows and experience reduced predation. With ample food, metal depuration through molting, and reduced population size, they grow larger. In contaminated estuaries, we've found that juvenile blue crabs are less likely to be eaten by adults; adults are impaired in prey capture but are larger, despite eating much detritus and algae.

Our goal is to provide insights into explaining such variation. We first summarize the responses of some species to novel situations, including novel risks and resources, habitat loss/fragmentation, pollutants and climate change. Using a sensory ecology approach, we present a mechanistic framework for predicting variation in behavioural responses to environmental change, drawing from models of decision-making processes and an understanding of the selective background against which they evolved. Where immediate behavioural responses are inadequate, learning or evolutionary adaptation may prove useful, although these mechanisms are also constrained by evolutionary history.

In this paper, we propose that consistent behavioural differences among individuals, or personality, covary with life history and physiological differences at the within-population, interpopulation and interspecific levels.

Such effects should affect individuals and, in turn, alter interspecific interactions. We sought to determine how sublethal concentrations (0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) of two common pesticides (carbaryl and malathion) affected predator and prey behavior as well as subsequent predation rates. We conducted a series of experiments using three species of larval amphibians (Gray Treefrogs, Hyla versicolor; Green Frogs, Rana clamitans; and American Bullfrogs, R. catesbeiana) and three species of their predators (larval dragonflies, Anax Junius; adult water bugs, Belostoma flumineum; and adult Red-spotted Newts, Notophthalmus viridescens). We found that the pesticides frequently reduced the activity of all three tadpole species. For the two invertebrate predators (Anax and Belostoma), the pesticides were lethal, precluding us from examining sublethal effects on predator-prey interactions. However, newt survival was high and the addition of the pesticides reduced the predation rates of newts in one of the three tadpole species. There were no effects of the pesticides on the striking frequency of the newts or on their prey capture efficiency. Thus, the mechanism underlying the pesticide-induced reduction in predation rates remains unclear. What is clear is that sublethal concentrations of pesticides have the potential to alter prey behavior and species interactions and thereby alter the composition of ecological communities.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  62     Total Times Cited:  78     Cited Reference Count:  69,10.1643/CE-09-027     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),AMPHIBIAN POPULATION DECLINES;NEVADA MOUNTAIN-RANGE;SWIMMING PERFORMANCE;UV-B;TADPOLES;CALIFORNIA;MALATHION;INSECTICIDE;CARBARYL;GROWTH;Pesticides;Prednisolone,NA,NA,what doesnt kill you makes you sluggish how sublethal pesticides alter predatorprey interactions

It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability.

New approaches in biological and computational sciences may be able to generate mechanistic information that could help in meeting these challenges. However, to use mechanistic data to support chemical assessments, there is a need for effective translation of this information into endpoints meaningful to ecological risk-effects on survival, development, and reproduction in individual organisms and, by extension, impacts on populations. Here we discuss a framework designed for this purpose, the adverse outcome pathway (AOP). An AOP is a conceptual construct that portrays existing knowledge concerning the linkage between a direct molecular initiating event and an adverse outcome at a biological level of organization relevant to risk assessment. The practical utility of AOPs for ecological risk assessment of chemicals is illustrated using five case examples. The examples demonstrate how the AOP concept can focus toxicity testing in terms of species and endpoint selection, enhance across-chemical extrapolation, and support prediction of mixture effects. The examples also show how AOPs facilitate use of molecular or biochemical endpoints (sometimes referred to as biomarkers) for forecasting chemical impacts on individuals and populations. In the concluding sections of the paper, we discuss how AOPs can help to guide research that supports chemical risk assessments and advocate for the incorporation of this approach into a broader systems biology framework.

Personality will introduce variability in resting MR measures because individuals consistently differ in their stress response, exploration or activity levels, all of which influence MR measurements made with respirometry and the doubly-labelled water technique. Physiologists try to exclude these behavioural influences from resting MR measurements, but animal personality research indicates that these attempts are unlikely to be successful. For example, because reactive animals ""freeze"" when submitted to a stress, their MR could be classified as ""resting"" because of immobility when in fact they are highly stressed with an elevated MR. More importantly, recent research demonstrating that behavioural responses to novel and highly artificial stimuli are correlated with both behaviour and fitness under more natural circumstances calls into question the wisdom of excluding these behavioural influences on MR measurements. The reason that intra-specific variation in resting MR are so weakly correlated with daily energy expenditure (DEE) and fitness, may be that the latter two measures fully incorporate personality while the former partially excludes its influence. Because activity, exploration, boldness and aggressiveness are energetically costly, personality and metabolism should be correlated and physiological constraints may underlie behavioural syndromes. We show how physiological ecologists can better examine behavioural linkages between personality and metabolism, as required to better understand the physiological correlates of personality and the evolutionary consequences of metabolic variability.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  615     Total Times Cited:  687     Cited Reference Count:  114,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16513.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),JUVENILE ATLANTIC SALMON;DOUBLY LABELED WATER;TITS PARUS-MAJOR;INDIVIDUAL VARIATION;GREAT TITS;BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES;LABORATORY MICE;LIFE-HISTORY;EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR;GENETIC CORRELATIONS;Energy Metabolism;Animals;Animal Shells,NA,NA,energy metabolism and animal personality

Such recognition mechanisms are vulnerable to disruption by the presence of anthropogenic contaminants in the aquatic environment. Here we show that acute exposure to low, environmentally relevant dosages of the ubiquitous contaminant, 4-nonylphenol, can seriously affect social recognition and ultimately social organization in fishes.

This common phenomenon covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study of temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics, pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of the link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence in terminology with similar traits often given different names, or different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament can and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework and provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five major temperament trait categories: shyness-boldness, exploration-avoidance, activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not make inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological processes, which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary biologists from working on these traits. We present extensive literature reviews that demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and linked to fitness and to several other traits of importance to ecology and evolution. Furthermore, we describe ecologically relevant measurement methods and point to several ecological and evolutionary topics that would benefit from considering temperament, such as phenotypic plasticity, conservation biology, population sampling, and invasion biology.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2391     Total Times Cited:  2690     Cited Reference Count:  229,10.1111/j.1469-185X.2007.00010.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),temperament;personality;individual differences;behavioural syndromes;coping styles;context-specificity;shyness-boldness;exploration;aggressiveness;sociability;CONSISTENT INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;CSF 5-HIAA CONCENTRATION;MACAQUES MACACA-MULATTA;MALE RHESUS MACAQUES;TROUT SALMO-TRUTTA;BEHAVIORAL-DIFFERENCES;EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR;REALIZED HERITABILITY;AVIAN PERSONALITIES;TONIC IMMOBILITY;Animal Shells;Animals;Temperament,NA,NA,integrating animal temperament within ecology and evolution

We focused on the combined effects of food limitation, drying conditions, and exposure to possibly the most abundant and widely used herbicide in the world, atrazine. We used a factorial design to evaluate the effects of exposure to four ecologically relevant doses of atrazine (approximate measured doses: 0, 4, 40, and 400 mug/L), two food levels (limited and unlimited food), and two hydroperiods (presence or absence of a dry down) on the survival, life history, and behavior of the streamside salamander, Ambystoma barbouri, from the embryo stage through metamorphosis. In general, food and atrazine levels did not interact statistically, and atrazine affected dependent variables in a standard, dose-dependent manner. Exposure to 400 mug/L of atrazine decreased embryo survival and increased time to hatching. Drying conditions and food limitation decreased larval survival, while 400 mug/L of atrazine only reduced larval survival in one of the two years tested, Suggesting that the lethality of atrazine may be condition dependent. Sublethal effects included elevated activity and reduced shelter use associated with increasing concentrations of atrazine and food limitation. The larval period was lengthened by food limitation and shortened by 400 mug/L of atrazine. Drying conditions accelerated metamorphosis for larvae exposed to 0 and 4 mug/L of atrazine but did not affect timing of metamorphosis for larvae exposed to 40 or 400 mug/L of atrazine. Food limitation, drying conditions, and 400 mug/L of atrazine reduced size at metamorphosis without affecting body condition (relationship between mass and length), even though feeding rates did not differ significantly among atrazine concentrations at any time during development. This suggests that high atrazine levels may have increased larval energy expenditures. Because smaller size at metamorphosis can lower terrestrial survival and lifetime reproduction, resource limitations, drying conditions, and environmentally realistic concentrations of atrazine have the potential to contribute to amphibian declines in impacted systems.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  104     Total Times Cited:  130     Cited Reference Count:  58,10.1890/03-5087     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ambystoma barbouri;amphibian decline;atrazine;behavior;embryos;larvae;life history;metamorphosis;ontogeny;survival;AMBYSTOMA-BARBOURI;AMPHIBIAN POPULATIONS;STREAMSIDE SALAMANDER;ANURAN AMPHIBIANS;RANA-SYLVATICA;UNITED-STATES;DAPHNIA-MAGNA;ATRAZINE;METAMORPHOSIS;GROWTH,NA,NA,multiple stressors and salamanders effects of an herbicide food limitation and hydroperiod

An example is an aggression syndrome where some individuals are more aggressive, whereas others are less aggressive across a range of situations and contexts. The existence of behavioral syndromes focuses the attention of behavioral ecologists on limited (less than optimal) behavioral plasticity and behavioral carryovers across situations, rather than on optimal plasticity in each isolated situation. Behavioral syndromes can explain behaviors that appear strikingly non-adaptive in an isolated context (e.g. inappropriately high activity when predators are present, or excessive sexual cannibalism). Behavioral syndromes can also help to explain the maintenance of individual variation in behavioral types, a phenomenon that is ubiquitous, but often ignored. Recent studies suggest that the behavioral type of an individual, population or species can have important ecological and evolutionary implications, including major effects on species distributions, on the relative tendencies of species to be invasive or to respond well to environmental change, and on speciation rates.

Past research has found that the globally common pesticide carbaryl can become more lethal under different environmental conditions including differences in temperature and competition. A recent study has found, that predatory stress, a situation common for most amphibians, can make carbaryl 2-4 times more deadly to gray tree frogs (Hyla versicolor). To determine whether this is a general phenomenon in amphibians, I examined how carbaryl affected the survival of six amphibian species in the presence and absence of predatory stress. Higher concentrations of carbaryl caused higher mortality. In two of the six species, carbaryl became even more lethal when combined with predatory stress (up to 46 times more lethal).

Calculations are performed on a series of frames to derive a set of quantitative descriptors of the animal's movement. EthoVision (from Noldus Information Technology) is a specific example of such a system, and its functionality that is particularly relevant to transgenic mice studies is described. Key practical aspects of using the EthoVision system are also outlined, including tips about lighting, marking animals, the arena size, and sample rate. Four case studies are presented, illustrating various aspects of the system: (1) The effects of disabling the Munc 18-1 gene were clearly shown using the straightforward measure of how long the mice took to enter a zone in an open field. (2) Differences in exploratory behavior between short and long attack latency mice strains were quantified by measuring the time spent in inner and outer zones of an open field. (3) Mice with hypomorphic CREB alleles were shown to perform less well in a water maze, but this was only clear when a range of different variables were calculated from their tracks. (4) Mice with the trkB receptor knocked out in the forebrain also performed poorly in a water maze, and it was immediately apparent from examining plots of the tracks that this was due to thigmotaxis.

Initial studies were conducted to determine the effect of soil moisture and depth oil the rate of larval movement. Movement of 2-d-old larvae in sandy soil was not affected by soil moisture ranging from 2 to 12%, but they did not penetrate soil with < 1% moisture. Movement of 2-d-old larvae was retarded as moisture and soil depth increased.

Settlement size larvae (7 turn total length) were given an acute exposure of atrazine at 0, 40, and 80 mu g l(-1) for 4 days. Tests of 96 h survival confirmed that these naturally occurring concentrations were sublethal for red drum larvae. Growth, routine swimming, antipredator responses to artificial and actual predators, and resting respiration rate were monitored I and 3 days after onset of exposure. Atrazine exposure significantly reduced growth rate. Atrazine-exposed larvae also exhibited significantly higher routine swimming speeds, swam in more convoluted paths, and were hyperactive. Responses to artificial and actual predators were not affected by atrazine exposure nor were resting respiration rates. The higher rate of travel (86% higher in atrazine-treated larvae) resulted in higher predicted encounter rates with prey (up to 71%) and slow moving predators (up to 63%). However, hyperactivity and faster active swimming speeds of exposed larvae indicated that naturally occurring sublethal levels of atrazine will result in an elevated rate of energy utilization (doubling the total metabolic rate), which is likely to increase the risk of death by starvation. Moreover, atrazine effects on growth will prolong the larval period, which could reduce the juvenile population by as much as 24%.

In this context, behavioral endpoints have proved their usefulness in evidencing impacts of such chemicals at environmental concentrations that do not necessarily cause mortality. The recent development of video-tracking technologies now offers the possibility of accurately quantifying locomotor behaviors. However, these techniques have not yet been applied to evaluating the toxicity of pesticides in amphibians. We therefore aimed at determining the potential toxicity of endosulfan on endpoints associated with locomotion after short-term environmental endosulfan exposure in Rana temporaria tadpoles and at using these data as warning systems for survival alterations after a longer exposure. To this end, we analyzed video-tracks of 64 tadpoles (two pesticide treatments: Sand 50 mu g L-1, one control and one solvent-control) with Ethovision XT 7 software. The highest endosulfan concentration had a significant effect on all four behavioral endpoints. Contaminated tadpoles traveled shorter distances, swam less often, at a lower mean speed, and occupied a less peripherical position than control tadpoles. The lowest endosulfan concentration had similar but lower effects, and did not affect mean speed during swimming. Survival was reduced only after a long-term exposure to endosulfan and was associated with short-term behavioral dysfunctions. These results show that endosulfan strongly affects the behavioral repertory of amphibian tadpoles, but in different ways depending on concentration, thus suggesting that the pesticide has complex modes of action. Given the importance of locomotion and space use in tadpole success in their aquatic environment, these results confirm the toxic action of endosulfan. By highlighting effects before mortality markers, video-tracking systems also show their potential as sentinels of sublethal effects of pesticides. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we aimed at showing that these behavioral endpoints could be differently affected across time and concentrations, and be biomarkers of toxicity. To this end, we tested the effects of an organochlorine pesticide (endosulfan) on amphibians during a standard 96 h test. We evaluated possible lag effects in continuing the analyses after removal of the pesticide. The study was based on 240 tadpoles (4 pesticide treatments: 0.4, 3, 22, and 282 mu g/l, 1 control and 1 solvent-control). Abnormal behaviors such as lying and swirling rapidly were exhibited only in the presence of the pesticide. Essential functions such as breathing and feeding were deeply affected by the pesticide: contaminated tadpoles breathed and fed less than control tadpoles. They also moved less and occupied a more central position in the aquariums in the presence of the pesticide. A higher mortality was only found at the highest concentration. These results suggest that endosulfan is toxic to amphibians at environmental concentrations. Behavioral markers showed potential as early warning systems.

In a bioassay, sea bass juveniles were individually exposed to different doses of carbofuran (31, 63, 125 and 250 mu g/L) for 96 h. At the end of the bioassay, the swimming performance and 11 biomarkers were determined. Biomarkers were: hepatosomatic index (HSI), lipid peroxidation (LPO), reduced glutathione and the activities of the enzymes ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferases, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and muscle cholinesterases (ChE). After 96 h of exposure, carbofuran induced a decrease of the swimming velocity and inhibition of EROD activity at all concentrations tested, and inhibition of muscle ChE and brain AChE activities at 250 mu g/L. No relevant alterations in any of the other tested parameters were found. These results show that carbofuran induced adverse effects on fish by interfering with neurofunction, capability of detoxication and swimming velocity. In addition, positive and significant correlations between the swimming velocity and (i) brain AChE activity, (ii) muscle ChE activity and (iii) EROD activity suggest that the inhibition of these enzymes may somehow be related to the behavioural changes observed. Since these functions are determinant for the survival and performance of the fish in the wild, the findings of the present study suggest that adverse effects may occur in populations exposed to carbofuran if a sufficient number of animals is affected.

Recently, extensive research has been conducted on the toxicity of BF in in vitro and in vivo assays. However, no data is so far available regarding the developmental toxicity of BF to fish in early life stages. In this study, the developmental effects of BF were evaluated in embryo-larval zebrafish. At specified stages (24, 48, 72, and 96 hpf), spontaneous movement, survival and hatching as well as non-lethal malformation like curved body axis or edema were described in detail. No significant lethal effects of the treatment group compared to the control occurred except for the highest concentration group exposed for 96 h. The hatching process was accelerated by BF in a concentration-dependent way, correlated with increasing spontaneous movement. Developmental abnormalities were observed for the test compound with 96-h EC50 of 256 mu g L-1 for pericardial edema, and 109 mu g L-1 for curved body axis. Results from locomotor assays showed that zebrafish larvae of 96 hpf exhibited impaired swimming behaviour after exposure to 50, 100, and 200 mu g L-1 from 3 to 84 hpf. After being cultured in the BF-free embryo medium for one more day till 120 hpf, larvae from the 50 mu g L-1 group seemed to have recovered and showed no difference in the swimming behaviour compared to the control while animals of the two higher concentration groups were exhausted and swam in significantly lower speed. Furthermore, reverse transcription real-time PCR results showed that vitellogenin I expressions were significantly induced in larval zebrafish exposed to 150 mu g L-1 BF for 72 h, indicating the disruption of the endocrine level. In summary, our studies showed that BF was developmentally toxic to zebrafish in early life stage after short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations and had the ability to impair the individual behaviours which are of great importance in the assessment of their ecological fitness.

This study examined the toxicity targets of CPF in early life stage of zebrafish on the endpoints at developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress and immunotoxicity. Firstly, CPF exposure decreased the body length, inhibited the hatchability and heart rate, and resulted in a number of morphological abnormalities, primarily spinal deformities (SD) and pericardial edema (PE), in larval zebrafish. Secondly, the free swimming activities and the swimming behaviors of the larvae in response to the stimulation of light-to-dark photoperiod transition were significantly influenced by the exposure to 100 and 300 mu g/L CPF. In addition, the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the transcription of some genes related to neurotoxicity were also influenced by CPF exposure. Thirdly, CPF exposure induced oxidative stress in the larval zebrafish. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased and the glutathione (GSH) contents decreased significantly in a concentration-dependent manner after the exposure to CPF for 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). CPF affected not only the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), but also the transcriptional levels of their respective genes. Finally, the mRNA levels of the main cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf alpha), interferon (Ifn), interleukin-1 beta (Il-1 beta), interleukin 6 (116), complement factor 4 (C4) in the larvae increased significantly after the exposure to 100 or 300 mu g/L CPF for 96 hpf, suggesting that the innate immune system disturbed by CPF in larvae.

Moreover, tadpoles exposed to these concentrations exhibited several abnormalities in swimming patterns, such as shorter distance moved, swirling, resting, and unusual use of space. The exposure to 0.005 mg endosulfan/L did not cause any significant effects on behaviour, larval growth, or development, but we observed a significant decrease in both survival and time to metamorphosis. We showed that developmental abnormalities are dose-dependent and that the pesticide effects could differ depending on the endosulfan concentration and the species tested. We also validated the hypothesis that behavioural analysis, along with the use of new analytical methods, could be a useful tool in amphibian ecotoxicological studies.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  25     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.1007/s00244-012-9819-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),INSECTICIDE ENDOSULFAN;PESTICIDE EXPOSURE;VIDEO TRACKING;ACUTE TOXICITY;LIFE STAGES;AMPHIBIANS;SURVIVAL;SIZE;SUSCEPTIBILITY;METAMORPHOSIS;Endosulfan,NA,NA,endosulfan effects on <i>rana dalmatina<i> tadpoles quantitative developmental and behavioural analysis

Focus was given to the soil-water transfer pathways (leaching and runoff), to the pesticide transport in soil between pesticide application (crop row) and non-application areas (between crop rows), as well as to toxic effects of the various matrices on terrestrial and aquatic biota. A semi-field methodology mimicking a ""worst-case"" ethoprophos application (twice the recommended dosage for maize and potato crops: 100% concentration v/v) in agricultural field situations was used, in order to mimic a possible misuse by the farmer under realistic conditions. A rainfall was simulated under a slope of 20 for both crop-based scenarios. Soil and water samples were collected for the analysis of pesticide residues. Ecotoxicity of soil and aquatic samples was assessed by performing lethal and sublethal bioassays with organisms from different trophic levels: the collembolan Folsomia candida, the earthworm Eisenia andrei and the cladoceran Daphnia magna. Although the majority of ethoprophos sorbed to the soil application area, pesticide concentrations were detected in all water matrices illustrating pesticide transfer pathways of water contamination between environmental compartments. Leaching to groundwater proved to be an important transfer pathway of ethoprophos under both crop-based scenarios, as it resulted in high pesticide concentration in leachates from Maize (130 mu g L-1) and Potato (630 mu g L-1) crop scenarios, respectively. Ethoprophos application at the Potato crop scenario caused more toxic effects on terrestrial and aquatic biota than at the Maize scenario at the recommended dosage and lower concentrations. In both cropbased scenarios, ethoprophos moved with the irrigation water flow to the soil between the crop rows where no pesticide was applied, causing toxic effects on terrestrial organisms. The two simulated agricultural cropbased scenarios had the merit to illustrate the importance of transfer pathways of pesticides from soil to groundwater through leaching and from crop rows to the surrounding soil areas in a soil-water interface environment, which is representative for irrigated agricultural crops under Mediterranean conditions.

We examined the effects of the insecticide malathion, larger tadpole competitors (green frogs, Rana clamitans), and a toxic cyanobacteria (Anabaena spp.) on tadpoles of Cope's gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) reared from hatching through metamorphosis in outdoor mesocosms. The response of mass at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis was significantly affected by exposure to malathion and presence of overwintered green frog tadpoles. Malathion generally led to increased mass at metamorphosis, earlier time to metamorphosis, and increased activity during larval development. These results likely stem from short-term increases in periphyton associated with malathion exposure (although these effects were nonsignificant). Exposure of gray treefrogs to overwintered green frog tadpoles led to an earlier time to metamorphosis without differences in mass at metamorphosis and was associated with increased activity in gray treefrogs. Survival of gray treefrogs was significantly affected by an interaction of green frog and malathion, indicating nonadditive effects of these treatments. Exposure to cyanobacteria had a significant negative effect on green frogs but no effect on treefrogs.

In a first bioassay, mortality was investigated in prawns exposed during 96 h to concentrations of fenitrothion ranging from 39 to 40000 ng L-1. The effects on swimming velocity and biomarkers were determined in prawns exposed to the sub-lethal concentrations of fenitrothion (from 39 to 625 ng L-1). A specific newly bioassay was developed to assess the capability of prawns to avoid the toxicant (avoidance test). Finally, in order to determine the effects on biomarkers during the avoidance test, prawns were collected at different times of exposure (30, 60, 90 and 120 min). Results showed that prawns exposed to the sub-lethal concentrations of fenitrothion exhibited a significant inhibition of swimming velocity with a LOEC of 313 ng L-1. A significant inhibition of both eye AChE (LOEC = 78 ng L-1) and muscle ChE (LOEC = 156 ng L-1) activities were also observed. Results from the avoidance test indicated that animals significantly avoided fenitrothion (78 ng L-1). However, this capability was not observed in prawns exposed to 156 ng L-1 fenitrothion. Prawns exposed to fenitrothion showed alterations in enzymes involved in the production of energy (LDH and IDH) possibly in an attempt to cope with additional energetic demands. Impairment of locomotion and avoidance may lead to alterations at the population level. Thus, the present behavioral tests can be useful as ecologically relevant tools for ecological risk assessment.

Development of CWQG is based on review of chromium's properties, uses, fate in the environment, ambient levels, accumulation in biota, and toxicity. Chromium's principal uses and entry into the environment include electroplating, production of paints and pigments, tanning, wood preservation, chromium chemicals production, metal smelting, and pulp and paper production. Concentrations of chromium in Canada range between 1 and 545,000 ng.m(-3) in air, 0.001 and 0.165 mg.L-1 in water, nondetectable and 31,000 mg.kg(-1) in sediments, 10 and 5000 mg.kg(-1) in soils, 0.006 and 18 mg.kg(-1) in plants, and 0.03 and 1.6 mg.kg(-1) in animals. In nature, trivalent chromium sorbs to various ligands and forms insoluble entities becoming unavailable for uptake by biota. Hexavalent chromium forms many soluble salts that can enter body membranes and induce a toxic response. Estimates of toxicity of hexavalent chromium to aquatic life range from 0.0006 mg.L-1 (reduction in algal growth) to 1000 mg.L-1 (decrease in rest time of Chironomus tentans). For trivalent chromium the toxicity ranges from 0.002 mg.L-1 (reduction in filtering rate of Perna perna) to 937 mg.L-1 (48-h LCS50 of Asellus aquaticus). Plants are affected by the concentrations of hexavalent chromium ranging from 0.16 mg.L-1 (growth reduction in lettuce) to 75 mg.L-1 (no effects in sweet orange). For trivalent chromium the toxicity ranges between 0.104 mg.L-1 (reduction in root growth of oats) and 50 mg.L-1 (stunted growth of corn and tomato). Terrestrial animals such as the beagle dog can be affected by concentrations exceeding 62.7 mg.L-1 (CrVI). Mice can tolerate 100 mg.L-1 of hexavalent chromium. Trivalent chromium has adverse effects on rats and mice at 28.0 mg.L-1. For freshwater life, guidelines of 0.001 (Cr VI; full) and 0.008 (Cr III; interim) mg.L-1 are recommended. For marine life, guidelines of 0.001 (Cr VI; draft) and 0.05 (Cr III; interim) mg.L-1 are recommended. Irrigation guidelines are set at 0.008 (Cr VI) and 0.005 (Cr III).

Following application, endosulfan can get to watercourses through surface runoff from agricultural fields and disturb the non-target aquatic animals including freshwater fish species. Given that the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the most recurrently used biomarkers of exposure to pesticides and there are controversial results concerning the effects of endosulfan exposure and AChE activity in fish, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of endosulfan in brain AChE activity and its gene expression pattern using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an animal model. Moreover, we have analyzed the effects of endosulfan exposure in different parameters of zebrafish swimming activity and in long-term memory formation. After 96 h of exposition, fish in the 2.4 mu g endosulfan/L group presented a significant decrease in AChE activity (9.44 +/- 1.038 mu mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1): p = 0.0205) when compared to the control group (15.87 +/- 1.768 mu mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1); p = 0.0205) which corresponds to approximately 40%. The down-regulation of brain AChE activity is not directly related with the transcriptional control as demonstrated by the RT-qPCR analysis. Our results reinforce AChE activity inhibition as a pathway of endosulfan-induced toxicity in brain of fish species. In addition, exposure to 2.4 mu g endosulfan/L during 96 h impaired all exploratory parameters evaluated: decreased line crossings (approximate to 21%, 273.7 +/- 28.12 number of line crossings compared to the control group 344.6 +/- 21.30, p = 0.0483), traveled distance (approximate to 20%, 23.44 +/- 2.127 m compared to the control group 29.39 +/- 1.585, p = 0.0281), mean speed (approximate to 25%, 0.03 +/- 0.003 m/s compared to the control group 0.04 +/- 0.002, p = 0.0275) and body turn angle (approximate to 21%, 69.940 +/- 4871 absolute turn angle compared to the control group 88.010 +/- 4560, p = 0.0114). These results suggest that endosulfan exposure significantly impairs animals' exploratory performance, and potentially compromises their ecological and interspecific interaction. Our results also showed that the same endosulfan exposure did not compromise animals' performance in the inhibitory avoidance apparatus. These findings provide further evidence of the deleterious effects of endosulfan exposure in the nervous system. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The bioaccumulation values indicated that the accumulation of chlorpyrifos was maximum in viscera followed by head and body.

From these experiments, one can estimate the concentration that causes no effect on survival. However, organisms in nature frequently experience multiple applications of pesticides over time rather than a single constant concentration. In addition, organisms are embedded in ecological communities that can propagate indirect effects through a food web. Using outdoor mesocosms, we examined how low concentrations (10-250 mu g/L) of a globally common insecticide (malathion) applied at various amounts, times, and frequencies affected aquatic communities containing zooplankton, phytoplankton, periphyton, and larval amphibians (reared at two densities) for 79 days. All application regimes caused a decline in zooplankton, which initiated a trophic cascade in which there was a bloom in phytoplankton and, in several treatments, a subsequent decline in the competing periphyton. The reduced periphyton had little effect on wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), which have a short time to metamorphosis. However, leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) have a longer time to metamorphosis, and they experienced large reductions in growth and development, which led to subsequent mortality as the environment dried. Hence, malathion (which rapidly breaks down) did not directly kill amphibians, but initiated a trophic cascade that indirectly resulted in substantial amphibian mortality. Importantly, repeated applications of the lowest concentration (a ""press treatment'' consisting of seven weekly applications of 10 mu g/L) caused larger impacts on many of the response variables than single ""pulse'' applications that were 25 times as great in concentration. These results are not only important because malathion is the most commonly applied insecticide and is found in wetlands, but also because the mechanism underlying the trophic cascade is common to a wide range of insecticides, offering the possibility of general predictions for the way in which many insecticides impact aquatic communities and the populations of larval amphibians.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  136     Total Times Cited:  171     Cited Reference Count:  77,10.1890/08-0454.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acetylcholine esterase inhibitor;amphibian decline;ecotoxicology;leopard frog (Rana pipiens);pesticide pulse;wood frog (Rana sylvatica);AMPHIBIAN POPULATION DECLINES;NEVADA MOUNTAIN-RANGE;LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS;POND MICROCOSMS;UV-B;ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES;PYRETHROID INSECTICIDE;AMBYSTOMA-TALPOIDEUM;ALGAL COMMUNITIES;WOOD FROG;Pesticides,NA,NA,an unforeseen chain of events lethal effects of pesticides on frogs at sublethal concentrations

These pesticides are harmful and potentially deadly if ingested or inhaled in large quantities by causing a significant reduction in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the central and peripheral nervous system. However, much less is known about the effects of exposure to small quantities of the pesticides on neural systems and behavior during development. In the current study we used zebrafish larvae in order to determine the effects of two of the most widely used organophosphates, chlorpyrifos and malathion, on zebrafish behavior and AChE activity. Embryos and larvae were exposed to the organophosphates during different time points in development and then tested at 5 days post-fertilization for behavioral, neurodevelopmental and AChE abnormalities. The results of the study indicate that chlorpyrifos and malathion cause opposing behaviors in the larvae such as swim speed (hypoactivity vs. hyperactivity) and rest. Additionally, the pesticides affect only certain behaviors, such as thigmotaxis, during specific time points in development that are unrelated to changes in AChE activity. Larvae treated with malathion but not chlorpyrifos also had significantly smaller forebrain and hindbrain regions compared to controls by 5 days postfertilization. We conclude that exposure to very low concentrations of organophosphate pesticides during development cause abnormalities in behavior and brain size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although several genetic risk factors have been identified in recent years, little is known about the environmental factors that either cause neurobehavioral disorders or contribute to their progression in genetically predisposed individuals. One environmental factor that has raised concerns is chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide that is widely used in agriculture and is found ubiquitously in the environment. In the present study, we examined the effects of sub-chronic chlorpyrifos exposure on anxiety-related behavior during development using zebrafish larvae. We found that sub-chronic exposure to 0.01 or 0.1 mu M chlorpyrifos during development induces specific behavioral defects in 7-day-old zebrafish larvae. The larvae displayed decreases in swim speed and thigmotaxis, yet no changes in avoidance behavior were seen. Exposure to 0.001 mu M chlorpyrifos did not affect swimming, thigmotaxis, or avoidance behavior and exposure to 1 mu M chlorpyrifos induced behavioral defects, but also induced defects in larval morphology. Since thigmotaxis, a preference for the edge, is an anxiety-related behavior in zebrafish larvae, we propose that sub-chronic chlorpyrifos exposure interferes with the development of anxiety-related behaviors. The results of this study provide a good starting point for examination of the molecular, cellular, developmental, and neural mechanisms that are affected by environmentally relevant concentrations of organophosphate pesticides. A more detailed understanding of these mechanisms is important for the development of predictive models and refined health policies to prevent toxicant-induced neurobehavioral disorders.

This is particularly true for exposures that reflect the typical range of pesticide concentrations in the aquatic environment. To directly compare the effects of chlorpyrifos on AChE activity and salmon behavior, we exposed juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kistitch) to chlorpyrifos (0-2.5 mug/L) for 96 h. A computer-assisted, three-dimensional video imaging system was used to measure spontaneous swimming and feeding behaviors in control and chlorpyrifos-exposed fish. After the behavioral trials, brain and muscle tissues were collected and analyzed for AChE activity. Chlorpyrifos inhibited tissue AChE activity and all behaviors in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, brain AChE inhibition and reductions in spontaneous swimming and feeding activity were significantly correlated. Benchmark concentrations for sublethal neurotoxicity (statistical departure values) were <0.5 mug/L and were similar for both neurochemical and behavioral endpoints.

Exposure from agricultural sources is largely short-term in nature and edge-of-field runoff appears to be a rather important source of entry for both aqueous-phase and particle-associated compounds. Concentrations of pyrethroids detected vary between a few nanograms in water up to several hundred micrograms in sediments or suspended particles. Three case studies on pyrethroid effects are included. Interspecific (predation) and intraspecific (cannibalism) interactions increased the susceptibility of model communities to pulse exposure with fenvalerate in artificial stream microcosms. Another stream microcosm study with cypermethrin that simulated agricultural runoff conditions with elevated turbidity levels indicated the importance of reduced bioavailability under field conditions in which there is naturally more suspended and dissolved material than in controlled laboratory studies. This study also suggested the behavioural reactions of mayfly nymphs as important, i.e. nymphs exposed to higher flow rates reduced their pyrethroid exposure by a flow avoidance behaviour. A third study used in situ bioassays with the amphipod species Gammarus pulex in a stream system receiving transient fenvalerate runoff. Here, an avoidance reaction was evident in that the amphipods actively migrated from a site contaminated with fenvalerate into an uncontaminated tributary during the runoff event. Hence, under field conditions, avoidance reactions of mobile non-target organisms appear to be a relevant process which, if not considered, may lead to overestimation of real-world toxicity e.g. in in situ studies while there may be no manifest responses at the in-stream population level. Due to the relatively low water solubility of pyrethroids, in stream mitigation measures using aquatic plants such as vegetated ditches or constructed wetlands appear to be a valuable management tool. A case study is presented below, which demonstrates that 300-m stretches of vegetated ditches effectively mitigated concentrations of 666 mu g/L bifenthrin or 375 mu g/L lambda-cyhalothrin experimentally-added to simulate a storm runoff event. It may be concluded, that by incorporating vegetated drainage ditches or constructed wetlands into a watershed management program for pyrethroids, that agriculture can continue to decrease the potential impact of nonpoint-sources to downstream aquatic receiving systems.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  119,,PARTICLE-ASSOCIATED FENVALERATE;INSECTICIDE LAMBDA-CYHALOTHRIN;IN-SITU BIOASSAYS;GAMMARUS-PULEX L;AQUATIC ORGANISMS;TOXICITY TESTS;MONITORING PESTICIDES;CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS;RUNOFF SIMULATION;AQUEOUS-PHASE,NA,NA,synthetic pyrethroids in agricultural surface waters exposure effects and risk mitigation

We used four environmentally realistic levels (1, 10, 100 and 200 mu g/l) of a commonly used organophosphate pesticide (OP), chlorpyrifos, and examined tadpole response at the conclusion of 4 days of exposure. We further examined if the presence or absence of pond sediment influenced tadpole responses, and, in two species, we determined how a 12-day exposure influenced responses. We found species-specific differences in response to the pesticide, with H. chrsysoscelis and G. olivacea being most sensitive; however, the levels of inhibition of ChE activity were generally not sufficient to exert an effect on swim speed as we measured it. Generally, tadpole mass was reduced 20-35% in the highest concentration after 4 days of exposure. We found the presence of sediment to influence these responses, although the effects were not consistent among species.

Salinization of freshwater habitats is increasing and has the potential to interact with other stressors. Chemical pollutants also contribute to habitat degradation in freshwater environments, and both salinity and various pesticides can harm amphibians. The present study used a factorial experiment to investigate the effect of elevated salinity alone and in combination with each of 3 pesticidesatrazine, carbaryl, and glyphosateon life history and behavior of southern toad larvae (Anaxyrus terrestris). Tadpoles were negatively affected by elevated salinity and by exposure to the insecticide carbaryl, with the most deleterious outcomes associated with both stressors combined. Carbaryl exposure led to reduced survival as well as sublethal effects on growth, activity and feeding behavior, escape response swimming, and time to metamorphosis. Tadpoles reared at elevated salinity were also smaller and less active, and ultimately metamorphosed later and at smaller size. Together, carbaryl and elevated salinity had a synergistic effect, resulting in particularly poor growth, depressed activity and feeding, and sluggish escape swimming among tadpoles exposed to both stressors simultaneously. These results suggest that both elevated salinity and carbaryl represent threats for amphibian populations and that pesticide exposure in salinized habitats may pose a particularly high risk.

It has resulted in a series of toxicological and environmental problems, such as impacts on many non-target aquatic species, including fish. The spleen and head kidney in the bony fish are the major hematopoietic organs, and play a crucial part in immune responses. This study evaluated the subchronic effects of ATR and CPF on the mRNA and protein levels of HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 in the immune organs of common carp and compared the acute and subchronic effects of ATR and CPF on the swimming speed (SS) of common carp. The results of acute toxicity tests showed that the 96 h-LC50 of AIR and CPF for common carp was determined to be 2.142 and 0.582 mg/L, respectively. Meanwhile, acute and subacute toxicity of ATR and CPF in common carp resulted in hypoactivity. We also found that the mRNA and protein levels of HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 genes were induced in the spleen and head kidney of common carp exposed to ATR and CPF in the subchronic toxicity test. Our results indicate that ATR and CPF are highly toxic to common carp, and hypoactivity in common carp by acute and subchronic toxicity of ATR and CPF may provide a useful tool for assessing the toxicity of triazine herbicide and organophosphorous pesticides to aquatic organisms. In addition, the results from the subchronic toxicity test exhibited that increasing concentration of AIR and CPF in the environment causes considerable stress for common carp, suggesting that AIR and CPF exposure cause immunotoxicity to common carp.

The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to pesticides increases the susceptibility of hares to F. tularensis and modulates the course of the infection.        METHODS: Experimental hares were allocated to a) control, b) paraoxon-treated, c) F tularensis-treated, and d) paraoxon-and-F. tularensis-treated groups of five specimens on a random basis and subcutaneously inoculated with a wild F. tularensis subsp. holarctica strain (a single dose of 9 x 10(8) CFU pro toto) and/or injected a sublethal dose of paraoxon (100 mu g/kg). Group differences were evaluated using survival curves, oxidative stress responses as well as caspase-3 and acetylcholinesterase activities in whole blood samples collected on day 2 post exposure.        RESULTS: The paraoxon-and-F. tularensis-treated group showed a rapid onset of clinical signs and all deaths occurred on days 2 and 3 post exposure. F. tularensis-inoculated hares survived from 3 to 10 days, while only one hare died on day 12 in the paraoxon-treated group. Survival curves in the three exposed groups were significantly different from the control and median survival in F. tularensis-inoculated and paraoxon-and-F. tularensis-treated hares amounted to 7 and 2 days, respectively. Compared with controls, significant responses included an eight- and seven-fold activation of caspase-3 in E tularensis-inoculated and paraoxon-and-F. tularensis-treated hares, respectively, and a 1.5-fold decrease of blood acetylcholinesterase activities in the paraoxon-treated and paraoxon-and-F. tularensis-treated groups. There was a 1.3- to 1.4-fold decrease of the ferric reducing antioxidant power in blood of F. tularensis-inoculated hares and the paraoxon- and-F. tularensis-treated group, respectively. The blood lipid peroxidation levels were of no differences among the four experimental groups.

The Central Science Laboratory (CSL) has contributed to WIIS by providing the required laboratory skills for the determination of bee diseases and the expert analytical experience necessary to determine low-level pesticide residues and interpret these results. The results from WIIS form part of the pesticide regulatory process coordinated by the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) and are published each year. This paper has reviewed the data from WIIS over the 10 year period from 1994 to 2003. The overall trend is that suspected poisoning incidents, reported by beekeepers and the general public, have declined from 56 incidents per year to 23 incidents per year. The number of these incidents that have been attributed to pesticide poisoning has also declined, from 25 incidents to five incidents per year. The possible reasons for these changes and the circumstances involved in the bee poisoning incidents are discussed. However, the source of the pesticide in bee poisoning incidents is often uncertain and the likely cause of these incidents and any trends over time are also discussed. (C) Crown copyright 2007.

These studies are primarily related to the risk assessment of spinosad towards beneficial arthropods. This review takes into account recent data with the aim of (i) highlighting potentially adverse effects of spinosyns on beneficial arthropods (and hence on ecosystem services that they provide in agroecosystems), (ii) clarifying the range of methods used to address spinosyn side effects on biocontrol agents and pollinators in order to provide new insights for the development of more accurate bioassays, (iii) identifying pitfalls when analysing laboratory results to assess field risks and (iv) gaining increasing knowledge on side effects when using spinosad for integrated pest management (IPM) programmes and organic farming. For the first time, a thorough review of possible risks of spinosad and novel spinosyns (such as spinetoram) to beneficial arthropods (notably natural enemies and pollinators) is provided. The acute lethal effect and multiple sublethal effects have been identified in almost all arthropod groups studied.

This review summarizes, for the first time, 15 years of research on the hazards of neonicotinoids to bees including honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees. The focus of the paper is on three different key aspects determining the risks of neonicotinoid field concentrations for bee populations: (1) the environmental neonicotinoid residue levels in plants, bees and bee products in relation to pesticide application, (2) the reported side-effects with special attention for sublethal effects, and (3) the usefulness for the evaluation of neonicotinoids of an already existing risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds. Although environmental residue levels of neonicotinoids were found to be lower than acute/chronic toxicity levels, there is still a lack of reliable data as most analyses were conducted near the detection limit and for only few crops. Many laboratory studies described lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on the foraging behavior, and learning and memory abilities of bees, while no effects were observed in field studies at field-realistic dosages. The proposed risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds was shown to be applicable to assess the risk for side-effects of neonicotinoids as it considers the effect on different life stages and different levels of biological organization (organism versus colony). Future research studies should be conducted with field-realistic concentrations, relevant exposure and evaluation durations.

The commercial glyphosate-based herbicide Accord is approved for use in wetlands and ponds because it is designed to be safer to aquatic wildlife than other herbicide formulations (e.g., Roundup or Atrazine); however, field experiments are needed to determine whether there are direct, indirect, or sublethal effects on amphibians or effects on wetland community structure. We conducted a replicated field experiment in constructed ponds to test for both the effects of Accord and predator (Tiger Salamanders, Ambystoma tigrinum) density on amphibians and aquatic invertebrates. Herbicide treatment had significant density-dependent effects on Tiger Salamander growth, development, and survival. The survival of anurans and aquatic invertebrates was also affected by herbicide treatment and predator density. At certain Tiger Salamander densities, the community structure was altered such that some species became more common with herbicide treatment, whereas others became less common. Behavior assays of salamander larvae suggest that herbicide treatment alters predator-prey relationships in the experimental pond communities. These results suggest that competition and predation may mediate indirect effects of this herbicide on the aquatic fauna.

This article reviews the literature on possible thyroid disruption in wildlife, humans, and experimental animals and focuses on the most studied chemicals: the pesticides DDT, amitrole, and the thiocarbamate family, including ethylenethiourea, and the industrial chemicals polyhalogenated hydrocarbons, phenol derivatives, and phthalates. Wildlife observations in polluted areas clearly demonstrate a significant incidence of goiter and/or thyroid imbalance in several species. Experimental evidence in rodents, fish, and primates confirms the potentiality for thyroid disruption of several chemicals and illustrates the mechanisms involved. In adult humans, however, exposure to background levels of chemicals does not seem to have a significant negative effect on thyroid function, while exposure at higher levels, occupational or accidental, may produce mild thyroid changes.

For example, aboveground. oral visitors provide pollination services, while belowground arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhance nutrient capture. Traditionally in ecology, these processes were studied in isolation, reinforcing the prevailing assumption that these above- and belowground processes were also functionally distinct. More recently, there has been a growing realization that the soil surface is not a barrier to many ecological interactions, particularly those involving plants (who live simultaneously above and below ground). Because of the potentially large impact that mycorrhizae and. oral visitors can have on plant performance and community dynamics, we designed an experiment to test whether these multi-species mutualisms were interdependent under field conditions. Using benomyl, a widely used fungicide, we suppressed AMF in a native grassland, measuring plant, fungal, and floral-visitor responses after three years of fungal suppression. AMF suppression caused a shift in the community of. oral visitors from large-bodied bees to small-bodied bees and flies, and reduced the total number of. oral visits per flowering stem 67% across the 23 flowering species found in the plots. Fungal suppression has species-specific effects on. oral visits for the six most common flowering plants in this experiment. Exploratory analyses suggest these results were due to changes in. oral-visitor behavior due to altered patch-level. oral display, rather than through direct effects of AMF suppression on. oral morphology. Our findings indicate that AMF are an important, and overlooked, driver of. oral-visitor community structure with the potential to affect pollination services. These results support the growing body of research indicating that interactions among ecological interactions can be of meaningful effect size under natural field conditions and may influence individual performance, population dynamics, and community structure.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  73     Total Times Cited:  95     Cited Reference Count:  51,10.1890/07-0719.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Aspen Parkland;Kinsella;Alberta;Canada;community ecology;grassland;indirect interactions;interactions at multiple trophic levels;mutualisms;mycorrhizae;plant-soil interactions;pollination biology;ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;TALLGRASS PRAIRIE;INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION;POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES;POLLEN LIMITATION;DIVERSITY;SOIL;VISITATION;GRASSLAND,NA,NA,disruption of a belowground mutualism alters interactions between plants and their floral visitors

Hardly any incidents were due to crop-spraying. The reason why so few incidents are registered for normal crop-spraying is discussed: do they not occur, or are the casualties not registered?

Past reviews, using vote-counting methods, have described pollution as one of the major threats faced by amphibians. However, vote-counting methods lack strong statistical power, do not permit one to determine the magnitudes of effects, and do not compare responses among predefined groups. To address these challenges, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured the effects of different chemical pollutants (nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds, pesticides, road deicers, heavy metals, and other wastewater contaminants) at environmentally relevant concentrations on amphibian survival, mass, time to hatching, time to metamorphosis, and frequency of abnormalities. The overall effect size of pollutant exposure was a medium decrease in amphibian survival and mass and a large increase in abnormality frequency. This translates to a 14.3% decrease in survival, a 7.5% decrease in mass, and a 535% increase in abnormality frequency across all studies. In contrast, we found no overall effect of pollutants on time to hatching and time to metamorphosis. We also found that effect sizes differed among experimental venues and among types of pollutants, but we only detected weak differences among amphibian families. These results suggest that variation in sensitivity to contaminants is generally independent of phylogeny. Some publication bias (i.e., selective reporting) was detected, but only for mass and the interaction effect size among stressors. We conclude that the overall impact of pollution on amphibians is moderately to largely negative.

Previous models estimating the impact on wildlife of chemicals used in agro-ecosystems typically have not included the variety of pathways, including both dermal and oral, by which individuals are exposed. The present model contains four submodels simulating (1) foraging behavior of individual birds, (2) chemical applications to crops, (3) transfers of chemicals among soil, insects, and small mammals, and (4) transfers of chemicals to birds via ingestion and dermal exposure. We demonstrate use of the model by simulating the impacts of a variety of commonly used herbicides, insecticides, growth regulators, and defoliants on western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) that winter in agricultural landscapes in southern Texas, United States. The model generated reasonable movement patterns for each chemical through soil, water, insects, and rodents, as well as into the owl via consumption and dermal absorption. Sensitivity analysis suggested model predictions were sensitive to uncertainty associated with estimates of chemical half-lives in birds, soil, and prey, sensitive to parameters associated with estimating dermal exposure, and relatively insensitive to uncertainty associated with details of chemical application procedures (timing of application, amount of drift). Nonetheless, the general trends in chemical accumulations and the relative impacts of the various chemicals were robust to these parameter changes. Simulation results suggested that insecticides posed a greater potential risk to owls of both sublethal and lethal effects than do herbicides, defoliants, and growth regulators under crop scenarios typical of southern Texas, and that use of multiple indicators, or endpoints provided a more accurate assessment of risk due to agricultural chemical exposure. The model should prove useful in helping prioritize the chemicals and transfer pathways targeted in future studies and also, as these new data become available, in assessing the relative danger to other birds of exposure to different types of agricultural chemicals.

Depending on their type, dose, and persistence in the environment, they can have impact even on non-target species such as beneficial insects (honeybees) in different ways, including reduction in their survival rate and interference with their reproduction process. Honeybee Apis mellifera is a major pollinator and has substantial economical and ecological values. Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is a mysterious phenomenon in which adult honeybee workers suddenly abandon from their hives, leaving behind food, brood, and queen. It is lately drawing a lot of attention due to pollination crisis as well as global agriculture and medical demands. If the problem of CCD is not resolved soon enough, this could have a major impact on food industry affecting world's economy a big time. Causes of CCD are not known. In this overview, I discuss CCD, biogenic amines-based-pesticides (neonicotinoids and formamidines), and their disruptive effects on biogenic amine signaling causing olfactory dysfunction in honeybees. According to my hypothesis, chronic exposure of biogenic amines-based-pesticides to honeybee foragers in hives and agricultural fields can disrupt neural cholinergic and octopaminergic signaling. Abnormality in biogenic amines-mediated neuronal signaling impairs their olfactory learning and memory, therefore foragers do not return to their hive - a possible cause of CCD. This overview is an attempt to discuss a hypothetical link among biogenic amines-based pesticides, olfactory learning and memory, and CCD. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Sensitive species may be impaired by sublethal effects or decimated by lethality, and this ecological alteration may initiate a trophic cascade or a release from competition that secondarily leads to responses in tolerant species. Contaminants may exert direct effects on keystone facilitator and foundation species, and contaminant-induced changes in nutrient and oxygen dynamics may alter ecosystem function. Thus, populations and communities in nature may be directly and/or indirectly affected by exposure to pollutants. While the direct effects of toxicants usually reduce organism abundance, indirect effects may lead to increased or decreased abundance. Here we review 150 papers that reference indirect toxicant effects in aquatic environments. Studies of accidental contaminant release, chronic contamination and experimental manipulations have identified indirect contaminant effects in pelagic and benthic communities caused by many types of pollutants. Contaminant-induced changes in behavior, competition and predation/grazing rate can alter species abundances or community composition, and enhance, mask or spuriously indicate direct contaminant effects. Trophic cascades were found in 60% of the manipulative studies and, most commonly, primary producers increased in abundance when grazers were selectively eliminated by contaminants. Competitive release may also be common, but is difficult to distinguish from trophic cascades because few experiments are designed to isolate the mechanism(s) causing indirect effects. Indirect contaminant effects may have profound implications in environments with strong trophic cascades such as the freshwater pelagic. In spite of their undesirable environmental influence, contaminants can be useful manipulative tools for the study of trophic and competitive interactions in natural communities.

From the 35,022 cases from which one or more avian carcasses were submitted to the NWHC for necropsy, we identified 335 mortality events attributed to anticholinesterase poisoning, 119 of which have been included in earlier reports. Poisoning events were classified as confirmed (n = 205) when supported by findings of greater than or equal to50% inhibition of cholinesterase (ChE) activity in brain tissue and the detection of a specific pesticide in the gastrointestinal contents of one or more carcasses. Suspected poisonings (n = 130) were defined as cases where brain ChE activity was greater than or equal to50% inhibited or a specific pesticide was identified in gastrointestinal contents. The 335 avian mortality events occurred in 42 states. Washington, Virginia, and Ohio had the highest frequency of events, with 24 (7.2%), 21 (6.3%), and 20 (6.0%) events, respectively. A total of 8877 carcasses of 103 avian species in 12 orders was recovered. Because carcass counts underestimate total mortality, this represents the minimum actual mortality. Of 24 different pesticides identified, the most frequent were famphur (n = 59; 18%), carbofuran (n = 52; 15%), diazinon (n = 40; 12%), and fenthion (n = 17; 5.1%). Falconiformes were reported killed most frequently (49% of all die-offs) but Anseriformes were found dead in the greatest numbers (64% of 8877 found dead). The majority of birds reported killed by famphur were Passeriformes and Falconiformes, with the latter found dead in 90% of famphur-related poisoning events. Carbofuran and famphur were involved in mortality of the greatest variety of species (45 and 33, respectively).

Although North America was of special interest for regulatory reasons, the review was extended to western Europe because the most extensive and intensive work has been done there. The half-life of herbicides in the environment ranges from less than 1 month to more than 1 year. Wildlife within fields is most likely to be exposed to herbicides, particularly when fields are planted with crops (e.g. corn, soybean, wheat, cotton) which are routinely sprayed. Wildlife is also likely to be exposed in non-crop habitats adjoining croplands, primarily from direct overspray (especially during aerial application), and drift during and/or volatilisation after application, The most conclusive scientific evidence for direct effects of herbicides on arable weeds, and associated indirect effects on insects and birds exists in the United Kingdom. Evidence for similar effects in North America is primarily circumstantial at present. Little work has been done anywhere on impacts of herbicides on plants and their associated fauna in non-crop habitats adjoining treated fields. Chemical farming (in particular, the use of herbicides) has dramatically altered the habitat pattern of temperate landscapes in North America and western Europe. Strong evidence exists for adverse effects of changes in habitat pattern on beneficial insects and arthropods in the United Kingdom, and on birds in North America and western Europe. Toxicity testing guidelines for nontarget plant protection need to be developed and enforced to support pesticide registration. In addition, research is needed to include more ecologically relevant plant species in laboratory tests, to develop multi-species tests (particularly in the field), to improve methods for risk assessment, and to develop options for mitigating risks.

The range of chemical effects on adult birds covers acute mortality, sublethal stress, reduced fertility, suppression of egg formation, eggshell thinning, and impaired incubation and chick rearing behaviors.

Immunotoxicity may be direct via inhibition of serine hydrolases or esterases in components of the immune system, through oxidative damage to immune organs, or by modulation of signal transduction pathways controlling immune functions. Indirect effects include modulation by the nervous system, or chronic effects of altered metabolism/nutrition on immune organs.

Accordingly, the developmental immunotoxic potential of imidacloprid was investigated. Oral exposure was initiated in timed pregnant female Wistar rats on gestation day 6 (GD 6) till GD 21. On GD 20, half of the gravid dams were sacrificed, and in utero fetal development was assessed. In the other half of the dams, administration was continued till weaning on postnatal day 21 (PND 21) and maternal toxicity was investigated. A subgroup of weaned pups was sacrificed to assess immunotoxicity parameters. The other half of the pups were exposed to irnidacloprid till PND 42, and immunotoxicity was assessed. The findings revealed post-implantation loss in the highest dose group, indicating the risk of abortion. Soft tissue abnormalities and skeletal alterations were observed in the highest dose group. Humoral immunity was assessed by estimating hemagglutination titer and immunoglobulin production. Cell mediated immunity was assessed by Delayed Type Hypersensitivity, whereas, non-specific immunity was assessed by phagocytic index, and other phenotypic parameters. These data revealed that imidacloprid caused age-dependent adverse effects on the developing immunity which was aggravated when exposure continued throughout development, leading to a compromised immune system.

Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations(4-6). Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour(7-11) and reductions in colony queen production(12). However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level(8), it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging(13-15), yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated(16,17). Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity.

Due to the ubiquitous and persistent nature of many anthropogenic chemicals, these defects, including thyroid dysfunction, hatching success, egg shell thinning, and gross birth deformities, have since been identified in numerous wildlife populations across the world. Certain wildlife taxa such as amphibians are especially vulnerable to chemical perturbation and are suffering alarming population declines.

Large zooplankton species, which generally are superior to small zooplankton species in competition, are also more sensitive to insecticides. Relatively low insecticide concentrations, which damage only large taxa (Daphnia), may affect the population dynamics of other zooplankton indirectly through altered competitive relationships. The effects of insecticide on the zooplankton community are also influenced by factors such as temperature, chemical properties (e.g. degradation rate), population trends among the organisms, community structure (presence or absence of predators), and timing of the chemical application. These factors modify interrelationships between organisms and, therefore, control the recovery process of the zooplankton community following insecticide impacts. Results to date suggest that insecticide stress decreases the average size of the organisms, reduces energy transfer efficiency, elongates the food chain and sometimes increases species richness.

The aim of the present review is to provide a synthesis of existing knowledge on the interactions between effects of ""natural"" and chemical (anthropogenic) stressors. More than 150 studies were evaluated covering stressors including heat, cold, desiccation, oxygen depletion, pathogens and immunomodulatory factors combined with a variety of environmental pollutants. This evaluation revealed that synergistic interactions between the effects of various natural stressors and toxicants are not uncommon phenomena. Thus, synergistic interactions were reported in more than 50% of the available studies on these interactions. Antagonistic interactions were also detected, but in fewer cases.

Amphibians have existed on the earth for over 300 million years, yet in just the last two decades there have been an alarming number of extinctions, nearly 168 species are believed to have gone extinct and at least 2,469 (43%) more have populations that are declining. Infectious diseases have been recognized as one major cause of worldwide amphibian population declines. This could be the result of the appearance of novel pathogens, or it could be that exposure to environmental stressors is increasing the susceptibility of amphibians to opportunistic pathogens. Here I review the potential effects of stressors on disease susceptibility in amphibians and relate this to disease emergence in human and other wildlife populations. I will present a series of case studies that illustrate the role of stress in disease outbreaks that have resulted in amphibian declines. First, I will examine how elevated sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific since the mid-1970s have affected climate over much of the world and could be setting the stage for pathogen-mediated amphibian declines in many regions.

We examined influences of soybean agriculture on trematode parasitism of larval amphibians (grey tree frogs; Hyla versicolor) to assess the potential effects of a commonly applied pesticide (glyphosate) and landscape factors relative to previous field studies focusing on the herbicide atrazine. Overall, trematode parasite infection did not differ between soybean-adjacent and nonagricultural ponds (87.7% and 72.6% mean infection, respectively). However, host-generalist echinostome species were more common in tadpoles from soybean-associated ponds (86.3% mean infection versus 36.2% in nonagricultural ponds) as well as sites with large or short average distances to forest cover and roads, respectively. In contrast, the occurrence of a host-specialist (Alaria sp.) group was greater in nonagricultural ponds (50.3% mean infection versus 9.8% in soybean-associated ponds) and increased with shorter distances to the closest forest patch and smaller average forest distance. Because glyphosate was not detected at any site and landscape influences were parasite-specific, we suggest that agriculture may have broad effects on wildlife diseases through habitat alterations that affect pathogen transmission via host habitat suitability. Notably, nonagricultural ponds had a lower mean distance to the nearest forest patch and lower mean forest distance compared with soybean-adjacent ponds. As a result, we emphasize the need for wider investigations of habitat perturbations generally associated with agriculture for host-pathogen interactions, and consequently, wildlife conservation and management strategies.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  33     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.7589/2011-09-258     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture;amphibian;disease;habitat;landscape;parasite;RANA-PIPIENS;ENVIRONMENTAL PARASITOLOGY;TREMATODE INFECTIONS;DISEASE;PREVALENCE;PESTICIDES;LANDSCAPE;PATTERNS;ECOLOGY;FRAGMENTATION,NA,NA,agricultural effects on amphibian parasitism importance of general habitat perturbations and parasite life cycles

These pesticides inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and thus have potential to interfere with behaviors that may be essential for salmon survival. Although the effects of individual anticholinesterase insecticides on aquatic species have been studied for decades, the neurotoxicity of mixtures is still poorly understood.        OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether chemicals in a mixture act in isolation (resulting in additive AChE inhibition) or whether components interact to produce either antagonistic or synergistic toxicity.        METHODS: We measured brain AChE inhibition in juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) exposed to sublethal concentrations of the organophosphates diazinon, malathion, and chlorpyrifos, as well as the carbamates carbaryl and carbofuran. Concentrations of individual chemicals were normalized to their respective median effective concentrations (EC50) and collectively fit to a nonlinear regression. We used this curve to determine whether toxicologic responses to binary mixtures were additive, antagonistic, or synergistic.        RESULTS: We observed addition and synergism, with a greater degree of synergism at higher exposure concentrations. Several combinations of organophosphates were lethal at concentrations that were sublethal in single-chemical trials.        CONCLUSION: Single-chemical risk assessments are likely to underestimate the impacts of these insecticides on salmon in river systems where mixtures occur. Moreover, mixtures of pesticides that have been commonly reported in salmon habitats may pose a more important challenge for species recovery than previously anticipated.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  221     Total Times Cited:  249     Cited Reference Count:  48,10.1289/ehp.0800096     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acetylcholinesterase;carbamates;conservation;organophosphates;pesticides;risk assessment;salmon;synergy;toxicity;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION;TOXICOLOGY;ORGANOPHOSPHATE;CHLORPYRIFOS;MODE;FISH;Pesticides;Risk Assessment,NA,NA,the synergistic toxicity of pesticide mixtures implications for risk assessment and the conservation of endangered pacific salmon

Our results revealed that P. helleri foragers that were not exposed to pesticides changed their color preference during the course of a year. By contrast, we found that pesticide exposure altered the color preference of stingless bees in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, imidacloprid decreased the overall locomotion of both bee species, whereas the fungicide mixture increased locomotion of only stingless bees. The fungicide mixture also reduced respiration rates of forager bees of both species. Forager bees of both species altered their color preference, but not their locomotory and respiration rates, when exposed to commercial formulations of each fungicidal mixture component (i.e., chlorothalonil and thiophanate-methyl). Our findings emphasize the importance of P. helleri as a model for Neotropical wild pollinator species in pesticide risk assessments, and also the critical importance of including groups of agrochemicals that are often considered to have minimal impact on pollinators, such as fungicides.

The acetate is administered to livestock via slow-release implants; some is converted by the animal to 17-beta-trenbolone, a relatively potent androgen receptor agonist in mammalian systems. Recent studies indicate that excreted 17-beta-trenbolone is comparatively stable in animal waste, suggesting the potential for exposure to aquatic animals via direct discharge, runoff, or both. However, little is known concerning the toxicity of trenbolone to fish. Our goal was to assess the effects of 17-beta-trenbolone on reproductive endocrinology of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). An in vitro competitive binding study with the fathead minnow androgen receptor demonstrated that 17-beta-trenbolone had a higher affinity for the receptor than that of the endogenous ligand, testosterone. Male and female fish were exposed for 21 d to nominal (target) concentrations of 17-beta-trenbolone ranging from 0.005 to 50 mug/L. Fecundity of the fish was significantly reduced by exposure to measured test concentrations greater than or equal to 0.027 mug/ L. The 17-beta-trenbolone was clearly androgenic in vivo at these concentrations, as evidenced by the de novo production in females of dorsal (nuptial) tubercles, structures normally present only on the heads of mature males. Plasma steroid (testosterone and beta-estradiol) and vitellogenin concentrations in the females all were significantly reduced by exposure to 17-beta-trenbolone. The 17-beta-trenbolone also altered reproductive physiology of male fathead minnows, albeit at concentrations much higher than those producing effects in females. Males exposed to 17-beta-trenbolone at 41 mug/L (measured) exhibited decreased plasma concentrations of 11-ketotestosterone and increased concentrations of beta-estradiol and vitellogenin. Overall, our studies indicate that 17-beta-trenbolone is a potent androgen and reproductive toxicant in fish.

We have investigated, for the first time, behavioral effects in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to a binary mixture of an antidepressant drug (citalopram) and a synthetic opioid (tramadol). Citalopram and tramadol have a similar mode of action (serotonin reuptake inhibition) and are known to produce drug-drug interactional effects resulting in serotonin syndrome (SS) in humans. Zebrafish embryo-larvae were exposed to citalopram, tramadol and 1:1 binary mixture from fertilization until 144 h post-fertilization. No effects on heart rate, spontaneous tail coiling, or death/malformations were observed in any treatment at tested concentrations. Behavior (hypoactivity in dark periods) was on the other hand affected, with lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) of 373 mu g L(-1 )for citalopram, 320 mu g L-1 for tramadol, and 473 mu g L-1 for the 1:1 mixture.

We then show that high doses of a physical stressor (increased temperature of +3 degrees C) and a chemical stressor (the pesticide chlorpyrifos at 30 mu g L-1) induced similar defects by decreasing fish TH levels and affecting their sensory development. Stressor-exposed fish experienced higher predation; however, their ability to avoid predation improved when they received supplemental TH.

This can be key in important social dynamics such as leadership, which is often positively related to personality traits such as boldness. Individuals consistently differ in how social they are (their sociability), so if other axes of personality variation, such as boldness, can be suppressed during social interactions, this suppression should be stronger in more sociable individuals. We measured boldness (latency to leave a refuge when alone) and sociability (time spent with a conspecific) in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and tested the boldness-leadership association in pairs of these fish. Both boldness and sociability were repeatable, but were not correlated. When splitting the data between the 50% most sociable and 50% less sociable fish, boldness was more strongly associated with leadership in less rather than more sociable individuals. This is consistent with more sociable fish conforming to their partner's behaviour due to their greater social tendency. One axis of personality variation (sociability) can thus modulate the relationship between others (boldness and leadership), with potential implications for selection on personality variation in social animals.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  44     Total Times Cited:  45     Cited Reference Count:  34,10.1098/rspb.2018.0829     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),personality;boldness;sociability;conformity;leadership;decision-making;STICKLEBACKS GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS;CONSISTENT;BEHAVIOR;FISH;PLASTICITY;CONFORMITY;ANIMALS;ECOLOGY;RISK,NA,NA,regulation between personality traits individual social tendencies modulate whether boldness and leadership are correlated

How animals integrate and balance the many signals they receive about their environment is rarely assessed. We investigated how signals from the social and physical environment interact to influence environmental preferences in the endemic Tanganyikan cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Specifically, we explored how fish respond to the physiological challenge of declining O-2 levels in light of embedded social preferences using a modified shuttle box apparatus to test O-2 preferences. In the presence of a conspecific, the average (preferred) partial pressure of oxygen (Po-2) and minimum Po-2 experienced were significantly lower (14.90 +/- 2.13 and 12.35 +/- 3.15 kPa, respectively) than in trials without a conspecific (17.18 +/- 2.55 and 15.62 +/- 3.09 kPa, respectively). Fish with conspecifics also spent more time in the low Po-2 zone of the shuttle box and moved between the high and low Po-2 zones less frequently. Hence, O-2 preferences were modified, and fish willingly remained in an area of continuously declining O-2 availability to associate with a conspecific. The O-2 preferences of an individual during social trials correlated with its excess postexercise O-2 consumption following an exhaustive chase but not with its aerobic scope, routine O-2 consumption rate, or body mass.

We evaluated bioaccumulation potential of oxazepam, bromazepam, temazepam, and clobazam in freshwater fish species - perch (Perca fluviatilis) and we conducted a series of behavioral trials to assess their potential to alter boldness, activity, and social behavior. All selected endpoints were studied individually for each target benzodiazepine and as a mixture of all tested compounds to assess possible combinatory effects. We used a three-dimensional automated tracking system to quantify the fish behavior. The four compounds bioconcentrated differently in fish muscle (temazepam > clobazam > oxazepam > bromazepam) at high exposure (9.1, 6.9, 5.7, 8.1 mu g L-1, respectively) and low exposure (0.5, 0.5, 0.3, 0.4 mu g L-1, respectively) concentrations. A significant amount of oxazepam was also measured in fish exposed to temazepam, most likely because of the metabolic transformation of temazepam within the fish. Bromazepam, temazepam, and clobazam significantly affected fish behavior at high concentration, while no statistically significant changes were registered for oxazepam. The studied benzodiazepines affected behavior in combination, because the mixture treatment significantly changed several important behavioral traits even at low concentration, while no single compound exposure had such an effect at that dose. Based on our results, we conclude that effects of pharmaceuticals on aquatic environments could be underestimated if risk assessments only rely on the evaluation of single compounds.

We investigated the effects of two of the most prescribed antidepressants, fluoxetine (FLX) and venlafaxine (VEN) in environmentally realistic concentrations on the predatory behaviour of hatchlings of Sepia officinalis. Newly-hatched cuttlefish were exposed from 1 h (i.e., day 1) to 5 days after hatching to either FLX alone (5 ng.L-1) or combined with VEN (2.5 ng.L-1 or 5 ng.L-1 each) to simulate an environmentally realistic exposure scenario. Their predatory behaviour was analysed through several parameters: prey detection, feeding motivation and success in catching the prey. All parameters improved in control animals over the first five days. The combination of FLX and VEN at 5 ng.L-1 each altered the predatory behaviour of the hatchlings by increasing the latency before attacking the prey, i.e., reducing feeding motivation, as well as by reducing the number of successful attacks. The changes in predatory behaviour tended to reduce food intake and affected growth significantly at 28 days post-hatching. Exposures to either FLX at 5 ng.L-1 or FLX and VEN in mixture at 2.5 ng.L-1 each tended to produce similar effects, even though they were not statistically significant. It is likely that the antidepressants affect maturation of the predatory behaviour and/or learning processes associated with the development of this behaviour.

Previous studies demonstrated their negative (e.g. lead, cadmium) or positive (e.g. zinc) effects on body condition, immunity and reproductive success in birds. Because of their effects on bird condition, trace metals are likely to influence the production of condition-dependent plumage colours, that may be used in mate choice. In the feral pigeon Columba livia, we investigated iridescent colouration in response to lead and zinc experimental (i.e. metal supplementation in standardized conditions) and natural exposure (i.e. metal concentrations in feathers of wild urban pigeons), and melanic feather colouration in response to experimental lead and zinc exposure. Both studies (i.e. experimental and correlative) consistently showed that lead exposure decreased iridescent neck feather brightness independently of colour morph. Moreover, lead, when provided alone, decreased melanic feather reflectance in the middle wavelengths while zinc supplementation increased melanic feather reflectance in the violet-wavelength. In conclusion, our study suggests that the colouration of iridescent and melanic feathers depends on the exposure to pollutants.

There are few empirical examples of how differences in collective dynamics emerge from variation among individuals in cognition. Here, we use a naturally variable and heritable learning behavior called latent inhibition (LI) to show that interactions among individuals that differ in this cognitive ability drive collective foraging behavior in honey bee colonies. We artificially selected two distinct phenotypes: high-LI bees that ignore previously familiar stimuli in favor of novel ones and low-LI bees that learn familiar and novel stimuli equally well. We then provided colonies differentially composed of different ratios of these phenotypes with a choice between familiar and novel feeders. Colonies of predominantly high-LI individuals preferred to visit familiar food locations, while low-LI colonies visited novel and familiar food locations equally. Interestingly, in colonies of mixed learning phenotypes, the low-LI individuals showed a preference to visiting familiar feeders, which contrasts with their behavior when in a uniform low-LI group. We show that the shift in feeder preference of low-LI bees is driven by foragers of the high-LI phenotype dancing more intensely and attracting more followers. Our results reveal that cognitive abilities of individuals and their social interactions, which we argue relate to differences in attention, drive emergent collective outcomes.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  31     Total Times Cited:  33     Cited Reference Count:  60,10.1073/pnas.1920554117     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),collective behavior;cognition;learning;latent inhibition;honey bee;LATENT INHIBITION;HONEY-BEE;HERITABLE VARIATION;APIS-MELLIFERA;PERFORMANCE;COLONIES;PREDATOR;MEMORY;Phenotype,NA,NA,individual learning phenotypes drive collective behavior

In mammals, such 'social buffering' of stress is mediated by affiliative relationships and production of the neuropeptide oxytocin, but whether these mechanisms facilitate social buffering across vertebrates remains an open question. Therefore, we evaluated whether the social environment influenced the behavioural and physiological recovery from an acute stressor in a group-living cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher. Individual fish that recovered with their social group displayed lower cortisol levels than individuals that recovered alone. This social buffering of the stress response was associated with a tendency towards lower transcript abundance of arginine vasotocin and isotocin in the preoptic area of the brain, suggesting reduced neural activation of the stress axis. Individuals that recovered with their social group quickly resumed normal behaviour but received fewer affiliative acts following the stressor. Further experiments revealed similar cortisol levels between individuals that recovered in visual contact with their own social group and those in visual contact with a novel but non-aggressive social group. Collectively, our results suggest that affiliation and familiarity per se do not mediate social buffering in this group-living cichlid, and the behavioural and physiological mechanisms responsible for social buffering may vary across vertebrates.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  82,10.1098/rspb.2019.1626     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),affiliation;aggression;arginine vasotocin;cortisol;isotocin;social groups;BREEDING CICHLID FISH;STEROIDOGENIC ENZYMES;SALIENCE HYPOTHESIS;ARGININE VASOTOCIN;CORTISOL SECRETION;BEHAVIOR NETWORK;SEX-DIFFERENCES;ADULT FEMALE;GROUP-SIZE;ISOTOCIN,NA,NA,social buffering of stress in a groupliving fish

Understanding the mechanisms that drive social network dynamics requires integrating individual-level biology with comparisons across multiple social networks. Testosterone is a key mediator of vertebrate social behaviour and can influence how individuals interact with social partners. Although the effects of testosterone on individual behaviour are well established, no study has examined whether hormone-mediated behaviour can scale up to shape the emergent properties of social networks. We investigated the relationship between testosterone and social network dynamics in the wire-tailed manakin, a lekking bird species in which male-male social interactions form complex social networks. We used an automated proximity system to longitudinally monitor several leks and we quantified the social network structure at each lek. Our analysis examines three emergent properties of the networks-social specialization (the extent to which a network is partitioned into exclusive partnerships), network stability (the overall persistence of partnerships through time) and behavioural assortment (the tendency for like to associate with like). All three properties are expected to promote the evolution of cooperation. As the predictor, we analysed the collective testosterone of males within each social network. Social networks that were composed of high-testosterone dominant males were less specialized, less stable and had more negative behavioural assortment, after accounting for other factors. These results support our main hypothesis that individual-level hormone physiology can predict group-level network dynamics. We also observed that larger leks with more interacting individuals had more positive behavioural assortment, suggesting that small groups may constrain the processes of homophily and behaviour-matching. Overall, these results provide evidence that hormone-mediated behaviour can shape the broader architecture of social groups. Groups with high average testosterone exhibit social network properties that are predicted to impede the evolution of cooperation.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  75,10.1111/1365-2656.13305,androgens;behavioural endocrinology;collective behaviour;cooperation;dynamic networks;social networks;testosterone;WIRE-TAILED MANAKIN;WILD POPULATION;MATING SUCCESS;LEK;ASSORTMENT;EVOLUTION;PERFORMANCE;FRIENDSHIP;HYPOTHESIS;STABILITY;Social Support;Testosterone,NA,NA,testosteronemediated behaviour shapes the emergent properties of social networks

Despite this broad importance, a general framework for predicting social network stability has not been proposed. Here we present longitudinal data on the social dynamics of a cooperative bird species, the wire-tailed manakin, to evaluate the potential causes of temporal network stability. We find that when partners interact less frequently and when social connect-edness increases, the network is subsequently less stable. Social connectivity was also negatively associated with the temporal persistence of coalition partnerships on an annual timescale. This negative association between connectivity and stability was surprising, especially given that individual manakins who were more connected also had more stable partnerships. This apparent paradox arises from a within-individual behavioral trade-off between partnership quantity and quality. Crucially, this trade-off is easily masked by behavioral variation among individuals. Using a simulation, we show that these results are explained by a simple model that combines among-individual behavioral heterogeneity and reciprocity within the network. As social networks become more connected, individuals face a trade-off between partnership quantity and maintenance. This model also demonstrates how among-individual behavioral heterogeneity, a ubiquitous feature of natural societies, can improve social stability. Together, these findings provide unifying principles that are expected to govern diverse social systems.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.1073/pnas.1913284117     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),social networks;dynamic networks;behavioral ecology;cooperation;personality;WIRE-TAILED MANAKIN;WILD POPULATION;EVOLUTION;MODELS;ORGANIZATION;COOPERATION;FRIENDSHIP;DYNAMICS;GUIDE;Social Support,NA,NA,reciprocity and behavioral heterogeneity govern the stability of social networks

These cross-scale feedback loops between individuals, populations and their environments can provide fitness benefits, such as the efficient exploitation of uncertain resources, as well as costs, such as increased resource competition. Although the social mechanics of collective behaviour are increasingly well-studied, its role in ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here we introduce collective movement into a model of consumer-resource dynamics to demonstrate that collective behaviour can attenuate consumer-resource cycles and promote species coexistence. We focus on collective movement as a particularly well-understood example of collective behaviour. Adding collective movement to canonical unstable ecological scenarios causes emergent social-ecological feedback, which mitigates conditions that would otherwise result in extinction. Collective behaviour could play a key part in the maintenance of biodiversity.        Collective movements such as flocking or schooling can benefit a single species, but there may also be wider implications of such behaviour.

It has been suggested that MPH could cause transgenerational effects because MPH can affect the male germline in rodents and because paternal effects have been observed in individuals taking similar drugs (e.g. cocaine). Despite these concerns, the transgenerational effects of paternal MPH exposure are unknown. Therefore, we exposed male and female Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to a low, chronic dose of MPH and observed that MPH affected the anxiety/exploratory behaviour of males, but not females. Because of this male-specific effect, we investigated the transgenerational effects of MPH through the paternal line. We observed behavioural effects of paternal MPH exposure on offspring and great-grandoffspring that were not directly administered the drug, making this the first study to demonstrate that paternal MPH exposure can affect descendants.

Progress in documenting the ecological effects of sensory pollutants is weakened by sparse knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these effects.

Here, we integrate knowledge of animal sensory ecology, physiology and life history to articulate three perceptual mechanisms-masking, distracting and misleading-that clearly explain how and why anthropogenic sensory pollutants impact organisms. We then link these three mechanisms to ecological consequences and discuss their implications for conservation. We argue that this framework can reveal the presence of 'sensory danger zones', hotspots of conservation concern where sensory pollutants overlap in space and time with an organism's activity, and foster development of strategic interventions to mitigate the impact of sensory pollutants.

We used a unique experimental framework, where formation of breeding colonies of different sizes was induced under uniform environmental conditions. For this purpose, different-size patches of attractive nesting substrate (artificial floating rafts) were provided at a single site with limited availability of natural nesting habitat.        Colony size was identified as the only significant predictor of both innate (natural antibody-mediated complement activation) and adaptive (immunoglobulin concentrations) immunological traits in the common terns, as more immunocompetent birds settled in larger experimental colonies.

Pesticide exposure is a potential factor in the loss of foragers. During 2009-2010, we assessed changes in the field force populations of 9-10 colonies at one location per crop on each of the eight crops by counting departing foragers leaving colonies at regular intervals during the respective crop blooming periods. The number of frames of adult bees was counted before and after bloom period. For pesticide analysis, we collected dead and dying bees near the hives, returning foragers, crop flowers, trapped pollen, and corn-flowers associated with the cotton crop. The number of departing foragers changed over time in all crops except almonds; general patterns in foraging activity included declines (cotton), noticeable peaks and declines (alfalfa, blueberries, cotton, corn, and pumpkins), and increases (apples and cantaloupes). The number of adult bee frames increased or remained stable in all crops except alfalfa and cotton. A total of 53 different pesticide residues were identified in samples collected across eight crops. Hazard quotients (HQ) were calculated for the combined residues for all crop-associated samples and separately for samples of dead and dying bees.

High levels of the 'social hormone' testosterone (T) are linked to aggression, dominance, and competition. Low T levels, in contrast, promote sociopositive behaviours such as affiliation, social tolerance, and cooperation, which can be crucial for group-level, collective behaviours. Here, we test the hypothesis that - in a collective context - low T levels should be favourable, using non-reproductive male and female stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and non-invasive waterbome hormone analysis. In line with our predictions, we show that the fishes' T levels were significantly lower during shoaling compared to when alone, with high-T individuals showing the largest decrease. Ruling out stress-induced T suppression and increased T conversion into oestradiol, we find evidence that shoaling directly affects androgen responsiveness. We also show that groups characterized by lower mean T exhibit less hierarchical leader-follower dynamics, suggesting that low T promotes egalitarianism. Overall, we show that collective action results in lower T levels, which may serve to promote coordination and group performance. Our study, together with recent complementary findings in humans, emphasizes the importance of low T for the expression of sociopositive behaviour across vertebrates, suggesting similarities in endocrine mechanisms.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  70,10.1016/j.yhbeh.2019.104636     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Collective hormone profiles;Social context;Social modulation;Social tolerance;Testosterone;SOCIAL MODULATION;NONINVASIVE MEASUREMENT;GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS;CHALLENGE HYPOTHESIS;HORMONAL MECHANISMS;TESTOSTERONE LEVELS;BEHAVIOR;AGGRESSION;INDIVIDUALS;DOMINANCE;Androgens;Virilism,NA,NA,collective action reduces androgen responsiveness with implications for shoaling dynamics in stickleback fish

However, these beachings occur for reasons that are not fully understood. In 2016, 124 LFPW were stranded on the Chilean Patagonian islands, offering a unique opportunity to obtain crucial information on the ecology, biology, and genetics of this population. In addition, we examined whether persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and trace elements (TEs) were responsible for this mass mortality. Stable isotopes (delta C-13 & delta N-15) and genetic analyses were used to reconstruct the trophic ecology, social structure, and kinship of LFPW and compared to POPs and TEs levels found in LFPW. Mitochondrial DNA analyses on 71 individuals identified four maternal lineages within the stranded LFPW. Of these animals, 32 individuals were analyzed for a suite of POPs, TEs, and lipid content in blubber. The highest levels were found for SDDXs (6 isomers) (542.46 +/- 433.46 ng/g, lw) and for total Hg (2.79 +/- 1.91 mg/kg, dw). However, concentrations found in these LFPW were lower than toxicity thresholds and those reported for LFPW stranded in other regions. Evidence was found of SDDX, S7PCBs, and Cd bioaccumulation and maternal transfer of POPs in mother/offspring groups. Nevertheless, no clear relationship between contaminant concentrations and LFPW mortality was established.

The effects of moderate and high exposure to Pb have been well-studied in birds, but whether low-level early-life exposure to Pb influences adult phenotype remains unclear. Female songbirds use a male's song and coloration to discriminate between high- and low-quality males. Therefore, if early-life exposure to Pb disrupts song learning ability or shifts the allocation of antioxidant pigments away from colorful secondary sexual traits, male birds exposed to Pb may be less attractive to females. We exposed developing zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to Pb-contaminated drinking water (100 or 1000 parts per billion [ppb]) after hatching (days 0-100). Once male finches reached adulthood (120-150 days post hatch), we measured song learning ability, coloration of bill and cheek patches, and volume of song nuclei in the brain. We also measured female preference for Pb-exposed males relative to control males. Finally, we measured motoric and spatial cognitive performance in male and female finches to assess whether cognitive traits differed in their sensitivity to Pb exposure. Male zebra finches exposed to 1000 ppb Pb had impaired song learning ability, reduced volume of song nuclei, bills with less redness and received less attention from females. Additionally, Pb exposure impaired motoric performance in both male and female finches but did not affect performance in a spatial cognitive task. Adult finches exposed to Pb-contaminated water had higher blood-Pb levels, though in all cases blood-Pb levels were below 7.0 mu g dL(-1). This study suggests that low-level exposure to Pb contributes to cognitive deficits that persist into adulthood and may indirectly influence fitness by altering secondary sexual traits and reducing male attractiveness.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  128,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111850,Dietary lead;Neurotoxicity;Song learning;Song nuclei;Bill coloration;Mate choice;CAROTENOID-BASED COLORATION;OXIDATIVE STRESS;MATE CHOICE;NUTRITIONAL STRESS;GLUTATHIONE LEVELS;HEAVY-METALS;WILD BIRDS;BEHAVIOR;BRAIN;ATTRACTIVENESS;Music,NA,NA,male zebra finches exposed to lead pb during development have reduced volume of song nuclei altered sexual traits and received less attention from females as adults

Fish are chronically exposed to pollution at low concentrations. The changes of aggressive behaviour of chub (Squalius cephalus) were determined under the exposure to four psychoactive compounds (sertraline, citalopram, tramadol, methamphetamine) at environmentally relevant concentrations of 1 mu g/L for 42 days. We tested whether (A) the behavioural effect of compounds varies within a single species; (B) there is a correlation between the individual brain concentration of the tested pollutants and fish aggression using the novel analysis of pollutants in brain; and (C) there is detectable threshold to effective pollutant concentration in brain. Behaviour and pollutant concentrations in brain were determined repeatedly (1st, 7th, 21st, 42nd and 56th days), including a two-week-long depuration period. The effect of particular compounds varied. Citalopram and methamphetamine generally increased the fish aggression, while no such effect was found after exposure to tramadol or sertraline. The longitudinal analysis showed an aggression increase after depuration, indicating the presence of withdrawal effects in methamphetamine- and tramadol-exposed fish. The analysis of pollutant concentration in brain revealed a positive linear relationship of citalopram concentration and aggression, while no such effect was detected for other compounds and/or their metabolites. Structural break analyses detected concentration thresholds of citalopram (1 and 3 ng/g) and sertraline (1000 ng/g) in brain tissue, from which a significant effect on behaviour was manifested. While the effect of sertraline was not detected using traditional approaches, there was a reduction in aggression after considering its threshold concentration in the brain. Our results suggest that pursuing the concentration threshold of psychoactive compounds can help to reduce false negative results and provide more realistic predictions on behavioural outcomes in freshwater environments, especially in the case of compounds with bioaccumulation potential such as sertraline.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  122,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112944,Pharmaceuticals;Sertraline;Citalopram;Tramadol;Methamphetamine;Withdrawal effects;ZEBRAFISH DANIO-RERIO;WASTE-WATER TREATMENT;SURFACE-WATER;METHAMPHETAMINE DEPENDENCE;TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS;AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT;STOCKING DENSITY;ANIMAL RESEARCH;CLOFIBRIC ACID;ILLICIT DRUGS,NA,NA,prescribed aggression of fishes pharmaceuticals modify aggression in environmentally relevant concentrations

Here we investigate how the structure, leadership, movement dynamics, and foraging performance of groups can emerge from inter-individual differences by high-resolution tracking of known behavioral types in free-swimming stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) shoals. We show that individual's propensity to stay near others, measured by a classic ""sociability'' assay, was negatively linked to swim speed across a range of contexts, and predicted spatial positioning and leadership within groups as well as differences in structure and movement dynamics between groups. In turn, this trait, together with individual's exploratory tendency, measured by a classic ""boldness'' assay, explained individual and group foraging performance. These effects of consistent individual differences on group-level states emerged naturally from a generic model of self-organizing groups composed of individuals differing in speed and goal-orientedness. Our study provides experimental and theoretical evidence for a simple mechanism to explain the emergence of collective behavior from consistent individual differences, including variation in the structure, leadership, movement dynamics, and functional capabilities of groups, across social and ecological scales.

Social insect colonies navigate this challenge, in the absence of centralized control, by allocating different individuals to exploration or exploitation based on variation in individual behaviour. To investigate how heritable differences in individual learning affect a colony's collective ability to locate and choose among different quality food resources, we develop an agent-based model and test its predictions empirically using two genetic lines of honey bees (Apis mellifera), selected for differences in their learning behaviour. We show that colonies containing individuals that are better at learning to ignore unrewarding stimuli are worse at collectively choosing the highest-quality resource.

However, there has been no large-scale, generalizable study on their impact on biodiversity of avian species in the United States. Here we show, using a rich dataset on breeding birds and pesticide use in the United States, that the increase in neonicotinoid use led to statistically significant reductions in bird biodiversity between 2008 and 2014 relative to a counterfactual without neonicotinoid use, particularly for grassland and insectivorous birds, with average annual rates of reduction of 4% and 3%, respectively. The corresponding rates are even higher (12% and 5%, respectively) when the dynamic effects of bird population declines on future population growth are considered. The effects of neonicotinoids on non-grassland and non-insectivorous birds are also statistically significant but smaller, with an average annual rate of reduction of 2% over this period.        Neonicotinoid insecticides have the potential to harm non-target organisms. This study finds that, between 2008 and 2014, increased neonicotinoid use in the United States reduced bird diversity, especially grassland and insectivorous birds.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  67     Total Times Cited:  80     Cited Reference Count:  58,10.1038/s41893-020-0582-x,LAND-USE;COUNT DATA;ABUNDANCE;MODELS;METAANALYSIS;EXPOSURE;CLIMATE;PRICES;HEALTH;United States,NA,NA,neonicotinoids and decline in bird biodiversity in the united states

Locomotion and HR were recorded over a period 30 min before and 30 min after exposure to physiological fluids of an injured conspecific, a natural stressor, four times during the tramadol exposure and four times during depuration. A significant increase in HR following stress induction was found in the majority of tramadol-exposed and control crayfish, as well as significant group-specific HR changes between both groups. Locomotor activity during tramadol treatment differed from that during depuration, in general showing less time spent in locomotion and lower distance moved.

One explanation for this variation is that individuals face differential benefits or costs depending on the group's order, but empirical evidence for this is lacking. Here we show that in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), fish that are first to respond to an ephemeral food source do so faster when shoals are in a disordered, swarm-like state. This is because individuals' visual fields collectively cover more of their environment, meaning private information is more readily available in disordered groups. Once social information becomes available, however, the arrival times of subsequent group members to the food are faster in more ordered, polarized groups. Our data further suggest that first responding individuals (those that benefit from group disorder) maintain larger differences in heading angle to their nearest neighbours when shoaling, thereby explaining how conflict over whether private or social information is favoured can drive dynamic changes in collective behaviour.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  37     Total Times Cited:  39     Cited Reference Count:  38,10.1038/s41467-020-16578-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),TRADE-OFFS;GROUP-SIZE;EVOLUTION;VIGILANCE;FISH;Animal Shells;Animals,NA,NA,information can explain the dynamics of group order in animal collective behaviour

It is well known that many species can form and disband groups, often in response to the distribution and abundance of resources. While previous studies showed that resources influence the broad-scale structure of animal groups, knowledge gaps remain on whether they affect fine-scale patterns of association among individuals within groups. We quantify association patterns in African lions while simultaneously monitoring the abundance and distribution of prey. We test how social and ecological factors, including individual trait (age, sex, reproductive state) similarity and prey availability (prey abundance, dispersion, herd size and body size) affect within-pride social structure in African lions. We found that individual decisions about associates depended on resource availability with individuals associating equally across all members of the pride when prey herds were scarce, aggregated or large bodied, and associating more exclusively (in subgroups of preferred associates) when prey herds were abundant, dispersed or small bodied. Individuals within lion prides seemed to be buffering against changes in prey availability by modulating their strength and density of connections with conspecifics when prides split into subgroups. The strength and density of connections among individuals within subgroups was greater when prey herds were large and lower when prey herds were dispersed or are large bodied. Our findings suggest that individual lions are making social decisions at both the subgroup level and the pride level, with decisions representing putatively fitness-enhancing strategies. Individuals were typically shifting between having few strong connections and having many weaker connections depending on prevailing ecological conditions, with prey abundance, dispersion and body size having the greatest impact on decisions about splitting into subgroups. The maintenance of connections within prides and subgroups in the face of ecological change suggests that the fission-fusion nature of lion prides might be essential for the long-term maintenance of social connections even when short-term conditions do not allow them. More broadly, our study reveals how fission-fusion dynamics and ecological factors can simultaneously have an effect on animals across multiple levels of sociality.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  72,10.1111/1365-2656.13334,animal social networks;dynamic networks;ecological factors;fission-fusion;heterogeneity;lion;null models;prey availability;FISSION-FUSION DYNAMICS;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;PANTHERA-LEO;ORGANIZATION;INDIVIDUALS;HYPOTHESIS;NETWORKS;SUCCESS;SIZE;FOOD,NA,NA,effect of ecological factors on finescale patterns of social structure in african lions

Honeybees use their sense of smell to identify the queen and nestmates, to signal danger and to distinguish flowers during foraging. Few behavioural studies to date have examined how neonicotinoid pesticides affect the ability of bees to distinguish odours. Here, we used a differential learning task to test how neonicotinoid exposure affects learning, memory and olfactory perception in foraging-age honeybees. Bees fed with thiamethoxam could not perform differential learning and could not distinguish odours during short- and long-term memory tests. Our data indicate that thiamethoxam directly impacts the cognitive processes involved in working memory required during differential olfactory learning. Using a combination of behavioural assays, we also identified that thiamethoxam has a direct impact on the olfactory perception of similar odours. Honeybees fed with other neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid, dinotefuran) performed the differential learning task, but at a slower rate than the control. These bees could also distinguish the odours. Our data are the first to show that neonicotinoids have compound specific effects on the ability of bees to perform a complex olfactory learning task. Deficits in decision making caused by thiamethoxam exposure could mean that this is more harmful than other neonicotinoids, leading to inefficient foraging and a reduced ability to identify nestmates.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  56,10.1242/jeb.217174     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Olfactory learning;Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor;Thiamethoxam;Apis mellifera;Odour discrimination;Cholinergic signalling;MEMORY FORMATION;AGONIST ACTIONS;ACETYLCHOLINE;EXPOSURE;BEE;CLOTHIANIDIN;THIAMETHOXAM;INSECTICIDES;EXPRESSION;SUBUNITS;Pesticides;Discrimination (Psychology);Learning,NA,NA,honeybees fail to discriminate floral scents in a complex learning task after consuming a neonicotinoid pesticide

Although sublethal levels of neonicotinoids are known to disrupt honeybee learning and behaviour, the neurophysiological basis of these effects has not been shown. Here, using recordings from mushroom body Kenyon cells in acutely isolated honeybee brain, we show that the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin, and the organophosphate miticide coumaphos oxon, cause a depolarization-block of neuronal firing and inhibit nicotinic responses. These effects are observed at concentrations that are encountered by foraging honeybees and within the hive, and are additive with combined application.

The Gulf of Mexico is a critical bird migration route area and migrants that were oiled but did not suffer mortality as a direct result of the spill faced unpredictable fates. This study utilized homing pigeons as a surrogate species for migratory birds to investigate the effects a single low level external oiling event has on the flight performance and behavior of birds flying repeated 161 km flights. Data from GPS data loggers showed that lightly oiled pigeons changed their flight paths, increased their flight durations by 2.6 fold, increased their flight distances by 28 km and subsequently decreased their route efficiencies. Oiled birds also exhibited reduced rate of weight gain between flights. Our data suggest that contaminated birds surviving the oil spill may have experienced flight impairment and reduced refueling abilities, likely reducing overall migration speed. Our findings contribute new information on how oil spills affect avian species, as the effects of oil on the flight behavior of long distance free-flying birds have not been previously described.

Numbers of ant encounters observed positively correlated with the duration of observation. Individuals varied in interaction frequency, even after accounting for the duration of observation. An ant's interaction frequency was explained by its path shape and location within the entrance chamber.

BP3 is currently receiving a great deal of attention because many of its properties, including high water solubility and potential to bioaccumulate, enable it to have damaging effects on aquatic ecosystems. One of these effects, the induction of coral bleaching, has led Hawaii to ban all sunscreens containing BP3. BP3 also appears to have endocrine-disrupting properties and has been found to affect animal physiology. However, behavioural consequences of BP3 exposure have yet to be thoroughly characterized. In the present study, we investigated the effects of BP3 on boldness, courtship and aggression in male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, as little is known about the effects that BP3 has on fish social behaviour. To accomplish this, we assigned males to a treatment group (control, low, medium or high BP3 concentration) and completed individual (empty tank, novel environment and shoal) and social (courtship and aggression) behavioural assays before and after a 28-day exposure period. BP3 influenced the expression of social behaviours, with individual boldness generally unaffected. Changes in shoaling occurred regardless of BP3 concentration, while BP3-associated decreases in courtship and aggression were concentration dependent. Abnormal social behaviour may impede successful mating and alter territorial dynamics, with potentially heightened effects in species already experiencing other anthropogenic stressors.

Direct contact of olfactory neuroepithelium to the surrounding environment makes it vulnerable to contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. Copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), which are increasingly used in commercial and domestic applications due their exceptional properties, can impair fish olfactory function. However, the molecular events underlying olfactory toxicity of CuNPs are largely unexplored. Our results suggested that CuNPs were bioavailable to olfactory mucosal cells. Using RNA-seq, we compared the effect of CuNPs and copper ions (Cu2+) on gene transcript profiles of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) olfactory mucosa. The narrow overlap in differential gene expression between the CuNP- and Cu2+-exposed fish revealed that these two contaminants exert their effects through distinct mechanisms. We propose a transcript-based conceptual model that shows that olfactory signal transduction, calcium homeostasis, and synaptic vesicular signaling were affected by CuNPs in the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Neuroregenerative pathways were also impaired by CuNPs. In contrast, Cu2+ did not induce toxicity pathways and rather upregulated regeneration pathways. Both Cu treatments reduced immune system pathway transcripts. However, suppression of transcripts that were associated with inflammatory signaling was only observed with CuNPs. Neither oxidative stress nor apoptosis were triggered by Cu2+ or CuNPs in mucosal cells. Dysregulation of transcripts that regulate function, maintenance, and reestablishment of damaged olfactory mucosa represents critical mechanisms of toxicity of CuNPs. The loss of olfaction by CuNPs may impact survival of rainbow trout and impose an ecological risk to fish populations in contaminated environments. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although pesticide application serves many important purposes, including protection against crop loss and against vector-borne diseases, there are significant concerns over the potential toxic effects of pesticides to non-target organisms, including humans. In many cases, the molecular target of a pesticide is shared by non-target species, leading to the potential for untoward effects.

Yet, without overcoming fundamental challenges such as how to coordinate movements with conspecifics, animals cannot maintain cohesion, and coordination is thus a prerequisite for the evolution of sociality in nonstationary animals. Although it has been considered that animal groups must coordinate the timing and direction of movements, coordinating speed is also essential to prevent the group from splitting. We investigated speed consensus in homing pigeon, Columba livia, flocks using high-resolution GPS. Despite observable differences in average solo speed (which was positively correlated with bird mass) compromises of up to 6% from the preferred solo speed were made to reach consensus in flocks. These results match theory which suggests that groups fly at an intermediate of solo speeds, which suggests speed averaging. By virtue of minimizing extreme compromises, speed averaging can maximize selective benefits across the group, suggesting shared consensus for group speed could be ubiquitous across taxa. Nevertheless, despite group-wide advantages, contemporary flight models have suggested unequal energetic costs in favour of individuals with intermediate body mass/preferred speed (hence the 'Goldilocks principle').

Individuals in selfish herds are thought to benefit by reducing their own risk at the expense of conspecifics by attracting toward their neighbors' positions(1,2) or central locations in the aggregation.(3-5) Alternatively, increased alignment with their neighbors' orientation could reduce the chance of predation through information sharing(6-8) or collective escape.(6) Using both small and large flocks of homing pigeons (Columba livia; n = 8-10 or n = 27-34 individuals) tagged with 5-Hz GPS loggers and a GPS-tagged, remote-controlled model peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), we tested whether individuals increase their use of attraction over alignment when under perceived threat. We conducted n = 27 flights in treatment conditions, chased by the robotic ""predator,'' and n = 16 flights in control conditions (not chased). Despite responding strongly to the RobotFalcon-by turning away from its flight direction-individuals in treatment flocks demonstrated no increased attraction compared with control flocks, and this result held across both flock sizes. We suggest that mutualistic alignment is more advantageous than selfish attraction in groups with a high coincidence of individual and collective interests (adaptive hypothesis). However, we also explore alternative explanations, such as high cognitive demand under threat and collision avoidance (mechanistic hypotheses). We conclude that selfish herd may not be an appropriate paradigm for understanding the function of highly synchronous collective motion, as observed in bird flocks and perhaps also fish shoals and highly aligned mammal aggregations, such as moving herds.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  25     Total Times Cited:  25     Cited Reference Count:  63,10.1016/j.cub.2021.05.009,COLLECTIVE MOTION;BEHAVIOR;STRATEGIES;LEADERSHIP;GEOMETRY,NA,NA,absence of selfish herd dynamics in bird flocks under threat

In particular, experimental fish presented anxiolytic-like effects, characterized by less bold and less social individuals. Exposed animals were less frequently out of the shelter and moved a shorter distance, indicating that they explored the new environment less during the boldness test. In the novel object recognition experiment, although they distinguished the new item, they examined it less and displayed a reduced activity. Shoal cohesion was disrupted as observed in an increased distance between individuals. After the depuration phase, this alteration remained whereas the boldness effect disappeared.

Most insecticides are insect neurotoxins. Evidence is emerging that sublethal doses of these neurotoxins are affecting the learning and memory of both wild and managed bee colonies, exacerbating the negative effects of pesticide exposure and reducing individual foraging efficiency.        2. Variation in methodologies and interpretation of results across studies has precluded the quantitative evaluation of these impacts that is needed to make recommendations for policy change. It is not clear whether robust effects occur under acute exposure regimes (often argued to be more field-realistic than the chronic regimes upon which many studies are based), for field-realistic dosages, and for pesticides other than neonicotinoids.        3. Here we use meta-analysis to examine the impact of pesticides on bee performance in proboscis extension-based learning assays, the paradigm most commonly used to assess learning and memory in bees. We draw together 104 (learning) and 167 (memory) estimated effect sizes across a diverse range of studies.        4. We detected significant negative effects of pesticides on learning and memory (i) at field realistic dosages, (ii) under both chronic and acute application, and (iii) for both neonicotinoid and non-neonicotinoid pesticides groups.        5. We also expose key gaps in the literature that include a critical lack of studies on non-Apis bees, on larval exposure (potentially one of the major exposure routes), and on performance in alternative learning paradigms.        6. Policy implications. Procedures for the registration of new pesticides within EU member states now typically require assessment of risks to pollinators if potential target crops are attractive to bees. However, our results provide robust quantitative evidence for subtle, sublethal effects, the consequences of which are unlikely to be detected within small-scale prelicensing laboratory or field trials, but can be critical when pesticides are used at a landscape scale. Our findings highlight the need for long-term postlicensing environmental safety monitoring as a requirement within licensing policy for plant protection products.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  101     Total Times Cited:  107     Cited Reference Count:  87,10.1111/1365-2664.13193     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),agricultural policy;bees;cognition;insecticide;neonicotinoid;pesticide;pollination;pollinators;CHRONIC EXPOSURE;NEONICOTINOID PESTICIDE;MUSHROOM BODIES;HONEY-BEES;BUMBLE BEES;METAANALYSIS;INSECTICIDES;POLLINATION;IMPAIRMENT;RESIDUES;Pesticides;Memory,NA,NA,quantifying the impact of pesticides on learning and memory in bees

Using standardized high-definition video playback on captive great tits (Parus major), we effectively demonstrate the influence of individual traits on the motivation to be near a conspecific. We show that social attraction varied contrastingly with boldness and stimulus novelty. Shyer birds tended to show stronger social attraction when they were confronted with the stimulus bird for the first time. Lower ranked birds showed the overall strongest social attraction. This rank effect remained after experimentally changing dominance ranks by altering group compositions. Moreover, preference for social association tended to increase with a decrease in dominance rank, suggesting that birds plastically change their social preference in relation to their within-group dominance status.

In this study the effects of copper NPs (Cu NPs) on the anti-predator behavioural responses of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to trout alarm substance was investigated. Individual fish were exposed for 12 h to a control (no added Cu), 50 mu g l(-1) of Cu as Cu NPs, or 50 mu g l(-1) Cu as CuSO4, after which fish behaviours were analyzed in 10 min periods before and after the addition of the alarm substance stimillus. The response of control fish to deionised water (negative control, no alarm substance stimulus) was also analyzed. The alarm substance elicited a behavioural response in the control fish characterized by an immediate freeze response and the slower resumption of swimming activity compared to negative controls exposed to the sham deionised water stimuli. In fish exposed to Cu NPs, the behavioural response to alarm substance was eliminated, with no significant difference in behaviours compared to negative controls. In comparison, exposure to 50 mu g l(-1) Cu as CuSO4 decreased, but did not eliminate the response of fish to alarm substance, which indicated a significantly greater effect of Cu NPs on olfactory mediated behaviours than of the equivalent concentration of Cu as CuSO4. Measurement of total Cu concentrations in the tissues of fish demonstrated no significant accumulation of Cu from any treatment in gill, liver or brain, confirming the effects of Cu NPs, and to a lesser extent CuSO4, on behavioural responses were mostly associated with the interaction of the materials with the external surfaces of the fish. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that Cu as CuSO4 caused a pronounced depletion of ciliated sensory and non-sensory cells in the olfactory rosette surrounding the midline raphe, whereas Cu NPs had no impact on the structure of the rosette. However, exposure to Cu NPs caused a significant increase in the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione in brains of fish, indicating some systemic oxidative stress that was not observed in either controls or fish exposed to CuSO4. Overall, the study showed that the olfactory mediated behaviours of fish were potentially more sensitive to Cu NPs than CuSO4 and NPs elicited effects via a mechanism that is distinct from that of the metal salt.

Here, we examine the impact of lifelong exposure to two concentrations (0.7 and 5.3 mu g/L) of the antidepressant fluoxetine on fecundity and social behavior (i.e. sociability and male-male aggression) in the turquoise killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri. When exposed to the highest concentration of fluoxetine (5.3 mu g/L), fish were smaller at maturation but they more frequently engaged in mating. In addition, in both fluoxetine treatments females roughly doubled their overall fecundity while egg fertilization rates were the same for exposed and unexposed fish. Although aggression of male fish was not impacted by fluoxetine exposure, exposed male fish (5.3 mu g/L) spent more time in the proximity of a group of conspecifics, which implies an increased sociability in these individuals. Overall, the results of this study indicate that exposure to fluoxetine may result in disrupted male sociability, increased mating frequency and an increased reproductive output in fish populations.

In recent years, concern has been mounting over a group of endocrine disruptors known as hormonal growth promotants (HGPs), which are natural and synthetic chemicals used to promote growth in livestock by targeting the endocrine system. One of the most potent compounds to enter the environment as a result of HGP use is 17 beta-trenbolone, which has repeatedly been detected in aquatic habitats. Although recent research has revealed that 17 beta-trenbolone can interfere with mechanisms of sexual selection, its potential to impact sequential female mate choice remains unknown, as is true for all EDCs. To address this, we exposed female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to 17 beta-trenbolone at an environmentally relevant level (average measured concentration: 2 ng/L) for 21 days using a flow-through system. We then compared the response of unexposed and exposed females to sequentially presented stimulus (i.e., unexposed) males that varied in their relative body area of orange pigmentation, as female guppies have a known preference for orange colouration in males. We found that, regardless of male orange pigmentation, both unexposed and exposed females associated with males indiscriminately during their first male encounter. However, during the second male presentation, unexposed females significantly reduced the amount of time they spent associating with low-orange males if they had previously encountered a high orange male. Conversely, 17 beta-trenbolone-exposed females associated with males indiscriminately (i.e., regardless of orange colouration) during both their first and second male encounter, and, overall, associated with males significantly less than did unexposed females during both presentations. This is the first study to demonstrate altered sequential female mate choice resulting from exposure to an endocrine disruptor, highlighting the need for a greater understanding of how EDCs may impact complex mechanisms of sexual selection.

The effects of agricultural pesticides on honeybee health have therefore raised concern. Bees can be exposed to multiple pesticides that may interact synergistically, amplifying their side effects. Attention has focused on neonicotinoid pesticides, but flupyradifur-one (FPF) is a novel butenolide insecticide that is also systemic and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. We therefore tested the lethal and sublethal toxic effects of FPF over different seasons and worker types, and the interaction of FPF with a common SBI fungicide, propiconazole. We provide the first demonstration of adverse synergistic effects on bee survival and behaviour (poor coordination, hyperactivity, apathy) even at FPF field-realistic doses (worst-case scenarios). Pesticide effects were significantly influenced by worker type and season. Foragers were consistently more susceptible to the pesticides (4-fold greater effect) than in-hive bees, and both worker types were more strongly affected by FPF in summer as compared with spring. Because risk assessment (RA) requires relatively limited tests that only marginally address bee behaviour and do not consider the influence of bee age and season, our results raise concerns about the safety of approved pesticides, including FPF.

In particular, managed honey bees (Apis mellifera) face multiple health risks including nutritional stress, exposure to pests and pathogens, poor queen quality, and pesticide contamination, which cause problems at the individual and colony levels. One of the gravest problems faced by honey bees is parasitization by the mite Varroa destructor, which is typically controlled through the application of miticides such as tau-fluvalinate, coumaphos, and amitraz. In addition to miticides, colonies are also exposed to pesticides brought by foragers from agricultural settings, including the fungicide chlorothalonil and the insecticide chlorpyrifos. Here, we explored whether exposure of wax to combinations of these pesticides during development affects honey bee queen physiology and worker behavior. To do this, we reared queens in plastic cups coated with molten beeswax that was either pesticide-free or containing field-relevant concentrations of tau-fluvalinate and coumaphos, amitraz, or chlorothalonil and chlorpyrifos. Once queens mated naturally, we placed them in observation hives to measure egg-laying rate and worker retinue size. We then dissected the queens and used the contents of their mandibular glands to measure worker attractiveness in caged bioassays and to analyze their chemical components using GC-MS. Exposure of wax to field-relevant concentrations of the tested pesticides during queen development significantly lowered the adult queens' egg-laying rate and worker retinue size. Miticide exposure during development also lowered the attractiveness of queen mandibular gland contents to workers and affected the relative amounts of the glands' chemical components. Our results support the ideas that mandibular gland pheromones act as honest indicators of queen reproductive fitness and that pesticide exposure of wax during bee development is an important and concerning factor impairing honey bee health.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  33     Cited Reference Count:  102,10.1007/s00265-020-2810-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Reproductive fitness;Queen health;Pheromones;QMP;Pesticides;Retinue behavior;Honesty;VARROA-DESTRUCTOR;NEONICOTINOID PESTICIDE;PRIMER PHEROMONES;COLONY LOSSES;JACOBSONI;WORKERS;FLUVALINATE;RESISTANCE;COMMUNICATION;APISTAN(R);Reproductive Behavior,NA,NA,queen honey bee <i>apis mellifera<i> pheromone and reproductive behavior are affected by pesticide exposure during development

Although such movements were precipitated by one individual, the success or failure of any attempt to instigate a collective movement was not solely dependent on this initiator's behavior but on the behavior of the group as a whole.

Cognitive abilities, such as perception, attention, learning, memory, and inhibitory control, aid in forming and maintaining social relationships. We investigate whether there is evidence that individual variation in these abilities influences individual variation in social relationships. We then consider the evolutionary consequences of the interaction between sociality and cognitive ability to address whether bi-directional relationships exist between the two, such that cognition can both shape and be shaped by social interactions and the social environment. In doing so, we suggest that social network analysis is emerging as a powerful tool that can be used to test for directional causal relationships between sociality and cognition.

Behaviour is the interface between an organism and its environment, and behavioural plasticity is important for organisms to cope with environmental change. Social behaviour is particularly important because sociality is a dynamic process, where environmental variation influences group dynamics and social plasticity can mediate resource acquisition. Heterogeneity in the ecological environment can therefore influence the social environment. The combination of the ecological and social environments may be interpreted collectively as the socioecological environment, which could explain variation in fitness.        2. Our objective was to outline a framework through which individual social and spatial phenotypes can be integrated and interpreted as phenotypes that covary as a function of changes in the socioecological environment. We propose the socioecological environment is composed of individual behavioural traits, including sociality and habitat selection, both of which are repeatable, potentially heritable and may reflect animal personality traits. We also highlight how ecological and social niche theory can be applied to the socioecological environment framework, where individuals occupy different socioecological niches. Individual sociality and habitat selection are also density-dependent, and theory predicts that density-dependent traits should affect reproduction, survival, and therefore fitness and population dynamics.        3. We then illustrate the proximate links between sociality, habitat selection and fitness as well as the ultimate, and possibly adaptive, consequences associated with changes in population density. The ecological, evolutionary and applied implications of our proposed socioecological environment framework are broad and changes in density could influence individual fitness and population dynamics. For instance, human-induced environmental changes can influence population density, which can affect the distribution of social and spatial phenotypes within a population. In summary, we outline a conceptual framework that incorporates individual social and spatial behavioural traits with fitness and we highlight a range of ecological and evolutionary processes that are likely associated with the socioecological environment.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  60     Total Times Cited:  66     Cited Reference Count:  96,10.1111/1365-2656.12773     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),adaptive landscape;animal personality;ecological niche;indirect genetic effects;isodar analysis;quantitative genetics;resource selection function;social network analysis;social niche specialization;socioecological environment;FISSION-FUSION DYNAMICS;COLLECTIVE DECISION-MAKING;HABITAT SELECTION;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;RESOURCE SELECTION;GROUP-SIZE;PERSONALITY;PREDATION,NA,NA,an evolutionary framework outlining the integration of individual social and spatial ecology

We conducted experiments to test whether chronic exposure to a maximally environmentally relevant concentration of fluoxetine (2.7 mu g day(-1)) altered courtship behaviour and female reproductive physiology in wild-caught starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a species commonly found foraging on invertebrates at wastewater treatment plants. When paired with a female over two days, males sang less and were more aggressive towards fluoxetine-treated females than controls. Fluoxetine-treated females were initially aggressive towards males, becoming significantly less aggressive by the second day. In contrast, control females expressed intermediate levels of aggression throughout. We found no effect of female treatment on female courtship behaviour. Female body condition, circulating testosterone and circulating oestradiol were unaffected by treatment and did not account for male preference.

Pollinators perform sophisticated behaviours while foraging that require them to learn and remember floral traits associated with food, but we know relatively little about the way that combined exposure to multiple pesticides affects neural function and behaviour. The experiments reported here show that prolonged exposure to field-realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor coumaphos and their combination impairs olfactory learning and memory formation in the honeybee. Using a method for classical conditioning of proboscis extension, honeybees were trained in either a massed or spaced conditioning protocol to examine how these pesticides affected performance during learning and short- and long-term memory tasks. We found that bees exposed to imidacloprid, coumaphos, or a combination of these compounds, were less likely to express conditioned proboscis extension towards an odor associated with reward. Bees exposed to imidacloprid were less likely to form a long-term memory, whereas bees exposed to coumaphos were only less likely to respond during the short-term memory test after massed conditioning. Imidacloprid, coumaphos and a combination of the two compounds impaired the bees' ability to differentiate the conditioned odour from a novel odour during the memory test.

Numerous studies on active avoidance and drift by aquatic organisms, as well as the main approaches used to measure both responses, were reviewed. We put forward a particular recommendation regarding methodological approaches: active avoidance should preferably be evaluated under a dilution gradient in a multi-compartmented system instead of in a bi-compartmented system. Available data on spatial avoidance from contamination indicate that emigration can occur at even lower contaminant concentrations than sub-individual noxious effects (assessed with the traditional forced-exposure assays), challenging the widely accepted paradigm in ecotoxicology that contaminant-driven adverse consequences at the population level result from a time delayed cascade of sequentially linked biochemical, cellular, physiological, and finally whole organism deleterious effects. Therefore, contaminants should not be viewed solely as potential toxicants at the individual level, but also as potential disturbers of habitats, by making the latter, at least partially, unsuited to accommodate life. Also, exposure to contamination is needed to trigger avoidance, but uptake is not mandatory, which demands the concept of exposure to be expanded, to include also the mere perception of the stressor. Since emigration eventually leads to local population extinction, and thus to severe implications for ecosystem structure and functioning, we then recommend that avoidance data be incorporated in environmental risk assessment schemes.

First, we contrast mean fitness and local adaptation measures and show that the latter can be expressed in a simple and general way as a function of the spatial covariance between population mean phenotype and local environmental conditions. Second, we develop several approximations of a population genetics model to show that the system exhibits different behaviours depending on the rate of migration. The main insights are the following: with intermediate migration, both genetic drift and migration decrease local adaptation; with low migration, drift decreases local adaptation but migration speeds up adaptation; with high migration, genetic drift has no effect on local adaptation.

First, we show that between 65% and 86% of human drug targets are evolutionarily conserved in 12 diverse fish species. Focusing on nuclear steroid hormone receptors, we further show that the sequence of the ligand binding domain that plays a key role in drug potency is highly conserved, but there is variation between species. This variation for the oestrogen receptor, however, does not obviously account for observed differences in receptor activation. Taking the synthetic oestrogen ethinyloestradiol as a test case, and using life-table-response experiments, we demonstrate significant reductions in population growth in fathead minnow and medaka, but not zebrafish, for environmentally relevant exposures. This finding contrasts with zebrafish being ranked as more ecologically susceptible, according to two independent life-history analyses. We conclude that while most drug targets are conserved in fish, evolutionary divergence in drug-target activation, physiology, behaviour and ecological life history make it difficult to predict population-level effects.

Recent discoveries that species diversity is positively associated with ecosystem stability, recovery, and services have made a community-level perspective on ecotoxicology more important than ever. Community ecotoxicology must explicitly consider both present and impending global change and shift from a purely descriptive to a more predictive science. Greater consideration of the ecological factors and threshold responses that determine community resistance and resilience should improve our ability to predict how and when communities will respond to, and recover from, xenobiotics. A better understanding of pollution-induced community tolerance, and of the costs of this tolerance, should facilitate identifying contaminant-impacted communities, thus forecasting the ecological consequences of contaminant exposure and determining the restoration effectiveness. Given the vast complexity of community ecotoxicology, simplifying assumptions, such as the possibility that the approximately 100,000 registered chemicals could be reduced to a more manageable number of contaminant classes with similar modes of action, must be identified and validated. In addition to providing a framework for predicting contaminant fate and effects, food-web ecology can help to identify communities that are sensitive to contaminants, contaminants that are particularly insidious to communities, and species that are crucial for transmitting adverse effects across trophic levels.

These chemicals, commonly referred to as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (hereafter EDCs), pose a particularly severe threat to animal health. They accumulate in body tissues and are highly persistent in the environment and thus can occur at significant concentrations far from their points of origin. Ecotoxicologists have used a number of animal species to identify physiological and morphological consequences of EDC exposure. Effects of exposure have typically been measured in terms of survival, development or aspects of reproductive anatomy and physiology. In recent years, ecotoxicologists have begun using behavioural endpoints as components of standard toxicological assays. There has been a concurrent although less widespread interest among animal behaviourists in understanding and studying the effects of these contaminants on animal behaviour. The purposes of this review are four-fold. First, we provide a primer on EDCs. Second, we summarize current knowledge about endocrine disruption of animal behaviour. Third, we describe the role that we envision for behaviour in the field of ecotoxicology. Finally, we hope to stimulate a dialogue between animal behaviourists and ecotoxicologists that will enhance our understanding of these environmental contaminants and their impacts on animal populations.

Although the act of moving from one habitat to another entails major costs to the disperser, empirical and theoretical studies suggest that these costs can be reduced by having morphological, physiological or behavioural specializations for dispersal. A few recent studies on different systems showed that individuals exhibit personality-dependent dispersal, meaning that dispersal tendency is associated with boldness, sociability or aggressiveness. Indeed, in several species, dispersers not only develop behavioural differences at the onset of dispersal, but display these behavioural characteristics through their life cycle. While personality-dependent dispersal has been demonstrated in only a few species, we believe that it is a widespread phenomenon with important ecological consequences. Here, we review the evidence for behavioural differences between dispersers and residents, to what extent they constitute personalities. We also examine how a link between personality traits and dispersal behaviours can be produced and how personality-dependent dispersal affects the dynamics of metapopulations and biological invasions. Finally, we suggest future research directions for population biologists, behavioural ecologists and conservation biologists such as how the direction and the strength of the relationship between personality traits and dispersal vary with ecological contexts.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  482     Total Times Cited:  562     Cited Reference Count:  96,10.1098/rstb.2010.0176     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),dispersal;behavioural syndrome;colonization;invasion;metapopulation dynamics;G x E interactions;CONSISTENT INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;RISK-TAKING BEHAVIOR;NATAL DISPERSAL;COMMON LIZARD;RHESUS MACAQUES;RANGE EXPANSION;BODY CONDITION;GREAT TITS;CORTICOSTERONE;EVOLUTION,NA,NA,personalitydependent dispersal characterization ontogeny and consequences for spatially structured populations

Studies of invertebrates, fish and amphibians have shown that non-lethal effects may be larger than lethal effects in determining the behaviour, condition, density and distribution of animals over a range of trophic levels. Although non-lethal effects have been well described in the behavioural ecology of birds (and also mammals) within the context of anti-predation behaviour, their role relative to lethal effects is probably underestimated. Birds show many behavioural and physiological changes to reduce direct mortality from predation and these are likely to have negative effects on other aspects of their fitness and population dynamics, as well as affecting the ecology of their own prey and their predators. As a consequence, the effects of predation in birds are best measured by trade-offs between maximizing instantaneous survival in the presence of predators and acquiring or maintaining resources for long-term survival or reproduction. Because avoiding predation imposes foraging costs, and foraging behaviour is relatively easy to measure in birds, the foraging-predation risk trade-off is probably an effective framework for understanding the importance of non-lethal effects, and so the population and community effects of predation risk in birds and other animals. Using a trade-off approach allows us to predict better how changes in predator density will impact on population and community dynamics, and how animals perceive and respond to predation risk, when non-lethal effects decouple the relationship between predator density and direct mortality rate. The trade-off approach also allows us to identify where predation risk is structuring communities because of avoidance of predators, even when this results in no observable direct mortality rate.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  257     Total Times Cited:  317     Cited Reference Count:  157,10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00793.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),indirect effects;predation risk;starvation risk;trait-mediated effects;trait-mediated interactions;MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS;BLACKBIRDS TURDUS-MERULA;GREY PARTRIDGES PERDIX;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;HABITAT SELECTION;TROPHIC CASCADE;TRADE-OFFS;RED GROUSE;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSES;INTRAGUILD PREDATION;Prednisolone,NA,NA,nonlethal effects of predation in birds

The odourants L-alanine and taurocholic acid (TCA) specifically activate microvillous or ciliated OSNs, respectively, in fish. We recorded electro-olfactograms (EOG) in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas; a laboratory-reared model species) and wild yellow perch (Perca flavescens) whose olfactory chambers were perfused with either L-alanine or TCA to determine if OSN classes were differentially vulnerable to contaminants, in this case copper or nickel. Results were consistent in both species and demonstrated that nickel targeted and impaired microvillous OSN function, while copper targeted and impaired ciliated OSN function. This result suggests that contaminant-specific effects observed in model laboratory species extrapolate to wild fish populations. Moreover, fathead minnows exposed to copper failed to perceive a conspecific alarm cue in a choice maze, whereas those exposed to nickel could respond to the same conspecific cue. These results demonstrate that fathead minnows perceive conspecific, damage-released alarm cue by ciliated, but not microvillous, OSNs. Fish living in copper-contaminated environments may be more vulnerable to predation than those in clean lakes owing to targeted effects on ciliated OSNs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A few examples of studies performed since the 1960s are discussed to highlight the sensitivity of these approaches in investigating the effects of chemicals, including priority pollutants and emerging contaminants, relative to conventional toxicity tests measuring survival.        The advantage of the behavioural response is due to the integration of biochemical and physiological processes that reflect changes at higher levels of organisation with ecological relevance. Avoidance often represents a behavioural symptom easily detected in many animals exposed to contaminants and would be a useful test to explore more widely. This rapid response would reflect a defence mechanism protective against further exposure and the potential development of more pronounced deleterious effects, whilst in some cases, escape could lead to the relocation of a species with negative consequences. An investigation of the avoidance behaviour of mud shrimp, Corophium volutator, along with the chemical analyses of sediments and amphipods to assess the quality of harbour sediments is summarised. The body burden of the amphipods was 1,000 times lower than the one associated with narcosis, emphasizing the sensitivity of this endpoint. The application of this acute toxicity test is briefly compared to additional work that involved intertidal mussels collected in the field.

Whether behaviour in captivity is analogous to behaviour in the wild, however, is seldom tested. We compared individual behaviour between captivity and the wild in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Over two winters, 125 blue tits were briefly brought into captivity to measure exploratory tendency and neophobia using variants of standard personality assays. Each was then released, fitted with a passive integrated transponder. Using an electronic monitoring system, we then recorded individuals' use of feeders as they foraged in the wild. We used variation in the discovery of new feeders to score 91 birds for exploratory tendency in the wild. At eight permanent feeding stations, 78 birds were assayed for neophobia in the wild. Behavioural variation in the captive personality trials was independent of permanent (e.g. sex) and nonpermanent (e.g. condition or weather) sources of between-individual variation at capture. Individual exploratory tendency and neophobia were consistent and repeatable in captivity, and analogous traits were repeatable in the wild; thus all constituted personality traits in the blue tit. Exploratory tendency and neophobia were not correlated with each other, in either the captive or the wild context. Therefore they are independent traits in blue tits, in contrast to many species. Finally, exploratory tendency and neophobia measured in captivity positively predicted the analogous traits measured in the wild. Reflecting differences in the use of feeding opportunities, personality in captivity therefore revealed relevant differences in foraging behaviour between individuals.

If these differences extend to pertinent natural environmental changes, which indicate changing predation or starvation threat, then personality may reflect important variation in how animals manage risk. We examined whether personality traits classified in captivity would predict the behavioral flexibility of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus as they foraged in the wild. Behavioral flexibility was defined as the tendency to adjust feeder use with changing winter air temperature, an indicator of starvation risk. At the population level, birds reduced their feeder use on warm days. Individuals, though, varied widely, with some instead using feeders at a relatively fixed, temperature-independent rate. Sex and size, correlates of dominance in blue tits, did not predict behavioral flexibility. Instead, behavioral flexibility was predicted by age and 2 personality traits: old, neophobic, and exploratory birds were more behaviorally flexible than young, neophilic, and nonexploratory birds. Our findings suggest that personality types differ in how they use information about their environments and hence cope with environmental change.A bird's response to the weather depends on their personality. Individual birds, like humans, respond differently to the same novel or threatening situations. In winter, when starvation risk is greatest, blue tits varied in foraging strategy. Shy but exploratory individuals adjusted their feeder use with air temperature, feeding most on cold days. Bold but less exploratory individuals fed at a fixed rate all winter. Thus, personality may predict how individuals cope with environmental change.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  39     Total Times Cited:  50     Cited Reference Count:  49,10.1093/beheco/aru131     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioral plasticity;Cyanistes caeruleus;environmental change;exploration;neophobia;starvation risk;INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR;NOVELTY RESPONSES;PARUS-CAERULEUS;PREDATION RISK;SELECTION;ECOLOGY;BIRD;REPEATABILITY;INFORMATION,NA,NA,personality predicts behavioral flexibility in a fluctuating natural environment

Endocrine disruption can be profound because of the crucial role hormones play in controlling development."" Since that time, there have been numerous documented examples of adverse effects of EDCs in invertebrates, fish, wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. Hormonal systems can be disrupted by numerous different anthropogenic chemicals including antiandrogens, androgens, estrogens, AhR agonists, inhibitors of steroid hormone synthesis, antithyroid substances, and retinoid agonists. In addition, pathways and targets for endocrine disruption extend beyond the traditional estrogen/androgen/thyroid receptor-mediated reproductive and developmental systems. For example, scientists have expressed concern about the potential role of EDCs in increasing trends in early puberty in girls, obesity and type II diabetes in the United States and other populations. New concerns include complex endocrine alterations induced by mixtures of chemicals, an issue broadened due to the growing awareness that EDCs present in the environment include a variety of potent human and veterinary pharmaceutical products, personal care products, nutraceuticals and phytosterols.

Algal, microbial, zooplankton and benthic invertebrate communities showed no declines in abundance during three summers of EE2 additions (5-6 ng l(-1)), indicating no direct toxic effects. Recruitment of fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) failed, leading to a near-extirpation of this species both 2 years during (young-of-year, YOY) and 2 years following (adults and YOY) EE2 additions. Body condition of male lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and male and female white sucker (Catostomus commersonii) declined before changes in prey abundance, suggesting direct effects of EE2 on this endpoint. Evidence of indirect effects of EE2 was also observed. Increases in zooplankton, Chaoborus, and emerging insects were observed after 2 or 3 years of EE2 additions, strongly suggesting indirect effects mediated through the reduced abundance of several small-bodied fishes. Biomass of top predator lake trout declined by 23-42% during and after EE2 additions, most probably an indirect effect from the loss of its prey species, the fathead minnow and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus).

Also, the API manufacturing sector is gradually shifting to countries with lower production costs. This paper focuses mainly on APIs for human consumption and highlights key differences between the low-, middle-and high-income countries, covering factors such as population and demographics, manufacture, prescriptions, treatment, disposal and reuse of waste and wastewater. The striking differences in populations (both human and animal), urbanization, sewer connectivity and other factors have revealed that the environmental compartments receiving the bulk of API residues differ markedly between low-and high-income countries. High sewer connectivity in developed countries allows capture and treatment of the waste stream (point-source). However, in many low-or middle-income countries, sewerage connectivity is generally low and in some areas waste is collected predominantly in septic systems. Consequently, the diffuse-source impact, such as on groundwater from leaking septic systems or on land due to disposal of raw sewage or septage, may be of greater concern. A screening level assessment of potential burdens of APIs in urban and rural environments of countries representing low-and middle-income as well as high-income has been made.

Unfortunately, standardized approaches, including HTS experimental designs, for examining fish behavioral responses to contaminants are rarely available. In the present study, we examined movement behavior of larval zebrafish over 7 days (4-10 days post fertilization or dpf) during typical daylight workday hours to determine whether intrinsic activity differed with age and time of day. We then employed an early life stage approach using the Fish Embryo Test (FET) at multiple developmental ages to evaluate whether photomotor response (PMR) behavior differed with zebrafish age following exposure to diazinon (DZN), a well-studied orthophosphate insecticide, and diphenhydramine (DPH), an antihistamine that also targets serotonin reuptake transporters and the acetylcholine receptor. 72 h studies were conducted at 1-4, 4-7 and 7-10 dpf, followed by behavioral observations using a ViewPoint system at 4, 7 and 10 dpf. Distance traveled and swimming speeds were quantified; nominal treatment levels were analytically verified by isotope-dilution LC-MSMS. Larval zebrafish locomotion displayed significantly different (p < 0.05) activity profiles over the course of typical daylight and workday hours, and these time of day PMR activity profiles were similar across ages examined (4-10 dpf). 10 dpf zebrafish larvae were consistently more sensitive to DPH than either the 4 or 7 dpf larvae with an environmentally realistic lowest observed effect concentration of 200 ng/L. Though ELS and FET studies with zebrafish typically focus on mortality or teratogenicity in 0-4 dpf organisms, behavioral responses of slightly older fish were several orders of magnitude more sensitive to DPH. Our observations highlight the importance of understanding the influence of time of day on intrinsic locomotor activity, and the age-specific hazards of aquatic contaminants to fish behavior.

To what extent such pharmaceutical contamination accumulates and disperses over time in different compartments of aquatic food webs is not well known. In this study we assess to what extent five pharmaceuticals (diphenhydramine, oxazepam, trimethopiim, diclofenac, and hydroxyzine) are taken up by fish (European perch) and four aquatic invertebrate taxa (damselfly larvae, mayfly larvae, waterlouse, and ramshorn snail), by tracing their bioconcentrations over several months in a semi-natural large-scale (pond) system. The results suggest both significant differences among drugs in their capacity to bioaccumulate and differences among species in uptake. While no support for in situ uptake of diclofenac and trimethoprim was found, oxazepam, cliphenhyclramine, and hydroxyzine were detected in all analyzed species. Here, the highest bioaccumulation factor (tissue:water ratio) was found for hydroxyzine. In the food web, the highest concentrations were found in the benthic species ramshorn snail and waterlouse, indicating that bottom-living organism at lower trophic positions are the prime receivers of the pharmaceuticals. In general, concentrations in the biota decreased over time in response to decreasing water concentrations. However, two interesting exceptions to this trend were noted. First, mayfly larvae (primarily grazers) showed peak concentrations (a fourfold increase) of oxazepam, cliphenhydramine, and hydroxyzine about 30 days after initial addition of pharmaceuticals. Second, perch (top-predator) showed an increase in concentrations of oxazepam throughout the study period. Our results show that drugs can remain bioavailable for aquatic organism for long time periods (weeks to months) and even re-enter the food web at a later time. As such, for an understanding of accumulation and dispersion of pharmaceuticals in aquatic food webs, detailed ecological knowledge is required. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

One year-old partridges (n = 42 pairs) were fed for 10 days in spring (prior to breeding) with wheat treated with difenoconazole (fungicide), thiram (fungicide) or imidacloprid (insecticide), using two doses for each pesticide (the one recommended, and its double to represent potential cases of abuse of pesticides). We investigated the direct and indirect effects on the body condition, physiology, immunology, coloration and subsequent reproduction of exposed partridges. For the latter, eggs were collected, measured and incubated and the growth and survival of chicks were monitored. Thiram and imidacloprid at high exposure doses produced mortalities of 41.6 and 58.3 %, respectively. The first death was observed at day 3 for imidacloprid and at day 7 for thiram. Both doses of the three pesticides caused sublethal effects, such as altered biochemical parameters, oxidative stress and reduced carotenoid-based coloration. The high exposure doses of imidacloprid and thiram also produced a decrease in cellular immune response measured by the phytohemagglutinin test in males. Bearing in mind the limitation of the small number of surviving pairs in some treatments, we found that the three pesticides reduced the size of eggs and imidacloprid and difenoconazole also reduced the fertilization rate.

Unfortunately, speciation biologists often consider sexual selection in isolation from natural selection, even though sexually selected traits evolve in an ecological context: both preferences and traits are often subject to natural selection. Conversely, while behavioural ecologists may address ecological effects on sexual communication, they rarely measure the consequences for population divergence. Herein, we review the empirical literature addressing the mechanisms by which natural selection and sexual selection can interact during speciation. We find that convincing evidence for any of these scenarios is thin. However, the available data strongly support various diversifying effects that emerge from interactions between sexual selection and environmental heterogeneity.

This has become an issue of considerable concern as vultures are a keystone species and their decline has a range of socio-economic, as well as cultural and biodiversity impacts. In this paper, we review these impacts and estimate in detail the economic cost of one of them: the human health impacts of the vulture decline. Livestock carcasses provide the main food supply for vultures, and are also eaten by dogs. Dogs are the main source of rabies in humans in India, and their populations have increased substantially in parallel with the vulture decline. The potential human health impact of rabies associated with the vulture decline is found to be significant. This, and a wide range of other impacts suggest that significant resources should be put into (1) testing of pharmaceutical products to ensure that similar situations are not repeated, (2) helping vulture populations to recover through the use of alternative drugs to diclofenac that are of low toxicity to vultures, and (3) through conservation breeding programmes.

Here, we show for the first time that birds foraging on invertebrates contaminated with environmental pollutants, show marked changes in both brain and behaviour. We found that male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) exposed to environmentally relevant levels of synthetic and natural estrogen mimics developed longer and more complex songs compared to control males, a sexually selected trait important in attracting females for reproduction. Moreover, females preferred the song of males which had higher pollutant exposure, despite the fact that experimentally dosed males showed reduced immune function. We also show that the key brain area controlling male song complexity (HVC) is significantly enlarged in the contaminated birds. This is the first evidence that environmental pollutants not only affect, but paradoxically enhance a signal of male quality such as song. Our data suggest that female starlings would bias their choice towards exposed males, with possible consequences at the population level.

Previous theoretical models of the effect of sexual selection on average individual fitness in a population have mostly predicted that sexually selected populations should adapt faster and clear deleterious mutations more quickly than populations where sexual selection is not operating.        2. While some laboratory studies have supported these predictions, others have not and studies of field systems have tended to find negative effects of sexual selection, or no effect. The negative effects of sexual selection found in field and other studies are usually ascribed to the costs associated with strong sexual selection acting on the population.        3. Here, using an individual-based model that allows feedback between demographic and evolutionary processes, we find that sexual selection can lead to both increases and decreases in population-level fitness measures such as extinction probability and adaptation rate. Whether fitness increases or decreases depends on a variety of environmental and demographic factors including the nature of environmental change, the carrying capacity of the environment, the average fecundity of the population in question and the strength of condition dependence.        4. In many cases, our model predicts that sexual selection leads to higher extinction probability in small populations because of an increased risk of demographic stochasticity, but lower extinction probability in larger populations because of faster adaptation rates. This is consistent with field studies that have mostly focussed on very small populations such as recently introduced birds, and tend to find negative effects, and also with laboratory studies that tend to use larger populations and have tended to find positive effects.        5.

Selection of genetically inherited tolerance on exposed populations, here referred as micro-evolution due to pollution, has been recognized as one of the causes of these changes. However, there is a gap between studies addressing this process and those assessing effects at higher levels of biological organization. In this review we attempt to address these evolutionary considerations into the ecological risk assessment (ERA) of polluting events and to trigger the discussion about the consequences of this process for the ecosystem response to toxic stress. We provide clear evidence that pollution drives micro-evolutionary processes in several species. When this process occurs, populations inhabiting environments that become polluted may persist. However, due to the existence of ecological costs derived from the loss of genetic variability, negative pleiotropy with fitness traits and/or from physiological alterations, micro-evolution due to pollution may alter different properties of the affected populations. Despite the existence of empirical evidence showing that safety margins currently applied in the ERA process may account for pollution-induced genetic changes in tolerance, information regarding long-term ecological consequences at higher levels of biological organization due to ecological costs is not explicitly considered in these procedures. In relation to this, we present four testable hypotheses considering that micro-evolution due to pollution acts upon the variability of functional response traits of the exposed populations and generates changes on their functional effect traits, therefore, modifying the way species exploit their ecological niches and participate in the overall ecosystem functioning.

Changes in these end-points resulting from chemical exposure can cause alterations in micro-evolutionary forces (mutation, drift, selection and gene flow) that control the genetic composition of populations. With multi-generation exposures, anthropogenic contamination can lead to a population with an altered genetic composition, which may respond differently to future stressors. These evolutionary changes are rarely discussed in regulatory or risk assessment frameworks, but the growing body of literature that documents their existence suggests that these important population-level impacts should be considered. In this meta-analysis we have compared existing contamination levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that have been documented to be associated with evolutionary changes in resident aquatic organisms to regulatory benchmarks for these contaminants. The original intent of this project was to perform a meta-analysis on evolutionary events associated with PCB and PAH contamination. However, this effort was hindered by a lack of consistency in congener selection for ""total"" PCB or PAH measurements. We expanded this manuscript to include a discussion of methods used to determine PCB and PAH total contamination in addition to comparing regulatory guidelines and contamination that has caused evolutionary effects. Micro-evolutionary responses often lead populations onto unique and unpredictable trajectories. Therefore, to better understand the risk of population-wide alterations occurring, we need to improve comparisons of chemical contamination between affected locations. In this manuscript we offer several possibilities to unify chemical comparisons for PCBs and PAHs that would improve comparability among evolutionary toxicology investigations, and with regulatory guidelines.

Estimation of the likelihood of effects from exposures to sublethal concentrations of contaminants in effluent plumes downstream of point sources poses a challenge when conducting ecological risk assessments (ERAs). This is an issue for regulatory agencies worldwide. This paper reviews the importance and availability of information on behavioural toxicity and identifies opportunities for its inclusion in ERAs. One of the major advantages of using data on behavioural effects is that they are more sensitive indicators of potential for impacts on survival in the field than are measures of lethality. Indications from available data for fish suggest that behavioural effects of organic contaminants often occur at concentrations 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those found to elicit mortality. As a result, it is believed that the use of data on behavioural toxicity in ERAs could benefit the assessment process a great deal, allowing for the consideration of more ecologically significant and protective hazard and exposure scenarios.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  66     Total Times Cited:  74     Cited Reference Count:  57,10.1139/F09-069     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),UNDIRECTED LOCOMOTOR BEHAVIOR;SALMON ONCORHYNCHUS-KISUTCH;MEDAKA ORYZIAS-LATIPES;SUBLETHAL TOXICITY;MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS;AVOIDANCE;RESPONSES;STRESS;PREFERENCE;QUALIFICATION;Risk Assessment;Organic Chemicals,NA,NA,behavioural toxicity of organic chemical contaminants in fish application to ecological risk assessments eras

To inform this possibility, we studied the extent to which guppies (Poecilia reticulata) show local adaptation to oil pollution in southern Trinidad. Neutral genetic markers revealed that paired populations in oil-polluted versus not-polluted habitats diverged independently in two different watersheds. Morphometrics revealed some divergence (particularly in head shape) between these environments, some of which was parallel between rivers. Reciprocal transplant experiments in nature, however, found little evidence of local adaptation based on survival and growth. Moreover, subsequent laboratory experiments showed that the two populations from oil-polluted sites showed only weak local adaptation even when compared to guppies from oil-free northern Trinidad.

This was achieved by subjecting fluoxetine-exposed and unexposed guppies to a simulated bird strike and recording their subsequent behavioural responses. We found that exposure to fluoxetine affected the anti-predator behaviour of guppies, with exposed fish remaining stationary for longer (i.e. 'freezing' behaviour) after the simulated strike and also spending more time under plant cover. By contrast, con-trol fish were significantly more active and explored the tank more, as indicated by the distance covered per minute over the period fish spent swimming. Furthermore, behavioural shifts were sex-dependent, with evidence of a non-monotonic dose-response among the fluoxetine-exposed fish. This is one of the first studies to show that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of fluoxetine can alter the anti-predator behaviour of adult fish. In addition to the obvious repercussions for survival, impaired anti-predator behaviour can have direct impacts on fitness and influence the overall population dynamics of species.

Since avoidance has been shown to be a relevant behavioral endpoint, our aims were: (i) to determine if TCS is able to trigger an avoidance response in Poecilia reticulata; (ii) to predict the population immediate decline (PID) caused by TCS exposure, by integrating lethality and avoidance responses; and (iii) to verify the overestimation of risk when mortality is assessed under forced exposure. Fish were exposed to TCS in a forced exposure system, to assess mortality, and to a TCS gradient in a non-forced exposure (NFE) system. Two NFE scenarios were simulated: (#1) a spatially permanent gradient, including low and high concentrations; and (#2) a scenario with high concentrations, simulating a local discharge. The fish avoided TCS concentrations as low as 0.2 mu g L-1 (avoidance of 22%). The AC50 obtained from scenario #1 (8.04 mu g L-1) was about 15 times more sensitive than that from scenario #2 (118.4 mu g L-1). In general, up to the highest concentration tested (2000 mu g L-1), the PID was determined by the avoidance. Mortality from the forced exposure was overestimated (48 h-LC50 of 1650 mg L-1), relative to the NFE. The reduced mortality in a non-forced environment does not imply a lower effect, because part of the population is expected to disappear by moving towards favorable environments. TCS is a potential environmental disturber, since at environmentally relevant concentrations (< 2 mu g L-1) it could cause a decline in the fish population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here the physiological and behavioural effects of metal exposure in relation to monoaminergic systems were considered by exposing rainbow trout dyads, demonstrating stable dominance relationships, to cadmium or lead. Fish exposed to 4 mug l(-1) cadmium accumulated more cadmium at the gill than fish held in control water. Fish exposed to 7 mug l(-1) cadmium had higher gill, liver and kidney cadmium concentrations. No significant lead accumulation was seen after exposure to 46 mug l(-1) for 48 h but exposure to 325 mug l(-1) lead caused an increase in gill, liver and kidney lead concentrations. Brain accumulation of both cadmium and lead was only seen after exposure to the highest concentrations. Exposure to 4 or 7 mug l(-1) cadmium, or 46 or 325 mug l(-1) lead for 48 h did not disrupt established dominance hierarchies. As expected with this stable behavioural situation, in control pairs, animals of different social status displayed different physiological profiles. Subordinate fish had higher concentrations of circulating plasma cortisol and telencephalic 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (5-HIAA/5-HT) ratios. However, these physiological profiles were affected by metal exposure, with a trend towards higher serotonergic activity in dominant fish. Dominants exposed to 325 mug l(-1) lead had significantly higher hypothalamic 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios when compared with subordinates. The results demonstrate that if stable social hierarchies are established in control water they may not be affected by exposure to cadmium and lead although physiological changes may be evident.

Competitive behaviour of fish is influenced by the physiological ability to perceive and process information about potential opponents and the level of coordination and energy stores available to successfully perform during social encounters. Many trace metals are known to interfere with these physiological processes and can affect the ability of salmonid fish to form dominance hierarchies. Additionally, socially mediated differences in physiology occur among individual fish within a dominance hierarchy, which can result in specific social ranks becoming more susceptible to aquatic toxicants.

Evidence for altered physiology in fish as a consequence of endocrine disruption is global, with some of the most widely reported effects on sexual development and function. In recent years, research has shown that fish behaviors can also be affected by EDCs which potentially has wide implications for individual fitness and population level outcomes. This review presents a critical assessment on reported effects of EDCs on behavior in fish, focusing on behaviors associated with reproduction. We investigate commonalities and differences in sexual behaviors between fish species most commonly applied in ecotoxicology, drawing out common principles for impacts of EDCs and then reviewing the evidence for, and implications of, disruptions of these behaviors after exposures to EDCs. In an analysis of the reported effects of exposure to the estrogen ethinylestradiol, we show that life-stage at exposure is a key factor determining behavioral responses of affected populations. EDC-induced changes in behavior occur at similar concentrations as for established biomarker responses (e. g. vitellogenin induction for estrogens), indicating behavior is equally sensitive (and noninvasive) as an indicator of EDC exposure. Adopting behaviors in fish as indicators of chemical exposure and effects, however, still has many technical and interpretation challenges and there is very little information available on how behaviors under laboratory conditions equate with those occurring in wild populations.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  171     Total Times Cited:  188     Cited Reference Count:  193,10.3109/10408444.2012.692114     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemical pollutants;ecotoxicology;reproduction;ethinyestradiol;pharmaceutical;behavior;ZEBRAFISH DANIO-RERIO;ROACH RUTILUS-RUTILUS;MINNOW PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS;MALE 3-SPINED STICKLEBACK;GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE;MALE REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR;MALE FATHEAD MINNOWS;JAPANESE MEDAKA;MATE CHOICE;ENVIRONMENTAL ESTROGENS;Sexual Behavior,NA,NA,endocrine disrupting chemicals and sexual behaviors in fish a critical review on effects and possible consequences

However, few studies have investigated the impact of such contaminants on the behavior of individuals living in exposed waters. Contaminant exposure can affect animal populations by disrupting behaviors including feeding, locomotion, and mating. In this study, we examined how living in an ecosystem polluted by combinations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, iron, lead, zinc) impacts contest behavior in the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Fish collected from heavily contaminated and cleaner sites in Lake Ontario were subjected to a resource contest to determine the effect of these contaminants on aggression and the establishment of dominance hierarchies, which in turn influence access to food, shelter, and mating opportunities. Dominance establishment (a clear resource winner) was less obvious among fish from the contaminated site compared to the more stable hierarchies that formed between pairs of fish from the clean site. Pairs of fish from the contaminated site performed more assessment displays compared to fish from clean sites. These results suggest that the costs of living in an environment under exposure can shape behavioral repertoires. The altered conflict resolution strategies of contaminated fish may reflect impaired cognitive function, sensory perception, and/or higher metabolic load associated with aggression.

Large populations of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) persist in some of the most contaminated estuaries of the United States, and killifish studies have provided some of the first insights into the types of genomic changes that enable rapid evolutionary rescue from complexly degraded environments. We describe how selection by industrial-pollutants and other stressors has acted on multiple populations of killifish and posit that extreme nucleotide diversity uniquely positions this species for successful evolutionary adaptation. Mechanistic studies have identified some of the genetic underpinnings of adaptation to a well-studied class of toxic pollutants; however, multiple genetic regions under selection in wild populations seem to reflect more complex responses to diverse native stressors and/or compensatory responses to primary adaptation. The discovery of these pollution-adapted killifish populations suggests that the evolutionary influence of anthropogenic stressors as selective agents occurs widely.

Quantitative variation can even increase in bottlenecked populations although this effect seems unlikely to increase the adaptive potential of populations. Second, individuals in small populations have lower fitness owing to environmental stress and genetic problems such as inbreeding, which can substantially increase the extinction probability of populations in changing environments.

We compared Cd accumulation between three control lines and three lines selected successfully for an increased Cd-resistance. Individuals of the Cd-adapted lines had a lower short-term (2 h) uptake of Cd than those of the control lines. A time-series experiment showed that selection-line fish had a lower rate of Cd accumulation than fish from the control lines during the first 14 h of exposure to 6 mg/l of Cd. At the 14 h time point, Cd accumulation in the control-line fish approached lethal levels, while Cd levels in selection-line fish from this point on increased at a slower rate than in the initial 14 h. Overall, the relatively small changes in uptake and accumulation patterns caused lethal body burdens in the fish from the selection lines to be reached at more than twice the exposure duration at which this occurred in fish from the control lines. Lethal Cd levels appeared to be the same in control- and selection-line fish.

We reviewed published evidence and found that EDCs also have adverse effects on a wide range of behaviours, including sexual and other reproductive behaviours, activity, motivation, communication, aggression, dominance and other social behaviours, and learning and other cognitive abilities. We also reviewed recent findings that challenge common assumptions in toxicology. For example, EDCs have several unanticipated properties, such as nonmonotonic dose effects and synergy. Furthermore, harmful effects of EDCs sometimes become apparent only when tested in natural ecological conditions, such as social stress and infection. These findings raise questions about the practicality and feasibility of testing chemical pollutants adequately. Finally, we discuss the implications of EDC research for species conservation and human health, and how toxicology and behavioural research might be better integrated. Behaviour might provide a useful indicator or biomarker for detecting harmful chemical contaminants; however, more integration between toxicology and behavioural ecology is needed to determine whether and how EDCs affect humans and other vertebrates outside of the laboratory.

Here we show experimentally that individual brown trout Salmo trutta (L.) made sequential use of foraging areas, with dominant individuals feeding mainly at the most beneficial times of dusk and the early part of the night while more subordinate fish fed at other times.        3. However, the degree of overlap in foraging times between high-ranking fish was dependent on energetic demands. At low temperatures (when requirements were low) the temporal activity patterns of top-ranking fish were synchronized, with foraging concentrated at the preferred times. In contrast, when temperature was raised to increase energetic requirements, activity patterns showed strong temporal segregation: the most dominant fish remained predominantly nocturnal, whereas second-ranking fish became increasingly diurnal.        4.

For this purpose, two males were placed in an aquarium (60 x 25 x 25 cm) that was divided into two equal compartments by a clear, perforated Plexiglas wall. The aquarium was filled with untreated water as control, and with polluted water under experimental conditions. After 24 h, one male (intruder) was placed in the other male's (resident) half of the aquarium. The behaviour of both males, particularly, air gulping rate, latency to first bite and to first opercular expansion, were recorded. The results indicate that the males under treatment conditions were less aggressive than those under control conditions.

Traditionally, female ornaments have been considered nonfunctional, being merely a genetically correlated response to selection for male ornamentation. However, this hypothesis is only relevant to species in which the ornament is basically the same in the two sexes. Alternatively, female ornaments may be influenced by selection acting directly on the females, either through female-female competition or male choice. We tested the latter hypothesis in mate-choice experiments with two-spotted gobies (Gobiusculus flavescens). In this small marine fish, females have bright yellow-orange bellies during the breeding season, a conspicuous trait that is not present in males. We conducted two aquarium experiments to test whether males preferred to mate with more colorful females. In the first experiment, males had a choice between two females that varied in natural coloration (and belly roundness). In the second experiment, we manipulated belly coloration and kept roundness constant. Males spent more time with colorful than with drab females in both experiments and also performed far more courtship displays toward colorful females. our study provides experimental evidence that males prefer ornamented females in a fish that is not sex-role reversed, supporting the hypothesis that female ornamentation is sexually selected.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  302     Total Times Cited:  352     Cited Reference Count:  49,10.1073/pnas.211439298     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),SEXUAL SELECTION;PARENTAL INVESTMENT;DICHROMATISM;EVOLUTION;IMMUNOCOMPETENCE;STICKLEBACKS;ASTAXANTHIN;COMPETITION;DIMORPHISM;DIRECTION;Color,NA,NA,male mate choice selects for female coloration in a fish

None of the females exposed to 10 ng/L of EE2 participated in reproductive behavior with unexposed males. The reproductive trials in combination with a histological survey indicated that male fish with gonadal intersex (i.e., testis-ova) were still capable of reproductive behavior and could fertilize eggs. Even though females exposed to 10 ng/L EE2 had poor reproductive success, their ovaries showed normal development and oogenesis.

This potential threat to animal populations posed by xenoestrogens has, hardly surprisingly, been met by an intensive global effort to identify and develop biomarkers suitable for screening chemicals for estrogen mimicking capacity. Despite this effort, there are few biomarkers capable of linking exposure to xenoestrogens to impaired reproductive capability. The reproductive success of most animals depends strongly on the ability to perform the appropriate sexual behavior. The sexual display of the male guppy is strongly linked to reproductive success and is readily quantified under laboratory conditions. This preliminary study demonstrates that exposure of adult male guppies to water weakly contaminated with either natural estrogen (17 beta-estradiol) or the xenoestrogen (4-tert-octylphenol) causes a dramatic decrease in the rate and intensity of sexual display, It is concluded that quantitative analysis of the sexual display of male guppies holds great promise as a biomarker at the organismal level for the effects of estrogen mimicking xenobiotics.

In all 4 cyprinids, MT treatment increased the magnitudes and sensitivities of EOG response to prostaglandins and, consistent with our initial study on tinfoil barbs, did not affect EOG responses to the free and conjugated steroid to which each species is most sensitive. In zebrafish, EOG responses to prostaglandins were similar in MT-treated juveniles and adult males, whereas responses of control (ethanol exposed) fish were similar to those of adult females. Finally, as previously observed in tinfoil barbs, MT treatment of juvenile redtail sharkminnows increased courtship behaviors (nuzzling and quivering) with a stimulus fish.

Although pp'DDT usage was strongly limited or banned in most parts of the world during the last three or four decades, the parent compound, its homologues and their metabolites still Occur it levels which might pose a risk for many ecosystem components.        A case of DDT Pollution of industrial origin was discovered in 1996 in Lake Maggiore, the second largest (212 km(2)) and deepest (370 in) lake in Italy, Causing concern for wildlife and human health.        The extensive monitoring of many biotic and abiotic compartments which followed from 1998 ill order to assess the pollution level and its trend in time, provided a great availability of data referring to DDT contamination of the different fish species of the lake.        In this study, the recent contamination levels in selected fish species were compared to those measured in 1998 to evaluate the temporal pollution trend of the lake and its natural recovery, given that no remediation measures were carried out on the contaminated soils and sediments in this time span. Moreover, a modelling approach to test the equilibrium condition between water and pelagic fish species was used. Analytical results of pp'DDT and pp'DDE concentrations in lake water were used as input data in the bioenergetic model by Connolly & Pedersen (1988) to calculate concentrations in two fish species and to compare the predicted and the measured contamination.        Methods. Sampling and analytical determination of DDT homologues ill lake water: Five water sampling campaigns were carried Out from May 2002 to February 2004 in three sampling sites of Lake Maggiore. Suspended and dissolved pollutants were determined separately. Quantitative DDT homologue analyses were performed by HRGC coupled with ECD detection by the external standard method. Single water extracts were put together in correspondence with the stratification zones of the water column inferred oil the basis of the temperature profile to improve analytical sensitivity. Selection of fish data: Concentrations of DDT and DDE in fishes were selected from recent literature (CIPAIS 2003, 2004).        Bioaccumulation model: The bioenergetic model proposed by Connolly & Pedersen (1988) was used to assess the bioaccumulation of pp'DDT and pp'DDE of Alosa fallax (landlocked shad) and Coregonus spp. (whitefish), selected among the different species as representative of a secondary consumer level.        Results and Discussion. The average concentrations of pp'DDT and pp 'DDE in water to be used as input data in the bioenergetic model were obtained considering ill the concentrations measured at the three sampling stations in the epylimnion where the fish species considered in this stud), spend most of their life. The resulting values were 0.05 and 0.16 ng/L for pp'DDT and pp'DDE, respectively.        Average measured pp'DDT and pp'DDE concentrations in landlocked shad were 0.81 +/- 0.39 and 1.69 +/- 0.71 mg/kg lipids, respectively, and were 0.29 +/- 0.12 and 1.06 +/- 0.41 mg/kg lipids for the whitefish. Calculated and measured values turned Out to be in quite good agreement for pp'DDT, while measured pp'DDE concentrations were higher than expected on the basis of the bioenergetic model in both species. Probably metabolic transformations of pp'DDT accumulated in fish tissues in the past are responsible for the observed differences between calculated and expected pp'DDE concentrations in fish.        Conclusions. Pelagic fishes of Lake Maggiore seem to maintain the DDT accumulated during their life time and the most efficient mechanism responsible for the fish population recoveries is probably their generation changes; for this reason, equilibrium models cannot be used until negligible pp'DDT concentrations are reached in fish tissues.        Recommendations and Outlook. The limit proposed for pp'DDT in water by the EU Directive 2000/60, which will come in force in 2008, is 0.2 ng/L, four times higher than the average concentration measured in Lake Maggiore waters. Nevertheless, concentrations measured in Lake Maggiore fish were very close and sometimes exceeded the Maximum residue limits (MRLs) settled by the Italian legislation for foods (0.1 mg/kg w.w. for fish containing 5-20% lipid). It seems, therefore, that the 'environmental quality standard' of 0.2 ng/L cannot guarantee the Suitability of fish for human consumption.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  27,10.1065/espr2006.01.010     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bioenergetic model;DDE;DDT concentrations in fish;fish;food chain;Lake Maggiore;trophic chains;ORGANOCHLORINE COMPOUNDS;CHEMICALS;MODEL;PCBS;Italy,NA,NA,ppddt and ppdde accumulation in a food chain of lake maggiore northern italy testing steadystate condition

The effects of the mixture were compared with those predicted by the model of concentration addition using biomathematical methods, which revealed that there was no deviation between the observed and predicted effects of the mixture. These findings demonstrate that estrogenic chemicals have the capacity to act together in an additive manner and that their combined effects can be accurately predicted by concentration addition. We also explored the potential for mixture effects at low concentrations by exposing the fish to each chemical at one-fifth of its median effective concentration (EC50)Individually, the chemicals did not induce a significant response, although their combined effects were consistent with the predictions of concentration addition.

Resistance to chemical stress, however, can evolve and the mechanisms include desensitized target sites, reduced chemical uptake and increased metabolic detoxification and sequestration. Chemical resistance in wildlife populations can also arise independently of exposure and may be spread by gene flow between populations. Inbreeding-matings between closely related individuals - can have negative fitness consequences for natural populations, and there is evidence of inbreeding depression in many wildlife populations. In some cases, reduced fitness in inbred populations has been shown to be exacerbated under chemical stress. In chemical testing, both inbred and outbred laboratory animals are used and for human safety assessments, isogenic strains (virtual clones) of mice and rats are often employed that reduce response variation, the number of animals used and associated costs. In contrast, for environmental risk assessment, strains of animals are often used that have been selectively bred to maintain heterozygosity, with the assumption that they are better able to predict adverse effects in wild, genetically variable, animals. This may not necessarily be the case however, as one outbred strain may not be representative of another or of a wild population.

A multi-stage Delay Differential Equation fish population model was used to simulate the perch population during two periods when it showed contrasting population structures (1968-1973 and 1983-1988) as the result of a disease outbreak in 1976, and to extrapolate the effects of chemical exposure to EE2 and NP observed in the laboratory to the environment. In the absence of chemical exposure, model simulations predicted population numbers (females) in line with those derived from field survey data. Effects predictions were made for long-term exposure (20 years) to low and high doses of EE2 (1 and 10 ng l(-1)) and NP (1 and 30 mu g l(-1)). The sustained high-level exposure of EE2 had a high probability of causing the extinction of a confined fish population such as that in Windermere, however, such an exposure scenario is unlikely. Far greater uncertainty surrounds the prediction of effects due to low-level exposure of fish populations and even though effects may appear to be significant in laboratory studies, such as fecundity lowered by 30%, they may not necessarily translate into significant population effects in the field. This is especially true if life-history data show high natural variability in terms of individual vital rates. Our work suggests that for a decline in the perch population numbers to be significant in Windermere, it would have to be substantially more than 50%. Our model predictions indicated that the post-disease population was generally more vulnerable than the pre-disease population and had a significantly greater probability of declining by 50% following single chemical exposure, but both populations were equally likely to decline following multiple chemical exposure. Rate of population recovery was shown to be a more sensitive measure in terms of differentiating the effects of low and high chemical exposure as well as the vulnerability of populations with contrasting structures, histories or levels of background stress.

As predicted, the rates of intrasexual interactions by both males and females increased with the number of competitors and decreased with the number of potential mates, whereas the rates of courtship decreased with the number of competitors and increased with the number of mates. At OSRs between 0.35 and 2, males engaged in more intrasexual interactions and courtship behaviour than females.

In contrast, exposure of females to EE2 (9.86 ng/L) during early life reduced their subsequent reproductive success in competitive spawning scenarios. Mate choice experiments suggested this was a consequence of the females' diminished courting behavior toward males, rather than any male preference for unexposed females.

Many fish have mating systems with complex social structures and it is not known whether EDCs will exaggerate or buffer the reproductive skews caused by the dominance hierarchies that normally occur for these species. This study investigated the impact of exposure to the pharmaceutical estrogen ethinylestradiol (EE2) on reproductive hierarchies and sexual selection in group-spawning fish. Breeding zebrafish were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2, and effects were determined on reproductive output, plasma androgen concentrations (in males), and reproductive success through microsatellite analyses of the offspring. Reproductive hierarchies in breeding colonies of zebrafish were disrupted by exposure to EE2 at a concentration that did not affect the number of eggs produced. The effect was a reduction in the skew in male paternity and increased skew in female maternity. This disruption in the reproductive hierarchy in group spawning fish, if it occurs in the wild, has potentially major implications for population genetic diversity. Reproductive success in male zebrafish was associated with elevated plasma concentrations of the male sex hormone 11-ketotestosterone and this hormone was suppressed in EE2-exposed males.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  85     Total Times Cited:  100     Cited Reference Count:  50,10.1021/es800277q     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ZEBRAFISH DANIO-RERIO;MINNOW PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS;MALE 3-SPINED STICKLEBACK;FATHEAD MINNOW;SYNTHETIC ESTROGEN;GONAD DEVELOPMENT;LIFE-CYCLE;EXPOSURE;BEHAVIOR;17-ALPHA-ETHINYLESTRADIOL;Estrogens,NA,NA,an environmental estrogen alters reproductive hierarchies disrupting sexual selection in groupspawning fish

It is excreted from the human body in high amounts and released via sewage treatment plant effluent into aquatic environments. In fish, estrogen receptors have strong binding affinities for EE2, and exposure raises the possibility of adverse neuroendocrine responses in aquatic animals. In the present study we explored the effects of dissolved-phase EE2 on the dynamics of male-male aggression and courtship behaviors in adult zebrafish. Further, we assessed whether the behavioral effects of EE2 result in changes in male offspring paternity. We scored the aggressive behaviors of individual unexposed males and categorized these fish as either dominant or subordinate. We then exposed dominant males to EE2 at doses of 0, 0.5. 5.0, and 50.0 ng/L for 48 h. Subsequent trials examined the agonistic behaviors of males in two testing scenarios: (1) a dyadic encounter with another male alone, and (2) a competitive spawning interaction with another male and three adult females. Competitive spawning tests were also used to assess the impacts of EE2 exposure on courtship behavior and paternity using males that were homozygous for green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression under the control of the islet-1 promoter. We found that EE2 at all exposure concentrations reduced male aggression during male-male dyadic encounters and caused a social dominance reversal in 50% of the fish at the highest exposure dose (50 ng/L EE2). The frequency of courtship-specific behavior decreased in dominant males exposed to the steroid, though this effect was only significant for the lowest dose group (0.5 ng/L EE2) In the highest exposure group (50 ng/L EE2), 50% of dominant males relinquished paternal dominance. Our results show that short-term exposure to EE2 at environmentally relevant levels can alter aggression, and shift individual social status and reproductive success in male zebrafish.

Such scenarios may be common in many fishes and amphibians, yet their ramifications remain largely unexplored. We used a simple model to study the (short-term) population consequences of environmental sex reversal (ESR). We examined the effects on sex ratios, sex chromosome frequencies, and population growth and persistence after exposure to environmental forces with feminizing or masculinizing tendencies. When environmental feminization was strong, X chromosomes were driven to extinction. Analogously, extinction of normally male-linked genetic factors (e.g., Y chromosomes) was caused by continuous environmental masculinization. Although moderate feminization was beneficial for population growth in the absence of large viability effects, our results suggest that the consequences of ESR are generally negative in terms of population size and the persistence of sex chromosomes. Extreme sex ratios resulting from high rates of ESR also reduced effective population sizes considerably. This may limit any evolutionary response to the deleterious effects of ESR. Our findings suggest that ESR changes population growth and sex ratios in some counter-intuitive ways and can change the predominant factor in sex determination from genetic to fully environmental, often within only a few tens of generations.

Newly fertilized eggs containing trace levels of PCBs via maternal deposition were collected from an aquaculture pond in which adult broodstock had been reared over their natural lives. The eggs were incubated using a flow through system that received the same pond water at in-situ temperatures from which they were spawned. Replicate samples of eggs were collected at six time points throughout incubation, ranging from day 0 (newly fertilized eggs) to post-hatch larvae (2-d old). Congener specific PCB fugacities in pooled egg samples showed increases over the incubation period. just prior to hatching, incubated eggs averaged 2.7-fold higher PCB fugacities compared to fresh eggs. The increase in PCB fugacity with egg incubation time was independent of chemical Kow. After hatching, PCB residues were lost from the larvae, attenuating the maximum chemical fugacity achieved in late-incubated eggs. However, the rate of PCB elimination in the early larvae stages was K-ow dependent such that a significant larvae/egg fugacity ratio was still evident for intermediate and highly hydrophobic compounds 2 d post-hatching. This study provides the first evidence of in-ovo PCB bioamplification in eggs of an aquatic species and suggests that incubating fish embryos are exposed to higher chemical fugacities in-ovo than would be predicted by maternal deposition alone.

Interestingly, the progression of behaviors in a typical bout of adult courtship was found to recapitulate the ontogeny of the courtship components as they were first expressed in juvenile fish. This finding suggests that the systems controlling the maturation and sequential expression of behaviors stimulated the expression of the later ones.

In rats, the estrogenic environment during pregnancy and lactation affects directly maternal behavior. This experiment was aimed to test whether the exposure to the estrogenic compound bisphenol-A (BPA; 0.040 mg/kg/die, orally) of adult female rats, from mating to weaning of the pups, could alter maternal behavior. An appropriate methodology was applied to reveal differences in the behavior of dams directed to male and female pups, testing the dams on postnatal days 3-4 and 8-9. Results show different maternal behavioral patterns towards male and female pups of control mothers, with more ano-genital licking to males than to females. Exposure of mothers to BPA modified their behavior, reducing specific components of maternal behavior, both active and passive, irrespective of the sex of pups and the period of observation. This experiment shows that maternal behavior is affected by a prolonged exposure to a low dose of BPA during pregnancy and lactation, thus suggesting an effect on neural circuits in adulthood.

Acute (but not chronic) alarm pheromone and acute caffeine produced robust anxiogenic effects, including reduced exploration, increased erratic movements and freezing behavior in zebrafish tested in the novel tank diving test.

Fish were exposed for 10 days to a concentration of 4 mug/l of [C-14] t-OP in a flow-through system and were sampled after 1, 4, 7 and 10 days of exposure. t-OP residues were extracted from all tissues and analysed by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography.

The concentration of t-OP residues were highest in bile, followed by faeces, pyloric caeca, liver and intestine. In these tissues the majority of alkylphenol was in the form of two metabolites which were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy as the glucuronide conjugates of t-OP and t-octylcatechol. t-OP accumulated as the parent compound in fat with a bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 1190, and in brain, muscle, skin, I,one, gills, and eye with BCFs of between 100 and 260.

Concentrations of most OCs in Lake Superior walleye eggs were I to 3 orders of magnitude greater than in Lake Manitoba eggs. Toxaphene (mean concentration (wet weight) +/- I SE, 1580 +/- 462 ng/g) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (240 +/- 24 ng/g) were the predominant OCs in Lake Superior walleye Eggs, whereas DDT and metabolites (eggs 16 +/- 1.5 ng/g, muscle 2.1 +/- 0.36 ng/g) and PCBs (eggs 9.2 +/- 0.83 ng/g, muscle 2.0 +/- 2.4 ng/g) were the most common OCs. in Lake Manitoba walleye eggs and female muscle. Egg size (dry mass) and the concentration of most OCs in Lake Manitoba walleye eggs were positively correlated with female length and age. This relationship was strongest for more hydrophobic OCs (e.g., PCBs) but was not significant for less hydrophobic OCs (e.g., hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs)). Neither egg size nor egg OC concentration of Lake Superior walleye were significantly correlated with female length or age. There was no relationship between OC concentrations in muscle tissue and female length or age of Lake Manitoba walleye. OC concentrations in Lake Manitoba walleye eggs were not correlated with concentrations in the muscle tissue of the mothers, suggesting that OCs in walleye eggs are derived from various tissues. A positive relationship between the egg:muscle ratio of PCB concentrations and the egg:muscle ratio of lipid in freshwater fish suggests that the maternal transfer of PCBs in freshwater fish is related to the relative amounts of lipid in the eggs and mother. The transfer of hydrophobic OCs from mother to eggs in freshwater fish appears to vary within and among fish species and with the hydrophobicity of the OC.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  32     Cited Reference Count:  35,10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70872-X     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),pollutants;contaminant dynamics;reproduction;fish size;lipid;SALMON ONCORHYNCHUS-TSHAWYTSCHA;TROUT SALVELINUS-NAMAYCUSH;GREAT-LAKES;CHINOOK SALMON;POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYL;FISH;MICHIGAN;MORTALITY;CONGENERS;SURVIVAL;Ovum,NA,NA,maternal transfer of organochlorines to eggs of walleye <i>stizostedion vitreum<i> in lake manitoba and western lake superior

Changes in vitellogenin were measured and these were correlated to changes in gene expression using a 22,000 gene microarray developed specifically for fathead minnows. Significant changes in gene expression were observed in both liver and testis, which correlate to phenotypic changes of vitellogenin induction and reduced competitive behavior. We also compared by real-time PCR the expression changes in key genes related to steroid biosynthesis and metabolism in fish exposed to the effluent as well as in fish exposed to a model estrogen and a model androgen.

Probably to avoid injury to self and offspring, competition among females is often displayed without much physical interaction and therefore remains harder to observe. Here, we show for the first time in a teleost fish, the zebrafish Danio rerio, that females can use waterborne pheromones to suppress reproduction by other females. Female zebrafish that had been exposed to another female's pheromones for 4 days prior to mating spawned significantly fewer viable eggs than females held in isolation or exposed to male pheromones. Male pheromones not only stimulated female reproduction but also increased the quality and viability of eggs. In grouped females, reproductive success correlated with dominance rank. These results indicate that fish pheromones function to control mates and competitors in addition to serving as reproductive timing signals. Differences in female reproductive success observed in many fish species might be explained by this mechanism. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Else-vier Ltd.

There is mounting evidence that EEDs can interfere with the processes of sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in different animal models. We investigated the effects of maternal exposure to EEDs, at concentrations within the range of human exposure and not patently teratogenic, on behavioral responses of male and female house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) before and after puberty. Pregnant dams were trained to spontaneously drink daily doses of corn oil with or without the estrogenic plastic derivative, bisphenol A (BPA, 10 mu g/kg), or the estrogenic insecticide methoxychlor (MXC 20 mu g/kg) from gestation day 11 to postpartum day 8. Their male and female offspring were examined at different ages to examine several components of explorative and emotional behaviors in 3 experimental paradigms: a novelty test before puberty and, as adults, a free-exploratory open-field test and the elevated plus maze test. The main results are sex differences in control mice on a number of behavioral responses at both ages and in all experimental paradigms, while perinatal exposure to BPA or MXC decreased or eliminated such sex differences. The present findings are evidence of long-term consequences of developmental exposure to BPA and MXC on neurobehavioral development and suggest a differential effect of low-dose exposure to these estrogenic chemicals in males and females.

The U.K. and European epidemiological data sets have demonstrated that the occurrence of feminized fish is associated with effluent discharges and that the incidence and severity is positively correlated with the proportion of treated sewage effluent in receiving waters. Although weakly estrogenic substances may contribute to the overall effect, studies have concluded that steroid estrogens are the principal and most potent estrogenic components of domestic sewage. Extensive laboratory data sets confirm that steroid estrogens are capable of eliciting the effects observed in wild fish at concentrations that have been measured in effluents and in the environment.

Intersex is often used as an indicator for disruption of sexual differentiation in fish exposed to different kinds of effluents from human activities. In wild fish it has exclusively been reported in terms of feminisation due to xenoestrogens in the environment. The assumption that the intersex individuals are feminised genetic males can only be proven by genetic sex identification of the intersexual individuals. Intersex and gonadal sex reversal were induced in three-spined sticklebacks by treatment with natural and synthetic steroid hormones. Juvenile sticklebacks were exposed to three nominal concentrations of 17beta-oestradiol (E2); i.e. 0.01, 1.0 and 10.0 mug/L; which were administered to the water either continuously from hatching to the end of the experiment (39-58 days post hatch), during the first 2 weeks after hatching only, from 14 days after hatching onwards, or during the chorionated embryo stage until hatching. Other groups were exposed to 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) at 0.05 mug/L and 17alpha-methyltestosterone (MT) at 1.0 mug/L (nominal concentrations). MT was applied continuously, during the first 2 weeks post hatch only, or from 14 days after hatching onwards. Gonad histology was examined and the genetic sex was identified with male sex-linked PCR markers. Treatment with oestrogens caused feminisation at the two highest E2 concentrations and with EE2. Exposure to E2 before hatching had no effect. Intersexual individuals from oestrogen treatments were genetic males. The genetic sex marker. identified apparent total reversal of the gonad type of genetic males. Treatment with MT did not reveal a clear picture, since intersex was observed in both genetic females and males. MT also caused severe testis abnormalities, mainly the development of large branched cavities with unidentified origin. The process of sex differentiation is most sensitive to the influence of external steroids during the first 2 weeks after hatching. A lower incidence of intersex could also be induced in sticklebacks exposed from 14 days after hatching by E2 treatment, but not with MT. The combination of gonad histopathology with genetic. sex identification in juvenile sticklebacks is suggested as a tool for detecting endocrine disruption in laboratory studies, and might become very useful in field surveys.

Ibuprofen is suspected of influencing sex steroid hormones through steroidogenic pathways in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In this study, the effect of ibuprofen on sex hormone balance and the associated mechanisms was investigated in vitro by use of H295R cells. We also conducted chronic toxicity tests using freshwater fish, Oryzias latipes, and two freshwater cladocerans. Daphnia magna and Moina macrocopa, for up to 144 and 21 d of exposure, respectively. Ibuprofen exposure increased 17 beta-estradiol (E2) production and aromatase activity in H295R cells. Testosterone (T) production decreased in a dose-dependent manner. For D. magna, the 48 h immobilization EC50 was 51.4 mg/L and the 21 d reproduction NOEC was <1.23 mg/L; for M. macrocopa, the 48 h immobilization EC50 was 72.6 mg/L and the 7 d reproduction NOEC was 25 mg/L For O.latipes, 120 d survival NOEC was 0.0001 mg/L In addition, ibuprofen affected several endpoints related to reproduction of the fish, including induction of vitellogenin in male fish, fewer broods per pair, and more eggs per brood. Parental exposure to as low as 0.0001 mg/L ibuprofen delayed hatching of eggs even when they were transferred to and cultured in clean water. Delayed hatching is environmentally relevant because this may increase the risk of being predated. For O. latipes, the acute-to-chronic ratio of ibuprofen was estimated to be greater than 1000. Overall, relatively high acute-to-chronic ratio and observation of reproduction damage in medaka fish at environmentally relevant ranges of ibuprofen warrant the need for further studies to elucidate potential ecological consequences of ibuprofen contamination in the aquatic environment.

In our study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to the 5 ng/L, 1 mu g/L and 50 mu g/L of DE-71 for the duration of the whole life cycle (120 days, from eggs to adults). The expression of selected genes along the brain-pituitary-gonadal (BPG) axis and liver, and the levels of plasma sex hormones were examined.        In male fish, up-regulation of GnRH in brain, FSH beta and LH beta in pituitary, FSH-receptor, LH-receptor, and CYP19a in testis was clearly evident, while down-regulation of CYP11a and 3 beta-HSD was found in testis. In female fish, a 2.4-fold up-regulation of 3 beta-HSD was found in ovary upon exposure to 50 mu g/L of DE-71. GnRH in brain, FSH beta and LH beta in pituitary were also up-regulated, while ER beta, TH and TPH in brain and GnRH-receptor in pituitary were significantly down-regulated. Hepatic ER alpha, AR and VTG in males were all down-regulated, while hepatic ER alpha and AR in female were up-regulated.        Serum estradiol (E-2) was reduced in both male and female upon exposure to DE-71, while significant increases in serum testosterone (T) and 11-keto-testosterone (11-KT) were only found in male but not female fish. The ratio of T/E-2 as well as the ratio of 11-KT/E-2 in male fish increased in a dose-dependent manner upon exposure to DE-71. Our overall results showed that whole life exposure of DE-71 altered the expression of regulatory genes and receptors at all three levels of the BPG axis in zebrafish, and the responses are sex dependent. The observed disruption of GnRH and GtHs can be further related to the subsequent disruption in both levels and balance sex steroid hormones. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The dominant's ability to reproductively control subordinates may depend on differences in competitive ability, due to, e.g. body size differences, but may also depend on the number of same-sex competitors inside the group. We tested experimentally whether subordinates reproduce more when these subordinates are large or when a second subordinate of the same sex need to be controlled by the dominants, using the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Dominant pairs were assisted by a large and a small unrelated subordinate; sexes of these fish were varied in a full-factorial design (giving four treatments). Dominant males lost significantly more parentage to the large subordinate male when a small subordinate male was also present, compared to when a small subordinate female was present. However, subordinate paternity was generally low and did not significantly curb total dominant male reproductive output, which was more affected by the sizes and numbers of reproductive females present inside his group. Dominant female maternity, clutch sizes and total output did not depend on the treatments. Subordinate-subordinate reproduction was virtually absent (one out of 874 offspring). Female subordinates were more likely to provide care for their own broods. In contrast, male subordinates did not adjust their level of care to their parentage. Variability in female subordinate alloparental brood care was particularly high, with females showing more care than males in general. We also detected effects of growth rate and food ration on parentage independent of the treatments, most notably: (i) a trade-off between dominant male growth rate and paternity; (ii) a decrease in dominant male paternity with increasing food ration; (iii) a positive effect of growth rate on paternity in small males. We conclude that dominant males should be sensitive to the number and sizes of subordinate males present in their group, particularly when these subordinates are not helpful or grow fast, and food is plentiful. Dominant females should be less sensitive, because female subordinates do not appear to impose reproductive costs and can be helpful through alloparental brood care.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  62,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03920.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),brood care;Cichlidae;cooperative breeding;helping behaviour;maternity;microsatellite DNA;paternity;reproductive skew;TUG-OF-WAR;FISH NEOLAMPROLOGUS-PULCHER;JULIDOCHROMIS-ORNATUS;LAKE TANGANYIKA;GROUP-SIZE;PSEUDOTROPHEUS-ZEBRA;BROODCARE HELPERS;CLOWN ANEMONEFISH;ANIMAL SOCIETIES;GROUP STABILITY;Breeding,NA,NA,group composition affects male reproductive partitioning in a cooperatively breeding cichlid

In 1998 and 1999, juvenile brown trout were caught in the wild and paired in staged dyadic contests in the laboratory where relative dominance rank was determined. Three categories of fish could be distinguished: dominants, subordinates and non-aggressive individuals of indeterminate status. All tested fish were released back into the stream and recaptured after 3 and 8 weeks. Dominant fish grew faster than subordinates, but non-aggressive fish grew as fast as dominants. Social status had no significant effect on recapture rates. Movement was not significantly related to status, but smaller individuals were more mobile and preferred faster-flowing habitats closer to the shore than larger fish. The utilisation of pool and riffle habitats varied among status categories, but this relationship was not consistent between years. These results support the hypothesis that dominance increases fitness in the wild.

In field studies, biomarkers of exposure [e.g., vitellogenin (VTG) induction in male fish] are powerful tools for tracking single substances and mixtures of concern. Biomarkers also provide linkage between field and laboratory data, thereby playing an important role in directing the need for and design of fish chronic tests for EDCs. It is the adverse effect end points (e.g., altered development, growth, and/or reproduction) from such tests that are most valuable for calculating (NOEC)-N-adverse (no observed effect oncentration) or (EC10)-E-adverse (effective concentration for a 10% response) and subsequently deriving predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs). With current uncertainties, (NOEC)-N-biomarker or (EC10)-E-biomarker data should not be used in isolation to derive PNECs. In the future, however, there may be scope to increasingly use biomarker data in environmental decision making, if plausible linkages am be made across levels of organization such that adverse outcomes might be envisaged relative to biomarker responses. For biomarkers to fulfil their potential, they should be mechanistically relevant and reproducible (as measured by interlaboratory comparisons of the same protocol). VTG is a good example of such a biomarker in that it provides an insight to the mode of action (estrogenicity) that is vital to fish reproductive health. Interlaboratory reproducibility data for VTG are also encouraging; recent comparisons (using the same immunoassay protocol) have provided coefficients of variation (CVs) of 38-55% (comparable to published CVs of 19-58% for fish survival and growth end points used in regulatory test guidelines). While concern over environmental xenoestrogens has led to the evaluation of reproductive biomarkers in fish, it must be remembered that many substances act via diverse mechanisms of action such that the environmental risk assessment for EDCs is a broad and complex issue. Also, biomarkers such as secondary sexual characteristics, gonadosomatic indices, plasma steroids, and gonadal histology have significant potential for guiding interspecies assessments of EDCs and designing fish chronic tests. To strengthen the utility of EDC biomarkers in fish, we need to establish a historical control database (also considering natural variability) to help differentiate between statistically detectable versus biologically significant responses. In conclusion, as research continues to develop a range of useful EDC biomarkers, environmental decision-making needs to move forward, and it is proposed that the ""biomarkers as signposts"" approach is a pragmatic way forward in the current risk assessment of EDCs.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  248     Total Times Cited:  281     Cited Reference Count:  126,10.1289/ehp.8062     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),aquatic;biomarkers;ecotoxicology;fish;endocrine disruptor;estrogen;vitellogenin;MINNOW PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS;LINKED-IMMUNOSORBENT-ASSAY;TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS;ZEBRAFISH DANIO-RERIO;SALMON SALMO-SALAR;WIDESPREAD SEXUAL DISRUPTION;ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR-ALPHA;FATHEAD MINNOW;IN-VIVO;LIFE-CYCLE;Risk Assessment;Mass Screening,NA,NA,screening and testing for endocrine disruption in fish biomarkers as signposts not traffic lights in risk assessment

The objective of this study was to use the assay to characterize responses of fathead minnow reproductive endocrinology and physiology to the mammalian antiandrogen, flutamide. Male and female fish were exposed to nominal (target) concentrations of 50 and 500 mug flutamide/l for 21-days, following which plasma steroid and vitellogenin concentrations were determined and gonadal morphology assessed. Fecundity of the fish was significantly reduced by exposure to a measured test concentration of 651 mug flutamide/l. In addition, embryo hatch was significantly reduced at this concentration. Qualitative histological assessment of ovaries from females exposed to flutamide indicated a decrease in mature oocytes and an increase in atretic follicles. Testes of males exposed to flutamide exhibited spermatocyte degeneration and necrosis. Concentration-dependent increases in plasma testosterone and vitellogenin concentrations were observed in the females. Flutamide also altered reproductive endocrinology of male fathead minnows. Males exposed to 651 mug flutamide/l exhibited elevated concentrations of beta-estradiol and vitellogenin. In summary, the results of this study with the fathead minnow demonstrate that flutamide affects reproductive endocrine function in fish and that the type of hormonal pattern and histopathology effects observed are consistent with an antiandrogenic mode-of-action. Consequently, our findings suggest that the 21-day reproduction assay utilizing fathead minnows is a sensitive short-term screening method for the detection of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, including antiandrogens.

Intersex fish were also found to have an altered endocrine status and an elevated concentration of plasma vitellogenin. Gonadal growth was inhibited only in severely intersex fish, whereas progression of spermatogenesis was delayed in a large proportion of all intersex and exposed male fish. In contrast to the effects observed in the intersex and exposed male fish, the maturation of ovaries in female fish inhabiting effluent-contaminated rivers appeared to be less obviously affected, although a higher incidence of oocyte atresia was found in the effluent-exposed fish compared with the reference fish. A positive correlation was found between the proportion of female tissue in the gonads of intersex fish and their plasma vitellogenin concentration, suggesting that vitellogenin can be an indicator for the level of gonadal disruption in intersex roach. The estradiol-17beta concentration in intersex fish was intermediate between the concentration found in males and females, and the plasma testosterone was between 2- and 3-fold higher in intersex fish compared with male fish. These data suggest a link between altered endocrine status in intersex and female fish and gonadal disruption.

This concern stems from the view that the effects observed have a parallel in humans, and that both phenomena are caused by exposure to mixtures of contaminants that interfere with reproductive development. The evidence for a ""wildlife-human connection"" is, however, weak: Testicular dysgenesis syndrome, seen in human males, is most easily reproduced in rodent models by exposure to mixtures of antiandrogenic chemicals. In contrast, the accepted explanation for feminization of wild male fish is that it results mainly from exposure to steroidal estrogens originating primarily from human excretion.        OBJECTIVES: We sought to further explore the hypothesis that endocrine disruption in fish is multi-causal, resulting from exposure to mixtures of chemicals with both estrogenic and antiandrogenic properties.        METHODS: We used hierarchical generalized linear and generalized additive statistical modeling to explore the associations between modeled concentrations and activities of estrogenic and antiandrogenic chemicals in 30 U.K. rivers and feminized responses seen in wild fish living in these rivers.        RESULTS: In addition to the estrogenic substances, antiandrogenic activity was prevalent in almost all treated sewage effluents tested. Further, the results of the modeling demonstrated that feminizing effects in wild fish could be best modeled as a function of their predicted exposure to both anti-androgens and estrogens or to antiandrogens alone.        CONCLUSION: The results provide a strong argument for a multicausal etiology of widespread feminization of wild fish in U.K. rivers involving contributions from both steroidal estrogens and xeno-estrogens and from other (as yet unknown) contaminants with antiandrogenic properties. These results may add farther credence to the hypothesis that endocrine-disrupting effects seen in wild fish and in humans are caused by similar combinations of endocrine-disrupting chemical cocktails.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  145     Total Times Cited:  163     Cited Reference Count:  38,10.1289/ehp.0800197     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"antiandrogen;endocrine disruption;estrogen;feminization;fish;testicular dysgenesis;ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY;IN-VITRO;MIXTURES;EXPOSURE;BENZOTRIAZOLE;REPRODUCTION;CONTAMINANTS;VINCLOZOLIN;ENVIRONMENT;CHEMICALS;Models, Statistical;Androgen Antagonists",NA,NA,statistical modeling suggests that antiandrogens in effluents from wastewater treatment works contribute to widespread sexual disruption in fish living in english rivers

Given the extent of this problem, risk assessment models are needed to predict the location and severity of endocrine disruption in river catchments and to identify areas where regulation of sewage discharges to remove these contaminants is necessary. In this study we attempted to correlate the extent of endocrine disruption in roach in British rivers, with their predicted exposure to steroid estrogens derived from the human population. The predictions of steroid estrogen exposure at each river site were determined by combining the modeled concentrations of the individual steroid estrogens [17 beta-estradiol (E-2), estrone (E-1), and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2)] in each sewage effluent with their predicted dilution in the immediate receiving water. This model was applied to 45 sites on 39 rivers throughout the United Kingdom. Each site studied was then categorized as either high, medium, or low ""risk"" on the basis of the assumed additive potency of the three steroid estrogens calculated from data derived from published studies in various cyprinid fish species. We sampled 1,438 wild roach from the predicted high-, medium-, and low-risk river sites and examined them for evidence and severity of endocrine disruption. Both the incidence and the severity of intersex in wild roach were significantly correlated with the predicted concentrations of the natural estrogens (E-1 and E-2) and the synthetic contraceptive pill estrogen (EE2) present. Predicted steroid estrogen exposure was, however, less well correlated with the plasma vitellogenin concentration measured in the same fish. Moreover, we found no correlation between any of the end points measured in the roach and the proportion of industrial effluents entering the rivers we studied.

Several studies have indicated potential changes in hormone levels as well as declines in vertebrates with increasing dietary MeHg exposure.        OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify alterations in gene expression associated with MeHg exposure, specifically those associated with previously observed changes in reproduction and reproductive biomarkers. Fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas were fed one of three diets that were similar to documented concentrations of MeHg in the diets of wild invertivorous and piscivorous fish. We used a commercial macroarray in conjunction with quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine gene expression in fish in relation to exposure to these environmentally relevant doses of MeHg.        RESULTS: Expression of genes commonly associated with endocrine disruption was altered with Hg exposure. Specifically, we observed a marked up-regulation in vitellogenin mRNA in individual Hg exposed males and a significant decline in vitellogenin gene expression in female fish with increasing Fig concentrations. Other genes identified by the macroarray experiment included those associated with egg fertilization and development, sugar metabolism, apoptosis, and electron transport. We also observed differences in expression patterns between male and female fish not related to genes specifically associated with reproduction, indicating a potential physiological difference in the reaction of males and females to MeHg.        CONCLUSION: Gene expression data may provide insight into the mechanisms by which MeHg affects reproduction in fish and indicate how MeHg differs in its effect from other heavy metals and endocrine-disrupting compounds.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  62     Total Times Cited:  80     Cited Reference Count:  52,10.1289/ehp.8786     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),endocrine disruption;gene expression;mercury;methylmercury;microarray;Pimephales promelas;reproduction;toxicogenomics;vitellogenin;BREAST-CANCER CELLS;CLARIAS-BATRACHUS L;RAINBOW-TROUT;GLYCERALDEHYDE-3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE;METHYL MERCURY;IN-VIVO;CADMIUM;VITELLOGENIN;FISH;ESTROGEN;Gene Expression,NA,NA,gene expression changes related to endocrine function and decline in reproduction in fathead minnow <i>pimephales promelas<i> after dietary methylmercury exposure

Here, we have used paternity analysis to provide new information on the ability of an endocrine disruptor to deleteriously affect male guppy reproductive fitness by including the effect of intermale competition. Groups of male guppies were exposed to 10.5, 44.4, or 112 ng/L of the synthetic estrogen 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) from birth to adulthood. Subsequently, an exposed male competed against an unexposed male for the opportunity to fertilize a receptive female. The successful males siring the majority of the offspring in each brood were then identified using micro-satellites in genetic paternity analysis. Only the highest dose of EE2 produced harmful effects with a significantly female-biased sex ratio, significant reductions in male sperm count, testis weight, body coloration and courtship behavior, and a significant increase in body size. These feminizing effects were translated into a highly significant reduction in fertility, where only 1 of the 17 exposed males sired offspring in competition with unexposed males. The evidence suggests that EE2-treated males have reduced reproductive fitness compared with untreated males, possibly the result of EE2 effects on multiple fitness traits.

We undertook a chronic exposure of roach to a treated estrogenic wastewater effluent for up to 3.5 years to assess principally for effects on subsequent reproductive fitness, as determined through parentage analysis on offspring from a competitive breeding study. In generating the fish for the breeding study we found that exposure to full strength WwTW effluent until sexual maturity resulted in sex reversal in almost all males in the population; 98% of the exposed fish were phenotypic females, containing ovaries. Furthermore, fish exposed to a 50% dilution of WwTW effluent contained ovotestis (21% of the male roach) that was absent from the control population. In competitive breeding studies, and applying DNA microsatellites to assess parentage, we show that presumptive females exposed to sexual maturity to WwTW effluent bred normally, albeit in the absence of nonexposed females, but putative sex-reversed males breeding as females contributed poorly, if at all, in a breeding population, depending on the competition.

Exposure of roach to EE2 (at 4 ng/L) for 2 years resulted in sex reversal in males, leading to an all-female population with two cohorts in terms of their stages of ovarian development, one paralleling the control females and one at a significantly less advanced stage, which we propose were sex-reversed males. Differing developmental and maturing rates of the putative sex-reversed males compared with control females would question their functional capability as females in the wild. Early-life exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2 sensitized females to estrogen, as determined by the measurement of the responses of estrogen-sensitive genes in a further EE2 challenge 398 days after the original exposure. In the wild, exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2 during early life has significantly wider implications for the sexual physiology in fish than has thus far been determined.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  117     Total Times Cited:  131     Cited Reference Count:  50,10.1021/es802661p     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ROACH RUTILUS-RUTILUS;SEWAGE-TREATMENT WORKS;WASTE-WATER;ENVIRONMENTAL CONCENTRATIONS;STEROID ESTROGENS;TERM EXPOSURE;LIFE STAGES;DISRUPTION;EFFLUENT;RIVER;Estrogens,NA,NA,sexual reprogramming and estrogenic sensitization in wild fish exposed to ethinylestradiol

However, it is unknown whether wild fish which are exposed to effluent actually compete with unexposed fishes, how long effects of estrogen exposure last, and whether females are affected by estrogens. This study addressed these issues using the fathead minnow (FHM) and effluent from the Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWTP) a well-studied source of environmental estrogens (EEs) in the Mississippi River. Maze tests found that adult FHMs are neither attracted nor repelled by MWTP effluent while previous studies have shown that minnows are attracted to the warmer waters which characterize effluents; it is realistic that previously unexposed fish enter MWTP effluent in the spring and then compete with exposed individuals. Competitive spawning experiments showed that male FHMs exposed to 44 ng E2/l (a high but realistic level) for three weeks failed to compete with unexposed males while males exposed to 4 ng E2/l outcompeted and sired more young than unexposed males (p < 0.05). The effects of estrogen exposure disappeared within a week of moving fish into uncontaminated water. Female FHM reproductive output and behavior were unaffected by exposure to estrogen. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the behavior of wild fishes likely determines their exposure to EEs and that while the effects of this exposure are likely significant to populations of wild fish, they will be location specific because of factors which determine the duration and intensity of male exposure. We conclude that the role of fish behavior in endocrine disruption strongly warrants additional consideration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Sex differentiation is influenced by a combination of hormonal, social and environmental factors and teleost fishes exhibit many examples of hermaphroditism. This means that the brain of fish is not irreversibly sexualized early in life. This review aims at highlighting some unique features of fish that may explain their brain sexual plasticity. Unlike mammals, in which brain aromatase activity decreases after birth, adult teleosts exhibit an intense aromatase activity due to strong expression of one of two aromatase genes (aromatase A or cyp19a1a and aromatase B or cyp19a1b) that arose from a gene duplication event. Interestingly, aromatase B is only expressed in radial glial cells (RGC) of adult fish. These cells persist throughout life and act as progenitors in the brain of both developing and adult fish. In agreement with the fact that brain aromatase activity is correlated with sex steroid levels, the high expression of cyp19a1b is due to an autoregulatory loop through which estrogens and aromatizable androgens upregulate aromatase expression. Given the well-established roles of estrogens and aromatase on brain sexualization, these features suggest that the brain of fish conserves properties of embryonic mammalian brain throughout life - high neurogenic activity and high aromatase expression in progenitor cells correlated with sex steroid levels. The permanent dialogue between the brain and the gonad would permit sex changes and thus the emergence of a variety of reproductive strategies.

Feminization of the reproductive ducts occurred in male fish in a concentration-dependent manner when the exposure occurred during early life, but we found no effects on the reproductive ducts in adult males. Deputation studies (maintenance of fish in clean water after exposure to WwTW effluent) confirmed that the feminization of the reproductive duct was permanent. We found no evidence of ovotestis development in fish that had no previous estrogen exposure for any of the treatments.

Partial largemouth bass gene segments were cloned for enzymes involved in neurotransmitter (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, GAD65; tyrosine hydroxylase) and estrogen (brain aromatase; CYP19b) synthesis for real-time PCR assays. In addition, neuropeptides regulating feeding (neuropeptide Y) and reproduction (chicken GnRH-II, cGnRH-II: salmon GnRH, sGnRH) were also investigated. Of the chemicals tested, only cadmium, PCB 126, and phenanthrene showed any significant effects on the genes tested, while atrazine and toxaphene did not. Cadmium (0.000067 mu g/g) significantly increased cGnRH-II mRNA while PCB 126 (0.25 mu g/g) decreased GAD65 mRNA. Phenanthrene decreased GAD65 and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels at the highest dose (50 mu g/g) but increased cGnRH-II mRNA at the lowest dose (5 mu g/g). CYP19b, NPY, and sGnRH mRNA levels were unaffected by any of the treatments.

We tested the hypotheses that (1) larval fathead minnows exposed to estrogens, a primary class of EDCs, singularly or in mixture, suffer a reduced ability to perform an innate C-start behavior when faced with a threat stimulus; (2) additive effects will cause greater reductions in C-start behavior; and (3) effects will differ among developmental stages.

Exposed embryos were allowed to hatch and grow in control well water until 12 days old. Similarly, post-hatch fathead minnows were exposed for 12 days to these compounds. High-speed (1000 frames/s) video recordings of escape behavior were collected and transferred to National Institutes of Health Image for frame-by-frame analysis of latency period, escape velocity, and total escape response (combination of latency period and escape velocity). When tested 12 days post-hatch, only El adversely affected C-start performance of larvae exposed as embryos. Conversely, larvae exposed for 12 days post-hatch did not exhibit altered escape responses when exposed to Ell, while adverse responses were seen in E2 and the estrogen mixture. Ethinylestradiol exposure did not elicit changes in escape behaviors at either developmental stage. The direct impact of reduced C-start performance on survival, and ultimately, reproductive fitness provides an avenue to assess the ecological relevance of exposure in an assay of relatively short duration.

Application of the model requires only a life table for the organism of interest, a measure of carrying capacity for the given population. and an estimation of the effect of a stressor on vital rates. The model was applied to investigate population dynamics for fathead minnow exposed to the androgen receptor agonist 17beta-trenbolone. Organismal-level responses for fathead minnows exposed to varying levels of 17beta-trenbolone were used to determine projected alterations in a population existing in a small body of water containing varying concentrations of the androgen. Fathead minnow populations occurring at carrying capacity and subsequently exposed to 0.027 mug/L of 17beta-trenbolone exhibited a 51% projected decrease in average population size after 2 years of exposure. Populations at carrying capacity exposed to concentrations of 17beta-trenbolone greater than or equal to0.266 mug/L exhibited a 93% projected decrease in average population size after 2 years of exposure.

Overall, data from laboratory experiments support the hypothesis that EDCs in the aquatic environment can impact the reproductive health of various fish species, but evidence that EDCs in the aquatic environment are actually impacting the reproductive health and sustainability of indigenous fish populations is less convincing. The scarcity of evidence linking impacts of environmental EDCs with changes in reproductive success of indigenous fish populations may reflect a critical need for a dependable method or indicator to assess reproduction of fish in situ. In addition, more studies that investigate whether fish populations routinely exposed to EDCs in situ are experiencing changes in population structure are needed. Linking endocrine disruption and reproductive impairment with an ecologically relevant impact on the sustainability of real fish populations remains, with few exceptions, an open challenge.

Endocrine disrupting chemicals have been defined as exogenous agents that interfere with the synthesis, secretion, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the body. Previous research conducted in our laboratory suggests that perinatal exposure to fenvalerate, a type-II pyrethroid, interferes with brain sexual organization in male pups, probably acting on a critical perinatal hormone-related period. In the present study we investigate the effects of maternal exposure to fenvalerate (FV) during the prenatal and postnatal periods of sexual brain organization of female offspring. Behavioral (open-field, stereotyped and sexual behaviors), physical (sexual maturation, body and uterine weights), and neuroendocrine (estrous cycle and gonadal hormone levels) parameters were assessed. Results show that 1) sexual maturation was delayed, albeit body weight was unchanged until adulthood; 2) there was a reduction in sexual behavior; 3) the estrous cycle was abnormal, and the uterine weight at different phases of the estrous cycle was modified; 4) gonadal hormone levels in the plasma were not affected, neither was stereotypy nor open-field behaviors. These results were attributed to an anti-estrogenic effect of perinatal exposure to FV during the critical periods of female brain sexual organization.

Evidence for a relationship between boldness and aggression was also apparent but depended both on strain and which specific behavior patterns were identified as measures of ""boldness."" Although some comparisons of laboratory and wild-derived strains were consistent with a domestication syndrome, others were not. Most observed relationships were relatively weak and occasionally inconsistent, arguing against strong underlying genetic linkages or pleiotropic effects relating any of the behavioral measures. Instead, it may be more important to study the details of selective context or the long-term impact of linkages between some, but not all, of a large set of genes influencing complex behavioral traits.

Herein, we use strain differences among zebrafish, Danio rerio, as an experimental tool to test the effects of social experience on behavior. By manipulating the strain composition of groups in which the subject fish are housed at different ages, we tested (1) whether mixing with dissimilar individuals influenced subsequent behavior, (2) whether prolonged mixing during the juvenile stage had a more pronounced effect than a shorter period of mixing during adulthood and (3) whether mixing had a lasting effect after animals were resorted into groups of same strain animals. We found that social experience had a profound impact on social behavior. Both Nadia and TM1 individuals engaged in more frequent biting after having been in mixed strain groups compared to pure strain groups. This was true of groups mixed as juveniles, as well as adults, indicating that this response was not dependent on exposure during a critical developmental period. Also, TM1 fish (but not Nadia) having recently been housed in mixed-strain groups were more willing to leave the immediate vicinity of a shoal than were TM1 fish raised in pure strain groups. This change was more pronounced in groups mixed as juveniles than as adults. In addition, the observed changes persisted after mixed groups were separated into pure strain groups for a month. Other behavioral measures including Activity Level, Predator Response and Stress Recovery were unaffected by previous social experience.

After completion of gonadal development that is mediated by various hormones, oviparous teleosts perform a suite of behaviors, often termed as spawning behavior. This is particularly important for teleosts that have their gametes fertilized externally as the behavior patterns ensures the close proximity of both sexes for gamete release, fusion and ultimately the production of offspring. As in other vertebrates, sexual behavior of fish is also under the control of hormones. Testicular androgen is a requirement for male sexual behavior to occur in most fish species that have been studied. Unlike tetrapods, however, ovarian estrogen does not appear to be essential for the occurrence of female sexual behavior for fish that have their gametes fertilized externally. Prostaglandins produced in the ovary after ovulation act as a trigger in some teleosts to induce female sexual behavior. Potentiating effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the brain on sexual behavior are reported in some species.        Under endocrine regulation, male and female fish exhibit gender-typical behavior during spawning, but in some fish species there is also some plasticity in their sexual behavior. Sex changing fish can perform both male-typical and female-typical sexual behaviors during their lifetime and this sexual plasticity can also be observed in non-sex changing fish when undergoing hormonal treatment. Although the neuro-anatomical basis is not clear in fish, results of field and laboratory observations suggest that some teleosts possess a sexually bipotential brain which can regulate two types of behaviors unlike most other vertebrates which have a discrete sex differentiation of their brain and can only perform gender-typical sexual behavior.

The relationships between dominance status and individual differences in foraging behaviour, habitat use, growth and emigration were examined for fluvial red-spotted masu salmon, Oncorhynchus masou ishikawai, in a mountain stream.        2. Size-structured linear dominance hierarchies were recognized among individuals inhabiting the same stream pools. Observations on space utilization and foraging behaviour revealed fish to be either territorial or nonterritorial. Within each local pool, dominant fish exclusively occupied the mid or surface layer of the pools as foraging territories, whereas subordinates adopted nonterritorial tactics, primarily utilizing the bottom layer.        3. Of the territorial fish, more dominant individuals tended to occupy focal points nearer the pool inlet, where they had priority of access to drifting food items. These fish showed higher actual foraging rates, feeding upon larger prey than their subordinates. This foraging advantage resulted in their having larger daily growth increments.        4. The more dominant fish in each pool exhibited a more sedentary tendency than their subordinates. Population densities in the pools did not fluctuate appreciably owing to both emigration of nonterritorial subordinates and immigration.        5.

The pharmaceutical ethynylestradiol (EE2) is a potent endocrine modulator and is present in the aquatic environment at biologically active concentrations. To investigate impacts on reproductive success and mechanisms of disruption, we exposed breeding populations (n = 12) of zebrafish (Danio rerio) over multiple generations to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2. Life-long exposure to 5 ng/L EE2 in the F, generation caused a 56% reduction in fecundity and complete population failure with no fertilization. Conversely, the same level of exposure for up to 40 days in mature adults in the parental F-0 generation had no impact on reproductive success. Infertility in the F, generation after life-long exposure to 5 ng/L EE2 was due to disturbed sexual differentiation, with males having no functional testes and either undifferentiated or intersex gonads. These F, males also showed a reduced vitellogenic response when compared with F-0 males, indicating an acclimation to EE2 exposure. Deputation studies found only a partial recovery in reproductive capacity after 5 months. Significantly, even though the F-0 males lacked functional testes, they showed male-pattern reproductive behavior, inducing the spawning act and competing with healthy males to disrupt fertilization. Endocrine disruption is therefore likely to affect breeding dynamics and reproductive success in group-spawning fish.

In view of the high degree of territoriality and stylized courtship behavior shown by pomacentrid fishes, they are a highly suitable group for the investigation of the interaction between reproductive hormones and reproductive behavior in fishes. This review examines the association between hormones and behavior in the two pomacentrid species for which data are available, the demoiselle Chromis dispilus and the garibaldi Hypsypops rubicundus. Territory holding males of both species show elevated plasma levels of the androgens testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) in association with courtship display and spawning. The maturational steroid 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta P) is also elevated during the spawning phase in territorial male demoiselles. Non-territorial male demoiselles show similar cyclic changes in gonadal condition to territory holding males, but have lower plasma T and 11KT levels than territory holders during the spawning phase, and show no changes in plasma 17,20 beta P levels. Changes in hormone levels in both garibaldi and demoiselles do not appear to result simply from cyclic changes in gonadal condition. Plasma levels of T, 11KT and 17,20 beta P are absolutely higher in spawning phase male demoiselles from areas of high population density, than in those from areas of low population density. Territory holding fish at high density sites have more frequent territorial interaction with neighbours, and spawn more often than fish at lower densities. This suggests that behavioral interactions modify endocrine status, which may in turn regulate levels of aggression and synchronise male spawning readiness. Exogenous hormones administered to nesting phase male demoiselles were ineffective at inducing display behavior, further supporting the view that primarily, behavior modifies endocrine status in damselfishes, rather than the other way round.

Fish were captured by SCUBA divers from natural populations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef and immediately bled underwater, following diver or video observation of precapture behaviour. In winter (July), most fish were nonterritorial, with a low proportion of mature males, or vitellogenic females present. In spring (November), most fish were territorial with broods of young at varying stages of maturity, and all stages of gonadal development were represented. Territorial males were larger than nonterritorial fish, but territorial fish that had large (older) young (the end of the brooding phase) had lower condition factors than fish at other stages. Males of all gonad stages had a high proportion of spermatozoa in the testis, but this was higher in November than in July. Ovaries of females commonly had several classes of developing follicles present, although fish that were brooding large young had regressed ovaries with a high incidence of atresia. Plasma levels of testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone were elevated in males of advanced gonadal maturity, and also in relation to recent or imminent spawning behaviour, but there were no changes in plasma 17,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta P), which was near assay detection limits at all times. Females had elevated T and 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) in association with vitellogenesis and elevated T in relation to spawning activity in some fish, but as in males, 17,20 beta P levels were low and unchanging. Territorial females without young had lower cortisol levels than nonterritorial fish, or females protecting young. The results confirm the importance of elevated androgens to spawning activity in territorial male fish, but not females where endocrine activity is more closely related to stage of ovarian development.

The current investigation was designed to determine if water contaminated with pulp-mill effluent (PME) from the Fenholloway River in Florida displayed androgenic activity in vitro and to relate this activity to the reproductive status of female mosquitofish taken from this river. We tested water samples for androgenic activity from a reference site upstream of a Kraft pulp and paper mill on the Fenholloway River, from 3 sites downstream from the mill, and from another reference site on the Econfina. River, also in Florida, where there is no paper mill. We also examined anal fin ray morphology in mosquitofish from these rivers for evidence of masculinization. Eighty percent of the female mosquitofish from the Fenholloway River were partially masculinized while another 10% were completely masculinized, based upon the numbers of segments in the longest anal fin ray (18.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 28.1 +/- 0.9 [p < 0.001]) in the Econfina River vs. the Fenholloway River, respectively). In a COS whole cell-binding assay, all 3 PME samples displayed affinity for human androgen receptor (hAR) (p < 0.001). In addition, PME induced androgen-dependent gene expression in CV-1 cells (cotransfected with pCMV hAR and MMTV luciferase reporter), which was inhibited by about 50% by coadministration of hydroxyflutamide (1 muM), an AR antagonist. Water samples collected upstream of the Kraft mill or from the Econfina River did not bind hAR or induce luciferase expression. When CV-1 cells were transfected with human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) rather than hAR, PME failed to significantly induce MMTV-luciferase expression. Further evidence of the androgenicity was observed using a COS cell AR nuclear-translocalization assay. PME bound hAR and induced translocalization of AR into the nucleus. In contrast, AR remained perinuclear when treated with water from the control sites (indicating the absence of an AR ligand). Interestingly, PME also displayed ""testosterone-like"" immunoreactivity in a testosterone radioimmunoassay, whereas water from the reference sites did not.

The fish were observed through the larval, juvenile, and adult stages. Growth, secondary sex characteristics, the liver somatic index, the gonadosomatic index, and fecundity were examined after several lengths of exposure. No significant changes were seen in fry or juvenile growth from 8 to 30 days posthatch (dph). An increase in the ovipositor index (a female secondary sex characteristic) was the most sensitive early response at 60 dph and was seen in fish exposed to EE2 concentrations >= 3.5 ng/L. Continuation of the EE2 exposure until 150 dph, through maturation and reproduction, allowed measurement of two sensitive end points: decreased egg fertilization and sex ratio (skewed toward females), both of which were significantly affected at the lowest EE2 concentration tested, 0.32 ng/L. The next most sensitive end point was demasculinization (decreased male secondary sex characteristic index) of males exposed to an EE2 concentration of 0.96 ng/L. The effects of low concentrations of EE2 (0.32 and 0.96 ng/L) were manifested in male fish (decreased male sex characteristics and reduced egg fertilization success), whereas female fish showed no changes in the gonaclosomatic index. Exposure to higher EE2 concentrations negatively affected females, as shown by a reduced gonadosomatic index at 150 dph in fish exposed to >= 3.5 ng/L EE2. Although there were some end points that showed changes at 60 dph, the reproductive end points and external sex characteristics measured in mature fish at 150 dph were more sensitive, with response thresholds of EE2 ranging from 0.32 to 0.96 ng/L. The concentrations of EE2 that negatively affected fathead minnows were similar to or lower than those detected in many municipal wastewater effluents. In conclusion, life-cycle exposure of fathead minnows proved to be a very sensitive bioassay, and responses were seen at concentrations of less than 1 ng/L, which are environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2.

This study set out to bridge this knowledge gap and better characterize dominance and its implications for reproductive success in both male and female zebrafish in colonies comprising of two males and two females. Analyses of four aggressive behaviors (chase, bite, repel, spar) were conducted twice daily over a 5-day period, and fertilized eggs were collected for parentage analyses using DNA microsatellite markers. Dominant-subordinate relationships occurred both between males and between females, and in both sexes, dominance was associated with a greater body size and higher levels of aggression. During the spawning period, dominant females were, however, less aggressive toward their subordinates than dominant males to their subordinates. Aggressive behaviors employed for maintaining dominance did not differ between the sexes, but in females, in contrast with males, the level of aggression directed toward the subordinate fish increased over the study period. Overall, dominance resulted in a greater total reproductive success in males but not in females; however, dominant females sired more offspring with the dominant male.

In this assay, mature male and female fathead minnow, previously kept under simulated winter conditions (15 degreesC; 8:16 h light:dark regime) were transferred to simulated summer conditions (25 degreesC water temperature; 16:8 h light:dark regime) to induce gonadal recrudescence. To assess sexual development fish were exposed to nominal concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 5 and 50 mug/L 17alpha-methyltestosterone. After 3 weeks of chemical exposure, effects on condition (condition factor, CF), plasma vitellogenin (VTG), secondary sex characteristics, gonad growth (gonadosomatic index; GSI) and gonad histology were investigated. Reproductive performance, including reproductive output (egg production), spawning behaviour, and fertilisation rate were measured over a subsequent 3-week-period in breeding adults maintained in clean water. 17alpha-Methyltestosterone had no effects on the condition of fish at any of the doses tested. 17alpha-Methyltestosterone induced both androgenic and estrogenic effects with females generally more affected by 17alpha-methyltestosterone than males: atretic follicles and male-specific sex characteristics (androgenic effect) were induced in females at greater than or equal to0.1 and greater than or equal to1 mug/L 17alpha-methyltestosterone, respectively. An inhibitory effect on ovary growth occurred at an exposure concentration of 50 mug/L 17alpha-methyltestosterone. In males 1 mug/L 17alpha-methyltestosterone induced a concentration-response induction of plasma vitellogenin (estrogenic effect) likely due to its conversion into 17alpha-methylestradiol, rather to the competition with endogenous steroids and their cross reactivity with the estrogen receptor. In the fish breeding studies, concentration-dependent reductions in egg number, fertilisation rate and increases in abnormal sexual behaviour in females were observed. All of these effects occurred at exposure concentrations of greater than or equal to5 mug/L 17alpha-methyltestosterone. Thus, it could be assumed that the observed estrogenic effects in male fathead minnow were likely to the conversion of 17alpha-methyltestosterone into the estrogen 17alpha-methylestradiol, rather to the acting of 17alpha-methyltestosterone itself. In conclusion to this, showing hormonally activity of 17alpha-methyltestosterone in fish down to 100 ng/L, indicates that its potency was close to the range of several naturally occurring estrogens.

The modified hemal spines (modified skeletal structures important in reproduction) of mosquitofish, Gambusia spp. have been shown to be under androgenic control and to be affected by exposure to estrogen. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of two sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Sydney, Australia on the morphology of hemal spines in populations of Gambusia holbrooki and on the ability of the fish to reach sexual maturity. The effluent from the two STPs had different effects on the hemal spines of males. At St. Marys differences in hemal spine morphology between fish upstream and downstream of the STP were not attributable to effluent from the STP. At Quakers Hill, results suggest that the effluent is generally estrogenic to G. holbrooki.

The study of the genetics of fish domestication could therefore benefit from the introduction of a model system. In this paper, we document behavioral and growth rate differences observed between a domesticated laboratory strain of zebra danio (Danio rerio) and a strain newly introduced into the laboratory from its native habitat in India. Domesticated zebra danio showed a higher degree of surface orientation, a reduced startle response, and higher growth rate compared with wild zebra danio. Wild-domesticated interstrain hybrids were intermediate in phenotype for all traits. When strains were reared together, most interstrain behavioral differences were maintained, indicating a genetic basis underlying the interstrain phenotypic variation.

To do this, male offspring of guppies from different predator localities were reared in the laboratory under conditions designed to mimic natural variation in wild populations. Two aspects of young male guppies' social environment were manipulated: (1) population demography and (2) origin (predator locality) of conspecifics. Heredity (origin of the males' parents) was responsible for only a small proportion of the variation in sexual behaviour; social environment had a much greater influence. Also, inter-population variation was found in the degree to which a male's behaviour was affected by demographic conditions and in the relationship between a male's body size and his rate of courtship. Male sexual behaviour also varied with male age and with the origin of the female being courted. Various components of male sexual behaviour (e.g. courtship, mating attempts) were influenced to different degrees by the factors examined.

The incidence of intersexuality is strongly correlated with discharges of estrogenic treated sewage effluent into those rivers, and this has led to the hypothesis that estrogenic chemicals in effluents are feminizing wild male fish. In this study, early-life stage roach (50 days post hatch, dph) were exposed for 150 days to a graded concentration (0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, and 100%) of treated sewage (primarily domestic) effluent to examine the effects of exposure on sexual differentiation and development. Measurement of steroid estrogens and alkylphenolic chemicals in the effluent and a resulting dose-dependent induction of vitellogenin (VTG; a female-specific, estrogen-dependent plasma protein) confirmed that the fish had been exposed and responded to ""estrogen"" in the effluent. Exposure to treated sewage effluent induced feminization of the reproductive ducts in ""male"" roach in a dose-dependent manner (in full-strength effluent, 100% of the fish had feminized ducts), indicating that the disruption of the gonad ducts seen in wild roach is the result of exposure to treated sewage effluents during early-life stages. There were no effects of treated sewage effluent exposure on germ cell development; therefore, no oocytes occurred in the testes of the feminized male roach. Subsequent, depuration of the effluent exposed fish in ""clean"" water for 150 days resulted in a reduction in plasma VTG but no alteration of the feminized ducts, indicating that the effect of the treated sewage effluent on reproductive duct development was permanent.

The aim of this study was to examine how exposure from 10 to 31 days to 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2, 41 ng L-1) affects the courtship and parental care behaviour of male sand gobies (Pomatoschistus minutus). The sand goby exhibits a polygynous mating system, where males compete for females and provide paternal care. First, male courtship performance towards a stimulus female was recorded with video camera. Secondly, after the male had received eggs his parental care behaviour was video recorded. In addition to behavioural endpoints, we measured the expression of hepatic vitellogenin (Vtg) and zona radiata protein (Zrp) mRNA, as well as common somatic indices. Our study shows that exposure to EE2 affected male fanning behaviour during both courtship and parental care. Interestingly, small exposed males increased their courtship fanning to similar levels as larger control males. However, during parental care egg fanning was not related to male size, and all exposed males fanned more than control males. The EE2-exposure induced Vtg and Zrp mRNA expression in males and decreased hepatosomatic index (HSI), and increased gonadosomatic index (GSI). Females prefer males that fan more, which will favour the small EDC exposed males. This may lead to mating that favours males that are not strong enough to tend the eggs until they hatch, thus decreasing the reproductive success of individuals. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The sand goby exhibits a polygynous mating system with male parental care, in which males compete for nest sites and females. The aim of this study was to test how EE2 exposure affects the ability of males to compete for breeding resources, i.e. nest sites and mates. First, EE2 exposed males competed over a nest site against a non-exposed, control male of the same size. Secondly, we examined male courtship behavior and female mate preferences for EE2 exposed males and similar-sized non-exposed, control males. In addition to the behavioral experiments we determined the zona radiata protein (Zrp) mRNA gene expression and measured morphometric indicators of sexual maturation. Our study revealed that EE2 treated males were not able to acquire or defend a nest site. Additionally, EE2 treated males spent significantly less time in active courtship and nest leading behavior than control males. As a result, females clearly preferred to mate with control males. However, we found no significant differences in Zrp mRNA expression or the morphometric indicators between treatments. Our study illustrates that exposure to this EDC can greatly reduce the chances of an individual reproducing successfully. Moreover, it demonstrates that severe behavioral effects can be seen before any effects are detectable at the molecular or morphometric level. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Behaviors analyzed included time under the spawning substrate, frequency of substrate cleaning, and conspecific aggression. Plasma hormone levels (11-ketotestosterone [11-KT], testosterone, and estradiol [E-2]), vitellogenin (VTG), secondary male characteristics (tubercle count and dorsal nape pad rank), gonadosomatic index (GSI), and gonad histology also were evaluated.

On the contrary, it is well known that estrogenic compounds can induce fish feminization. Yet, the combined effects of mixtures of androgenic and estrogenic compounds on fish sex differentiation have never been investigated before, even though in the environment animals are frequently exposed to both groups of xenobiotics. Therefore, in order to investigate whether exposure to estrogenic compounds can block the masculinizing effect of TBT, 5 days post-fertilization zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae were exposed for a four month period to TBT and to the synthetic estrogen-ethinylestradiol (EE2). The fish were fed a diet containing TBT at nominal concentrations of 25 and 100 ng TBT/g, and two groups of animals were also dosed with TBT plus EE2 at nominal water concentration of 3.5 ng/L, using a flow-through design. As expected, fish exposed to TBT showed a b. as of sex toward males (62.5% males in control tanks and 86% and 82% in TBT 25 and TBT 100 ng TBT/g, respectively). Co-exposure to EE2 completely blocked the masculinizing effect of TBT, with 7% males in the TBT 25 ng/g+EE2 treatment and 0% in the EE2 alone and in the TBT 100 ng/g+EE2 exposed groups. These results clearly indicate that EE2, at environmentally relevant concentrations, can block the TBT masculinizing effects in zebrafish, which suggests that in the aquatic environment the presence of estrogens may neutralize the fish masculinizing effect of TBT. Our findings highlight the need of testing the combined effects of contaminants, as single exposure studies may not be sufficient to predict the effects of mixtures of xenobiotics with antagonistic properties.

In this study, we examined the ability of NP to alter reproductive competence in male fathead minnows after a 28 day flow-through exposure in a range of environmentally relevant concentrations bracketing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency toxicity-based NP chronic exposure criterion of 6.1 mu g NP/L. Exposure to NP at and above the EPA chronic exposure criterion resulted in an induction of plasma vitellogenin (VTG) within 14 days. However, 7 days after the cessation of exposure, VTG concentrations had dropped more than 50% and few males expressed VTG above the detection threshold. All of the morphological endpoints, including gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, secondary sexual characters, and histopathology, were unaltered by all NP treatments. However, when NP-exposed male fish were allowed to compete with control males for access to nest sites and females, most treatments altered the reproductive competence of exposed males. At lower NP concentrations, exposed males out-competed control males, possibly by being primed through the estrogenic NP exposure in a fashion similar to priming by pheromones released from female fathead minnows. At higher NP exposure concentrations, this priming effect was negated by the adverse effects of the exposure and control males out-competed treated males. Results of this study indicate the complexity of endocrine disrupting effects and the need for multiple analysis levels to assess the effects of these compounds on aquatic organisms.

This study tested the hypothesis that 10-week exposure to a STP effluent with well-established estrogenic properties compromises the reproductive vigor of mature goldfish by decreasing the intensity of their reproductive drive and sperm production, Male goldfish were exposed for 10 weeks to one of four treatments: well water, a solvent control, 50 ng/L estradiol (E2), or undiluted effluent from a major metropolitan STP. Two trials,were conducted, one in the winter and one in the summer when the effluent was chlorinated. Exposure to effluent in both the summer and winter trials induced small, but nonsignificant, decreases in the frequency of male spawning behaviors but had no effect on sperm production. Exposure to E2 caused a clear reduction in spawning behavior in one trial while causing reduced sperm production in both trials. We conclude that the effect of effluent exposure from this STP on adult fish is likely to be relatively minor and that the effluent's estrogenic properties may vary over the course of the year.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  46     Total Times Cited:  49     Cited Reference Count:  40,10.1897/1551-5028(2002)021<2185:TWETTS>2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"xenoestrogen;sewage;fish;behavior;sperm;CARP CYPRINUS-CARPIO;COMMON CARP;VITELLOGENIN INDUCTION;ESTROGENIC CHEMICALS;MILT PRODUCTION;SEX-PHEROMONE;ANALYSIS CASA;STW EFFLUENT;17-ALPHA,20-BETA-DIHYDROXY-4-PREGNEN-3-ONE;MOTILITY;Reproductive Behavior",NA,NA,tenweek exposure to treated sewage discharge has relatively minor variable effects on reproductive behavior and sperm production in goldfish

Zooplankton composition and physico-chemical variables were observed during 4 weeks of pre-application, 6 weeks of dosing via controlled release, and a 12 weeks post-treatment period. In the treated microcosms, time-weighted averages of EE concentration ranged between 7 and 220 ng/L during the dosing period, with concentration maxima up to 724 ng/L. EE exposure resulted in a decrease of species numbers and diversity (Shannon-Wiener, Simpson). Abundances of cladocerans, copepods, and, less unambiguously, rotifers declined. Strongest affected groups were the offspring of cladocerans and copepods and, on species level, the cladoceran species Daphnia longispina and Chydorus sphaericus as well as the rotifer species Keratella quadrata and Polyarthra sp. EE apparently affected the phosphate cycle as indicated by increased phosphate concentrations in the water. During post-treatment period, the treated microcosms recovered, but especially the highest treated microcosms did not fully re-approximate to the controls. Whereas EE affected cladocerans and copepods directly, shifts of rotifers may (partly) be caused indirectly, e.g. by competition with crustaceae. Although not providing an absolute proof, the traits of direct and indirect effects on different taxonomic groups and larval stages as well as the time course of the effects indicate that effects primarily resulted from endocrine activity of EE.
