rayyan-1227306773,The kisspeptin-GnIH signaling pathway in the role of zebrafish courtship and aggressive behavior induced by azoxystrobin,2023,NA,NA,Environmental Pollution,02697491 (ISSN),325,,,"Guo, X. and Zhang, R. and Jin, Q. and Cao, N. and Shi, J. and Zong, X. and Chen, X. and Wang, C. and Li, X. and Pang, S. and Li, L.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150449670&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2023.121461&partnerID=40&md5=0b3921b93438f3e9efada49ae7e254c0,English,Elsevier Ltd,"[""Department of Applied Chemistry, College of Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China"", ""State Key Laboratory of NBC Protection for Civilian, Beijing, 102205, China""]","Azoxystrobin, a strobilurin widely used to control rice diseases, has raised concerns about possible adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. At present, very little is known about the effects of azoxystrobin on courtship and aggressive behavior and the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, after exposing adult male and female zebrafish to worst-case scenario concentrations of azoxystrobin (0, 2 μg/L, 20 μg/L, and 200 μg/L) for 42 d, we observed a decrease in courtship behavior and an increase in aggressive behavior in both male and female zebrafish. In addition, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the behavioral effects of azoxystrobin, we quantified the changes in the concentrations of kisspeptin, 5-HT, GnIH, and their corresponding receptor mRNA expression in the brain. The results showed that 200 μg/L azoxystrobin decreased the concentrations of kisspeptin and increased the concentration of GnIH in both male and female zebrafish brain. In addition, azoxystrobin also significantly reduced 5-HT concentration in female zebrafish brain. Further investigation revealed that altered courtship and aggressive behavior were associated with the expression levels of genes (kiss1, kiss2, gnrh3, gnrhr3, 5ht1a, and 5ht2a) involved in kisspeptin-GnIH signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study suggested that azoxystrobin may impair courtship and aggressive behavior in zebrafish by interfering with the kisspeptin-GnIH signaling pathway, which may have more profound effects on natural zebrafish populations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: L.

rayyan-1227306935,Environmentally Realistic Waterborne Atrazine Exposure Affects Behavior in <i>Poecilia latipinna</i>,2023,1,NA,WATER,2073-4441     J9  - WATER-SUI     JI  - Water,15,2,,"MacLaren, RD",,English,,"Merrimack Coll, Dept Biol, N Andover, MA 01845 USA","The present study examined the effects of environmentally realistic exposure to atrazine (ATZ) on the behavior of sailfin mollies, Poecilia latipinna. ATZ is one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and a known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). The behavior of sailfin mollies is well documented in the scientific literature. Moreover, they are ecologically important indicators of environmental health, widely distributed among the mangroves along the Gulf Coast of the Southeastern US where significant amounts of ATZ are introduced via runoff and storm water drainage from coastal households, businesses, and farms. Four sets of experiments designed to assess ATZ's impact on various aspects of male and female reproductive behavior, aggression, anxiety, and boldness were conducted following 12 weeks of exposure to 1 or 15 ppb water-borne ATZ, along with a no-exposure control group. Results indicated that the behavior of ATZ-exposed individuals differed from those of controls: ATZ exposure affected which stimulus fish (a male vs. a female) subject females preferred to associate with while also affecting female strength of preference for males of larger body size and their sexual receptivity to conspecific males in general. ATZ-exposed males also showed reduced overall responsiveness to conspecific stimuli and directed significantly less aggression toward their mirror image compared with controls. Finally, ATZ exposure affected multiple aspects of male and female behavior that are often used as proxies for boldness and anxiety. Overall, ATZ exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behaviors attributed to sexual receptivity, mate choice and motivation to mate, aggression, as well as boldness and anxiety. These ATZ-induced behavioral changes may adversely affect the long-term health of natural populations exposed to similar, environmentally realistic concentrations and add to a growing body of empirical data demonstrating substantial fitness consequences of exposure to sublethal concentrations of this known EDC.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  122 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shiho""=>""Included"", ""Kyle ""=>""Included""}",10.3390/w15020306     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioral toxicity;contaminants of emerging concern;reproductive behavior;aggression;anxiety;endocrine disrupting chemicals;Florida Gulf Coast;ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING CHEMICALS;LATERAL PROJECTION AREA;SHORT-TERM EXPOSURE;FEMALE PREFERENCE;BODY-SIZE;TESTOSTERONE PRODUCTION;PREDATION RISK;NONREPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR;MONOAMINERGIC SYSTEMS;AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR,NA,NA
