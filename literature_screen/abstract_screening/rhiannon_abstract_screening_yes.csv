M.",,eng,,,"Atrazine and Diuron are widely used herbicides. The use of pesticides contaminates the aquatic environment, threatening biodiversity and non-target  organisms such as fish. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute  exposure for 96 h hours to atrazine and diuron commercial formulations in  zebrafish (Danio rerio, wild-type AB) embryos and larvae and adult stages. We  observed a significant concentration-dependent survival decrease and hatching  delays in animals exposed to both herbicides and in the frequency of  malformations compared to the control groups. Morphological defects included  cardiac edema, tail reduction, and head malformation. At 7 days  post-fertilization (dpf), atrazine exposure resulted in a reduction in the head  length at 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L and increased the ocular distance at 1, 2, 2.5, and  5 mg/L atrazine when compared to controls. At the same age, diuron increased the  ocular distance in animals exposed to diuron (1.0 and 1.5 mg/L) and no effects  were observed on the head length. We also evaluated a behavioral repertoire in  larvae at 7 dpf, and there were no significant differences in distance traveled,  mean speed, time in movement, and thigmotaxis for atrazine and diuron when  animals were individually placed in a new environment. The cognitive ability of  the larvae was tested at 7 dpf for avoidance and optomotor responses, and neither  atrazine nor diuron had significant impacts when treated groups were compared to  their corresponding controls. Adults' behavior was evaluated 7 and 8 days after  the end of the acute herbicide exposure. Exploration of a new environment and  associated anxiety-like parameters, social interaction, and aggressiveness were  not altered. Our results highlight the need for further studies on the sublethal  effects of both herbicides and the consideration of the effects of commercial  formulas vs. isolated active ingredients. It also emphasizes the need to take  sublethal effects into consideration when establishing the environmental limits  of residues.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fphar.2022.841826,atrazine;cognition;diuron;exploratory behavior;social interaction;survival;teratogenesis;zebrafish,NA,NA

While  fenpropathrin was found to have neurotoxic effects in mammals, it remains unclear  whether it has similar effects on fish. Here, we used adult zebrafish to  investigate the impacts of fenpropathrin on fish social behaviors and neural  activity. Exposure of adult zebrafish to 500 ppb of fenpropathrin for 72 h  increased anxiety levels but decreased physical fitness, as measured by a novel  tank diving test and swimming tunnel test. Fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared  to spend more time in the conspecific zone of the tank, possibly seeking greater  comfort from their companions. Although learning, memory, and aggressive behavior  did not change, fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to have shorter fighting  durations. The immunocytochemical results showed the tyrosine hydroxylase  antibody-labeled dopaminergic neurons in the teleost posterior tuberculum  decreased in the zebrafish brain. According to a quantitative polymerase chain  reaction (qPCR) analysis of the brain, exposure to fenpropathrin resulted in a  decrease in the messenger (m)RNA expression of monoamine oxidase (mao), an enzyme  that facilitates the deamination of dopamine. In contrast, the mRNA expression of  the sncga gene, which may trigger Parkinson's disease, was found to have  increased. There were no changes observed in expressions of genes related to  antioxidants and apoptosis between the control and fenpropathrin-exposed groups.  We provide evidence to demonstrate the defect of the neurotoxicity of  fenpropathrin toward dopaminergic neurons in adult zebrafish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106756,"*Pyrethrins/toxicity;*Water Pollutants, Chemical/toxicity;Animals;Behavior, Animal;Dopaminergic neurons;Fenpropathrin;Locomotion;Mammals;Social Behavior;Zebrafish;Zebrafish/metabolism",NA,NA
rayyan-1227305078,Neurobehavioral anomalies in zebrafish after sequential exposures to DDT and chlorpyrifos in adulthood: Do multiple exposures interact?,2021,9,10,Neurotoxicology and teratology,1872-9738 0892-0362,87,,106985,"Hawkey, Andrew B. and Holloway, Zade and Dean, Cassandra and Koburov, Reese and Slotkin, Theodore A. and Seidler, Frederic J. and Levin, Edward D.",,eng,,,"A sequence of different classes of synthetic insecticides have been used over the past 70 years. Over this period, the widely-used organochlorines were eventually  replaced by organophosphates, with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and  chlorpyrifos (CPF) as the principal prototypes. Considerable research has  characterized the risks of DDT and CPF individually, but little is known about  the toxicology of transitioning from one class of insecticides to another, as has  been commonplace for agricultural and pest control workers. This study used adult  zebrafish to investigate neurobehavioral toxicity following 5-week chronic  exposure to either DDT or CPF, to or their sequential exposure (DDT for 5 weeks  followed by CPF for 5 weeks). At the end of the exposure period, a subset of fish  were analyzed for brain cholinesterase activity. Behavioral effects were  initially assessed one week following the end of the CPF exposure and again at  14 months of age using a behavioral test battery covering sensorimotor responses,  anxiety-like functions, predator avoidance and social attraction. Adult  insecticide exposures, individually or sequentially, were found to modulate  multiple behavioral features, including startle responsivity, social approach,  predator avoidance, locomotor activity and novel location recognition and  avoidance. Locomotor activity and startle responsivity were each impacted to a  greater degree by the sequential exposures than by individual compounds, with the  latter being pronounced at the early (1-week post exposure) time point, but not  3-4 months later in aging. Social approach responses were similarly impaired by  the sequential exposure as by CPF-alone at the aging time point. Fleeing  responses in the predator test showed flee-enhancing effects of both compounds  individually versus controls, and no additive impact of the two following  sequential exposure. Each compound was also associated with changes in  recognition or avoidance patterns in a novel place recognition task in late  adulthood, but sequential exposures did not enhance these phenotypes. The  potential for chemical x chemical interactions did not appear related to changes  in CPF metabolism to the active oxon, as prior DDT exposure did not affect the  cholinesterase inhibition resulting from CPF. This study shows that the effects  of chronic adult insecticide exposures may be relevant to behavioral health  initially and much later in life, and that the effects of sequential exposures  may be unpredictable based on their constituent exposures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ntt.2021.106985,"Aging;Animals;Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Brain/drug effects;Chlorpyrifos/*toxicity;Cholinesterase Inhibitors/toxicity;DDT;DDT/metabolism/*toxicity;Insecticides/toxicity;Locomotion/*drug effects;Neurobehavioral toxicology, anxiety-related behavior;Zebrafish;Zebrafish/metabolism",NA,NA
rayyan-1227305159,DDT and titanium dioxide nanoparticle coexposure induced neurobehavioral deficits in zebrafish.,2024,1,24,Neurotoxicology and teratology,1872-9738 0892-0362,102,,107323,"Lin, Jian and Lou, Yanqi and Sun, Zhenkai and Pan, Dongliang and Lei, Lei and Song, Yang and Huang, Changjiang and Chen, Jiangfei",,eng,,,"Both dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and titanium dioxide nanoparticle (TiO(2) NP) have worldwide-scale commercial applications, resulting in their  co-pollution in the ecosystems and posing combined health risks. However, there  is a lack of toxicity studies for the interactions of DDT and TiO(2) NP in the  environmental relevant concentrations. In this study, we characterized the  coexposures using a zebrafish waterborne exposure approach and evaluated the  neurotoxicity response of the treated embryos or adults. Our results showed that  DDT/TiO(2) NP coexposure enhanced the DDT accumulation in vivo and increased the  larval locomotor. The chronic DDT/TiO(2) NP coexposure did not affect the overall  survival rate, sex ratio and growth. However, DDT/TiO(2) NP coexposure severely  affected the adult locomotor activity, social contact, shoaling and aggressive  behaviors compared to single treatment groups or controls. These adult behavioral  deficits were accompanied by changes in neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACH)  level in the brain and muscle tissues, as well as neural development genes  expression activation of growth-associated protein 43 (gap43) and synaptic  vesicle glycoprotein 2 (sv2) in the brain. The significantly increased ACH level  and the activated neural genes expression in the DDT/TiO(2) NP co-exposed fish  may account for the observed hyperactivity and social deficits.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ntt.2024.107323,Behavior;Co-exposure;DDT;Neurotransmitter;TiO(2) NP;Zebrafish;Titanium,NA,NA

It is highly toxic during  all stages of mosquito development, suppresses metamorphosis, and interferes in  insect reproduction and proliferation. Pyriproxyfen and its main metabolite have  been shown to affect brain development in rodents. This compound is employed  mainly to eliminate outbreaks of the genus Aedes, even in potable water. Despite  the increasing number of toxicological studies about larvicides and  insecticides-with an indication of continuous use-there have been few studies  about the effects of pyriproxyfen in non-target species such as fish. This study  evaluated the effects of pyriproxyfen on behavioral, cognitive, and endocrine  parameters in zebrafish. We exposed adult zebrafish to different pyriproxyfen  (Pestanal(®)) concentrations (0.125, 0.675, and 1.75 mg/l) for 96 h. We analyzed  behavioral parameters, memory, cortisol levels, and gene expression of  glucocorticoid receptor (gr) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (crf) after  pyriproxyfen exposure. This exposure did not alter locomotion (distance or mean  speed), anxiety-like behavior (latency to enter to the top zone of the tank or  time in the top zone of the tank), and social or aggressive behavior. However,  there was impaired inhibitory avoidance memory at all tested pyriproxyfen  concentrations. Cortisol levels were reduced in exposed groups when compared to  control or vehicle. However, gr and crf gene expression in pyriproxyfen-treated  animals were unaltered when compared to control or vehicle groups. Taken  together, these findings indicate that pyriproxyfen may induce cognitive  impairment and altered cortisol levels in zebrafish, a non-target species.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fnbeh.2020.00103,cortisol;locomotion;memory;pyriproxyfen;zebrafish;Hydrocortisone;Cognition,NA,NA

Håkan",,eng,,,"Reproductive behaviour of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) from an anadromous stock was studied in a large stream water aquarium. Four adult males and two ovulated  females were placed in the aquarium together with eight mature male parr. Four of  the parr were exposed during the previous 4 days to two concentrations (0.1 or  1.0 microgl(-1)) of the pyrethroid pesticide cypermethrin (a disrupter of  olfactory receptor function) and four of the parr to the solvent ethanol. The  behaviour of all fish was followed for 24h and then blood and milt was collected.  Exposure to the higher concentration of cypermethrin disturbed the reproductive  behaviour of the parr. They displayed fewer courting events, spent less time near  the nesting females and had lower volumes of strippable milt. They also had  significantly lower amounts of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) in the blood plasma  than the control group. The higher cypermethrin group also had significantly  lower levels of all these variables than the lower cypermethrin group, apart from  strippable milt that showed no significant differences between two groups. No  significant differences in non-reproductive behaviours were observed between any  of the groups. In the control fish, there were significant positive correlations  between (a) the number of courting events and the amount of time spent near the  female, (b) blood plasma levels of 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one  (17,20beta-P) and time spent near the female and (c) plasma levels of 17,20beta-P  and the number of courting events. Further, in control fish, higher plasma levels  of 17,20beta-P were observed in parr interacting with a female compared to those  with no female contacts. A priming experiment confirmed a previous study that  cypermethrin damages olfactory reception. Parr exposed to cypermethrin had  significantly lower blood plasma levels of 17,20beta-P and 11-KT than control  males after exposure to ovarian fluid and urine (known to contain reproductive  priming pheromones). When ethanol-exposed males were exposed to ovarian fluid and  urine they had significantly higher plasma levels of 17,20beta-P compared to  those exposed to water only.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.10.011,"Analysis of Variance;Animals;Body Size/drug effects;Female;Hydroxyprogesterones/blood;Insecticides/*toxicity;Male;Odorants;Pyrethrins/*toxicity;Sexual Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Testosterone/analogs & derivatives/blood;Time Factors;Trout/*physiology;Urine;Water;Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity;Pesticides",NA,NA

Thus, as androgen receptor antagonists, the  fungicide vinclozolin and the principal DDT metabolite p,p'-DDE have been  demonstrated to induce demasculinization in rats. Whether this is also the case  in fish remains to be demonstrated. For a period of 30 days, groups of adult male  guppies were exposed to vinclozolin, p,p'-DDE, or the therapeutic antiandrogen  flutamide (used as positive control) applied to the fodder at concentrations  between 0.1 and 100 microg/g fodder. Subsequently, sexual characteristics of  relevance to the male reproductive capacity were measured and compared with  untreated control fish. All three chemicals caused profound alterations at  increasing levels of biological organization, even in these fully matured males.  At the cellular level, the three compounds induced a significant reduction in the  number of ejaculated sperm cells. At the organ level, the sexually attractive  orange-yellow coloration was reduced in area and discolored, and treated fish  also had smaller testes. Further, at the organismal level, computer-aided  behavior analyses demonstrated a severe disruption in male courtship behavior. We  conclude that this demasculinization is consistent with an antiandrogenic action  of vinclozolin and p,p'-DDE and is likely to compromise reproductive capability  in this fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Kyle ""=>""Included"", ""Rhiannon""=>""Included""}",10.1289/ehp.011091063,"*Sex Characteristics;Animals;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/*adverse effects;Flutamide/pharmacology;Insecticides/*adverse effects;Male;Pigmentation;Poecilia/*physiology;Reproduction;Sexual Behavior, Animal/drug effects;Sperm Count;Pesticides;Androgen Antagonists",NA,NA
