However, few studies have evaluated the effects of carbendazim on fish behaviour and our main objective was to evaluate behavioural changes on adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to this fungicide. We studied 177 fishes, divided into control groups (not exposed) and treatment groups, exposed to a concentration of 120 µg/L for 7, 14, 21 and 28. Behavioural data were collected using the scan sampling, with instantaneous recording every 30 s. We evaluated and compared fish behaviours and aquarium occupancy between treatments and controls using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. The results indicate that carbendazim initially elicited slow swimming and later fast swimming, decreased aggressiveness, and caused behavioural changes indicative of distress, like abnormal swimming and the gulping of air in water surface. In the wild, this behavioural change can result in an increased predation risk and consequent decrease or extinction of populations, revealing important ecological issues for animal communities living in polluted water bodies. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to ISPA, CRL 2024.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Gabriel""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""Gabriel""=>[""Potential right outcome: aggressiveness.""]}",10.1007/s10211-024-00438-8,"",NA,NA

However, there is little information on shorter time exposures and environmentally relevant concentrations. In this study, we investigated the effect of a 30-min exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of IBI on the behavior, redox status, and cortisol levels of zebrafish. We showed that the IBI decreased fish locomotion and social and aggressive behaviors and induced an anxiolytic-like behavior. Furthermore, IBI increased cortisol levels and protein carbonylation and decreased nitric oxide levels. These changes were mostly observed at 0.013 and 0.0013 µg·L−1 of IBI. In an environmental context, these behavioral and physiological disbalances, which were immediately triggered by IBI, can impair the ability of fish to evade predators and, consequently, affect their survival.
