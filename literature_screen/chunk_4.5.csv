Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is a popular alternative to brominated flame retardant and halogenated OPFRs. Neurodevelopmental toxicity is TPHP's primary adverse effect, whereas the biomarkers and the modes of action have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg of TPHP were orally administered to mice from postnatal day 10 (P10) to P70. The behavioral tests showed a compromised learning and memory capability. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus exposed to 0.5 or 50 mg/kg of TPHP identified 531 differentially expressed proteins that were mainly involved in axon guidance, synaptic function, neurotransmitter transport, exocytosis, and energy metabolism. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis showed that exposure to TPHP reduced the protein levels of TUBB3 and SYP in the synapses of hippocampal neurons. TPHP exposure also downregulated the gene expression of neurotransmitter receptors including Grins, Htr1α, and Adra1α in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, the calcium-dependent synaptic exocytosis governed by synaptic vesicle proteins STX1A and SYT1 was inhibited in the TPHP-treated hippocampus. Our results reveal that TPHP exposure causes abnormal learning and memory behaviors by disturbing synaptogenesis and neurotransmission. © 2020","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 34; Correspondence Address: Y.

Many Carp management methods have been applied including physical removal, pesticide treatments of whole lakes, and water drawdowns. Herein, we tested key elements of a potential “bait and switch” approach in which corn could be used to induce feeding aggregations of Carp and then switched for corn pellets with a pesticide Antimycin-A (ANT-A) to selectively target the Carp. First, laboratory experiments were used to determine if addition of lethal concentrations of ANT-A to corn pellets deterred Carp from eating corn-based food pellets. Second, a pond experiment tested if a corn-based bait containing ANT-A functioned as a species-specific Carp management tool in a semi-natural environment with three common native fishes: White Sucker (Catostomus commersonii Lacepède, 1803), Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens, Mitchill, 1814), and Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque, 1819). The use of baited sites by Carp and native species was monitored using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Mortality of each species and presence of corn in their digestive tracts was also monitored. Our laboratory experiment showed that presence of ANT-A did not deter Carp from consuming the pellets. The pond experiment showed that only Carp perished in significant numbers once toxic bait was applied. Further, only Carp increased their use of baited sites once baiting began, and only Carp had corn in their digestive tracts. Overall, our results indicate that corn might function as a species-specific Carp attractant in systems of North American Midwest and that corn-based bait can be used to effectively conceal a lethal dose of ANT-A. Further research is necessary to refine this potential management tool, specifically investigating the behavioral and social dynamics of Carp aggregating at sites baited with corn to enhance the temporal and spatial specificity of pesticide application. © Hundt et al.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: P.J.

In present studies, Nineteen maize inbreds selected from diverse sources were characterized for resistance traits against shoot fly under its natural infestation using moistened fishmeal. Though the antixenosis to shoot fly for oviposition was not observed in the test genotypes. But, the presence of significant variation in the deadhearts incidence revealed the existence of relative amount of resistance among the test genotypes. The Tolerance (measured in the terms of less proportion of deadhearts out of total shoot fly incidence (leaf injury + deadhearts)) and Antibiosis (in terms of larval and pupal weight, duration and survival) were recognized as key mechanisms of this resistance. Tolerance to shoot fly was significantly more in resistant inbreds, SO1SHYQBBB13B, HK12-6-2-4, DMSC 28, CM 143 and Winpop 8 (29.46–36.56%) in comparison to the susceptible genotypes SE 563 and LM 16 (46.31–47.44%). The correlation and stepwise regression analyses revealed that the more seedling vigor, less leaf area, less number of leaves and thin stem had significant impact on the shoot fly deadhearts incidence and provided resistance against this pest. The total soluble sugars (TSS), proteins and amino acids were significantly higher in the susceptible inbreds; whereas, total phenols and tannins; and activities of defensive enzymes viz. phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were significantly higher in resistant inbreds. Further, the stepwise regression revealed that the larval period, per cent pupation, pupal weight female, pupal weight male and adult emergence of shoot fly were significantly influenced by PAL activity, which explained 71.5, 82.9, 47.0, 29.8 and 39.9% of their total variation, respectively. PPO activity significantly influenced the pupal period (R2 = 59.7%) whereas, the larval weight was significantly influenced by amino acids (R2 = 56.9%), proteins (R2 = 10.2%) and TSS (R2 = 7.7%). So, the correlation and regression analyses revealed that these physico-chemical characters of the maize inbreds can be utilized as reliable markers traits to identify resistant sources to develop shoot fly resistant maize hybrids. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

Multiple strategies are adopted for its control including eradication of mosquito breeding sites by improving water storage and solid waste disposal as well as treating breeding sites with chemical insecticides. However, continuous use of insecticides has resulted in development of insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti. This study explores the potential biocontrol of Ae. aegypti by the use of commercial entomopathogenic nematodes, namely Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, H. downesi, H. megidis, Steinernema carpocapsae, S. feltiae and S. kraussei. The pathogenic effect of nematodes (concentrations 10, 250, 500 and 1,000 infective juveniles (IJs)) was assessed against third instar Ae. aegypti in multi-well culture plates for 3 days. The evaluated nematode species were pathogenic to Ae. aegypti, however, their virulence varied significantly. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and S. carpocapsae were most virulent causing 90-100% mortality at 100 IJs per larva, whereas H. megidis and S. kraussei showed least virulence causing 40-60% mortality. Heterorhabditis downesi and S. feltiae had intermediate virulence. Third instar Ae. aegypti indiscriminately overfeed nematodes triggering melanisation but ingested nematodes overcome the defence system resulting in killing the larvae and reproduced within them. Some of the nematodes were melanised, suggesting a strong humoral defence response by Aedes, nevertheless, with variable degree of melanisation. The melanisation did not stop nematode from multiplying and killing Aedes larvae and thus, they have potential to be developed into a novel strategy for Ae. aegypti control. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: M.A. Ansari; Institute of Life Science 1, Swansea University, Swansea, Singleton Park, SA2 8PP, United Kingdom; email: m.a.ansari@swansea.ac.uk; CODEN: BSTCE",10.1080/09583157.2020.1776215,Aedes aegypti;entomopathogenic nematodes;Heterorhabditis;ingestion;mosquito;Steinernema;Heterorhabditis bacteriophora;Heterorhabditis downesi;Heterorhabditis megidis;Nematoda;Steinernema carpocapsae;Steinernema feltiae;Steinernema kraussei;Zika virus;cause of death;chikungunya;dengue fever;disease control;disease vector;entomopathogenic organism;feeding;larva;nematode;potential biocontrol agent;yellow fever;Zika virus disease;Cause of Death;Q Fever;Fever;Aedes,NA,NA,indiscriminate feeding of commercial entomopathogenic nematodes caused death of aedes aegypti larvae potential for vector control of chikungunya dengue and yellow fever

The ability to sense host cell-imposed damages, and to mount efficient stress responses are crucial for survival and proliferation of intracellular pathogens. The various combinations of host defence mechanisms acting on intracellular bacteria and their individual response also explain the occurrence of distinct subpopulations of intracellular S. enterica such as dormant or persisting, slowly or rapidly replicating cells. Here we describe a set of fluorescence protein (FP)-based reporter strains that were used to monitor the expression of cytoplasmic or periplasmic stress response systems of single bacterial cells. This is mediated by a fast-maturing FP as reporter for induction of stress response genes. We evaluated slower maturing FPs for a second function, that is, the analysis of the status of intracellular proliferation of pathogens. The combination of two FPs allows, at level of single bacterial cells, the interrogation of stress response and intracellular proliferation.

All the cellular processes taking place in an organism are strictly regulated by an intracellular network of signaling pathways. In the case of immune cells, the NF-κB pathway is considered the key signaling pathway as it regulates the expression of more than 200 genes. The transcription factor NF-κB is sensitive to exogenous factors, such as xenoestrogens (XEs), which are compounds mimicking the action of endogenous estrogens and are widely distributed in the environment. Moreover, XE-induced modulation of signaling pathways may be crucial for the proper development of the immune system. In this review, we summarize the effects of XEs on the NF-κB signaling pathway. Based on our analysis, we constructed a model of XE-induced signaling in immune cells and found that in most cases XEs activate NF-κB. Our analysis indicated that the indirect impact of XEs on NF-κB in immune cells is related to the modulation of estrogen signaling and other pathways such as MAPK and JAK/STAT.

The D1 protein of Photosystem II is highly abundant in the chloroplast with a rapid steady-state turnover; the final step of D1 protein processing is thus exploited for the continuous release of antioxidant peptides into the organism. Three antioxidant peptides, isolated from different food sources, were successfully expressed in C. reinhardtii. We show that the in vitro antioxidant activity of algae extract is lower in transgenic lines, while the in vivo antioxidant activity is highly evident towards radical oxygen-generating substances than in the control strain. Moreover, the antioxidant mutant releasing the peptide designed from Hoki fish, showed a longer shelf-life and a better resistance to high light and heat stress than the control. These features can be exploited in the vision of the development of robust biocomponents for bioassay applications.

This study investigated the survival of viable oospores and chlamydospores of P. cinnamomi when present as free propagules in untreated soil, or in soil subject to four exogenous treatments: smoke water, fish emulsion and two fungicides (ridomil and furalaxyl). The exogenous treatments were applied under moist and dry soil conditions. Spore viability was determined by the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining technique, with a qPCR assay used to compare general patterns of decline. Over 96% of oospores lost viability over a period of 48 weeks irrespective of soil moisture conditions. The mean percentage viability for oospores decreased from 91% at time zero to 72, 35, 20 and 1% after 6, 12, 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. Reduction in viability of chlamydospores was more rapid than oospores, with viability declining from 92% to zero after 12 weeks. There was no significant difference between untreated soil and the exogenous treatments. The RNA-based qPCR assay indicated a strong presence of viable oospores of P. cinnamomi up to week 12 for moist soil and week 3 for dry soil, but thereafter failed to detect RNA even though viable oospores could be detected by MTT staining. Based on the MTT staining, this study indicated that viability of P. cinnamomi oospores may be entirely lost within 1 year and that of chlamydospores within 3 months for the soil type tested. Therefore, oospores and chlamydospores when existing as free propagules in soil appear unlikely to be involved in the long-term survival of P. cinnamomi. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: J.

The median lethal concentration (96 h-LC50) was determined, and the effects of a sublethal concentration on oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated in the liver, gills, white muscle, and heart. During the acute toxicity test, fish mortality progressively increased with RT concentration along with behavioral abnormalities were detected. The calculated 96 h-LC50 value of RT was found as 1.21 mg/L. Fish exposed to 0.5 mg/L of RT (40% of 96 h-LC50) showed a significant increase in the hepatic somatic index (HSI) with a concomitant decrease in Fulton’s condition factor (K). The sublethal exposure also induced significant increases (p < 0.05) in the hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, reduced glutathione (GSH) content, and catalase (CAT) activity, with a concomitant decrease in the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. In the gills, RT exposure induced significant increases in the GST activity, GSH and LPO levels, whereas CAT activity was inhibited. RT also induced CAT and GST activities together with the content of GSH and LPO levels in the white muscle. On the other hand, significant decreases in the CAT and GST activities were detected in the heart with a marked increase in the GSH content and no changes in LPO levels. Therefore, the exposure to 0.5 mg/L of RT induced oxidative stress in the liver, gills and white muscle with tissue-specific responses related to antioxidant defenses.

There is an urgent need to develop improved analytical methodologies as well as for a deep insight into the mechanism behind the interaction between pesticides and the nucleic acids of living organisms. In the present work, the electrochemical behavior of the diacylhydrazine insecticide methoxyfenozide (Met) on a boron-doped diamond electrode and its interaction with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were investigated for the first time by applying cyclic voltammetry and square-wave (SW) voltammetry. The influence of numerous factors, such as composition of the supporting electrolyte, its pH, and voltammetric parameters, was analyzed. Under the optimized conditions, a simple and sensitive SW voltammetric procedure was developed for the determination of Met. Quantification was found to be linear from 5.0 × 10−7 to 7.0 × 10−5 mol L−1, with a detection limit of 1.4 × 10−7 mol L−1. The application of the developed voltammetric methodology for the analysis of tap water, river water and grape juice was tested with spiked samples. Studies on the interaction between methoxyfenozide and double-stranded salmon sperm DNA were conducted using both voltammetric and spectroscopic techniques.

Designing cost-effective fishways is essential for a trade-off between water uses and successful longitudinal connectivity restoration. The multislot fishway (MSF) concept, which operates with 30–50% lower discharge than a vertical slot fishway (VSF), was recently developed. This study assessed and compared the entrance performance (entrance time; entry efficiency) and transit times of two cyprinids for VSFs and MSFs. Four configurations, with the same structural characteristics (slope; water depth; head drop; pool width and depth), operating with different discharges (Q), were tested (VSF 1: Q = 112 L·s−1; VSF 2: Q = 80 L·s−1; MSF 1: Q = 58 L·s−1; MSF 2: Q = 37 L·s−1 ). Hydrodynamics characterization was performed using a numerical model. Results showed that entry efficiency was higher in MSFs than in VSFs, while entrance time and transit time were overall lower. Numerical modelling revealed that velocities were around 30% lower in MSFs, and turbulence could reach a difference of around 70% in Reynolds shear stress and 50% in turbulent kinetic energy. Overall, MSFs can be considered as a cost-effective fishway solution that can balance the trade-offs between divergent interests in water uses. © 2021 by the authors.

In recent years, researchers have made great progress in the theoretical researches and technical promotion of rice-fish co-culture system in China. Rice-fish coculture system shows obvious advantages over the conventional practice in reducing fertilizers and pesticides, increasing rice production and efficiency, and improving soil and water physicochemical properties. Furthermore, rice-fish co-culture system can guarantee food security, increase farmers' income and reduce non-point source pollution, with good economic, ecological and social benefits. Currently, the area of rice-fish co-culture systems is still small in Guangdong Province. In this paper, we summarize and analyze the situation and the advantage of nature resources of the rice-fish co-culture system in Guangdong Province, and pointe out some problems such as small application area, low production, backward technology development and promotion, poor water and fertilizer management, few rice and fish varieties for the rice-fish co-culture system, and lack of mechanization and intelligentization technology. It is believed that rice-fish co-culture system would have an extensive market prospect in Guangdong Province.

We reviewed integrated pest and disease management steps and techniques in hydroponics to qualify as suitable techniques for different aquaponic designs. Non-chemical prophylactic measures are highly proficient for pest and disease prevention in all designs. Still, the use of chemical control methods remains highly complicated for all systems. We simulated 10–20% runoff concentrations of 9 pesticides in the common UVI design and compared them with NOEC, LC50 of fish. Endosulfan seems most toxic with runoff AI (20.7 μg L−1) exceeding LC50 (10.2 μg L−1) and NOEC (0.05 μg L−1). At 20% runoff, most chemical pesticides pose risks in aquaponic systems. Natural pesticides were also discussed as potential alternatives with low acute toxicity to fish, but little is known about their effects on water and bacteria. While insecticides and herbicides are replaceable by well-established commercial biocontrol measures, fungicides and nematicides would still be relevant in aquaponics due to low efficiency of alternatives (e.g. natural enemies, entomopathogenic fungus). Monitoring and cultural control are the first approaches to contain pest population below the action threshold. Biological controls, in general, are adaptable to a larger extent.

Edwardsiella piscicida is one of the fish pathogens that seriously infect cultured and wild fish species. To understand the molecular immune mechanisms underlying the response to E. piscicida, a comparative gene transcription analysis was performed through RNA-Seq technology. The low-quality sequences were excluded, and the high-quality sequences were assembled into a total of 60,759 contigs with an average length of 988.95 bp. A gene ontology (GO) analysis was employed to classify 5744 genes according to three major functional categories: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. A total of 19,918 genes were successfully annotated into 26 functional categories according to the clusters of orthologous groups (COG) classification. Furthermore, 15,006 genes were classified into 332 KEGG pathways. The q-value was introduced to estimate 5109 genes significantly differentially expressed which includes 1781 up-regulated genes and 3328 down-regulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were involved in the major immune-related pathways which refer to the pathogen recognition, inflammation, Toll-like receptor and chemokine signalling pathways. Moreover, 24,487 potential simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 193,760 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected and identified in the C. striata liver transcriptome.

These deficits include impacts on social and attachment behaviors in a prosocial rodent: the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster). The prairie vole is a laboratory-acclimated rodent that exhibits spontaneous attachment behaviors including pair bonding. Here we extend previous work by addressing how developmental exposure to FM 550 impacts pair bonding strength via an extended-time partner preference test, as well as neuron electrophysiological properties in a region implicated in pair bond behavior, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) core. Dams were exposed to vehicle or 1000 μg of FM 550 via subcutaneous injections throughout gestation, and female and male pups were directly exposed beginning the day after birth until weaning. Pair bond behavior of adult female and male offspring was assessed using a three hour-long partner preference test. Afterwards, acute brain slices of the NAcc core were produced and medium spiny neuron electrophysiological attributes recorded via whole cell patch-clamp. Behavioral impacts were sex-specific. Partner preference behavior was increased in exposed females but decreased in exposed males. Electrophysiological impacts were similar between sexes and specific to attributes related to input resistance. Input resistance was decreased in neurons recorded from both sexes exposed to FM 550 compared to vehicle.

Residual malaria transmission occurs under several possible circumstances, among which the presence of exophilic vector species, such as Anopheles dirus, or indoor- and outdoor-biting vectors, such as Anopheles nili, or specific behavior, such as feeding on humans indoors, then resting or leaving the house the same night (such as Anopheles moucheti) or also changes in behavior induced by insecticides applied inside houses, such as the well-known deterrent effect of permethrin-treated nets or the irritant effect of DDT. The use of insecticides may change the composition of local Anopheles populations, such as A. arabiensis taking up the place of A. gambiae in Senegal, A. aquasalis replacing A. darlingi in Guyana, or A. harrisoni superseding A. minimus in Vietnam. The change in behavior, such as biting activity earlier than usually reported - for example, Anopheles funestus after a large-scale distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets - or insecticide resistance, in particular the current spread of pyrethroid resistance, could hamper the efficacy of classic pyrethroid-treated long-lasting insecticidal nets and maintained transmission. These issues must be well documented in every situation to elaborate, implement, monitor, and evaluate tailored vector control programs, keeping in mind that they must be conceived as integrated programs with several well and appropriately coordinated approaches, combining entomological but also parasitological, clinical, and social methods and analyses. A successful integrated vector control program must then be designed to reduce transmission and incidence rates of malaria morbidity and overall mortality. © 2021 World Health Organization, 2021.

Therefore, based on the previously reported beneficial functions of the L1 cell adhesion molecule, we hypothesized that L1 mimetic compounds may serve to neutralize neurotoxicity triggered by the pesticide paraquat (PQ). In this study, we attempt to use PQ for inducing PD-like pathology and the L1 mimetic compounds phenelzine sulfate (PS) and tacrine (TC) as potential candidates for the amelioration of PD symptoms using zebrafish as a model system. Administration of PQ together with the L1 mimetic compounds PS or TC (250 nM) improved survival of zebrafish larvae, protected them from locomotor deficits, and increased their sensorimotor reflexes. Moreover, application of PQ together with PS (500 nM) or TC (1000 nM) in adult zebrafish counteracted PQ-induced toxicity, maintaining normal locomotor functions and spatial memory in an open field and T-maze task, respectively. Both L1 mimetic compounds prevented reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine levels, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, protected against impairment of mitochondrial viability, improved the antioxidant enzyme system, and prevented a decrease in ATP levels. Altogether, our findings highlight the beneficial functions of the agonistic L1 mimetics PS and TC by improving several vital cell functions against PQ-triggered neurotoxicity.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  141,10.3389/fnins.2020.00458     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),pesticide;paraquat;zebrafish;Parkinson's disease-like pathology;L1 cell adhesion molecule;phenelzine sulfate;tacrine;OXYGEN SPECIES PRODUCTION;SPINAL-CORD REGENERATION;PARKINSONS-DISEASE;OXIDATIVE STRESS;MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION;RECOGNITION MOLECULES;ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN;RAT-BRAIN;IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY;FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY;Pesticides,NA,NA,adhesion molecule l1 agonist mimetics protect against the pesticide paraquatinduced locomotor deficits and biochemical alterations in zebrafish

We used atrazine, one of the most used herbicides in the world, and Daphnia pulex, a representative cladocerans, to test the possible interference effect of herbicides on the induced defensive traits of cladocerans in response to predator fish (Rhodeus ocellatus) kairomone, including morphological defense, life history strategies, and the expression of defense-related genes.

Exposure to atrazine affected the expression of defense-related genes, and we speculated that atrazine affected the signaling process in the induced anti-predation defense of cladocerans. Specially, fish kairomone attenuated the negative effects of high concentrations of atrazine on the life history traits of D. pulex.

Metal residues (Cu, Cd, As and Pb), in liver and muscle, as well as oxidative stress biomarkers were assessed at different stages in the life cycle of white seabream under culture conditions and in wild specimens, of a marketable size. Metal concentrations in tissues were low, and below the established limits. However, wild white seabream showed higher accumulation than cultured ones. Antioxidant enzymes, namely catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were correlated with metal accumulation. Oxidative damages to tissues were low, with wild white seabream showing lower levels than cultured fish.

Fish were exposed to the herbicide at concentrations of 10,20 and 40 mu l per liter of water for 24 hours to determine its effects on gills and liver epithelia. The estimated LC50 was 34.64 mu l of 2,4-D per liter of water.

Histochemistry revealed qualitative variations of glycoconjugates present on mucous cells and granules. The four types of mucous cells contained neutral granules, acids, or both. Increasing amounts of syalomucins were observed from the control group to the group exposed to the highest concentration of 2,4-D, suggesting increased mucous viscosity and the formation of plaques that could inhibit gas exchange and osmoregulation. Lamellar fusion observed in the group exposed to 40 mu l of 2,4-D suggests a defense mechanism. Hepatocytes showed vacuolization in the 10 and 20 mu l/L groups. The 40 mu l/L group showed normal hepatocytes as well as changed ones, many Ito cells, micronuclei, and nuclear swelling.

Biochemical analysis and synergistic studies with metabolic inhibitors indicated that elevated glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) with a predominant peroxidase activity conferred resistance to both pyrethroids, whereas esterases conferred part of the resistance to permethrin. Purified esterases hydrolysed permethrin at a slow rate, but incubation of either pyrethroid or their primary metabolites with partially purified GSTs had no effect on the metabolic profile. Although GSTs were sensitive to inhibition by both pyrethroids, they did not serve as binding proteins, as previously hypothesized [Grant and Matsumura (1988) Insect Biochem. 18, 615-622]. We demonstrate that pyrethroids, in addition to their neurotoxic effect, induce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in insects. Pyrethroid exposure induced lipid peroxides, protein oxidation and depleted reduced glutathione. Elevated GSTs in the resistant strains attenuated the pyrethroid-induced lipid peroxidation and reduced mortality, whereas their in vivo inhibition eliminated their protective role. We therefore hypothesize that the main role of elevated GSTs in conferring resistance in N. lugens is through protecting tissues from oxidative damage.

These neurobehavioral injuries have been linked to reduced survival and population declines. Despite the importance of maintaining proper olfactory signaling processes in the presence of chemical exposures, little is known regarding chemical detoxification in the salmon olfactory system, and in particular, the antioxidant defenses that maintain olfactory function. An understudied, yet critical component of cellular antioxidant defense is phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx/GPx4), an isoform within the family of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzymes that can directly reduce lipid peroxides and other membrane-bound complex hydroperoxides. In this study, we cloned two gpx4 isoforms (gpx4a and gpx4b) from Coho salmon olfactory tissues and compared their modulation in olfactory and liver tissues by cadmium, an environmental pollutant and olfactory toxicant that cause oxidative damage as a mechanism of toxicity. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the two gpx4 isoforms shared 71% identity, and also relatively high sequence identities when compared with other fish GPx4 isoforms. Sequence comparisons with human GPx4 indicated conservation of three important active sites at selenocysteine (U46), glutamine (Q81), and tryptophan (W136), suggesting similar catalytic activity between fish and mammalian GPx4 isoforms. Tissue profiling confirmed the expression of gpx4a and gpx4b in all ten Coho tissues examined. The expression of gpx4 mRNAs in the Coho olfactory system was accompanied by comparably high initial rates of GPx4 enzymatic activity in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. Exposure to low (3.7 ppb) and high (347 ppb) environmental Cd concentrations for 24-48 h significantly decreased gpx4a expression in Coho olfactory rosettes, whereas olfactory gpx4b mRNA expression was not modulated by exposures at these concentrations. In summary, Coho salmon express two paralogs of gpx4, a key enzyme in the maintenance of signal transduction processes that protect against cellular oxidative damage. The Cd-associated downregulation of salmon olfactory gpx4a expression in particular, may be associated with the loss of olfactory signal transduction that accompanies metal-associated loss of olfaction in salmonids.

Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were determined in blood and tissues for measurement of oxidant-antioxidant status. A significant elevation in the level of MDA, as an index of lipid peroxidation, and reductions in antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px) and low molecular weight antioxidant (GSH) levels were observed in DM-exposed fish. Treatment with lycopene attenuated the DM-induced oxidative stress by significantly decreasing the levels of MDA.

Laboratory experiments examined feeding and respiration rates of the caddisfly Sericostoma vittatum as well as the growth, emergence and respiration rates of the midge Chironomus riparius, exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of imidacloprid. The effects of the two stressors on burrowing behaviour of both species were also assessed. The results show significant effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of imidacloprid on all endpoints studied. Perceived predation risk also elicited sub-lethal effects in C. riparius and S. vittatum, the latter species being less responsive to predation cues. The effects of simultaneous exposure to both types of stressors were assessed using two different approaches: analysis of variance and conceptual models [concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA)] normally used for the evaluation of contaminant mixture exposure. Both statistical approaches showed no significant interactions on responses in simultaneous exposures in the majority of parameters assessed with only a signification deviation from the reference CA and IA models being found for C. riparius respiration data contrary to the ANOVA results.        Exposure to imidacloprid also compromised antipredator behavioural responses of both insect species, with potential negative consequences in terms of mortality from predation in the field.        The results obtained demonstrate that natural and anthropogenic stressors can be treated within the same framework providing compatible data for modelling. For an improved interpretation of ecological effects it will be important to expand the mechanistic study of effects of combined exposure to pesticides and perceived predation risk by measuring different endpoints over a wider range of pesticide concentrations.

In this laboratory study, we tested the prediction that prior chemical exposure to a non-native predator feeding on conspecific tadpoles will subsequently allow tadpoles of the common toad (Bufo bufo) to recognize the chemical cues specifically released by this starved predator. Furthermore, we investigated the vulnerability of this chemically-mediated process to herbicide contamination. With these aims in view, groups of tadpoles were kept either unexposed or exposed for ten days to chemical cues from Turkish crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) previously fed on tadpoles, both in uncontaminated water and in the presence of four sublethal concentrations of amitrole (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.l(-1)). We then assessed the effects of the six conditioning treatments on general activity and behavioural response to chemical cues from starved crayfish. Larval treatments did not affect the general activity of the tadpoles. By contrast, the treatments had significant effects on the behavioural response to the test solution prepared form starved crayfish. The only tadpoles to show an antipredator behavioural response to the chemical stimulation from starved crayfish belonged to the groups derived from chemical exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in uncontaminated water and in contaminated water with the lowest concentration of amitrole (0.01 mg.l(-1)). Conversely, this chemical stimulation produced no behavioural change in the control group or in the groups derived from exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in contaminated water containing 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.l(-1) of amitrole. This study demonstrates that chemical cues released during the predator's feeding activity can subsequently be used by common toad tadpoles in the recognition of an unfamiliar predator. In addition, our results show that the presence of sublethal amitrole concentrations can impair this recognition process.

During periods of food scarcity, arctic seabirds experience lipid mobilization, allowing stored lipid soluble contaminants to re-enter the body circulation. In the present study, we investigated the effects of PCB exposure and fasting on the antioxidant defense system in HG chicks. Forty newly hatched chicks were exposed to contaminated cod liver oil for 6 weeks and then fasted for 1 week. We assessed the hepatic total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) against peroxynitrite, hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, and measured glutathione (reduced: GSH, and oxidized: GSSG) levels and the enzymatic activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase. The results show that fasting significantly increased the HOC levels in the HG chick livers. Limited effects were observed on antioxidant responses; significant effects were only found for catalase (CAT) activity, Se-dependent GPX activity and the GSH/GSSG ratio in the exposed and fasted group. CAT and Se-dependent GPX activities correlated negatively with the PCB concentrations within this group, and a nonlinear relationship between glutathione and contaminant levels was also found. These effects were generally not observed after exposure or fasting alone and were likely related to the high PCB levels induced by the combination of exposure and fasting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Chlorpyrifos was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 July 2006 by Commission Directive 2005/72/EC5. It was a specific provision of the inclusion, that notifiers were required to submit to the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') further studies to confirm the risk assessment for birds and mammals within two years from the entry into force of the inclusion Directive.        In accordance with the specific provision, Dow AgroSciences, on behalf of the Chlorpyrifos Task Force, submitted further studies in June 2008, which were evaluated by the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), Spain, in the form of an Addendum to the assessment report. In compliance with Guidance Document SANCO 5634/2009 rev. 3, the RMS distributed the Addendum to Member States and the EFSA for comments on 30 June 2009. The RMS collated all comments in the format of a Reporting Table, which was submitted to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) in November 2009.

This activity often takes place in areas subjected to various recurring pollutions. The recrudescent use of herbicides in agriculture including atrazine implies pollutant transfer towards aquatic environment in estuarine areas. Harmful effects of such substances on animals in marine environment, particularly on cultured bivalves, are poorly documented. Bivalve molluscs such as mussels and oysters have been postulated as ideal indicator organisms because of their way of life. They filter large volumes of seawater and may therefore accumulate and concentrate contaminants within their tissues. Moreover, development of techniques allowing effect analysis of such compounds on bivalve biology may lead to the development of diagnosis tools adapted to analyze pollutant transfer towards estuarine areas. In this context, influence of atrazine on defence mechanisms was analyzed in Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas.

In mammals, it inhibits monoamine uptake through binding to the dopamine transporter, with a mechanism of action similar to cocaine, resulting in higher levels of dopamine at the synapse. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in a broad spectrum of processes such as locomotion, cognition, reward, and mental disorders. In this work we have studied, for the first time, the effects of TDF on behavior of both larval and adult zebrafish and its connection with changes in the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We evaluated the acute exposure of 5 dpf larvae to different concentrations of TDF, ranging from 5 mg/L to 35 mg/L. The lowest concentration does not alter neither locomotor activity nor dopamine levels but produced changes in the expression of two genes, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine transporter (dat). Besides, it induced a reduction in extracellular serotonin and had an anxiolytic-like effect, supported by a decrease in cortisol production. On the other hand, a high concentration of TDF produced a dose-dependent reduction in locomotion, which was reversed or enhanced by D1 (SCH-23390) or D2 (Haloperidol) dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively. Using in vivo electrochemistry, we show that these changes could be associated with higher levels of dopamine in the brain. Thus, in adult zebrafish, though not in larvae, TDF exposure increases locomotor activity, anxiety and aggressiveness, which coincides with the behaviors observed in mammals.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  42,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.12.012     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Triadimefon;Dopamine;Serotonin;Zebrafish;Behavior;TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE;DOWN-REGULATION;LARVAL;THIGMOTAXIS;MODULATION;LOCOMOTION;FUNGICIDES;PATTERNS;RELEASE;NEURONS,NA,NA,behavioral effects of triadimefon in zebrafish are associated with alterations of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways

Susceptibility of different tissues to oxidative DNA damage was studied by exposing fish to model pollutants. Cu(II), paraquat (PQ) and malathion failed to promote DNA oxidation in liver, while dieldrin significantly increased the 8-oxodG content in this organ, but not in gills or blood. After PQ exposure, fish liver showed high levels of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (G-6PDH) and GSSG reductase activities. The increased antioxidant status and the lack of a specific transport system could explain the lack of susceptibility of liver to DNA oxidative damage induced by PQ. Increased levels of 8-oxodG were detected in the gills of PQ-exposed fish after 8 and 24 h. In contrast, after 48 h exposed fish contained lower 8-oxodG levels than controls. The existence of a PQ transport system in this O-2-rich organ and the lack of a significant increase in antioxidant defenses would explain the sensitivity of gills to DNA damage promoted by PQ. Elimination of this soluble chemical and the putative induction of DNA-repair enzymes specific for oxidative damages could explain the drop of 8-oxodG levels at longer times. Fish exposed to moderate levels of urban and industrial pollution showed significantly high 8-oxodG content in hepatic DNA. We conclude that 8-oxodG determination in chromosomal DNA by HPLC-EC is a potentially useful biomarker of environmental pollution, although its response is still somewhat lower than that of other well-established biomarkers of oxidative stress.

Following exposure to a broad variety of aquatic pollutants, early morphologically detectable toxic effects often manifest in alterations of the gills. Suitable methods for an accurate and unbiased quantitative characterization of the type and the extent of morphological gill alterations are therefore essential prerequisites for recognition, objective evaluation and comparison of the severity of gill lesions. The aim of the present guidelines is to provide practicable, standardized and detailed protocols for the application of unbiased quantitative stereological analyses of relevant morphological parameters of the gills of rainbow trout. These gill parameters inter alia include the total volume of the primary and secondary gill lamellae, the surface area of the secondary gill lamellae epithelium (i.e., the respiratory surface) and the thickness of the diffusion barrier. The featured protocols are adapted to fish of frequently used body size classes (300-2000 g). They include well-established, conventional sampling methods, probes and test systems for unbiased quantitative stereological analyses of light- and electron microscopic 2-D gill sections, as well as the application of modern 3-D light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) of optically cleared gill samples as an innovative, fast and efficient quantitative morphological analysis approach. The methods shown here provide a basis for standardized and representative state-of-the-art quantitative morphological analyses of trout gills, ensuring the unbiasedness and reproducibility, as well as the intra- and inter-study comparability of analyses results. Their broad implementation will therefore significantly contribute to the reliable identification of no observed effect concentration (NOEC) limits in ecotoxicological studies and, moreover, to limit the number of experimental animals by reduction of unnecessary repetition of experiments.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  133,10.1371/journal.pone.0243462     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),DESIGN-BASED STEREOLOGY;SURFACE-AREA;FISH GILL;HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ALTERATIONS;ARBITRARY PARTICLES;SALMO-GAIRDNERI;PATHOLOGICAL RESEARCH;MEMBRANE THICKNESS;PROLONGED EXPOSURE;BRACHYDANIO-RERIO,NA,NA,a practical guide to unbiased quantitative morphological analyses of the gills of rainbow trout <i>oncorhynchus mykiss<i> in ecotoxicological studies

Compression affects the quality of the depth maps which in turn may introduce various structural and textural distortions in the DIBR-synthesized images. Estimation of the compression-related distortion in depth maps is very important for a high-quality 3D experience. The task becomes challenging when the corresponding reference depth maps are unavailable, e.g., when evaluating the quality on the decoder side. In this paper, we present a no-reference quality assessment algorithm to estimate the distortion in the depth maps induced by compression. The proposed algorithm exploits the depth saliency and local statistical characteristics of the depth maps to predict the compression distortion.

The first synthetic pyrethroids developed in the United States are allethrin and bioallethrin. According to the World Health Organization, the classification pyrethroids has a place in the fourth group of insecticides and includes 42 substances. More than 30% of pyrethroid insecticides are used worldwide. In the year 2015, the global market of pyrethroid insecticides has been estimated at USD 4.67 billion and is expected to touch USD 6.45 billion by the year 2021. Pyrethroid insecticides are potent against an extensive variety of pests belonging to the orders Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, and Thysanoptera. Pyrethroid insecticides interrupt the functioning of the peripheral nervous system by reacting with the voltage-gated sodium channels and cause a series of bursts and paralyses. The low tendency to accumulate in organisms, short biodegradation period, and economic value have led to the overuse of pyrethroids with unavoidable consequences. The increase in the production of mites in cotton, in tea, and in vegetables was reported by the constant use of synthetic pyrethroids. Even at a very low concentration in water, pyrethroids are strongly absorbed by the gills of fish due to their lipophilic nature and lead to their toxicity and even altered homing ability in honeybees. Pyrethroid metabolites were detected in the breast milk of women in various parts of the world. Long-term exposure of pyrethroids leads to aggressive behavior in humans due to the leftover traces of pyrethroid metabolites in urine.

In the present study, zebrafish embryos and larvae were used to study the effects of the insecticide diazinon and the herbicide diuron in regard to occurrence of oxidative stress-related cellular responses, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR)-related efflux transporter activity—which represents the first line of defense against xenobiotics in many aquatic organisms—and responses of different molecular and biochemical biomarkers. Results: The recently established non-invasive quantitative plate assay, which uses the fluorescent probes CM-H                             2                             DCFDA and CellTracker™ Green CMFDA and measures the fluorescence in whole zebrafish larvae, was applied to assess changes in reactive oxidative species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) after exposure to the investigated pesticides. The results showed a significant increase of GSH after 1 h exposure of zebrafish larvae to both diazinon and diuron. Regarding the ROS induction, no significant increases in fluorescence could be detected after 2 h exposure to the investigated pesticides. Applying a newly adapted assay for MXR activity, it was determined that diuron caused no change after a 24-h exposure, but caused a significant induction of MXR activity after a 48-h exposure (indicated by a decreased amount of accumulated rhodamine B). On the other hand, diazinon caused an inhibition of MXR activity after both 24 h and 48 h exposure (indicated by an increased amount of accumulated rhodamine B). Regarding the biomarkers, different set-ups and exposure periods were applied and both molecular (gene expression) and biochemical (enzymatic activities) responses were assessed. Diazinon caused an inhibition of carboxylesterase (CES) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in zebrafish larvae, diuron inhibited AChE activity in in vitro testing, and both pesticides significantly affected gene expression and activities of some of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family enzymes. Conclusions: The obtained results show various effects of the investigated pesticides and will help to elucidate how aquatic animals cope with pesticides present in their environment. Additionally, the recently developed fluorescence-based assay and the newly adapted MXR activity assay proved to be useful tools for ecotoxicological risk assessment to further investigate pesticide effects.                          © 2019, The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 38; Correspondence Address: T.-B.

The present study aimed to evaluate the toxic effects of Monocrotophos on the locomotor activity, antioxidant activity, lipid peroxidation, and expression of genes related to apoptosis using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model. The neurotoxic effects of sub-lethal concentration of the Monocrotophos on fish were evaluated. The locomotor activity of the fishes was determined, followed by an antioxidant activity, and lipid peroxidation assays were performed. The expression of genes related to apoptosis in the brain was also determined by qPCR. The Lethal Concentration for 96 hrs. was estimated to be 36.5 mg/L. When exposed to sub-lethal concentration, marked changes were observed in locomotor activity (distance traveled, swimming speed and meandering), acetylcholinesterase activity, oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxidation) and antioxidant defenses in the brain. Expression of apoptotic genes determined by qPCR revealed an increase in Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 expressions.

The presence of neonicotinoids in surface waters raises the concern of the potential risk of exposure to non-target aquatic species, with relevance for both free-living and parasitic taxa. The susceptibility of aquatic free-living parasitic stages to the lethal effects of neonicotinoids may influence the prevalence and intensity of host infection, and their availability as prey for a variety of organisms (e.g., fish, invertebrates). We examined the effects of two commonly used neonicotinoids on the survival of free-living infectious stages (cercariae) from two trematode (flatworm) species (Diplostomum sp. and Haematoloechus sp.). We found that exposure to commercially formulated imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, individually and in a binary mixture, had no significant effect on cercarial survival for either species at environmentally relevant concentrations. Further study is required to understand if the ability of the surviving cercariae to infect the next host in their life cycle is compromised in the presence of neonicotinoids, or if host defenses are compromised, as changes in parasite infectivity or host susceptibility could influence infection dynamics and have community- and ecosystem-level implications. © 2020, Crown.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: S.A.

Methods: This review presents qualitative and quantitative evidence in three animal models (rodent, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans), for neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects occurring at CPF doses lower than those inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Results: CPF treatment in rodents at low noncholinergic doses during neurodevelopment showed behavioral effects, including locomotor activity, neuromotor function (NMF), cognition, anxiety, social behavior, and maternal care. Zebrafish and C. elegans, which are transparent during development, allow for detailed analysis of specific systems; further, they exhibit neurotoxic effects closely emulating those observed in mammalian pathways. Qualitative results showed concordance among rodents, zebrafish and C. elegans for adverse effects on locomotor activity, NMF, and AChE inhibition. Male rodents had greater sensitivity for effects on locomotor activity than females and exposure during the gestation day 10–14 window showed consistent increases in locomotor activity at low CPF doses (≤1.0 mg kg−1 day−1). Zebrafish had cognitive and anxiety deficits after CPF treatment at low doses and young adult C. elegans had reproductive dysfunction associated NMF and disruption of the serotonergic pathway. Quantitative data for all three species showed neurobehavioral effects after exposure to CPF doses approximately 2–10-fold below the threshold for AChE inhibition. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings provided a weight-of-evidence for low-dose CPF neurotoxicity and noncholinergic mechanisms.

After 28 d of CYP exposure, the levels of Immunoglobulin M (IgM), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and C-reactive protein (CRP)were significantly decreased (p < 0.05)after treatment with 1.5 μg/L CYP. Moreover, an induction of inflammatory cytokine transcripts (tnfa, il-6, il-8, and il-12)was observed (p < 0.05)after treatment with 1.5 μg/L CYP. After challenge with Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens), plasma lysozyme (LYS)activity at 24 and 48 hours post-injection (hpi)was significantly decreased in the 0.5 and 1.5 μg/L CYP treatment groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, liver Complement component 3 (C3)and CRP contents at 24 hpi were significantly decreased in the 1.5 μg/L CYP treatment group (p < 0.05), whereas significant decreases in liver C3 and IgM contents were observed at 48 hpi (p < 0.05). Inhibition of expression of Toll-like receptor-nuclear factor kappa B (TLR-NF-kB)signaling pathway-related genes was observed in the CYP treatment groups and resulted in significant down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines (il-1β and il-12)in the 1.5 μg/L CYP treatment group at 48 hpi (p < 0.05). Interestingly, the mortality in the 0.5 and 1.5 μg/L CYP treatments was significantly increased at 48 hpi (p < 0.05). These results indicated that environmentally relevant concentrations of CYP suppressed the Chinese rare minnow immune system and reduced immune defense against bacterial infection, thereby causing subsequent mortality.

However, in aquaculture settings the application of SCP to treat cynobacterial blooms may affect non-targeted biota, such as fish due to H2O2 being known to elicit toxic oxidative stress. Consequently, a better understanding of the side effects as a function of dosing concentrations would help to improve treatment efficacy and fish welfare. Thus, the aim of the current study is to assess the potential risks of SCP to largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), a high priced fish in the U.S. To this end, fish were exposed to two recommended doses of SCP corresponding to either 2.5 or 4.0 mg/L H2O2 for 6 days, with a control group in parallel. After 6 days, the effect of SCP exposure on oxidative stress, histopathological changes and anti-oxidant potential in the brain, liver, gills and muscle were investigated. Results show that exposure to 4.0 mg/L H2O2 -SCP incited oxidative damage, evidenced by an over-accumulation of H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the brain and liver, which were accompanied by an increment in xanthine oxidase activity. Unlike 4.0 mg/L H2O2, these oxidative stress biomarkers in the brain and liver tissue of 2.5 mg/L H2O2-SCP exposed fish were restrained within control levels and concomitant with an increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) activity. In contrast, many of these anti-oxidants sentinels in the 4.0 mg/L H2O2 exposed fish were either unaffected or significantly inhibited, which resulted in over-accumulation of H2O2 and MDA. In addition, a series of histopathological alterations were observed, and the most severe brain injuries and liver inflammation were recorded in 4.0 mg/L H2O2-SCP exposed fish. Based on oxidative parameters, both SCP doses resulted in a relatively mild oxidative stress in gills but no effect in muscle, probably explaining the modest anti-oxidative responses in the former and almost complete lack of anti-oxidative responses in the latter. Overall, our findings suggests that the application of SCP at 4.0 mg/L H2O2 to control cyanobacterial blooms in aquaculture settings can possess potential risks to the farmed fish. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 25; Correspondence Address: N.

Towards this end, we designed and synthesized a synthetic peptide of 23 amino acids (AAs) (1GWLIRGAIHAGKAIHGLIHRRRH23) from a defense protein 3 cDNA sequence of Octopus minor. The sequence of the peptide, which was named Octominin, had characteristic features of known antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as a positive charge (+5), high hydrophobic residue ratio (43%), and 1.86 kcal/mol of Boman index. Octominin was predicted to have an alpha‐helix secondary structure. The synthesized Octominin was 2625.2 Da with 92.5% purity. The peptide showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of 50 and 200 μg/mL, respectively, against Candida albicans. Field emission scanning electron microscopy observation confirmed that Octominin caused ultrastructural cell wall deformities in C. albicans. In addition, propidium iodide penetrated the Octominin‐treated C. albicans cells, further demonstrating loss of cell membrane integrity that caused cell death at both MIC and MFC. Octominin treatment increased the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and decreased cell viability in a concentration dependent manner. Cytotoxicity assays revealed no significant influence of Octominin on the viability of human embryonic kidney 293T cell line, with over 95% live cells in the Octominin‐treated group observed up to 100 μg/mL. Moreover, we confirmed the antifungal action of Octominin in vivo using a zebrafish experimental infection model. Overall, our results demonstrate the Octominin is a lead compound for further studies, which exerts its effects by inducing cell wall damage, causing loss of cell membrane integrity, and elevating oxidative stress. © 2020 by the authors.

The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 μg/L of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: S.N.

Since traditional methods only consider a small fraction of substances present in the water cycle, biological effect monitoring is required for a more reliable assessment of the pollution status. A major challenge for environmental risk assessment (ERA) is the application of adverse outcome pathways (AOP), i.e. the linking of pollutant exposure via early molecular and biochemical changes to physiological effects and, ultimately, effects on populations and ecosystems. We investigated the linkage between responses at these different levels. Many AOP aspects were investigated, from external and internal exposure to different classes of micropollutants, via molecular key events (MKE) the impacts on organs and organisms (fish physiology), to changes in the population dynamics of fish. Risk assessment procedures were evaluated by comparing environmental quality standards, bioassay responses, biomarkers in caged and feral fish, and the impact on fish populations. Although no complete AOP was observed, indirect relationships linking pollutant exposure via MKE to impaired locomotion were demonstrated at the most polluted site near a landfill for chemical waste. The pathway indicated that several upstream key events requiring energy for stress responses and toxic defence are likely to converge at a single common MKE: increased metabolic demands.

In this study, the endocrine disrupting effects of commonly used insecticides thiamethoxam and λ cyhalothrin were investigated by using Oreochromis niloticus as a model organism. The fish exposed to 1/20, 1/10 of 96-h LC50 value of thiamethoxam and λ cyhalothrin (477.29 mg/L, 2.901 µg/L), individually and in mixtures, for 7 and 15 days. Fish were then left to depurate in pesticide-free water for 7 days. Results showed that acetyhcholinesterase, catalase and estradiol/testosterone levels decreased, while the amount of etoxyresorufin-Odeetylase (EROD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione (GSH) and protein carbonil (PCO) increased in comparison to the control. After the recovery period, EROD, GST, malondialdehyde, estradiol/testosterone levels were found to be lower than the control. In the pesticide mixture group, the activity of antioxidant enzymes was highest and the level of hormones was lowered. The group of the mixture pesticide showed the highest lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation than only thiamethoxam or λ cyhalothrin exposure. In conclusion, the mixture of the insecticides showed a more toxic effect on the gonad of tilapia compared to individual pesticide exposures. In addition, the depuration period of 7 days was not adequate to eliminate the toxic effects of these insecticides.

During evolution, they have developed different anti-predator behaviours, as the vibrational-evoked startle response and its habituation, for promoting survival to predator's strikes. Whereas these two behaviours can be altered by the exposure to some neurotoxicants, it is currently unknown if the exposure to environmentally relevant concentration (ERC) of neurotoxic pollutants could impair them. In this study thirty neurotoxic environmental pollutants from nine chemical groups, including: herbicides; carbamate, organophosphate (OP), organochlorine (OC), neonicotinoid and pyrethroid insecticides; toxins; metal and non-metal elements, have been screened at two concentrations, including one environmental relevant concentration (ERC), for adverse effects on anti-predator behaviours by using the Vibrational Startle Response Assay on zebrafish larvae. Significant effects over anti-predator responses were equally observed in both exposure concentrations. Focusing on the ERC scenario, it was found that the startle response was the less affected behaviour, where ten pollutants from all chemical groups except for organochlorine, neonicotinoid and pyrethroids, altered this response. Interestingly, organic and inorganic pollutants showed opposite effects on this response: whereas all organic pollutants decreased the startle response, the three remaining inorganic pollutants increased it. On the other hand, more pollutants affected habituation of the startle response of the larvae, where thirteen of the pollutants from all groups, except for herbicides, altered this behaviour at ERC, generally resulting in a faster habituation except for one OP and one marine toxin, which were able to delay this response. Ultimately, only one chemical from the OP, toxin, metal and non-metal element groups altered both the startle response and its habituation at both ERC and WSC. These results emphasize the environmental risk of the current levels of some neurotoxicants present in our aquatic ecosystems, as they are high enough to impair essential anti-predator behaviours in fish larvae. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 25; Correspondence Address: M.

However, limited information is known about the toxicological effects of their enantiomers on aquatic organisms. In this study, zebrafish were separately exposed to 100 and 1000 μgL−1 hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers for 21 d 1H NMR-based metabolomics analysis showed that the exposure of low and high dose of hexaconazole enantiomers altered energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism of zebrafish, with the different metabolic profiles resulted from the same dose of (+)-hexaconazole and (−)-hexaconazole. Similar to hexaconazole enantiomers, the metabolic profiles, including the changes related to energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, were demonstrated in low and high dose epoxiconazole enantiomers treatment groups. There are differences in the metabolic profiles of zebrafish between exposed to (+)-epoxiconazole and (−)-epoxiconazole of the same dose. The results of histological examination revealed that the exposure of both enantiomers for hexaconazole and epoxiconazole resulted in the similar histopathological changes. The exposure of hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers at low and high dose resulted the vacuolization and swell in the liver of the female and male zebrafish. Compared to female zebrafish, more liver damage was found in male zebrafish in the hexaconazole enantiomers exposure groups. The reduction of spermatids was observed in hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers treatment groups of both doses. Hexaconazole enantiomers exposure of low and high dose resulted the increase in the number of mature eggs, while such effect was not observed in epoxiconazole enantiomers exposure groups. Hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers exposure resulted in no changes in brains of female and male zebrafish. As a result, both triazole-based chiral bactericides, hexaconazole and epoxiconazole, have similar toxicological effects but their mechanisms of action are not exactly the same.

Fishes in the Family Cichlidae have been especially successful colonizers of south Florida freshwater habitats. Herein we report a multi-agency effort to eradicate two non-native cichlid fishes in Miami, Florida (Bay Snook Petenia splendida and Blue Mbuna Labeotropheus fuelleborni). These fishes were removed before they were observed in the extensive, interconnected canal system through which they may have been able to expand throughout south Florida and access protected areas such as Everglades National Park. The study site, Pinecrest Gardens, is important because it contains remnant coastal cypress-strand habitat in an increasingly urbanized landscape that historically provided refuge to native amphidromous fishes and invertebrates. The project took considerable time (3.5 years), and we detail in this report how it evolved from a focus on isolating the non-native fishes and reducing their population sizes to an eradication. Gardens’ staff hydrologically isolated their ponds from nearby waterbodies by plugging a culvert with a solid gate. That provided the interagency team with more time to remove the potential threats. Compromises were made between fish management strategies and the Gardens’ priorities. Hurricane impacts helped shift priorities to more aggressive fish-management strategies. Cooperation among several federal and state agencies, as well as the Gardens, was key to the project’s success. We hope this effort may serve as a model for removing non-native species before they spread into ecosystems where eradication is not practical. © Schofield et al.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: P.J.

These short cationic peptides are bactericidal against both Gram-positive and -negative enteric pathogens, but may also exert killing effects on intestinal luminal microbiota. Simultaneously, these peptides modulate numerous cellular responses crucial for gut defenses, including leukocyte chemotaxis and migration, wound healing, cytokine production, cell proliferation, and pathogen sensing. This review discusses recent advances in our understanding of expression, mechanisms of action and microbicidal and immunomodulatory functions of major colonic host defense peptides, namely cathelicidins, β-defensins, and members of the Regenerating islet-derived protein III (RegIII) and Resistin-like molecule (RELM) families. In a theoretical framework where these peptides work synergistically, aspects of pathogenesis of infectious colitis reviewed herein uncover roles of host defense peptides aimed to promote epithelial defenses and prevent pathogen colonization, mediated through a combination of direct antimicrobial function and fine-tuning of host immune response and inflammation. This interactive host defense peptide network may decode how the intestinal immune system functions to quickly clear infections, restore homeostasis and avoid damaging inflammation associated with pathogen persistence during infectious colitis. This information is of interest in development of host defense peptides (either alone or in combination with reduced doses of antibiotics) as antimicrobial and immunomodulatory therapeutics for controlling infectious colitis. © Copyright © 2020 Blyth, Connors, Fodor and Cobo.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 28; Correspondence Address: E.R.

Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) is a well-known medicinal plant with many pharmacological properties. Hence, the present study was designed to explore the probable beneficial effect of M. oleifera on CPF-induced health disturbances in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Two hundred and seventy fish were allocated into six groups in triplicate. For 30 days, the first group was fed a basal diet; the second group was exposed to 1/10 of the LC                             50                              of CPF (0.007 mg/L) and fed the basal diet; the third and fourth groups were fed basal diets supplemented with 7% M. oleifera seeds and 10% M. oleifera leaves, respectively; and the fifth and sixth groups were exposed to 1/10 of the LC                             50                              of CPF and fed basal diets supplemented with 7% M. oleifera seeds and 10% M. oleifera leaves, respectively. CPF exposure significantly altered growth performance, haematologic profiles, immune defence mechanisms, liver functions, and oxidant/antioxidant status. Additionally, CPF exposure resulted in prominent genotoxic and lipid peroxidative impacts. Interestingly, dietary supplementation with 7% M. oleifera seeds or 10% M. oleifera leaves significantly counteracted the CPF-induced adverse impacts on O. niloticus growth performance and health. These outcomes show that dietary supplementation with M. oleifera seeds or leaves can safeguard the commercially valuable freshwater fish species O. niloticus against CPF-induced health disorders and may be a candidate feed additive for Nile tilapia in aquaculture.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 57; Correspondence Address: Y.M.

Antifungal and entomotoxic effects were demonstrated for Jaburetox, an intrinsically disordered polypeptide derived from jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) urease. Here we describe the properties of Soyuretox, a polypeptide derived from soybean (Glycine max) ubiquitous urease. Soyuretox was fungitoxic to Candida albicans, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species. Soyuretox further induced aggregation of Rhodnius prolixus hemocytes, indicating an interference on the insect immune response. No relevant toxicity of Soyuretox to zebrafish larvae was observed. These data suggest the presence of antifungal and entomotoxic portions of the amino acid sequences encompassing both Soyuretox and Jaburetox, despite their small sequence identity. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic data revealed that Soyuretox, in analogy with Jaburetox, possesses an intrinsic and largely disordered nature. Some folding is observed upon interaction of Soyuretox with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles, taken here as models for membranes. This observation suggests the possibility for this protein to modify its secondary structure upon interaction with the cells of the affected organisms, leading to alterations of membrane integrity. Altogether, Soyuretox can be considered a promising biopesticide for use in plant protection. © 2019 by the authors.

We use the case of fish-friendly rice produced in Shiga prefecture, Japan, which contributes to the conservation of the water and ecosystem in rural areas around Lake Biwa by setting up fish ways and reducing the use of herbicides. We assume two conditions for consumers to pay premiums on environmental-friendly agricultural products. The first is that consumers recognize multifunctionality in agriculture. The second condition is that consumers have a correct understanding of environment-friendly agricultural products. We thus examine the effects of respondents’ attributes on their responses to two types of visual stimuli: one associated with the multifunctionality of agriculture and information about environment-friendly agricultural products. In the analysis of the respondents; willingness to pay, the price premium of the group with both the stimulus and information is significantly higher than the price premium of the control group with no interventions. However, the price premium of the group with only the stimulus is not statistically different for the control group. The policy implication of this research is that consumers are more likely to support agri-environmental policies if they recognize both the multifunctionality of agriculture and the properties of environmental-friendly agricultural products.

However, fish responses to organophosphates may vary depending on the activation of different defense mechanisms as well as the length of exposure. As such, the evaluation of acetylcholinesterase activity, in combination with the evaluation of biotransformation and antioxidants enzymes levels, is useful for indicating damage in fish exposed to this insecticide. Moreover, evaluating mitochondrial activity might evidence how the hierarchic responses occur in relation to the length of time that the fish is exposed. Therefore, the aim of our study is to evaluate whether the length of exposure to malathion differentially affects the biochemical responses of tambaqui. Our hypothesis is that the physiological alterations due to exposure are time dependent. Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of the insecticide during 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Contrary to expectations, there was no acetylcholinesterase activity inhibition during the experiment, which indicates an absence of neurotoxicity. Phase II biotransformation mechanism was activated early, especially in the liver. Oxidative damage was evident in the first hours of exposure and was concurrent with the activation of antioxidant enzymes. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were differentially affected by the length of exposure. The data suggest that the tambaqui regulates mitochondrial respiration differently over time, seeking to maintain homeostasis and ATP demand, and ensures the activation of response mechanisms, thus minimizing oxidative damage and avoiding the neurotoxicity of malathion.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  40,10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105997,Detoxification;Response mechanisms;Mitochondrial respiration;ATP demand;INTEGRATED BIOMARKER RESPONSE;CARPIO PROTECTIVE ROLE;CHIROSTOMA-JORDANI;LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY;DANIO-RERIO;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE;INHIBITION;CHLORPYRIFOS;BIOENERGETICS;DYSFUNCTION,NA,NA,temporal exposure to malathion biochemical changes in the amazonian fish tambaqui <i>colossoma macropomum<i>

The selective mode of action of diflubenzuron provided us with a unique tool for examining the indirect responses of an experimental aquatic ecosystem following direct impacts at the primary consumer (invertebrate) trophic level. Twelve outdoor aquatic mesocosms (0.1 ha each) were randomly assigned to three treatments of diflubenzuron (four mesocosms/treatment): control, monthly (five total 10-mu g/L applications), or biweekly (twice monthly; nine total 10-mu g/L applications). Direct impacts on invertebrates (numbers and species composition of insects and zooplankton) and indirect impacts on fish (mortality, growth, and reproduction of bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass), phytoplankton (biomass and productivity), and water quality were measured over 16 weeks posttreatment. Both monthly and biweekly treatments of diflubenzuron decreased total numbers (fivefold reduction) and species richness (twofold reduction) and increased dominance (twofold increase) of zooplankton within 4 weeks posttreatment; Cladocerans, Copepods, and Rotifers were all sensitive. Diflubenzuron reduced species richness of emergent insects, which resulted in increased dominance by a few species; however, impacts on emergent insects were confounded by a treatment x time interaction. Direct reductions in invertebrate grazers caused indirect increases in algal biomass. Indirect effects on biomass (50% reduction) and individual weight (50% reduction) of juvenile bluegill occurred because of apparent decreases in invertebrate food resources. No statistically significant impacts were observed on adult bluegill or largemouth bass for the duration of the experiment.

POPs are therefore addressed by the Stockholm Convention globally with human milk or blood as matrix for effectiveness evaluation. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess plasma concentrations of certain chlorinated POPs in subjects from the urban population in Algiers. Methods: A total number of 207 adult subjects were recruited in Algiers and plasma concentrations of Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), p,p'Dichlorodiphenyl DichloroEthylene (4,4'DDE) and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) were determined by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). Results: The nanogram per gram of lipids (ng g???1 lipids) geometric means of plasma concentrations of studied compounds were: 6.09 for HCB, 131.60 for 4,4'DDE, 8.61 for PCB153, 7.95 for PCB138 and 8.39 for PCB180. PCB 180, PCB 153 and PCB 138 showed a high correlation with each other (r > 0.5). 4,4'DDE concentrations were significantly higher in women and in subject with low educational level, whereas POPs were higher in older participants (> 65 years old). Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and PCB153 concentrations were higher in overweight and obese subjects. There was no significant difference between POPs concentrations according to breastfeeding history, smoking status or fish consumption. Conclusions: Chlorinated POPs were detected in the blood plasma of adults living in Algiers. Plasma concentrations were consistent with those of several studies in the world. However, further investigations are needed to assess the exposure profile of subjects living near contaminated sites. (c) 2021 The Authors.

However, stability has not been investigated for cases in which multiple types of density dependence act simultaneously. To determine whether IDD mortality can destabilize populations that are otherwise regulated by directly density-dependent (DDD) mortality, I used scale transition approximations to model populations with IDD mortality at smaller ""aggregation"" scales and DDD mortality at larger ""landscape"" scales, a pattern observed in some reef fish and insect populations. I evaluated dynamic stability for a range of demographic parameter values, including the degree of compensation in DDD mortality and the degree of spatial aggregation, which together determine the relative importance of DDD and IDD processes. When aggregation-scale survival was a monotonically increasing function of density (a ""dilution"" effect), dynamics were stable except for extremely high levels of aggregation combined with either undercompensatory landscape-scale density dependence or certain values of adult fecundity. When aggregation-scale survival was a unimodal function of density (representing both ""dilution"" and predator ""detection"" effects), instability occurred with lower levels of aggregation and also depended on the values of fecundity, survivorship, detection effect, and DDD compensation parameters. These results suggest that only in extreme circumstances will IDD mortality destabilize dynamics when DDD mortality is also present, so IDD processes may not affect the stability of many populations in which they are observed. Model results were evaluated in the context of reef fish, but a similar framework may be appropriate for a diverse range of species that experience opposing patterns of density dependence across spatial scales.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  80,10.1007/s12080-010-0083-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Dynamic stability;Negative binomial distribution;Scale transition approximation;Social aggregation;Thalassoma bifasciatum;REEF FISH POPULATIONS;PREY;RECRUITMENT;PREDATORS;MORTALITY;DISPERSAL;PATTERN;MUSSEL;CONSEQUENCES;CONNECTIVITY;Animal Shells;Animals,NA,NA,can inverse density dependence at small spatial scales produce dynamic instability in animal populations

The acute toxicity study revealed that the 96-h LC50 of BF is 6.81 mu g/L, and varying degrees of behavioral changes were recorded in a dose-dependent manner. The subchronic study revealed reduction of dissolved oxygen and increased ammonia in aquaria of BF-exposed fish. Clinical signs revealed high degree of discomfort and aggressiveness together with reductions in survival rate and body weight gain. The levels of monoamines in brain, and GABA and amino acids in serum were reduced, together with decreased activities of Na+/K+-ATPase and acetylcholine esterases (AchE). The activities of antioxidant enzymes were also diminshed in the brain while oxdative damage and DNA breaks were elevated. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in serum increased with overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain tissue. BF also upregulated the expression of brain-stress related genes HSP70, Caspase-3 and P53. Supplemention of PEO to BF markedly abrogated the toxic impacts of the insecticide, specially at the high level.

Although the toxicity of ATZ in fish is well documented, there are few studies on the recovery capacity after cATZ exposure. This work aimed to evaluate, using several biomarkers, the toxic effects of long-term exposure to the sublethal (3.57 mg/L) and nonlethal realistic (3.00 mu g/L) cATZ concentrations followed by a recovery assay, in fingerlings of a Brazilian teleost, the Piaractus mesopotamicus (pacu).        Materials and Methods: Pacu fingerlings were housed in glass tanks and divided into the following experimental groups (two tanks/group): Exposure control = EC, recovery control = RC, the sublethal groups exposed to 3.57 mg/L of cATZ, (sublethal exposure group = SLE and sublethal recovery group = SLR) and the nonlethal groups treated with 3.00 mu g/L of cATZ (nonlethal exposure group = NLE and nonlethal recovery group = NLR). The exposure assay was semi-static with a duration of 30 days and the recovery assay (after cATZ withdrawal) lasted 14 days. Several biomarkers were evaluated in fingerlings from all groups: The swimming behavior, the body weight gain, the micronucleus formation and nuclear alterations in erythrocytes, and the hepatic and renal histopathology analyzed by qualitative and semi-quantitative morphological methods (using light and electron microscopy).        Results: No significant difference in weight gain was observed among the groups after the exposure and recovery assays. The sublethal exposure induced impaired swimming movements, significant histopathological alterations, including necrosis in the liver and kidney, and a significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in erythrocytes. The nonlethal exposure induced only subtle histopathological changes in the liver and kidney. After recovery assay, no genotoxic alteration was noted in pacu exposed to sublethal concentration, while the cATZ-induced kidney damage was partially reversed but not the hepatic injury.        Conclusion: cATZ exhibits long-term toxic effects on pacu, even at relatively low concentrations, affecting mainly the liver and the kidney, and the effects of sublethal concentration are only partially reversed after cATZ withdrawal.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.14202/vetworld.2020.147-159     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Brazilian ichthyofauna;genotoxicity;histopathology;liver and kidney lesions;recovery assay;ultrastructure;EMERGING CONTAMINANTS;MICRONUCLEUS TEST;GENE-EXPRESSION;RISK-ASSESSMENT;ACUTE TOXICITY;CHLORPYRIFOS;WATER;FISH;KIDNEY;RIVER,NA,NA,effects of sublethal and realistic concentrations of the commercial herbicide atrazine in pacu <i>piaractus mesopotamicus<i> longterm exposure and recovery assays

Although in vitro approaches are used internationally, South African studies have only used in vivo methods. Considering ethical implications, the authors support the use of in vitro bioassays to screen environmental matrices for their OS potential. Since OS responses are initiated and measurable at lower cellular concentrations compared to other toxicity endpoints, in vitro OS bioassays could be used as an early warning sign for the presence of chemical mixtures in non-target environments. Areas of concern in the country could be identified and prioritized without using animal models.

NK cells are a subset of lymphocytes that act as an initial immune defense against tumor cells and virally infected cells. TBT is an environmental contaminant that has been detected in human blood, which has been shown to interfere with ATP synthesis. Previous studies have shown that TBT is able to decrease very significantly the lytic function of NK cells. In this study NK cells were exposed to various concentrations of TBT and to two other compounds that interfere with ATP synthesis (rotenone a complex I inhibitor and oligomycin an ATP synthase inhibitor) for various lengths of time before determining the levels of ATP and lytic function. Exposures of NK cells to 10, 25, 50 and 100 nm TBT did not significantly reduce ATP levels after 24 h. However, these same exposures caused significant decreases in cytotoxic function. Studies of brief I h exposures to a range of TBT, rotenone and oligomycin concentrations followed by 24 h, 48 h and 6 day periods in compound-free media prior to assaying for ATP levels or cytotoxic function showed that each of the compounds caused persistent decreases in ATP levels and lytic function of NK cells. Exposures to 0.05-5 mu m rotenone or oligomycin for 1 h reduced ATP levels by 20-25% but did not have any measurable effect on the ability of NK cells to lyse tumor cells. ATP levels were also decreased by about 20-25% after 24 h or 48 h exposures to rotenone or oligomycin (0.5 mu m), and the lytic function was decreased by about 50%. The results suggest that TBT-induced decreases in ATP levels were not responsible for the loss of cytotoxic function seen at I h and 24 h. However, TBT-induced decreases of NK-ATP levels may be at least in part responsible for losses of NK-cytotoxic function seen after 48 h and 6 day exposures.

To our knowledge, the mechanisms of toxicity to fish by the carbamate fungicide Tattoo that contains mancozeb [ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate)] have not been studied. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of Tattoo on goldfish gills and blood, tissues that would have close early contact with the pollutant. Exposure of goldfish Carassius auratus to 3,5 or 10 mg L-1 of Tattoo for 96 h resulted in moderate lymphopenia (by 8 percent) with a concomitant increase in both stab (by 66-88 percent) and segmented (by 166 percent) neutrophils. An increase in the content of protein carbonyl groups in blood (by 137-184 percent) together with decreased levels of protein thiols (by 23 percent) and an enhancement of lipid peroxide concentrations (by 29 percent) in gills after exposure to 10 mg L-1 of Tattoo demonstrated the induction of mild oxidative stress in response to Tattoo exposure. At the same time, the activities of selected antioxidant enzymes were enhanced in gills: superoxide dismutase by 18-25 percent and catalase by 27 percent. A 34 percent increment in low molecular mass thiol concentrations (mainly represented by glutathione) also occurred in gills and could be related to increased activity (by 13-30 percent) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The results indicate that Tattoo exposure perturbs free radical processes, i.e. induces mild oxidative stress and enhances the activity of certain antioxidant and associated enzymes in goldfish gills. It is clear that goldfish respond to the presence of waterborne pesticide by adjusting antioxidant defenses through upregulation of activities of antioxidant and associated enzymes.

Crayfish are polytrophic, meaning that they feed on and become prey for all levels of the aquatic food web as well as are also important for the transfer of energy between benthic and terrestrial food webs. Because crayfish are a keystone species, it is important to investigate any factors that may affect their population size. Crayfish are active at night and rely heavily on their sensory appendages (e.g., antennulues, maxillipeds, and pereopods) to localize food sources. In this experiment, we investigated the effects of atrazine (ATR) exposure on the chemosensory responses of male and female crayfish to food odors. We exposed crayfish to environmentally relevant, sublethal levels of ATR [80 ppb (A mu g/L)] for 72 h and then examined the behavioral responses of both ATR-treated and control crayfish to food odor delivered from one end of a test arena. We used Noldus Ethovision XT software to measure odor localization and locomotory behaviors of crayfish in response to food (fish) odor. We found that control crayfish spent more time in the proximal region of the test arena and at the odor source compared with ATR-treated crayfish. Furthermore, there were no differences in the time spent moving and not moving, total distance travelled in the tank, and walking speed (cm/s) when control and ATR-treated crayfish were compared.

As a result, removal of invasive species and reestablishment of natural vegetation have been attempted in order to restore biodiversity and ecosystem function. This study examined how native arthropod assemblages, an abundant and functionally important group of organisms in many ecosystems, are affected by the incursion of the invasive wetland plant Phragmites australis and if the restoration of the native vegetation in brackish Spartina alterniflora marshes results in the reestablishment of the arthropod community. The invasion of Phragmites into a coastal Spartina marsh in southern New Jersey seriously altered arthropod assemblages and trophic structure by changing the abundance of trophic groups (detritivores, herbivores, carnivores) and their taxonomic composition. Herbivore assemblages shifted from the dominance of external free-living specialists (e.g., planthoppers) in Spartina to concealed feeders in Phragmites (stem-feeding cecidomyiids). Moreover, free-living arthropods in Phragmites became dominated by detritivores such as Collembola and chironomids. The dominant marsh spiders, web-building linyphiids, were significantly reduced in Phragmites habitats, likely caused by differences in the physical environment of the invaded habitats (e.g., lower stem densities). Thus, trophic structure of arthropod assemblages in Phragmites, as seen in the large shifts in feeding guilds, was significantly different from that in Spartina. Removal of Phragmites with the herbicide glyphosate resulted in the rapid return of Spartina (<= 5 yrs). Moreover, return of the dominant vegetation was accompanied by the recovery of most original habitat characteristics (e.g., live and dead plant biomass, water flow rate). The arthropod assemblage associated with Spartina also quickly returned to its preinvasion state and was not distinguishable from that in uninvaded Spartina reference sites. This study provides evidence that the reestablishment of native vegetation in areas previously altered by an invasive plant can result in the rapid recovery of the native arthropod assemblage associated with the restored habitat.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  147     Total Times Cited:  197     Cited Reference Count:  70,10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00045.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alloway Creek;arthropod community structure;habitat restoration;invasive plants;Phragmites;salt marsh;Spartina;trophic structure;MUMMICHOG FUNDULUS-HETEROCLITUS;ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT;COASTAL SAGE SCRUB;COMMON REED;TIDAL WETLANDS;NORTH-AMERICA;NEW-JERSEY;BOTTOM-UP;BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS;BRACKISH-MARSH,NA,NA,restoration of arthropod assemblages in a <i>spartina<i> salt marsh following removal of the invasive plant <i>phragmites australis<i>

The total average PCB concentrations were as high as 96 and 29 mu g/g dry wt, in eels and damselfish, respectively, from Tern Island. The localized behavior and high bioaccumulation potential for PCBs suggest that damselfish are an excellent species for monitoring PCBs in small areas in the ocean. The high average concentrations of the sum of PCBs in different food chain levels suggest that pollution source(s) are around Tern Island and possibly around Disappearing Island. Aroclor 1254 and its analogs are suspected sources responsible for PCBs in the samples. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Fish were allocated into 6 groups: the control group was reared in clean water and fed with a commercial basal diet (CNT), two groups were fed with the basal diet supplemented with two different levels of GEO (GEO1 and GEO2, respectively), one group was intoxicated with 1/5 of ATZ 96-h lethal concentration 50 (1.39 mg/L) (ATZ group), and the remaining two groups were fed with the GEO-supplemented diets and concurrently exposed to 1.39 mg ATZ/L (GEO1+ATZ and GEO2+ATZ, respectively). The experiment lasted for 60 days. GEO supplementation exerted a significantly positive influence on fish growth, feed utilization, and hepatic antioxidant defense systems at both levels of supplementation. ATZ exposure significantly reduced fish survival rates and impaired fish growth and feed utilization, with the lowest final weights, weight gain, total feed intake, and the highest feed conversion ratio being recorded in the ATZ-intoxicated group. ATZ exposure caused significant changes in intestinal digestive enzyme activity (decreased lipase activity), hematological indices (decreased hemoglobin, packed cell volume, erythrocytes, and leukocytes), blood biochemical variables (decreased total proteins, albumin, globulins, and immunoglobulin M; increased total cholesterol, triglycerides, and cortisol), and hepatic oxidative/antioxidant indices (decreased glutathione level, superoxide dismutase and catalase enzyme activity and mRNA expression levels, and increased malondialdehyde content). Moreover, in the hepatic tissue of ATZ-intoxicated Nile tilapia, histopathological alterations and upregulated mRNA expression levels of stress- and apoptosis-related genes (Hsp70, caspase 3, and p53) were observed. GEO supplementation in ATZ-treated groups significantly attenuated the aforementioned negative effects, though some parameters did not reach the CNT values. These findings provide further and partly new evidence that sub-lethal ATZ toxicity induces reduced survivability, growth retardation, impaired digestive function, anemia, immunosuppression, hepatic oxidative stress damage, and overall increased stress level in Nile tilapia, and suggest that GEO supplementation may be useful for mitigating this toxicity and provide more general support to the productive performance and health status of this fish species.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  95,10.3389/fmars.2022.920057     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"herbal essential oils;aquafeed;animal health;animal welfare;productive performance;oxidative stress;physiological parameters;atrazine toxicity;HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS;FRESH-WATER FISH;DNA-DAMAGE;AMERICAN GINSENG;GENE-EXPRESSION;STRESS-RESPONSE;EXPOSURE;ENZYMES;GROWTH;CHLORPYRIFOS;Dietary Supplements;Animals;Oils, Volatile;Panax;Animal Shells",NA,NA,dietary supplementation of nile tilapia <i>oreochromis niloticus<i> with <i>panax ginseng<i> essential oil positive impact on animal health and productive performance and mitigating effects on atrazine induced toxicity

Amongst them, the cholinesterases are commonly extracted from several organisms to evaluate/measure organophosphate and carbamate neurotoxic effects. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) is an enzyme of the group of serine esterases that acts on the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine allowing the intermittence of the nerve impulses responsible for the neuronal communication. This enzyme is the main target for the action of some pesticides and the inhibition of its activity in bivalve mollusks may be used as biomarker due to their filter-feeding habit. In this context, the present study aimed to characterize physicochemical and kinetic parameters of the AChE extracted from gills and viscera of the oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae and investigate the in vitro effect of pesticides (dichlorvos, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, methyl-parathion, temephos, carbaryl, carbofuran, aldicarb, diflubenzuron and novaluron) in search for assessing its potential as biomarker. Specific substrates and inhibitors evidenced the predominance of AChE in both tissues. The optimum pH found for gills and viscera AChE were 8.0 and 8.5, respectively. The maximum peak of activity occurred at 70 degrees C for gill AChE and 75 degrees C for viscera AChE. The enzymes of both tissues presented remarkable thermostability. The Michaelis-Menten constant for both enzymes were 1.32 +/- 0.20 mM for gills and 0.43 +/- 0.12 mM for viscera. The values for gills and viscera were 53.57 +/- 1.72 and 27.71 +/- 1.15 mU/mg, respectively. The enzymes were able to reduce the activation energy to 9.75 kcal mol(-1) (gills) and 11.87 kcal mol(-1) (viscera) obtaining rate enhancements of 3.57 x 10(5) and 1.01 x 10(4), respectively, in relation to non-catalyzed reactions. Among the pesticides under study, the carbamates carbaryl and carbofuran exerted the strongest inhibitory effects on the enzyme activity achieving important degrees of inhibition at concentrations below national and international current regulations. The first observation of the effects of benzoylurea pesticides (diflubenzuron and novaluron) on AChE from mollusks is reported here. The gills AChE of C. rhizophorae showed potential to be specific biomarker for the carbamate carbaryl while the viscera AChE showed it for carbofuran.

Phase one utilized an online, voluntary, self-administered survey with 2788 responses received from a convenience sample of Laurentian Great Lakes Basin residents. Phase two included three “Thinkshops” of fishing and boating stakeholders in southern Michigan. Across all hypothetical Asian carp invasion scenarios, the application of rotenone to a large area was the most frequently selected management response. When impacts from Asian carp and their management were discussed, study participants supported framing risks in terms of environment and economy. Insights herein provide new evidence that can help narrow the gap between how invasion risks are perceived and responded to by natural resource managers to reduce social conflicts over, and potentially address, invasive species threats more rapidly. © Kahler et al.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: M.L.

In this study, krasV12 genetically modified zebrafish, Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2; TRE2:EGFP-krasG12V), a model system in which liver tumors can be induced by doxycycline (DOX), was used to evaluate the liver tumor promotion potential of TDCIPP. Briefly, krasV12 transgenic females were exposed to 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP, 20 mg/L DOX or a binary mixture of 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP with 20 mg/L DOX, and liver size, histopathology, and transcriptional profiles of liver were determined. Treatment with TDCIPP resulted in increased liver size and caused more aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Compared with the exposure to DOX, TDCIPP in the presence of DOX up-regulated the expression of genes relevant with salmonella infection and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. These results implied an occurrence of inflammatory reaction, which was sustained by the increase in the amount of infiltrated neutrophils in the liver of Tg(lyz:DsRed2) transgenic zebrafish larvae whose neutrophils were labelled by red fluorescent protein under the lysozyme C promoter. Furthermore, compared with the binary exposure of DOX and TDCIPP, treatment with a ternary mixture of TDCIPP, DOX and inflammatory response inhibitor (ketoprofen) significantly decrease the liver size and the amounts of neutrophils in the livers of kras and lyz double transgenic zebrafish larvae.

We check the relationships of these environmental factors with the total bird abundance (N), the alpha-fisher diversity (α), the bird species richness (S), the Berger-Parker dominance (d), the Margalef diversity (Mg), the Shannon diversity (H), the Shannon entropy (eh), the Simpson diversity (D) and the Simpson dominance (1-D) using stepwise multiple linear regression. To validate these statistical models, we determine the coefficients of determination (R2), the residual normality by Shapiro-Wilk test (W) and the residual homoscedasticity by Breusch-Pagan test (BP). In all the regressions we obtained high coefficients of determination, residual normality (except in Simpson dominance) and residual homoscedasticity. The main causal variables that effected ecological parameters of community were altitude, distance to nearest city, noise level and shrub cover. The park age was irrelevant because in urban areas the environment is continuously modified by gardening and, consequently, the succession processes are not produced.

In this study, we investigated the immunotoxic effects of Gla exposure on zebrafish embryos. Firstly, Gla markedly decreased the survival rate and caused a series of morphological malformations in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the number of macrophages and neutrophils was substantially reduced upon Gla exposure. In addition, the levels of oxidative stress were changed and the antioxidant enzyme activities such as CAT and SOD were elevated with the increase of Gla concentrations. Secondly, comparative transcriptome analysis identified 1, 366 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 789 up-regulated and 577 down-regulated in zebrafish embryos after Gla exposure. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that metabolic pathways such as drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 was markedly regulated and proteolysis, oxidation-reduction process, and peptidase activity were significantly enriched by the GO analysis. Besides, 55 immunity-related genes were identified in the DEGs, and we found that the genes in the metabolism, redox and immunity display an unique expression profilings by clustering analysis. Finally, 8 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were further conﬁrmed and they were differentially regulated after Gla exposure. In summary, a global survey of zebrafish defense against glufosinate was performed, and a large number of gene expression levels regarding metabolism, redox, and immunity-related genes were acquired from RNA-Seq.

In line with the regulatory framework implemented within the European Union (EU) to reduce the levels of endocrine disruptors (EDs) for consumers, new and effective methods for ED testing are needed. The OBERON project will build an integrated testing strategy (ITS) to detect ED-related metabolic disorders by developing, improving and validating a battery of test systems. It will be based on the concept of an integrated approach for testing and assessment (IATA). OBERON will combine (1) experimental methods (in vitro, e.g., using 2D and 3D human-derived cells and tissues, and in vivo, i.e., using zebrafish at different stages), (2) high throughput omics technologies, (3) epidemiology and human biomonitoring studies and (4) advanced computational models (in silico and systems biology) on functional endpoints related to metabolism. Such interdisciplinary framework will help in deciphering EDs based on a mechanistic understanding of toxicity by providing and making available more effective alternative test methods relevant for human health that are in line with regulatory needs. Data generated in OBERON will also allow the development of novel adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). The assays will be pre-validated in order to select the test systems that will show acceptable performance in terms of relevance for the second step of the validation process, i.e., the inter-laboratory validation as ring tests. Therefore, the aim of the OBERON project is to support the organization for economic co-operation and development (OECD) conceptual framework for testing and assessment of single and/or mixture of EDs by developing specific assays not covered by the current tests, and to propose an IATA for ED-related metabolic disorder detection, which will be submitted to the Joint Research Center (JRC) and OECD community. © 2020 by the authors.

These organisms can replicate and survive within host macrophages to escape from the subversion of the immune defense. E. piscicida-macrophage interaction is very important in determining the outcome of edwardsiellasis. As an effector protein of E. piscicida T6SS, EvpP has been determined to be a very important virulence factor for E. piscicida, although its precise role in E. piscicida-macrophage interactions is not yet clear. In this study, the roles of EvpP in E. piscicida-macrophage interactions were characterized. Here, we constructed the deletion mutants of evpP (ΔevpP) and complementation (ΔevpP-C) by the allelic exchange method. Compared to wild type strain (WT), ΔevpP was found to be attenuated for growth within macrophages. In line with this observation, we found its survival capacity was lower than WT under oxidative and acid stress in vitro, which simulate conditions encountered in host macrophages. Attenuation of ΔevpP also correlated with enhanced activation of macrophages, as reflected by augmented NO production in ΔevpP-treated macrophages. Moreover, compared to WT, ΔevpP induced markedly increased apoptosis of macrophages, characterized by increased Annexin V binding and the activation of cleaved caspase-3. These findings provided strong evidence that EvpP is involved in the process of E. piscicida-macrophage interactions and is required for its survival and replication in macrophages. Thus, we propose that EvpP might be an important factor that controlling the fate of E. piscicida inside macrophages. To further exploring the underlying mechanism of EvpP action, the cDNA library was constructed from E. piscicida-infected macrophages and a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to search for cellular proteins interacting with EvpP. Ribosomal protein S5 (RPS5) was identified as a target of EvpP. Furthermore, the interaction was validated with co-immunoprecipitation assay. This result implies that the observed effect of EvpP on macrophages might be related to RPS5-mediated regulation, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms of EvpP involved in E. piscicida-macrophage interactions. © Copyright © 2020 Qin, Wang, Gao, Bi and Wang.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: L.

In this study, Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2; TRE2:EGFP-krasG12V), referred as kras transgenic zebrafish which was shown to be an inducible liver tumor model, was applied as experimental model to assess the promotion potential of TDCIPP for HCC in males. In brief, kras males were exposed to 20 mg/L doxycycline (DOX), 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP and a binary mixture of 20 mg/L DOX with 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP, and after exposure liver size, histopathology and transcriptional profiles of liver from these treatments were examined. With the involvement of TDCIPP, the liver size was significantly increased and the lesion of hepatocyte became more aggressive. Furthermore, expressions of genes involved in DNA replication and inflammatory response were simultaneously up-regulated in the treatment of TDCIPP compared with the solvent control and in the treatment of the binary mixture of the two chemicals compared to the single DOX treatment.

Based on data from 934 Chinese consumers, confidence in the safety of milk and IMF was measured by using a multi-item scale with 2 dimensions—optimism and pessimism. We found that Chinese consumers were optimistic about the safety of milk and IMF but, at the same time, were concerned about the risks related to milk and IMF. Chinese consumers have less confidence in IMF than in milk. Structural equation modeling indicated that consumer trust in manufacturers and third parties in the dairy supply chain and confidence in other foods, such as meat and fish, can foster consumer confidence in the safety of milk and IMF, while the extent of recall of the melamine infant formula incident in 2008 and trait worry exert negative effects. In addition, consumers with more children or less family income are likely to be more confident in domestically produced IMF.

This pesticide is an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, an essential enzyme for termination of nerve impulses. High rates of TRF use generate risks to the environment and human health. In the environment, pesticides can affect the local fauna and generate an ecological breakdown. There are several studies performed with fish production; however, gaps are created for native fish with other commercial values. The tuvira (Gymnotus carapo) is a fish native to Brazilian fauna and has great commercial importance in sport fishing. The present study aimed to determine the lethal concentration of trichlorfon (Masoten) in Gymnotus carapo and its sublethal effects on the enzyme AChE. In this study, the acute toxicity (the concentrations to kill 50% of the fish LC50 ) of TRF in tuviras (Gymnotus carapo) and acetylcholinesterase inhibition in liver and muscle tissue of tuviras submitted to sublethal concentrations were evaluated. For the acute assay, concentrations of 0.0, 5.0, 7.5, 15, 22.5, 30, 37.5 and 45 mg L-1 were used for a period of 96 h. After the acute exposure period, a LC50 of 6.38 mg L-1 was determined. In the sublethal assay, concentrations of 0.0, 0.238, 0.438 and 0.638 mg L-1 were used, based on 10% of the LC50, over a period of 14 days. Two collections were performed: one at seven days and the other at the end (day 14). Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in the liver was only shown (p < 0.05) for the treatment with 0.638 mg L-1 after 14 days of exposure. At seven days, muscle activity showed a significant difference only for the treatments 0.438 and 0.638 mg L-1, compared with the treatment 0.238 mg L-1 and control. At 14 days of exposure, only the treatment 0.638 mg L-1 showed significant differences in relation to the other groups, thus showing that enzyme recovery had occurred. The value found in the acute test allowed the conclusion that TRF presents moderately toxic characteristics to Gymnotus carapo. The toxicity parameter values calculated in the present study assisted in estimation of maximum allowable limits in bodies of water when combined with test data from other non-target organisms. © 2020, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

For this reason, larger, older females often disproportionately contribute to recruitment. However, increases in body size and age have also been shown to correlate with increased bioaccumulation of environmental contaminants, which negatively impact reproduction and larval survival. In this study, we tested for maternal age and size effects on fecundity, egg size and quality, contaminant body burden, and maternal transfer in Alligator Gar Atractosteus spatula to assess the potential for contaminant bioaccumulation to offset reproductive benefits of large females. We measured fecundity and egg quality (via lipid content) as well as tissue concentrations of mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in female Alligator Gar from the Trinity River, Texas. Fecundity was positively correlated with body size, but egg lipid was not significantly correlated with body size or with fecundity. Total mercury (THg) in both liver and muscle was positively correlated with maternal body size, and egg THg was positively correlated with maternal body size and liver THg. All liver and egg samples contained detectable levels of PCBs and OCPs, which were positively correlated with body size. Concentrations of PCBs and OCPs were positively correlated between tissues for each female, with egg concentrations being generally higher than liver concentrations. Based on concentrations of Hg, PCBs, and OCPs known to cause biological impairment in adult and larval fishes, the concentrations observed in this study suggest that adult reproductive function and behavior—as well as egg hatching success, larval development, and survival—could be compromised.

Although the toxicity of ATZ in fish is well documented, there are few studies on the recovery capacity after cATZ exposure. This work aimed to evaluate, using several biomarkers, the toxic effects of long-term exposure to the sublethal (3.57 mg/L) and nonlethal realistic (3.00 μg/L) cATZ concentrations followed by a recovery assay, in fingerlings of a Brazilian teleost, the Piaractus mesopotamicus (pacu). Materials and Methods: Pacu fingerlings were housed in glass tanks and divided into the following experimental groups (two tanks/group): Exposure control = EC, recovery control = RC, the sublethal groups exposed to 3.57 mg/L of cATZ, (sublethal exposure group = SLE and sublethal recovery group = SLR) and the nonlethal groups treated with 3.00 μg/L of cATZ (nonlethal exposure group = NLE and nonlethal recovery group = NLR). The exposure assay was semi-static with a duration of 30 days and the recovery assay (after cATZ withdrawal) lasted 14 days. Several biomarkers were evaluated in fingerlings from all groups: The swimming behavior, the body weight gain, the micronucleus formation and nuclear alterations in erythrocytes, and the hepatic and renal histopathology analyzed by qualitative and semi-quantitative morphological methods (using light and electron microscopy). Results: No significant difference in weight gain was observed among the groups after the exposure and recovery assays. The sublethal exposure induced impaired swimming movements, significant histopathological alterations, including necrosis in the liver and kidney, and a significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in erythrocytes. The nonlethal exposure induced only subtle histopathological changes in the liver and kidney. After recovery assay, no genotoxic alteration was noted in pacu exposed to sublethal concentration, while the cATZ-induced kidney damage was partially reversed but not the hepatic injury. Conclusion: CATZ exhibits long-term toxic effects on pacu, even at relatively low concentrations, affecting mainly the liver and the kidney, and the effects of sublethal concentration are only partially reversed after cATZ withdrawal. © Delcorso, et al.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: S.

The implications of these findings for fish was unknown, therefore we investigated the effects of chronic (21 day) exposures to NTO and an NTO-containing IM formulation called IMX-101 (composed of 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN), nitroguanidine (NQ), and NTO) in adult male fathead minnows to assess if impacts on testes were conserved. The NTO exposure caused no significant mortality through the maximum exposure concentration (720 mg/L, measured), however NTO elicited testicular impacts causing significant asynchrony in spermatogenesis and necrosis in secondary spermatocytes at the two highest exposure concentrations (383 mg/L and 720 mg/L) and testicular degeneration at the highest exposure. Microarray-based transcriptomics analysis identified significant enrichment of steroid metabolism pathways and mTORC-signal control of spermatogonia differentiation in NTO exposures each having logical connections to observed asynchronous spermatogenesis. Additionally, NTO impaired transcriptional expression for genes supporting sperm structural and flagellar development including sperm-associated antigen 6 (Spag6). These functional transcriptomic responses are hypothesized contributors to impacted reproductive physiology in NTO exposures that ultimately lead to reductions in spermatozoa. In contrast to NTO, the IMX-101 formulation elicited significant mortality at the two highest exposure concentrations of 25.2 and 50.9 mg/L (DNAN nominal + NTO measured + NQ measured). Unlike NTO and NQ, the DNAN component of the IMX-101 formulation underwent significant transformation in the 21d exposure. From previous investigations, neither NTO nor NQ caused mortality in fish at >1000 mg/L suggesting that mortality in the present study arose from DNAN / DNAN-attributable transformation products. The 12.6 mg/L IMX-101 exposure caused significant sublethal impacts on testes including sperm necrosis, interstitial fibrosis, and Sertoli-like cell hyperplasia. Transcriptional profiles for IMX-101 indicated significant enrichment on multiple signaling pathways supporting spermatogenesis, mitosis / meiosis, and flagellar structure, all logically connected to observed sperm necrosis. Additionally, pronounced transcriptional increases within the PPARα-RXRα pathway, a known DNAN target, has been hypothesized to correspond to Sertoli cell hyperplasia, presumably as a compensatory response to fulfill the nurse-function of Sertoli cells during spermatogenesis. Overall, the transcriptional results indicated unique molecular responses for NTO and IMX-101. Regarding chemical hazard, NTO impacted testes and impaired spermatogenesis, but at high exposure concentrations (≥ 192 mg/L), whereas the IMX-101 formulation, elicited mortality and impacts on reproductive physiology likely caused by DNAN and its transformation products present at concentrations well below the NTO-component concentration within the IMX-101 mixture formulation. © 2019","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: K.A.

Rice-fish farming has been applied in Margoluwih Village, Seyegan District, Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta Province for a few years. This study aims to analyze the use of inputs and production costs in rice-fish (minapadi) farming compared to monoculture rice farming, to estimate the income of rice-fish farming and monoculture rice farming, and to identify factors that influence farmers’ decision in adopting the integrated rice-fish farming. The study was conducted at Margoluwih Village, Sayegan District, Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta in March 2017. A total of 50 farmers were surveyed, comprising of 25 rice-fish farmers and 25 monoculture rice farmers. The methods used to achieve these objectives are descriptive analysis, income analysis, and logistic regression analysis. The results show that rice-fish farming requires inputs such as fish seeds, fish feed, prebiotics, and molasses of sugarcane while monoculture farming does not require such inputs, but monoculture farming uses pesticides and herbicides to overcome pest attacks and applies more chemical fertilizers than rice-fish farming. The labor time devoted to rice-fish farming is also higher than in monoculture farming. The total cost of rice-fish farming per hectare in one production season is Rp 63.47 million, while the total cost of monoculture rice farming amounted to Rp 17.55 million. However, rice-fish farming significantly earn more income compared to monoculture farming with an average value of Rp 28.45 and Rp 3.19 million per hectare in one growing season, respectively. Income is believed to be the main factor in determining the adoption, while social factors that influence farmer's decision to adopt rice-fish farming are age of farmer and experience of rice cultivation. © 2019, International Society for Southeast Asian Agricultural Sciences.

Previous studies have not evaluated the relationships of the frequency and severity of crayfish injuries with physical habitat quality, water quality, and biotic factors within agricultural headwater streams. Understanding these relationships will assist with determining if crayfish injury variables can serve as an indicator of physical habitat quality or water quality in these small degraded streams. We sampled crayfishes, documented the frequency and type of injuries, and measured instream habitat and water chemistry in 2014 and 2015 within 12 agricultural headwater streams in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. We documented five native crayfish species from 1641 adult captures. The most abundant species were Faxonius rusticus, Faxonius immunis, and Faxonius propinquus. Linear mixed effect model analyses indicated that four crayfish injury response variables were positively correlated (p < 0.05) with crayfish density, physical habitat quality, and water velocity diversity and that crayfish injury response variables were more strongly correlated with crayfish density than physical habitat quality or water quality.

Ecological models provide a means of quantitatively linking measured risk assessment endpoints with protection goals, by integrating potential chemical effects with species life history, ecological interactions, environmental drivers and other potential stressors. Here we demonstrate how an ecosystem modeling approach can be used to quantify insecticide-induced impacts on ecosystem services provided by a lake from toxicity data for organism-level endpoints. We used a publicly available aquatic ecosystem model AQUATOX that integrates environmental fate of chemicals and their impacts on food webs in aquatic environments. By simulating a range of exposure patterns, we illustrated how exposure to a hypothetical insecticide could affect aquatic species populations (e.g., recreational fish abundance) and environmental properties (e.g., water clarity) that would in turn affect delivery of ecosystem services. Different results were observed for different species of fish, thus the decision to manage the use of the insecticide for ecosystem services derived by anglers depends upon the favored species of fish. In our hypothetical shallow reservoir, water clarity was mostly driven by changes in food web dynamics, specifically the presence of zooplankton. In contrast to the complex response by fishing value, water clarity increased with reduced insecticide use, which produced a monotonic increase in value by waders and swimmers. Our study clearly showed the importance of considering nonlinear ecosystem feedbacks where the presence of insecticide changed the modeled food-web dynamics in unexpected ways.

The area of low polarity analytes in high fat foods had not been covered by the OAWG for many years since the key comparison CCQM-K21 p,p'-DDT in fish oil occurring in 2000. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is one of the markers for the occurrence of PAHs in foods, for which maximum residue limits are enforced in many countries. Edible oil and fats are the main source of human PAH intake. BaP may form in edible oils by pyrolytic processes, such as incomplete combustion of organic substances. Worldwide regulatory limits of BaP in edible fats and oils are from 2.0 μg/kg to 10 μg/kg. Comparable and traceable measurement results for BaP in oil are important worldwide. Thus BaP in edible oil was the model system selected to align within the OAWG strategy. 16 NMIs and DIs participated in CCQM-K146. Different methods such as liquid-liquid extraction, GPC and SPE were applied in the sample pre-treatment and HPLC-FLD, HPLC-MS/MS, and GC-MS or GC-MS/MS were applied for detection by the participants. Most participants either used their own CRMs, other NMI's CRMs or pure materials assessed in house to guarantee traceability to SI for the calibrants. One lab was excluded from the KCRV evaluation, as they did not meet the CIPM metrological traceability requirements for their calibrant. Regarding the data evaluation, five labs withdrew their results from the statistical evaluation of the KCRV for technical reasons. In line with the OAWG guidance document for KCRV estimator selection, the Hierarchical Bayes option was selected for the KCRV value, which was determined as 2.74 μg/kg with a standard uncertainty of 0.03 μg/kg. The remaining ten institutes that were included in the calculation of the consensus KCRV all agreed within their standard uncertainties. In general, the majority of CCQM-K146 participants performed very well. Therefore, this Track A Key Comparison directly illustrates the capabilities in determining mass fraction of organic compounds, with molecular mass of 100 g/mol to 500 g/mol, having low polarity pKow <-2, in mass fraction range from 0.1 μg/kg to 1000 μg/kg in a high fat, low protein, low carbohydrate food matrix.

Both compounds are nonionic surfactants produced by the alkoxylation of ethylene oxide with tallow amine, and they are used in variety of industries such as textiles, paints, metal working, agriculture, and polish manufacture. Fish were exposed to six concentrations of TA15 (0.2–4.0 mg/L) or TH30 (8–140 mg/L) for 96 h. The LC50 for TA15 was 2.08 mg/L and for TH30 47.32 mg/L. The main clinical signs observed in fish exposed to 4 mg/L of TA15 and 32 to 140 mg/L of TH30, were lethargy, loss of shoaling behavior, respiratory distress, changes in swimming pattern, such as, loss of balance and abnormal buoyancy, prolapse of the lower lip and superior location in the water column. The highest concentrations of these compounds induced nervous signs and collapse. The relevant macroscopic lesions were skin and fins erosions with necrotic lysis of the caudal peduncle. In addition, hemorrhages in mouth, branchial arches, and petechial hemorrhages in skin were observed. An increased fluid in the celomic cavity and meningeal hemorrhages were also evident. Organs as gills, liver, brain, and anterior kidney presented severe lesions at the highest concentrations of each compound. For the first time, it is reported lesions in interrenal tissues and choroidal bodies, as well as severe telencephalic lesions associated with the POEA toxicity. These last lesions were more severe in fish exposed to TA15 than to TH30, although the pattern of injuries was similar with both substances. According to the Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemical (GHS) by the United Nations, we reported that TA15 is classified as Acute Category 2 and TH30 is Acute Category 3 for white cachama. Due to the low LC50 and the highly toxic effects of both POEA compounds for neotropical fish, a revision of the regulation of the use of herbicide mixtures by Colombian legislation is necessary. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: P.R.

PCB concentrations in bluefish varied between different locations, and also among fish from a given location. A generally decreasing gradient in PCB concentrations was evident as the bluefish were collected away from the Superfund Site. The average sum of PCB concentrations were highest for bluefish collected in the Upper Harbor between Inter-state-195 Bridge and Coggeshall Street Bridge (Upper Harbor), followed by bluefish in Lower Harbor from north of Popes Island Bridge (Lower Harbor), and bluefish from Outer Harbor south of Hurricane Barrier (Outer Harbor). The levels of PCBs in bluefish from Clarks Cove and PCBs in bluefish from Buzzards Bay were similar and lowest among all bluefish specimens analyzed in the present study. Pesticide concentrations were about one order of magnitude or lower than the PCB concentrations, and the gradient of pesticide concentrations generally followed the gradient of PCB concentrations. Some of the commonly detected pesticides in the order of decreasing concentrations included DDTs and metabolites, heptachlor epoxide, endosulfan sulfate, and alpha-chlordane. Distribution of PCBs and sulfate, and alpha-chlordane. Distribution of PCBs and organochlorine pesticides were examined in the tissues of YOY bluefish from Clarks Cove. PCBs and lipids in the brain samples of YOY bluefish were generally numerically greater than PCBs in the liver samples, but these differences were not statistically significant. PCBs and lipids in hypaxial muscle samples were numerically greater than PCBs in epaxial muscle samples, although these two groups of tissues were not statistically different. Despite the higher susceptibility of lighter PCB homologs to geophysical and biogeochemical weathering processes, the relative dominance of lighter homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor samples suggested ongoing or recent sources of these lighter PCBs, particularly Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016 in this area. The presence of heavier homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor bluefish samples could be attributed to Aroclor 1252 and Aroclor 1254 that were being used in relatively smaller quantities in the manufacture of electrical components in addition to Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016. The concentration of heavier PCB homologs appears to increase in YOY bluefish the further away from the PCB Superfund Site in the Acushnet Estuary the samples were collected. Principal component analyses of PCB 153 normalized concentrations of the individual PCB congeners resulted in two general groupings; a relatively tight group comprised of YOY bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor, and a rather loose and more dispersed group comprised of Buzzards Bay bluefish and the tissue samples of bluefish from Clarks Cove. Principal component analyses of major pesticides suggested close groupings of bluefish from Clarks Cove and bluefish from Buzzards Bay. Pesticides in bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor formed a loose group, with some bluefish from these locations populating close to Clarks Cove and Buzzards Bay bluefish.        Although PCBs have been implicated in various behavioral and health effects in the experimental and field studies, the deleterious effects of chronic exposure to high concentrations of PCBs and the potential for recruitment of New Bedford Harbor YOY bluefish population to the adult stock remains obscure. Adaptive or evolutionary resistance to contaminants have been documented in resident species in some highly contaminated estuaries, however similar responses have not been investigated in the migratory species like bluefish. The results of the present study provide a reference baseline for YOY bluefish for ""before-and-after"" comparative studies and other toxicological studies for the New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site that is currently being remediated.

Unexpectedly, these structures reveal DNA melting at the heptamer of the RSSs, thus resulting in a corkscrew-like rotation of coding-flank DNA and the positioning of the scissile phosphate in the active site. Substrate binding is associated with dimer opening and a piston-like movement in RAG1, first outward to accommodate unmelted DNA and then inward to wedge melted DNA.

Smaug orthologs form cytosolic membrane-less organelles (MLOs) in several organisms and cell types. We have performed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays that revealed that SDHB and UQCRC1 mRNAs associate with Smaug1 bodies in U2OS cells. Loss of function of Smaug1 and Smaug2 (also known as SAMD4A and SAMD4B, respectively) affected both mitochondrial respiration and morphology of the mitochondrial network. Phenotype rescue by Smaug1 transfection depends on the presence of its RNA-binding domain. Moreover, we identified specific Smaug1 domains involved in MLO formation, and found that impaired Smaug1 MLO condensation correlates with mitochondrial defects. Mitochondrial complex I inhibition upon exposure to rotenone, but not strong mitochondrial uncoupling upon exposure to CCCP, rapidly induced the dissolution of Smaug1 MLOs. Metformin and rapamycin elicited similar effects, which were blocked by pharmacological inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Finally, we found that Smaug1 MLO dissolution weakens the interaction with target mRNAs, thus enabling their release. We propose that mitochondrial respiration and the AMPK-mTOR balance controls the condensation and dissolution of Smaug1 MLOs, thus regulating nuclear mRNAs that encode key mitochondrial proteins.

It was based on the principle of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition and chemometric data analysis using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Four types of native or recombinant AChEs (electric eel, bovine erythrocytes, rat brain, Drosophila melanogaster) were immobilised by screen printing on four-electrode thickfilm sensors in sets containing each AChE. The multisensors were used for quantitative inhibition analysis of binary reagent mixtures combining the AChE-multisensor with feed-forward ANNs. The sensors registered a detection range for both analytes of 0.2-26 mu g/l with an overall assay time of less than 60 min. The individual inhibition pattern of each AChE-analyte combination enabled the discrimination of both analytes by the use of neural network data processing. Thus, paraoxon and carbofuran in mixtures displaying a concentration range of 0-20 mu g/l for each analyte could be analysed with prediction errors of 0.9 mu g/l for paraoxon and 1.4 mu g/l for carbofuran.

The purpose of this study is to understand how differing routes of exposure to atrazine alter social behaviors and physiological responses of aquatic organisms. This study used agonistic encounters in crayfish Orconectes virilis as a behavioral assay to investigate impact of sublethal concentrations of atrazine (0, 40, 80, and 160 A mu g/L) delivered by methods mimicking ground water and surface runoff influx into flow-through exposure arenas for a total of 23 h. Each experimental animal participated in a dyadic fight trial with an unexposed opponent. Fight duration and intensity were analyzed. Experimental crayfish hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle tissue samples were analyzed for cytochrome P450 and acetylcholinesterase levels to discern mechanism of detoxification and mode of action of atrazine. Atrazine delivered via runoff decreased crayfish overall fight intensity and contrastingly ground water delivery increased overall fight intensity. The behavioral differences were mirrored by increases in cytochrome P450 activity, whereas no differences were found in acetylcholinesterase activity.

For Fisher, dominance of the wild-type is the result of selection, whereas for Wright it is a mere consequence of the biochemical properties of physiological pathways. Over time, Wright's theory has appeared as the most appropriate, and Kacser and Burns explained why the widespread occurrence of recessive mutants is the inevitable consequence of the kinetic structure of enzyme networks. Does Wright and Kacser and Burns (W-K-B)'s theory apply for newly arisen adaptive genes? A survey of more than 70 studies shows that pesticide resistance conferred by mutations decreasing the affinity of the pesticide target-sites varies from complete recessivity to complete dominance. This review shows that dominance always has a purely physiological explanation that can be roughly, but not simply, predicted by W-K-B's theory.

On the other hand, the natural environment of amphibians is extremely polluted by various xenobiotics. This study evaluated how pre-exposure of Bombina variegata tadpoles to chronic environmental stress (desiccation) modulates the biochemical response of juvenile individuals to following acute chemical stressor (pesticide deltamethrin). Our results demonstrated that individually applied pesticide changed the thiol and lipid status of the treated juveniles but animals subjected solely to desiccation pressure were more tolerant to free radicals and showed no induction of lipid peroxidation. Comparison of juveniles exposed to deltamethrin revealed that desiccation pretreatment during the larval stage of development modified cellular protection in the juveniles. Higher activities of CAT, GSH-Px and GR were recorded in the preexposed group, as well as a lower degree of lipid peroxidation relative to the group that was not pre-exposed to low water stress. Pre-desiccated groups displayed the greatest range of coordination of investigated antioxidant parameters, supported by Pearson's correlations. Activation of the GSH-redox system is a significant marker in juveniles against stress caused by desiccation and a chemical stressor. The stressful environment experienced during tadpole development produced an adaptive reaction to subsequent exposure to another stressor in juveniles.

The deduced OfMIF and OfDDT protein sequences revealed the presence of the catalytic oxidoreductase (CXXC), motif. They also possessed highly conserved proline (P-2) and lysine residues (K-33), responsible for their isomerase and tautomerase functions. Rock bream MIF and DDT homologues shared higher identity with fish homologues and also with mammals and occupied a distinct position in the phylogenetic tree, depicting their evolutionary conservation. The spatial expression analysis revealed the highest expression of both OfMIF and OfDDT in liver, while portraying constitutive expression in other tissues. The recombinant proteins purified using the Escherichia coli system revealed potent oxidoreductase activity against insulin with both dithiothreitol and glutathione as reducing agents. Stimulation of rock bream head kidney cells with recombinant OfMIF and OfDDT proteins induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta).

By studying HMGB1 release mechanisms, here we identify a role for double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR, also known as EIF2AK2) in inflammasome activation. Exposure of macrophages to inflammasome agonists induced PKR autophosphorylation. PKR inactivation by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition severely impaired inflammasome activation in response to double-stranded RNA, ATP, monosodium urate, adjuvant aluminium, rotenone, live Escherichia coli, anthrax lethal toxin, DNA transfection and Salmonella typhimurium infection. PKR deficiency significantly inhibited the secretion of IL-1 beta, IL-18 and HMGB1 in E. coli-induced peritonitis. PKR physically interacts with several inflammasome components, including NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), NLRP1, NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and broadly regulates inflammasome activation.

These results show a crucial role for PKR in inflammasome activation, and indicate that it should be possible to pharmacologically target this molecule to treat inflammation.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  598     Total Times Cited:  676     Cited Reference Count:  26,10.1038/nature11290     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PROTEIN-KINASE PKR;SUBSTRATE RECOGNITION;NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME;APOPTOSIS;ACID;ELF2-ALPHA;INFECTION;PATHWAYS;BINDING;STRESS,NA,NA,novel role of pkr in inflammasome activation and hmgb1 release

A total of 146 collections containing two or more apogonid species was made in the Gulf of Honduras, 22 in Puerto Rico, and 35 in the Hawaiian Islands. Detrended correspondence analysis determined whether collections from specific habitats clustered together in ordination space. Analysis of the Atlantic apogonid data did not result in the recognition of any exclusive assemblages corresponding to specific habitats, whereas collections from the Pacific Ocean demonstrated exclusive clusters of cardinalfish assemblages from different habitats. Horn's Index of Similarity was used to compare assemblages, and a randomization test was used to evaluate their significance. Because these differences could be the result of large differences in sample sizes between collections from the two oceans, subsamples of the much larger Atlantic dataset were taken. The subsamples demonstrated that with smaller samples the probability of visualizing polygons containing only samples from a single habitat are greater, but these samples did not result in the same level of habitat specificity as found for the Pacific samples, and similarity measures also differed. These data demonstrate for the first time that assemblage patterns within a single fish family differ between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

Immunological responses were examined at different organizational levels, from individuals to gene expression. No negative effects of PD were noted on the Fulton index nor on the liver or spleen somatic indices (LSI; SSI) before viral infection, but the infectious stress seems to generate a weak but significant decrease in Fulton and LSI values, which could be associated with consumption of energy reserves. During the viral challenges, the distribution of cumulative mortality was slightly different between infected groups. The impact of the virus on fish previously contaminated by PD started earlier and lasted longer than controls. The proportion of seropositive fish was lower in the fish group exposed to PD than in the control group, with similar quantities of anti-IHNV antibodies secreted in positive fish, regardless of the treatment. While no significant differences in C3-1 expression levels were detected throughout the experiment, TNF1&2, TLR3, Il-1 beta and IFN expression levels were increased in all infected fish, but the difference was more significant in fish groups previously exposed to herbicide.

Exposure to estrogenic endocrine disrupters during critical periods in fetal life can alter the development of reproductive organs, the neuroendocrine system and subsequent behavior. We present a series of studies on the effects of exposure during fetal life to low, environmentally relevant doses of two pesticides, o, p ' DDT and methoxychlor, and of low doses of the synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol on subsequent neuro-behavioral development in house mice. The main findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Mice prenatally exposed to methoxychlor showed changes in reflex development. Exposure to a very low dose of methoxychlor appeared to produce an increased reactivity during early postnatal life. (2) Methoxychlor exposed periadolescent mice showed a decreased reaction time exploring both a novel environment and a novel object. (3) The onset of male intrasex aggression appeared to be delayed in males prenatally exposed to low doses of methoxychlor, since exposed males showed low levels of aggressive interactions during early adolescence but not after they reached adulthood. (4) The rate of depositing urine marks in a novel environment was increased in males prenatally exposed to DES, and also to o, p ' DDT and methoxychlor. (5) The proportion of both males and females attacking a same-sex conspecific was increased in mice prenatally exposed to low doses of DES and, marginally, to o, p ' DDT. This effect appeared to be related to a decreased latency to attack. However, males prenatally exposed to o, p ' DDT displayed a decreased intensity of aggression. The possible implications of perturbing the hormonal milieu during fetal development on the modulation of developmental turnpoints and future behavioral responses are discussed.

We used congener-specific and total Aroclor quantitative approaches, both of which involved gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (electron ionization mode), we confirmed the presence of PCBs in the combined serum samples and in the aliquots of bluefish and lobsters. In measuring the PCB levels in serum, we found good agreement between the two electron capture detector approaches (r greater-than-or-equal-to 0.97) when the serum of specific congeners was compared to total Aroclor. We used univariate and multivariate quality control approaches to monitor these analyses. Analytical results for bluefish showed a better agreement between the two techniques than did those for lobsters; however, the small number of samples precluded any statistical comparison. We also measured levels of chlorinated pesticides in the serum samples of two groups of New Bedford residents, those with low PCB levels (< 15 ng/ml) and those with high PCB levels (greater-than-or-equal-to 15 ng/ml). We found that residents with high PCB levels also tended to have higher levels of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-di-(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE).

Coagulation, liver, and kidney indices were first analyzed by variance analysis, receiver operating characteristic curves, and Fisher discriminant analysis. Then, a new, intelligent, machine learning-based system was established to effectively provide prognostic analysis of PQ-poisoning patients based on a combination of the aforementioned indices. In the proposed system, an enhanced extreme learning machine wrapped with a grey wolf-optimization strategy was developed to predict the risk status from a pool of 103 patients (56 males and 47 females); of these, 52 subjects were deceased and 51 alive. The proposed method was rigorously evaluated against this real-life dataset, in terms of accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficients, sensitivity, and specificity. Additionally, the feature selection was investigated to identify correlating factors for risk status. The results demonstrated that there were significant differences in the coagulation, liver, and kidney indices between deceased and surviving subjects (p<0.05). Aspartate aminotransferase, prothrombin time, prothrombin activity, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, urea nitrogen, and creatinine were the most highly correlated indices in PQ poisoning and showed statistical significance (p<0.05) in predicting PQ-poisoning prognoses. According to the feature selection, the most important correlated indices were found to be associated with aspartate aminotransferase, the aspartate aminotransferase to alanine ratio, creatinine, prothrombin time, and prothrombin activity. The method proposed here showed excellent results that were better than that produced based on blood-PQ concentration alone. These promising results indicated that the combination of these indices can provide a new avenue for prognosticating the outcome of PQ poisoning.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  43     Total Times Cited:  46     Cited Reference Count:  34,10.1371/journal.pone.0186427     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),GREY WOLF OPTIMIZER;FACE RECOGNITION;CLASSIFICATION;PREDICTION;Kidney;Poisoning;Liver,NA,NA,a new machinelearning method to prognosticate paraquat poisoned patients by combining coagulation liver and kidney indices

Reliable indicators still need to be found in order to properly assess the impact of pesticides in fish. After an in vivo chronic exposure to pendimethalin, the detoxification process and the antioxidant defense system were assessed in 120 adult rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Four nominal exposure conditions were tested: control (C), 500 ng L-1 (P500), 800 ng L-1 (P800) and the commercial formulation Prowl at 500 ng L-1 (Pw500). Fish samples were made after a 28 day exposure period (D28) and after a fifteen day recovery period in clean fresh water (D43). At D28, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was not activated in liver in spite of the pendimethalin uptake in fish. At D43, EROD activity in fish exposed to the commercial product was lower than in control fish, which may be explained by the high presence of herbicide in fish (613 +/- 163 ng g bile(-1)). Furthermore, antioxidant defense responses were set up by trout in gills and liver following chronic exposure to 800 ng L-1 of pendimethalin concentration. While the glutathione content (GSH) decreased in gills, it increased in liver associated with higher activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). These disturbances could lead to reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress in the vital organs in fish. After fifteen days in clean water, while the SOD activity was restored, the GSH content and GPx activity were still significantly disturbed in fish exposed to pendimethalin in comparison with control. These significant differences between treatments in antioxidant defenses parameters measured, attesting to the irreversibility of the effects. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Considering the importance of genomic integrity, it is critical to improve the knowledge on ozone-related genotoxic hazard to organisms reared in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) applying ozonation. Therefore, genetic damage induced by ozone exposure in the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) was assessed, combining the comet and the erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) assays, reflecting different damage levels, i.e. DNA and chromosomal damage, respectively. Fish were subjected to a daily 6-h ozone (0.15 mg L-1) exposure, repeated for 3 consecutive days, simulating a short-term event of overozonation. To assess the temporal impact of the previous event, the progression of damage was evaluated 7 days later, following transference to ozone-free water or to 0.07 mg L-1 ozone, a routinely adopted level in RAS. Both endpoints pointed to the ozone genotoxic potential, displaying DNA oxidation as a possible mechanism of damage. Overall, the present findings pointed out the genotoxic hazard of ozone to fish, highlighting the importance of these types of studies and contributing to improve aquaculture practices, namely in RAS systems. These early genotoxic signals may be a prelude to negative repercussions on fish health, which may affect the aquaculture productivity. The present findings recommend precautions in relation to accidental or intentional overozonation in fish-farming, even when short-term events are considered. The strategies to mitigate the impact of ozonation in S. senegalensis may include a dietary extra supplementation of antioxidants (regularly, or punctually in cases of overozonation).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  54,10.1016/j.cbpc.2019.02.001     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),DNA damage;Ozone;Fish;RAS;TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS;GLYPHOSATE-BASED HERBICIDE;ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA L.;RECIRCULATION AQUACULTURE;COMET ASSAY;NUCLEAR ABNORMALITIES;OZONATED SEAWATER;E SUPPLEMENTATION;OXIDATIVE STRESS;UV-IRRADIATION;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA,NA,NA,dna and chromosomal damage in senegalese sole <i>solea senegalensis<i> as side effects of ozonebased water treatment contribution to optimization of fishfarming practices

This effort has led to the production of large, complex data sets of environmental results making the task of evaluation of the aquatic chemical status more difficult. Furthermore, the evaluation of the chemical status of the water ecosystems is one of the main aspects which should be considered in a River Basin Management Plan. In this study, two indices were developed in order to assess the combined pesticide ecotoxicity to aquatic non-target organisms, the Aquatic Quality Index of Short term Toxicity of Pesticides (AQI ShToxP) and the Aquatic Quality Index of Long term Toxicity of Pesticides (AQI LToxP). These indices were applied to the environmental results obtained from an intensive monitoring study of 302 pesticides in 102 stationary sampling stations located on the surface aquatic network of the Pinios River Basin, in Greece, in 2011 and 2012. The evaluation of the surface water quality was achieved by taking into consideration the frequency and the intensity of exposure of the aquatic organisms to pesticides above the respective ecotoxicological quality objectives such as the acute or chronic term predicted no-effect concentrations derived from risk assessment. Seventy-five pesticides, that have been previously identified as the River Basin Specific Pollutants of Pinios by an environmental and human risk hierarchy exercise, were assessed. It appears, from the implementation of the two indices, that the detected pesticides in the surface aquatic ecosystem of the Pinios River Basin exert significant pressure on the aquatic non-target organisms especially at the chronic effect level. The developed AQI ShToxP and AQI LToxP indices, as well as the proposed quality classification system could be valuable communication and interpretation tools for River Basin Management Plans that can contribute in the restoration of environmental health. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: A.

The lack of researchers and resources in insect nematology also contributed significantly to this delay. During the 1980s, as applications made against foliage-feeding insects generally proved to be ineffective because of rapid desiccation and inactivation by sunlight, a shift to usage in their natural habitat against soil insects occurred. These trials had greater success, particularly against root weevils, but field evaluations of efficacy against soil insect pests other than root weevils produced inconsistent results.3'4 The sources of variation included application methods, nematode species and strains, host stage and defense mechanisms, and the biotic and abiotic soil environments.

Despite recent advances in fish, mice, and insects, there are still only a few compelling examples of major genes and cellular mechanisms associated with complex behavioral changes. Shifts in food or host preferences in insects, accompanied by changes in the peripheral chemosensory system, offer some of the best examples of adaptive behavioral evolution. A remarkable example is the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, a major indoor pest with a highly diverse omnivorous diet. Strong and persistent selection pressure with toxic-baits has induced rapid evolution of behavioral resistance in multiple cockroach populations. While typical cockroaches detect and accept the sugar glucose as a feeding-stimulant, behaviorally resistant cockroaches avoid eating glucose-containing toxic baits by sensing glucose as a deterrent.

On the synthetic solution, the study was conducted with a concentration of l50ppm of fenitrothion submitted to gamma rays of 60Co to absorbed doses varying from l5 to 50kGy. The results showed that on the one hand, the pesticide concentration decreased with dose increasing and, on the other hand, irradiation acidifies the pH of solution, which passed from 5.l7 to 3.2l at 50kGy. The High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis has shown that 90 % of the fenitrothion contained in the solution was degraded at the dose of 50kGy. Some by-products formed during irradiation were identified. The study on sewer water was conducted on real samples collected from a purification plant effluent that receives industrial and domestic sewer water. Samples were irradiated in 2 -l2 kGy dose range. The results showed the decrease of the pH of the effluent sample with the increase of the absorbed dose. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) of irradiated and non-irradiated samples was determined. The results showed that gamma radiation at the dose of l2kGy reduced by 46%the COD of the effluent.

Hypoxia manifests these unfavorable effects through activation of a family of transcription factors, Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play a pivotal role in the adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxic and nutrient-deprived conditions by upregulating the transcription of several pro-oncogenic genes. Several advanced human cancers share HIFs activation as a final common pathway. Areas covered: This review highlights the role and regulation of the HIF-1/2 in cancers and alludes on the biological complexity and redundancy of HIF-1/2 regulation. Moreover, this review summarizes recent insights into the therapeutic approaches targeting the HIF-1/2 pathway. Expert opinion: More studies are needed to unravel the extensive complexity of HIFs regulation and to develop more precise anticancer treatments. Inclusion of HIF-1/2 inhibitors to the current chemotherapy regimens has been proven advantageous in numerous reported preclinical studies. The combination therapy ideally should be personalized based on the type of mutations involved in the specific cancers, and it might be better to include two drugs that inhibit HIF-1/2 activity by synergistic molecular mechanisms. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 185; Correspondence Address: W.

METHODS: We interviewed 177 pregnant women between November 2016 and February 2017 in the 10 basic health units of the municipality of Propriá, state of Sergipe, two located in the rural area and eight in the urban area, during prenatal appointments, to raise information about the use of preventive measures against the vector transmission of Zika virus. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods, chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, and the odds ratio was calculated. The independent variables were grouped by the analysis of principal components, and the dependents (the use of repellent, mosquito nets, garments, screens and insecticides) were analyzed using the logistic regression method. RESULTS: Among the measures recommended by the Ministry of Health, mosquito nets were the most used by pregnant women living in rural areas and with low education level, while the repellents were more used by women in the urban area and with higher education level. Women in a vulnerable socio-economic situation presented a risk 2.4 times higher for not using screens in their homes, 1.9 times higher for not changing clothes and 2.5 times higher for not using repellent than pregnant women in better economic conditions.

Though this “knowing-doing gap” has been well-described, there have been few efforts to guide scientists in how to develop useful and usable science. Here we demonstrate how a comprehensive survey of managers (representing 42 wetland management units across the Great Salt Lake watershed) can highlight management practices and challenges (here for the widespread invasive plant, Phragmites australis, a recent and aggressive invader in this region) to ultimately inform a research program. The diversity of surveyed organizations had wide-ranging amounts of Phragmites which led to different goals and approaches including more aggressive control targets and a wider array of control tools for smaller, private organizations compared to larger government-run properties. We found that nearly all managers (97%) used herbicide as their primary Phragmites control tool, while burning (65%), livestock grazing (49%), and mowing (43%) were also frequently used. Managers expressed uncertainties regarding the timing of herbicide application and type of herbicide for effective control. Trade-offs between different Phragmites treatments were driven by budgetary concerns, as well as environmental conditions like water levels and social constraints like permitting issues. Managers had specific ideas about the plant communities they desired following Phragmites control, yet revegetation of native species was rarely attempted. The results of this survey informed the development of large-scale, multi-year Phragmites control and native plant revegetation experiments to address management uncertainties regarding herbicide type and timing. The survey also facilitated initial scientist-manager communication, which led to collaborations and knowledge co-production between managers and researchers. An important outcome of the survey was that experimental results were more pertinent to manager needs and trusted by managers. Such an approach that integrates manager surveys to inform management experiments could be adapted to any developing research program seeking to be relevant to management audiences. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 23; Correspondence Address: C.B.

(Aizoaceae), a prominent invasive plant in Europe. Carpobrotus species are mat-forming trailing succulent perennial herbs native from South Africa, introduced in Europe for ornamental and soil stabilization purposes since the beginning of the seventeenth century, now widely naturalized on coastal habitats of southern and western Europe. C. acinaciformis and C. edulis are the main species recognized outside South Africa, together with their hybrids and potential hybrid swarms. Identification conflicts both in the native and invaded areas raise doubts on the taxonomy of these taxa, but hybridization processes may boost adaptive changes in the invaded range. The release of Carpobrotus in natural environments and protected areas is prohibited in several European countries, but this taxon is not included in the list of invasive species of Union concern. Carpobrotus is a pioneer of disturbed sites and coastal areas including cliffs and sand dune systems, due to its tolerance to stress factors such as salinity, drought and excess of light. Carpobrotus invasion ultimately affects patterns of native species diversity. Moreover, it has been recognized as a major driver of soil conditions shifts and soil geochemical processes disruptions, representing a serious threat for coastal habitats. Management plans for Carpobrotus must consider its high plasticity for morphological and ecophysiological traits, which may probably explain its tolerance to a wide range of ecological conditions. Its flexible mating systems, which represent an optimal strategy to facilitate local adaptation and habitat colonization, include ability to produce apomictic seeds, self- and cross-pollination, and an intense vegetative clonality. In addition, Carpobrotus produces a large seed bank with a moderate short-term persistence, and fruits are effectively dispersed by mammals. The most efficient control methods are physical removal and herbicide application on leaves, whereas integration of biological control with other conventional management methods are likely to be most effective.

However, antimicrobials (typically antimicrobial peptides, AMPs) in the venom often exist in low abundance that might exclude their immune role alone, leaving an open question with regard to their in vivo biological function. Here, we report the bactericidal activity of seven peptides isolated from the scorpion Mesobuthus eupeus venom, including one classical α-helical AMP and five ion channel-targeted neurotoxins. This AMP of 49 amino acids (named Meucin-49) is a multifunctional molecule that displays a wide-spectrum and highly potent activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with strong hemotoxicity on scorpion’s predators (i.e., mammals, lizards, and birds) and high insecticidal activity. Although the neurotoxins targeting voltage-gated sodium (Na                             v                             ) and/or large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels showed only marginal activity towards several species of bacteria, they were capable of significantly potentiating the bactericidal potency of Meucin-49. This observation highlights, for the first time, the venom’s antibacterial immune function mediated by a joint action between neurotoxins and AMPs. The findings that traditionally defined neurotoxins possess (synergistic) bactericidal activity, while the classical AMPs play predatory and defensive roles, provide new evidence in favor of a general and intrinsic multifunctionality of scorpion venom components.                          © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: S.

Treatment may continue during pregnancy, since untreated depression poses a risk to the mother and child. However, many antidepressants readily pass through the placental barrier to reach the fetus or may be ingested by the newborn via breastmilk. Little is known about the effects of antidepressants on brain development and subsequent behavior in young children. In the current study, we used zebrafish as a model system to examine the neurodevelopmental effects of three commonly prescribed antidepressants, sertraline, duloxetine and bupropion. Zebrafish were exposed to these antidepressants during development and were examined for changes in larval avoidance behavior, activity, social behaviors, and anxiety-related behaviors. The results show that antidepressants commonly affect larval swim speeds and resting, and differentially affect other behaviors depending upon the exposure period. Using cluster analysis profiling, we compared the obtained results to previous reports on behavioral defects induced by organophosphate pesticides. We found that the behavioral profiles induced by antidepressants and pesticides overlap, indicating a common mechanism of action. We conclude that developmental antidepressant exposures lead to specific behavioral changes in zebrafish larvae.

As there are limited studies focusing on farmers’ and retailers’ knowledge related to pesticide use and associated risks as well as safety behaviour, this study assesses their perceptions of pesticide use, associated impacts on human and environmental health and safety behaviours. This study is also intended to quantify pesticide use in vegetable farming. We used the Health Belief Model (HBM) to evaluate farmers’ and retailers’ safety behaviour associated with pesticides. We interviewed 183 farmers and 45 retailers. The study revealed that farmers applied pesticides at an average of 2.9 kg a.i./ha per crop per season; and insecticides, especially pyrethrins and pyrethroids as well as organophosphate, were the most frequently used. Retailers were more aware of the threats surrounding pesticide use and were thus more aware of the risks to their own health as well as to the health of animals, birds, fishes, and honey bees. Headache (73.8%) was the most commonly reported acute health symptom of pesticide use. Farmers often did not adopt the appropriate safety measures when handling pesticides sighting the constrained perceived barriers (direct path coefficient, DPC = −0.837) such as feeling uncomfortable and the unavailability of safety measures. Likewise, retailers lacked the incentive (direct path coefficient, DPC = 0.397) to adopt the necessary safety measures while handling pesticides. Training and awareness programs addressing safe handling practices and safety measures as well as education concerning the long-term risks of pesticide exposure on health and the environment, through radio, television and posters, may improve the safety behaviour of farmers and retailers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 79; Correspondence Address: G.

This is particularly so for fungal pathogens, which can occupy several niches in the host. We developed an infection model of talaromycosis in zebrafish embryos with the thermally-dimorphic intracellular fungal pathogen Talaromyces marneffei and used it to define different roles of neutrophils and macrophages in infection establishment. This system models opportunistic human infection prevalent in HIV-infected patients, as zebrafish embryos have intact innate immunity but, like HIV-infected talaromycosis patients, lack a functional adaptive immune system. Importantly, this new talaromycosis model permits thermal shifts not possible in mammalian models, which we show does not significantly impact on leukocyte migration, phagocytosis and function in an established Aspergillus fumigatus model. Furthermore, the optical transparency of zebrafish embryos facilitates imaging of leukocyte/pathogen interactions in vivo. Following parenteral inoculation, T. marneffei conidia were phagocytosed by both neutrophils and macrophages. Within these different leukocytes, intracellular fungal form varied, indicating that triggers in the intracellular milieu can override thermal morphological determinants. As in human talaromycosis, conidia were predominantly phagocytosed by macrophages rather than neutrophils. Macrophages provided an intracellular niche that supported yeast morphology. Despite their minor role in T. marneffei conidial phagocytosis, neutrophil numbers increased during infection from a protective CSF3-dependent granulopoietic response. By perturbing the relative abundance of neutrophils and macrophages during conidial inoculation, we demonstrate that the macrophage intracellular niche favours infection establishment by protecting conidia from a myeloperoxidase-dependent neutrophil fungicidal activity. These studies provide a new in vivo model of talaromycosis with several advantages over previous models. Our findings demonstrate that limiting T. marneffei’s opportunity for macrophage parasitism and thereby enhancing this pathogen’s exposure to effective neutrophil fungicidal mechanisms may represent a novel host-directed therapeutic opportunity. © 2018 Ellett et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 48; Correspondence Address: G.J.

Therefore, in this study, effects of TDCIPP on yolk diameter, surface morphology of eggs, sperm density and total motility were evaluated. First generation (F0) zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio) were exposed to 0, 50, 500 or 5000 ng/L tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) from 14 days post fertilization (dpf) to 120 dpf. The F0 generation of zebrafish were paired and F1 generation of embryos were collected and continuously exposed to the same concentrations of TDCIPP until 150 dpf. TDCIPP bioconcentration in the whole body as well as effects on survival and fecundity were evaluated in F1 generation. Exposure to TDCIPP resulted in an accumulation of the chemical and decreased survival of F1 generation of zebrafish. TDCIPP decreased cumulative production and changed surface morphology of eggs in females. In males, TDCIPP decreased total motility of sperm but did not affect sperm density. These effects on quality of egg and sperm might be responsible for the decreased hatching rates observed in cross mating experiments. Furthermore, TDCIPP exposure resulted in down-regulated gene expression related to gonadal development and maturation of germ cells in females or/and males, and the down-regulation was correlated to decreased fecundity. Taken together, the results suggested that exposure to TDCIPP could decrease the quantity of eggs and sperms by down-regulating the expression of genes related to gonadal development and maturation of germ cells in zebrafish. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 22; Correspondence Address: C.

The presence of different diseases in crops often leads to a misuse of the proper therapeutic, or the combination of different diseases forces the use of more than one pesticide. This work concerns the development of a ‘super-Blad’: a chimeric protein consisting of Blad polypeptide, the active ingredient of a biological fungicide already on the market, and two selected peptides, SP10-5 and Sub5, proven to possess biological potential as antibacterial agents. The resulting chimeric protein obtained from the fusion of Blad with SP10-5 not only maintained strong antibacterial activity, especially against Xanthomonas spp. and Pseudomonas syringae, but was also able to retain the ability to inhibit the growth of both yeast and filamentous fungi. However, the antibacterial activity of Sub5 was considerably diminished when fused with Blad, which seems to indicate that not all fusion proteins behave equally. These newly designed drugs can be considered promising compounds for use in plant protection.

This study presents a case study analysis based on an extensive literature review examining how these hazard characteristics affect people’s risk and benefit perceptions, and associated attitudes and behaviors. The cases include E. coli incidences (outbreaks linked to fresh spinach and fenugreek sprouts), contamination of fish by environmental pollutants, (organochlorine contaminants in farmed salmon), radioactive contamination of food following a nuclear accident (the Fukushima accident in Japan), and GM salmon destined for the human food chain. The analysis of the cases over the acute vs. chronic dimension suggests that longitudinal quantification of the relationship between risk perceptions and impacts is important for both acute and chronic food safety, but this has infrequently been applied to chronic hazards. Technologies applied to food production tend to potentially be associated with higher levels of risk perception, linked to perceptions that the risk is unnatural. However, for some risks (e.g. those involving biological irreversibility), moral or ethical concerns may be more important determinants of consumer responses than risk or benefit perceptions. (Lack of) trust has been highlighted in all of the cases suggesting transparent and honest risk–benefit communications following the occurrence of a food safety incident.

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the introduced fish species Gambusia affinis as a bioindicator of environmental pollution in the middle-lower basin of the Suquia River. The assessment was performed by measuring biomarkers at different levels of biological organization, at two sampling sites (before and after Cordoba city), and at dry and wet seasons. Water quality evaluation was made through a water-quality index (based on physico-chemical parameters), heavy-metals and pesticides concentrations in water. The water quality varied between sampling sites, showing the most degraded conditions downstream Cordoba city. The same pattern of variation was detected in the biomarkers studied, mainly in: gill and liver histopathological indexes, copulatory organ (gonopodium) morphology and vitellogenin expression in males and females. The present study characterized the environmental conditions in the middle-lower basin of the Suquia River and revealed the low freshwater quality at the most polluted site. Although G. affinis is an introduced species, it could be considered a good sentinel of water resource quality of invaded Neotropical basins. Our results demonstrated the importance of addressing the environmental quality monitoring through an integrated analysis of water quality parameters together with histological, morphological and molecular parameters. Thus, our study provides a good model for application in other basins of South America. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Zebrafish, an important developmental model, has been used for studying the effects of toxic compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure to dichlorvos at early life stages (1 h postfertilization - 7 days postfertilization) in the zebrafish and its toxicological effects during the development, through morphological (7 days postfertilization), locomotor and social behavior analysis (7, 14, 30, 70, and 120 days postfertilization). Dichlorvos (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) exposure reduced the body length and heartbeat rate at 7 days postfertilization (dpf), as well as the surface area of the eyes (5 and 10 mg/L). The avoidance behavior test showed a significant decrease in escape responses at 7 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 14 (5 and 10 mg/L) dpf zebrafish. The evaluation of larval exploratory behavior showed a reduction in distance traveled, mean speed (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and time mobile (10 mg/L) between control and dichlorvos groups. In addition, the analysis performed on adult animals showed that the changes in distance traveled and mean speed remained reduced in 30 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 70 dpf (5 and 10 mg/L), recovering values similar to the control at 120 dpf. The social behavior of zebrafish was not altered by exposure to dichlorvos in the early stages of development. Thus, the exposure to organophosphorus compounds at early stages of development induces an increased susceptibility to behavioral and neuronal changes that could be associated with several neurodegenerative diseases.

We carried out a 2 1/2-year immunotoxicological experiment in which two groups of 11 harbour seals each were fed herring from either the relatively contaminated Baltic Sea or the relatively uncontaminated Atlantic Ocean. Seals in the Baltic Sea group accumulated 3-4 times higher levels of Ah-receptor-mediated 2,3,7,8-TCDD Toxic Equivalents in blubber than did their Atlantic counterparts following 2 years on the respective diets. Blood was sampled a total of 17 times during the course of the experiment for immunological evaluation, during which time the natural cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from seals fed Baltic Sea herring declined to a level approximately 25% lower than that observed in seals fed Atlantic herring (P < 0.01). Natural killer (NK) cell activity has not been previously described for a marine mammal species. We characterized the natural cytotoxic activity of harbour seal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and found this to be interleukin-2 (IL-2) responsive, sensitive to antibody anti-asialo GM1, and it was higher against a virus-infected target cell, like NK cells described for other mammals. As NK cells are leukocytes which play an important role in the first line of defence against viruses, the observed impairment of NK cell activity in the seals feeding on the Baltic Sea herring suggests that exposure to contaminants may have an adverse effect on the defence against virus infections in seals inhabiting polluted waters in Europe.

Bacteria that reside free and inside phagocytes cause acute and chronic forms of photobacteriosis. Infections of juveniles rapidly kill up to 90-100% fish. Factors underlying failure of the immune protection against bacteria remain largely unknown. The reported study used a transcriptomic approach to address this issue. juvenile sea breams (0.5 g) were challenged by immersion in salt water containing 2.89 x 10(8) CFU of a virulent Phdp and the head kidney was sampled after 24- and 48-h. Analyses were performed using the second version of a 44 k oligonucleotide DNA microarray that represents 19,734 sea bream unique transcripts and covers diverse immune pathways. Expression changes of selected immune genes were validated with qPCR. Results suggested rapid recognition of the pathogen, as testified by up-regulation of lectins and antibacterial proteins (bactericidal permeability-increasing protein lectins, lysozyme, intracellular and extracellular proteases), chemokines and chemokine receptors. Increased expression of proteins involved in iron and heme metabolism also could be a response against bacteria that are dependent on iron. However, negative regulators of immune/inflammatory response were preponderant among the up-regulated genes. A remarkable finding was the increased expression of IL-10 in concert with up-regulation of arginase I and II and proteins of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway that diverts the arginine flux from the production of reactive nitrogen species. Such expression changes are characteristic for alternatively activated macrophages that do not develop acute inflammatory responses. Immune suppression can be induced by the host to reduce tissue damages or by the pathogen to evade host response. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The taxa that numerically dominated the region included few large, deep-burrowing suspension feeders that typify estuaries elsewhere. This pattern is indicative of disturbance, and results in dominance by trophic groups that live near the sediment-water interface (early benthic-community succession). Trophic structure was significantly related to several sediment contaminants (especially metals, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, DDT), and three environmental gradients (salinity, depth, and sediment silt-clay content). Generally trophic diversity increased and proportion of subsurface-deposit feeders (SSDF) decreased with salinity, meaning that a more even distribution of trophic structure was found at high-salinity stations.        The trophic shift toward dominance by shallow, subsurface-deposit feeders in contaminated habitats may have dire implications for fisheries. Several important commercial and recreational fisheries of the region depend on fish that feed primarily at the sediment surface. Higher proportion of subsurface-deposit feeders, coupled with low macrobenthic density in contaminated sediments, may imply that limited energy is transferred to higher trophic levels.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  100     Total Times Cited:  119     Cited Reference Count:  109,10.1071/MF97089     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),trophic ecology;feeding ecology;benthos;estuary;contaminants;hypoxia;benthic pelagic;coupling;Gulf of Mexico;indicator species;principal component analysis (PCA);community succession;pollution;community structure;fisheries;red drum;Sciaenops ocellata;spotted seatrout;Cynoscion nebulosus;surface-deposit feeders;subsurface-deposit feeders;filter feeders;suspension feeders;carnivores;omnivores;CONTROL PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS;SOFT-BOTTOM COMMUNITIES;GULF-OF-MEXICO;MISSISSIPPI SOUND;CHESAPEAKE BAY;ORGANIC ENRICHMENT;BENTHIC COMMUNITY;FEEDING-BEHAVIOR;NORTHERN GULF;MOBILE-BAY,NA,NA,trophic function in estuaries response of macrobenthos to natural and contaminant gradients

It is source of neurotoxins known as aphantoxins or paralytic shellfish poisons (PSPs), which present a major threat to the environment and human health. The molecular mechanism of PSP action is known, however the in vivo effects of this neurotoxin on oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant defense responses in zebrafish brain remain to be understood. Aphantoxins purified from a natural isolate of A. flos-aquae DC-1 were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. The major components of the toxins were gonyautoxins 1 and 5 (GTX1 and GTX5, 34.04% and 21.28%, respectively) and neosaxitoxin (neoSTX, 12.77%). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were injected intraperitoneally with 7.73 mu g/kg (low dose) and 11.13 mu g/kg (high dose) of A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins. Oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defense responses in the zebrafish brain were investigated at various timepoints at 1-24 h post-exposure. Aphantoxin exposure was associated with significantly increased (>1-2 tidies) reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in zebrafish brain compared with the controls at 1-12 h postexposure, suggestive of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In contrast, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in the zebrafish brain exposed to high or low doses of aphantoxins decreased by 44.88% and 41.33%, respectively, after 1-12 h compared with the controls, suggesting that GSH participated in detoxification to ROS and MDA. Further analysis showed a significant increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) compared with the controls, suggesting elimination of oxidative stress by the antioxidant response in zebrafish brain. All these changes were dose and time dependent. These results suggested that aphantoxins or PSPs increased ROS and MDA and decreased GSH in zebrafish brain, and these changes induced oxidative stress. The increased activity of SOD, CAT and GPx demonstrated that these antioxidant enzymes could play important roles in eliminating excess ROS and MDA. These results also suggest that MDA, ROS, GSH and these three antioxidant enzymes in the brain of zebrafish may act as bioindicators for investigating A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins or PSPs and algal blooms in nature.

Increasing evidence shows that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), members of the steroid receptor subfamily, are potential targets for EDCs. GR and MR mediate the actions of glucocorticoids and miner-alocorticoids, respectively, which are two main classes of corticosteroids involved in many physiological processes. The effects of EDCs on the homeostasis of these two classes of corticosteroids have also gained more attention recently. This review summarized the effects of environmental GR/MR ligands on receptor activity, and disruption of corticosteroid homeostasis. More than 130 chemicals classified into 7 main categories were reviewed, including metals, metalloids, pesticides, bisphenol analogues, flame retardants, other industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The mechanisms by which EDCs interfere with GR/MR activity are primarily involved in ligand-receptor binding, nuclear translocation of the receptor complex, DNA-receptor binding, and changes in the expression of endogenous GR/MR genes. Besides directly interfering with receptors, enzyme-catalyzed synthesis and prereceptor regulation pathways of corticosteroids are also important targets for EDCs. The collected evidence suggests that corticosteroids and their receptors should be considered as potential targets for safety assessment of EDCs.

In the second experiment, zander (Stizostedion lucioperca) (secondary carnivore), were stocked in the lake resulting in a reduction in the population size of roach to 51% of its previous population size (31% of biomass). In both experiments, seasonal average biomass of Daphnia cucullata) increased in the two years with the lowest roach biomasses. but no shift to larger zooplankton forms took place. In the years with increased Daphnia biomass, phytoplankton biomass and transparency showed an increased seasonal variation (measured as coefficient of variation). In contrast to manipulations in which planktivorous fish were totally removed, no effect on seasonal average phytoplankton biomass was observed. Due to the high reproductive capacity of roach, the system returned to previous conditions within a year or two after the perturbations. Under unperturbed conditions, the lake showed few indications of instability as suggested by the paradox of enrichment hypothesis. This lack of instability can. among other things, be related to high zooplanktivore predation pressure present in highly productive lakes preventing overexploitation of primary producers by grazers. In addition, the omnivorous feeding characteristics of roach (feeding on both zooplankton and algae/detritus) and interactions between the open water and the detritus nutrient pool are likely to increase the stability of the system. The two perturbation experiments plus a previous natural experiment (winter fish kill), which all were pulsed perturbations, provide no evidence for the presence of alternative stable states in highly productive lakes.

We established cellular stress response markers for proteotoxicity (HSP70, HSP90), phase I detoxification mechanism (CYP1A1), metal-binding (metallothionein), as well as immune-function and pathogen-defense (TGF-beta, Mx-protein, nRAMP). Quantitative real-time TaqMan (R) PCR was used to examine tissue-specific changes in the transcriptome of liver, spleen, white muscle, anterior kidney and gills after 7-day Cu exposures and 24-h esfenvalerate exposures. On the transcriptome level, exposure to Cu showed strongest effects on the transcription of metallothionein in spleen tissue, causing a 4-fold increase of mRNA at 42 ppb total Cu and a 10-fold increase at 160 ppb Cu. Exposure to Cu also caused significant tissue-specific changes in gene transcription for immune-system related genes. Esfenvalerate exposure had tissue-specific effects on the transcription of HSP70, HSP90 and CYP1A1. The most significant effects were detected in liver tissue after exposure to 0.64 mu g/L esfenvalerate.        Our results show that the stress response at the transcriptome level is a more sensitive indicator for Cu and esfenvalerate exposures at low concentrations than swimming behavior, growth or mortality.

The fish were exposed to 20% of 96-hour LC50 of fenthion for 24 and 96 hours. Total and oxidized glutathione, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, protein levels, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase-specific enzyme activities were measured spectrophotometrically. There was a 15-day depuration period to evaluate the changes in the studied parameters. Fenthion caused a time-dependent depletion of the total and reduced glutathione levels. The oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio and catalase specific enzyme activity were reduced while the glutathione-S-transferase activity was elevated. Intraperitonal buthionine sulfoximine application disclosed the inhibitory effect of fenthion on superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, whereas glutathione-S-transferase activity was increased. There was no change in lipid peroxidation levels during the experiments. No amelioration was observed in the affected parameters except the glutathione-S-transferase activity in the 15-day depuration period. In conclusion, glutathione-S-transferase and catalase enzyme activities and total and reduced glutathione levels were better estimators to monitor the effects of fenthion in low concentration in the liver of C. carpio.

The clear chorion and embryo of the zebrafish allow for continuous visualization of the anatomical changes associated with development, which, along with short maturation times and the capability of complex behavior, makes this model particularly useful for measuring changes to the developing nervous system. Moreover, the rich array of developmental, behavioral, and molecular benefits offered by the zebrafish have contributed to an increasing demand for the use of zebrafish in behavioral teratology. Essential for this endeavor has been the development of a battery of tests to evaluate a spectrum of behavior in zebrafish. Measures of sensorimotor plasticity, emotional function, cognition and social interaction have been used to characterize the persisting adverse effects of developmental exposure to a variety of chemicals including therapeutic drugs, drugs of abuse and environmental toxicants. In this review, we present and discuss such tests and data from a range of developmental neurobehavioral toxicology studies using zebrafish as a model. Zebrafish provide a key intermediate model between high throughput in vitro screens and the classic mammalian models as they have the accessibility of in vitro models and the complex functional capabilities of mammalian models.

While they are often used as an indicator species due to their high organochlorine contaminant loads, little is known of their movements in relation to contaminated habitats. A Vemco Positioning System acoustic telemetry array was used to collect fine-scale movement data and characterize the site fidelity, area use, and dispersal of 83 white croaker on the Palos Verdes Shelf Superfund Site, California over 27 months. White croaker generally demonstrated low residency and recurrence to the Palos Verdes Shelf, and were observed to be largely nomadic. However, individual behavior was highly variable. Although the entire monitored shelf was visited by tagged white croaker, habitats in 0-200 m proximity to wastewater outfalls and between 25 and 35 m depth were used most frequently. Approximately half of white croaker migrated into Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbors; areas where they may be targeted by subsistence fishers.

However, concerns about the pesticide residues in agricultural products have been raised in recent years because of public interest in health and food quality and safety. Thus, rapid, convenient, and accurate analytical methods for the detection and quantification of pesticides are urgently required. RESULTS A nanohybrid system composed of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and tetrakis(N-methyl-4-pyridiniumyl) porphyrin (TMPyP) was used as an optical probe for the detection and quantification of five pesticides (Paraquat, Dipterex, Dursban, methyl thiophanate and Cartap). The method is based on the aggregation effect of pesticides on the carboxyl group modified by AuNPs. Subsequently, with the help of particle swarm optimization-optimized sample weighted least squares-support vector machine (PSO-OSWLS-SVM), all the pesticides could be successfully quantified. In addition, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was applied and the five pesticides were satisfactorily recognized based on data array obtained from the ultraviolet visible (UV-visible) spectra of AuNP-TMPyP complex. Furthermore, the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the five pesticides could be also achieved in the complex real samples, in which all the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 0.3 parts per thousand and all the linear absolute correlation coefficients were more than 0.9990. Furthermore, recognition rate of the training set and the prediction set based on multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), or second-order derivative (2nd derivative) UV-visible spectra in PLS-DA model could reach 100%. CONCLUSION This method was successfully applied for the rapid and accurate determination of multicomponent pesticide residues in real food samples.

Zinc pyrithione is an organometallic biocide, with bactericidal, algicidal and fungicidal activities. It has been recently incorporated in antifouling formulas, such as paints, which prevent the establishment of a biofilm on surfaces exposed to the aquatic environment. It has also been used in cosmetics, such as anti-dandruff shampoos and soaps. Previously reported data has shown the presence of this substance in the aquatic compartment, a factor contributing to the potential exertion of toxic effects, and there is also evidence that photodegradation products of zinc pyrithione were involved in neurotoxic effects, namely by inhibiting cholinesterases in fish species. Additional evidence points to the involvement of zinc pyrithione in alterations of metal homeostasis and oxidative stress, in both aquatic organisms and human cell models. The present work assesses the potential ecotoxicity elicited by zinc pyrithione in the freshwater fish Gambusia holbrooki after an acute (96 h) exposure. The oxidative stress was assessed by the quantification of the activities of specific enzymes from the antioxidant defense system, such as catalase, and glutathione-S-transferases; and the extent of peroxidative damage was quantified by measuring the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels. Neurotoxicity was assessed through measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity; and a standardized method for the description and assessment of histological changes in liver and gills of was also used. Zinc pyrithione caused non-specific and reversible tissue alterations, both in liver and gills of exposed organisms. However, histopathological indices were not significantly different from the control group. In terms of oxidative stress biomarkers, none of the tested biomarkers indicated the occurrence of pro-oxidative effects, suggesting that the oxidative pathway is not the major toxicological outcome of exposure to zinc pyrithione.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  63,10.1007/s10646-015-1525-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Antifouling;Organometallics;Biomarkers;Histological damage;Mosquitofish;Oxidative stress;Neurotoxicity;OXIDATIVE STRESS;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;ANTIFOULING BIOCIDES;COPPER PYRITHIONE;HISTOPATHOLOGY;EXPOSURE;GILL;LIVER;PHARMACEUTICALS;BIOMARKERS;Zinc,NA,NA,ecotoxicological effect of zinc pyrithione in the freshwater fish <i>gambusia holbrooki<i>

While fenpropathrin was found to have neurotoxic effects in mammals, it remains unclear whether it has similar effects on fish. Here, we used adult zebrafish to investigate the impacts of fenpropathrin on fish social behaviors and neural activity. Exposure of adult zebrafish to 500 ppb of fenpropathrin for 72 h increased anxiety levels but decreased physical fitness, as measured by a novel tank diving test and swimming tunnel test. Fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to spend more time in the conspecific zone of the tank, possibly seeking greater comfort from their companions. Although learning, memory, and aggressive behavior did not change, fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to have shorter fighting durations. The immunocytochemical results showed the tyrosine hydroxylase antibody-labeled dopaminergic neurons in the teleost posterior tuberculum decreased in the zebrafish brain. According to a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of the brain, exposure to fenpropathrin resulted in a decrease in the messenger (m)RNA expression of monoamine oxidase (mao), an enzyme that facilitates the deamination of dopamine. In contrast, the mRNA expression of the sncga gene, which may trigger Parkinson's disease, was found to have increased.

The fish community has undergone dramatic shifts in composition, from freshwater species present in the initial wash-in to stocked marine species to dominance by an unintentionally introduced cichlid. Historical catch records, creel censuses, and gill-netting studies suggest that total fish biomass in the lake increased dramatically throughout the 1970s, crashed in the late 1980s, recovered in the mid-1990s, and crashed again in the early 2000s. We speculate that crashes in fish populations are primarily due to three physiological stressors-rising salinity, cold winter temperatures, and high sulfide levels and anoxia associated with mixing events. The trends in fish biomass are mirrored in population trends of both breeding and wintering fish-eating birds, as indexed by a number of independent bird surveys. In contrast, most non-piscivorous birds at the Salton Sea show no indication of these temporal dynamics.

An alternative explanation, put forward by Wright, is that the commonly observed dominance of wildtype alleles is simply a physiological consequence of metabolic pathways. Wright's explanation has gained support over the years, largely ending the debate over the general recessivity of deleterious mutations. Nevertheless there is reason to believe that dominance relationships have been moulded by natural selection to some extent. First, the metabolic pathways are themselves products of evolutionary processes that may have led them to be more stable to perturbations, including mutations. Secondly, theoretical models and empirical experiments suggest that substantial selection for dominance modifiers exists during the spread of adaptive alleles or when a polymorphism is maintained either by overdominant selection or by migration-selection balance.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  62     Total Times Cited:  69     Cited Reference Count:  40,10.1038/sj.hdy.6885600     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),balanced polymorphism;deleterious mutations;dominance modifiers;metabolic pathways;overdominance;patchy environment;MOLECULAR-BASIS;INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE;GENETIC DOMINANCE;ADAPTIVE GENES,NA,NA,the evolution of dominance

The recognition of the limitations of numerous, if not all, pesticides in terms of species-specificity, toxicity level, persistency in the environment, influencing its runoff and transport ability, among other characteristics, have been the subject of numerous studies over the years. These have especially focused on the deleterious impacts of such substances in non-target organisms, including potential effects in humans, considering pesticide uptake through the ingestion of contaminated foodstuff. Aquatic ecosystems may be considered the most vulnerable to pesticide contamination, has most toxicants may eventually end up in these systems, if not directly, via indirect inputs. Aquatic communities are, thus, susceptible both to on-point acute contaminations and to exposure to mixtures of different contaminants for longer periods. Impacts of numerous pesticides in non-target aquatic species have been reported and investigated, contributing to the definition of regulations and legislation to prevent harmful effects to the communities. However, in order to assess effectively the effect of different pesticides in organisms, the definition of suitable biomarkers is crucial. As one of the most identifiable effect of pesticides is cell damage induced by oxidative stress, most studies have resorted to the analysis of antioxidant enzymes to assess the impacts of contamination in the organism. Nonetheless, with methodological advances, other molecules have been identified as potentially useful to be used as biomarkers, as fatty acids. These ubiquitous macromolecules in living organisms are major constituents of biological membranes and tissues. Evidence of the impact of xenobiotics on lipid metabolism and composition, as well as the sensitivity of fatty acids profiles to alterations in the homeostasis of organisms, have been arising, supporting the suitability of these macromolecules as biomarkers of toxicants exposure. However, most studies using fatty acids as biomarkers have dwelled mostly on marine ecosystems, disregarding other aquatic systems, as freshwater systems. Given the importance of these systems as providers of numerous services and goods and their role in ecological integrity and support, the present literature review aims to compile and critically review the studies conducted until the present time regarding the use of fatty acids as biomarkers of pesticide exposure assessment in freshwater communities, as well as highlight limitations identified and propose future research.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  56,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107299     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Saturated fatty acids;Monounsaturated fatty acids;Polyunsaturated fatty acids;Highly unsaturated fatty acids;Xenobiotics;Bioindicators;ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES;OXIDATIVE STRESS;DAPHNIA-MAGNA;HUMAN HEALTH;GOLD TZ;FISH;ENDOSULFAN;EXPOSURE;HERBICIDE;FOOD;Pesticides,NA,NA,fatty acids as suitable biomarkers to assess pesticide impacts in freshwater biological scalesa review

The present study was conducted on Channa punctata Bloch exposed to sub-lethal doses of PD (0.5 and 0.8 ppb) for 96 h. The exposure resulted in alterations in epinephrine levels in the fish brain. Epinephrine levels decreased significantly in a dose dependent manner with increase in the PD exposure. A marked decrease in the activity of acetylcholinesterase along with reduction in Na+-K+-ATPase and monoamine oxidase activity was also observed. In comparison with the corresponding controls, the sub-lethal doses of PD also caused significant changes in the oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxidation and carbonyl derivatives of protein oxidative destruction levels) and antioxidant defenses (reduced glutathione levels, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase activity) in brain tissue.

We suggest that influence of shared genetic biases should be detectable by the disproportionate use of the same genes in independent instances of parallel phenotypic evolution. We show how progress in testing this prediction can be made through simple tests of parallel inheritance of genetic differences: similar additive, dominance, and epistasis components in analysis of line means and similar effective numbers of loci. We demonstrate parallel inheritance in two traits, lateral plate number and body shape, in two lineages of threespine stickleback that have adapted independently to freshwater streams on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean. Notably, reduction of plate number in freshwater involves a substitution at the same major locus in both lineages. Our results represent only a first step in the study of the genetics of parallel phenotypic evolution in sticklebacks.

The persistence of PBDEs in the environment leads to continued ubiquitous exposure to low levels, with infants and children experiencing higher exposures than adults. Accumulating evidence suggest that low-level exposures during early life stages can affect brain development and lead to long-term behavioral impairments. We investigated the effects of zebrafish exposure to low doses of the two prominent PBDEs; 2,2′,4,4′,5,-Pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) and 2,2′,4,4′,-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), during embryo-development on short- and long-term behavioral endpoints. We included the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) due to its well documented neurotoxicity across species from zebrafish to humans. Methods: Zebrafish embryos were exposed to the following individual treatments; 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control); 0.3 μM CPF; 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 μM BDE-47; 0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20 μM BDE-99 from 5 until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). Low exposure levels were determined as those not causing immediate overt toxicity, and behavior assays were conducted in the low-level range. At 144 hpf the larvae were tested for locomotor activity. At approximately 6 months of age adult zebrafish were tested in a behavioral battery including assays for anxiety-related behavior, sensorimotor response and habituation, social interaction, and predator avoidance. Results: In the short-term, larval locomotor activity was reduced in larvae treated with 0.3 μM CPF and 0.1 μM BDE-47. BDE-99 treatment caused non-monotonic dose effects, with 0.3 μM causing hyperactivity and 1 μM or higher causing hypoactivity. In the long-term, adult anxiety-related behavior was reduced in all treatments as measured in both the novel tank dive test and tap test. Discussion: We show that exposure of zebrafish embryos to low concentrations of the brominated flame retardants BDE-47 and BDE-99, and the organophosphate pesticide CPF, caused both short- and long-term behavioral impairments. Interestingly, we also found that at very low exposure concentrations, where there were no visible effects on larval activity, adult behavior was still strongly affected. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 57; Correspondence Address: L.

Most studies use biological monitoring methods to monitor water pollutants, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and organic pollutants. However, there are still many difficulties at present. Few methods consider the influence of illumination and complex background in the monitoring environment, and the characteristics parameters extracted in the systems are single. In addition, the results of using shallow neural networks for water quality classification are often not ideal. In order to solve the above problems, we design a water quality monitoring system combined with the computer image processing technology and use computer vision to analyze the fish behavior in real-time for monitoring the existence or not of water pollution. For the illumination problem, we use the no-reference quality assessment algorithm based on natural scene statistics for contrast distortion images to evaluate the video and configure the lighting conditions of the monitoring environment. White balance preprocessing is also performed to provide a great basis for moving target detection. Besides, we use background modeling to eliminate the influence of complex background on the moving target detection and the foreground is extracted using the saliency detection algorithm. In order to comprehensively analyze the influence of water quality on the fish behavior from the extracted foreground targets, multi-dimensional feature parameters are used to quantify the indicators, including movement velocity, rotation angle, spatial standard deviation, and body color which characterize the behavior changes of the fish. Finally, the classification model based on the long short-term memory neural network is used to classify the feature parameters data of the fish behavior in different water quality environments. In this paper, red zebra fish is used as the indicator organism and copper sulfate solution is used as the toxic pollutant to simulate the water pollution. Experiment results show that the classification accuracy rate of water quality using the proposed system can reach 100% at level 2 classification (93.33% at level 3 and 91% at level 4). Our system can achieve more accurate multi-level classification than the shallow neural network, such as RNN, and it is faster for real-time monitoring with a high reference for the water environment emergencies. © 2013 IEEE.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 34; Correspondence Address: E.

Although less toxic to mammals and birds compared to organophosphates, nicotinoids have the potential to impact non-target invertebrates, especially through sublehal effects on behavior, physiology, reproduction, and development. We investigated the impact of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on the defensive responses of rusty crayfish Orconectes rusticus exposed to 0, 1, 10, and 100 µg•L−1 of imidacloprid for 10 days (n = 7 crayfish per treatment). Defensive behaviors were examined with the rod test, in which a glass rod was jabbed into the crayfish’s container at a 90 degree angle from the bottom and about 0.5 cm directly in front of the crayfish. Crayfish responded to the rod aggressively with claw raising and pinching, neutrally (no response), or by backing or tail-flipping away. The frequency of neutral responses more than doubled after four days in the high (100 µg•L−1) group and after eight days in the low (1 µg•L−1) exposure group. Furthermore, most crayfish in the 100 µg•L−1 treatment were not able to right themselves within 30 s when placed on their backs. Several studies have reported concentrations of imidacloprid contamination in freshwater ecosystems that exceed this study’s lowest exposure scenario, 1 µg•L−1. We therefore conclude that imidacloprid contamination reduces the defensive behaviors of crayfish, impairing their ability to survive in habitats where they play important ecological roles. © 2018, The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: R.J.

Population models can incorporate population resilience, physiological susceptibility, and likelihood of exposure, and can therefore be employed to extrapolate from individual- to population-level effects in ERA. Here, we present the development of an individual-based model (IBM) for the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and its application in assessing population-level effects of disrupted male breeding behaviour after exposure to the anti-androgenic pesticide, fenitrothion. The stickleback is abundant in marine, brackish, and freshwater systems throughout Europe and their complex breeding strategy makes wild populations potentially vulnerable to the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Modelled population dynamics matched those of a UK field population and the IBM is therefore considered to be representative of a natural population. Literature derived dose-response relationships of fenitrothion-induced disruption of male breeding behaviours were applied in the IBM to assess population-level impacts. The modelled population was exposed to fenitrothion under both continuous (worst-case) and intermittent (realistic) exposure patterns and population recovery was assessed. The results suggest that disruption of male breeding behaviours at the individual-level cause impacts on population abundance under both fenitrothion exposure regimes; however, density-dependent processes can compensate for some of these effects, particularly for an intermittent exposure scenario. Our findings further demonstrate the importance of understanding life-history traits, including reproductive strategies and behaviours, and their density-dependence, when assessing the potential population-level risks of EDCs. © 2018","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: C.R.

The security of this water environment has a strong influence on national economic development and public health. However, data on the pollution status and potential risks due to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in this area is insufficient. In this study, we selected a branch of the Grand Canal in Hangzhou as the study subject from which 16 surface water samples were collected in the summer of 2016. The concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) (including 4 hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and 6 dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs)), 12 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and 35 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the water samples were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Non-carcinogenic risk, carcinogenic risk, and cytotoxicity experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential health risks due to these POPs. Additionally, the toxicological data for the Danio rerio aquatic organism from the US EPA were employed for comparison with the residue from POPs in this area. The results showed that the total concentrations of HCHs, DDTs, PCBs, and PAHs were 29.937, 60.2, 8.30, and 1670.2 ng/L, respectively. Some pollutants (including acenaphthene and acenaphthylene, hepta-PCBs and tetra-PCBs, octa-PCBs and hexa-PCBs, β-HCH and α-HCH, and δ-HCH and γ-HCH) showed a correlation, which indicated they might have a similar origin. There were no non-carcinogenic risks or ecological risks for adults, children, and aquatic organisms, but a relatively low carcinogenic risk for adults presented at certain sites.

To aid conservation managers conducting hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle) management, we evaluated changes in aquatic vegetation community structure and dominance in dioecious hydrilla-infested ponds by applying several management tools and monitoring vegetation changes on an annual basis over a 4 yr period. The study was conducted in fully vegetated (dioecious hydrilla and native macrophytes) 0.3 ha mesocosm ponds using 4 levels of triploid grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella Valenciennes) stocking densities (0–129 per vegetated hectare), a one-time second-year herbicide treatment to reduce standing biomass of hydrilla and other submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV), and native plantings to provide the basis for replacing hydrilla as it was controlled. Grass carp stocking density had an inverse relationship with coverage of total vegetation, hydrilla, volunteer SAV, and volunteer emergents. All vegetation categories recovered from the one-time herbicide application, although this was suppressed by higher densities of grass carp. Grass carp did not significantly affect planted growth forms (SAV, floating-leaved, and emergent), with increases in mean coverage in all treatments through time, although coverage was lowest at the highest grass carp density. Vegetation dominance shifted from hydrilla to native in both control and low grass carp density treatments, with most SAV eliminated from treatments stocked with more than 72 per hectare. ©, This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Podbel'skogo, St. Petersburg, 196608, Russian Federation","Currently, the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis represents a key agent for biological protection against dipteran species, which are harmful to livestock and crop production and transmit infectious diseases of economically important animals. The production strains can be obtained by isolation from natural resources, selection of previously used isolates, screening of genetic collections, and genetic or genomic engineering. The issue of preservation and control of practically valuable properties of strains is of high importance. Biologicals are of significant interest due to their substantial advantages over chemical pesticides and are considered in modern agricultural systems as environmentally and socially priority alternatives to agrochemicals. In the present work, we performed the first comprehensive comparative analysis of crystallogenic and acrystallogenic variants of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (BtH14) isolated after storage of the strain in different modes. For crystallogenic variants, genes encoding the target insecticidal toxins, Cry4 and Cry11, were detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and it was shown that the acrystallogenic variants are devoid of these genes. It was found that the culture fluid of crystallogenic variants is approximately 7000 times more active against the Aedes aegypti larvae than the same of acrystallogenic. The aim of this work was to compare the morphological, biochemical, technological, larvicidal properties of the crystal-forming and acrystallogenic variants of the strains of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (BtH14) and testing for the presence of genes encoding Cry insecticidal toxins, which are key determinants of virulence. We studied the strains 404 and 87 stored for 28 years by freeze-drying, then 2 years in test tubes on canted fish agar (FA) with replanting every 6 months; the 7-1/23 strain stored for 28 years in crystals of NaCl, then 2 years in culture liquid (CL) at 3 °C. Bacterial strains were inoculated on Petri dishes to obtain separate colonies. On day 7 of growth, the 404/14, 87/21, 7-1/23-4 (crystal-forming) and 404/19, 87/33, 7-1/23-8 (acrystallogenic) variants were selected by microscopic analysis using aniline black dye. The differences in the colony morphology were not revealed: the colonies were flat, opaque, grayish-white, rough, rounded, the structure was finegrained, and the consistency was viscous. The differences either in the morphology of the vegetative cultures, or in the main biochemical properties (the formation of acetylmethyl carbinol, lecithinase, the use of carbohydrates, the splitting of starch, etc.), or in the titer on the yeast-polysaccharide medium were not shown as well. The productivity of the 404/14, 87/21, 7-1/23-4 and 404/19, 87/33, 7-1/23-8 strains varied from 3.36×109 CFU/ml to 4.02×109 CFU/ml and from 3.74×109 CFU/ml to 4.13×109 CFU/ml, respectively. The larvicidal activity of the crystalforming variants, expressed in LC50 for L4 Aedes aegypti, was (0.12-0.16)×10-3 %, while acrystallogenic variants were inactive within the standard dilutions (×10-3%) 1.0; 0.5; 0.25; 0.125; 0.06. Only their 1 % suspension (7000-fold higher concentration) caused 22-39 % death of the Aedes larvae after 24 hours; the same concentration of active variants resulted in 100% death in 15 minutes. It was established that cultural liquid of the acrystallogenic variants formed a precipitate and a supernatant layer after 12 hours, while the crystal-forming variants remained suspended. The investigated variants of BtH14 were analyzed for the presence of genes encoding insecticidal toxins. The results of the PCR analysis with the Bti-specific primers confirmed the belonging of the both crystal-forming and acrystallogenic variants to BtH14. It has been found that the 404/14, 87/21, 7-1/23-4 strains carry genes encoding the Cry4 and Cry11 insecticidal toxins, while 404/19, 87/33, 7-1/23-8 acrystallogenic variants are devoid of these genes agreeing with the absence of larvicidal activity against A. aegypti. © 2019 Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

The pathogenesis of ASD is not well characterized and involves a multifaceted interaction between genetic, neurobiological and environmental factors. Animal (experimental) models possess evolutionarily conserved behaviors and molecular pathways that are highly relevant for studying ASD. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a relatively new animal model with promise for understanding the pathogenesis of complex brain disorders and discovering novel treatments. As a highly social and genetically tractable organism, zebrafish have recently been applied to model a variety of deficits relevant to ASD.

Here, we used dechorionated Tropical 5D wild-type zebrafish embryos to screen a 91-compound library provided by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) for developmental toxicity. This library contained 86 unique chemicals that included negative controls, flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), drugs, industrial chemicals, and pesticides. Fish were exposed to 5 concentrations of each chemical or an equal amount of vehicle (0.5% DMSO) in embryo medium from 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). Fish were examined daily for mortality and teratogenic effects and photomotor behavior was assessed at 4 and 5 dpf. Of the 5 negative control compounds in the library, none caused mortality/teratogenesis, but two altered behavior. Chemicals provided in duplicate produced similar outcomes. Overall, 13 compounds caused mortality/teratology but not behavioral abnormalities, 24 only affected behavior, and 18 altered both endpoints, with behavior affected at concentrations that did not cause mortality/teratology (55/86 hits). Of the compounds that affected behavior, 52% caused behavioral abnormalities at either 4 or 5 dpf. Compounds within the same functional group caused different behavioral abnormalities, while similar behavioral patterns were caused by compounds from different groups. Our data suggest that behavior is a sensitive endpoint for developmental toxicity screening that integrates multiple modes of toxic action and is influenced by the age of the larval fish at the time of testing. © © The Author(s) 2018.

Phytophthora spp. and Pythium spp. which belong to the Oomycetes pseudo-fungi require special attention because of their mobile form of dispersion, the so-called zoospores that can move freely and actively in liquid water. In coupled aquaponics, curative methods are still limited because of the possible toxicity of pesticides and chemical agents for fish and beneficial bacteria (e.g. nitrifying bacteria of the biofilter). Furthermore, the development of biocontrol agents for aquaponic use is still at its beginning. Consequently, ways to control the initial infection and the progression of a disease are mainly based on preventive actions and water physical treatments. However, suppressive action (suppression) could happen in aquaponic environment considering recent papers and the suppressive activity already highlighted in hydroponics. In addition, aquaponic water contains organic matter that could promote establishment and growth of heterotrophic bacteria in the system or even improve plant growth and viability directly. With regards to organic hydroponics (i.e. use of organic fertilisation and organic plant media), these bacteria could act as antagonist agents or as plant defence elicitors to protect plants from diseases. In the future, research on the disease suppressive ability of the aquaponic biotope must be increased, as well as isolation, characterisation and formulation of microbial plant pathogen antagonists. Finally, a good knowledge in the rapid identification of pathogens, combined with control methods and diseases monitoring, as recommended in integrated plant pest management, is the key to an efficient control of plant diseases in aquaponics. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2019, corrected publication 2020.

Water withdrawal from their tributaries is one and in many cases main reason for that. Since prehistoric times, the size and shape of the Aral Sea changed depending on the amount of water arriving at the lake. The Aral Sea system is in equilibrium when the amount of water flowing in equals the amount of water evaporating over the year. During the 1950s, the government of the former USSR decided to increase the areas used for agriculture in the river valleys of the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya. To this end, water was and still is deviated from the rivers by thousands of open trenches being unsealed and leading to a massive loss of water by evaporation and seepage. In consequence, less water was and is arriving at the Aral Sea and its size is shrinking dramatically. Especially on its eastern shoreline even a small decrease in the water level leads to the exposition of large areas of former sea bottom because the lake is very shallow. Cities like Aralsk and Munyak formally located directly on the seaside are now completely surrounded by the steppe far away from the water. Although the shrinking of the Aral Sea was an economic disaster for the population living on the coast, the population in the river valleys increased significantly. Today, the major part of Uzbekistan’s population is working in this area, and in Kazakhstan there are also millions of people depending on the irrigation water taken from the tributaries of the Aral Sea. The area around the Aral Sea was declared to be a “zone of ecological disaster,” and small subsidies are (still) paid to its inhabitants. Most of the former fishermen moved away to other lakes. In consequence of the breakdown of the economic background the social structure in the population changed completely and people are suffering from unemployment and the lack of any economic perspective. However, studies performed up to now could not prove the assumption that the health of the local population impaired because of environmental pollutants having their origin in the river valleys of the Aral Seas tributaries. There is no doubt that the health of inhabitants of the area is severely affected by the environmental conditions, but not by single contaminants. People living in the Syr Darya valley and, most probably, in the Amu Darya valley suffer much more from pesticide pollution than those living in the former shoreline area of the Aral Sea. Owing to the use of certain pesticides, high concentrations of dioxins and dibenzofurans have been detected in their bodies. Water is a valuable resource and probably the most important economic factor in the countries of Central Asia. The problems of the Aral Sea cannot be solved in the short term. The problems are a result of economic decisions made in the 1950s within a different political context on the basis of a Soviet Union-wide organized economy. Now that small countries are struggling for survival of their local economies, there is, at least in the nonoil producing countries, not enough economic power for a rapid change. However, the area of the Aral Sea will enlarge with an increasing amount of water left over in the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya, even if the Aral Sea probably will not regain its former size during the next generation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The blood stress indicators of cortisol concentration increased after intraperitoneal injection, and consequentially influenced some of the organism defense mechanisms as observed through a decrease of white blood cell phagocytic activity and other effects. Furthermore, when three kinds of pathogens (Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida, Streptococcus iniae and Tenacibaculum maritimum) administered to induce an experimental infection one hour after intraperitoneal injection, the accumulative death rates of the intraperitoneal injection group infected with P. damselae subsp. piscicida and S. iniae were significantly higher than the control group.

Although current treatment regimens cure approximately 70% of patients with localized disease, they are ineffective for most patients with metastases or relapse. New treatment combinations are necessary for these patients. Experimental Design: Ewing sarcoma cells are dependent on focal adhesion kinase (FAK) for growth. To identify candidate treatment combinations for Ewing sarcoma, we performed a small-molecule library screen to identify compounds synergistic with FAK inhibitors in impairing Ewing cell growth. The activity of a top-scoring class of compounds was then validated across multiple Ewing cell lines in vitro and in multiple xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma. Results: Numerous Aurora kinase inhibitors scored as synergistic with FAK inhibition in this screen. We found that Aurora kinase B inhibitors were synergistic across a larger range of concentrations than Aurora kinase A inhibitors when combined with FAK inhibitors in multiple Ewing cell lines. The combination of AZD-1152, an Aurora kinase B–selective inhibitor, and PF-562271 or VS-4718, FAK-selective inhibitors, induced apoptosis in Ewing sarcoma cells at concentrations that had minimal effects on survival when cells were treated with either drug alone. We also found that the combination significantly impaired tumor progression in multiple xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma. Conclusions: FAK and Aurora kinase B inhibitors synergistically impair Ewing sarcoma cell viability and significantly inhibit tumor progression.

A non-native strain of Phragmites australis (Common Reed; hereafter Phragmites) is aggressively invading North American wetlands, and the species has been shown to alter hydrology and impact aquatic organisms. Clear Creek Wildlife Management Area, in Kentucky, is heavily impacted by Phragmites invasion. Portions of the Wildlife Management Area with Phragmites were treated with herbicide to restore wetland flora, and in this study, we evaluated the effects of both the presence and management of Phragmites on wildlife populations and ecosystem function. We selected 3 locations (treated Phragmites, untreated Phragmites, and Phragmites-free) and surveyed each for water chemistry, wildlife populations, and stable-isotope signatures over a 2-y period. Water chemistry varied with the presence or absence of Phragmites, suggesting differences in nutrient cycling. Fish diversity did not differ among sites, but individual species varied in distribution and abundance between the Phragmites sites and the Phragmites-free site. Turtles showed significant differences in both diversity and body size based on the presence or absence of Phragmites, but not herbicide treatment. We detected no significant differences in frog diversity across treatments. We recorded 8 Kentucky Species of Greatest Conservation Need, but there were few differences in the distribution of these species across sites. Stable-isotope analysis revealed variation in food-web structure based on the presence of Phragmites. These results indicate that herbicides had little effect on fish and herpetofaunal communities in the short term, but potentially significant ecological changes may occur if Phragmites were eradicated. Our conclusions highlight the importance of monitoring habitat restoration to guide future management. A holistic, ecosystem-level approach is necessary to understand the impacts of both invasive species and their management. © 2018 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

Methods: Firstly, flow cytometry, cell viability assay, transwell assay, and tube formation were used to explore the role of miR-17-5p in angiogenesis. Then zebrafish model was used to confirm effects of miR-17-5p on angiogenesis. qRT-PCR analysis and Immunofluorescence assay were used to explore the expression of miR-17-5p in NPC tissues and cells compared to the normal control. Besides, in vitro assays were used to analyze the biological functions of miR-17-5p in NPC. What’s more, in vitro and in vivo assays were used to detect the function of exosomal miR-17-5p in angiogenesis. Finally, luciferase reporter assay and western bolt were used to determine the relationship between miR-17-5p and BAMBI. Results: We observed that high expression of miR-17-5p promoted angiogenesis in NPC. Also, high expression of miR-17-5p promoted the NPC cells proliferation and migration. To know whether there’s any communication between HUVECs and NPC cells, exosomes derived from CNE-2 cells were collected. Further results showed that exosomal miR-17-5p secreted from NPC promoted the angiogenesis. What’s more, in vitro assays revealed that miR-17-5p targets BAMBI and regulates AKT/VEGF-A signaling.

The preference was related to the avoidance of artificial sweeteners, flame retardants, fragrances, PAHs, PCBs, pesticides, UV filters and some inorganic elements.

We aimed to determine if a model fish, the goldfish, could sense reuse water using olfaction (smell), and if 30 min or 7 d (acute) and 60 d (sub-chronic) exposures would affect their olfactory responses to natural odorants. We examined olfaction as previous studies have found that numerous chemicals can impair the olfactory sense, which is critical to carrying out numerous life-sustaining behaviors from feeding to mating. We also examined if fish olfactory and liver tissues would mount a response in terms of biotransformation enzyme gene expression, and whether treatment of reuse water with UV/H2O2 ameliorated adverse effects following reuse water exposure. We found that fish olfactory tissue responded to reuse water as it would to a natural odorant and that UV/H2O2 treatment had no influence on this. With acute exposures, olfactory impairment was apparent regardless of water type (e.g. responses of 23–55% of control), but in sub-chronic exposures, only the untreated reuse water caused olfactory impairment. The exposure of fish to reuse water increased the expression of one enzyme (CYP1A; > 2.5–6.5 fold change) and reuse water treatment with UV/H2O2 reversed the effect. There was a seasonal effect that was likely due to changes in water quality (60 d summer exposure impaired olfaction whereas spring and fall exposures did not). Overall, the data suggest that reuse water may be detected by olfaction, impair olfactory responses in fish receiving unavoidable exposures, and that exposure duration and season are important factors to consider regarding adverse effects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: K.B.

We explored associations between exposures and metabolism through an exposome-metabolome wide association scan and multivariate O2PLS modeling. Novel and reproducible associations were found across two periods of pregnancy for three nonpersistent pollutants and across two subcohorts for four of the persistent pollutants. We found novel metabolic signatures associated with arsenic exposure: TMAO and dimethylamine possibly related to gut microbial methylamine metabolism and homarine related to fish intake.

CPF exposure led to a significant decrease in the activity of oxidative stress markers as follows: AChE (84 %), BChE (46 %), and gills Na+/K+ ATPase (62 %). At the end of the recovery period, enzyme levels were recovered except in leg muscle. Total lipids and SOD decreased; CAT and LPO levels increased; and GPx, GR, and GST showed tissue-specific activities. Maximum recovery was observed in GPx followed by GR in HP tissue of crab.

However, neurobehavioral effects associated with exposure have not been characterized in detail. We investigated the behavioral effects of FM 550 in zebrafish to facilitate the integration of the cellular and molecular effects of FM 550 with its behavioral consequences. The effects of developmental FM 550 exposure on zebrafish larvae swimming shortly after the end of exposure as well as the persisting effects of this exposure on adolescent behavior were studied. In addition, the acute effects of FM 550 on behavior with exposure during adolescence in zebrafish were studied.        Methods: Developmental exposure to 0, 0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion spanned 0-5 days post fertilization, with larval testing on day 6 and adolescent testing on days 40-45. Acute adolescent (45 dpf) exposure was to 0, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion, for 24 h, with testing 2 h or 1 week later. The vehicle condition was colony tank water with.0004% (developmental) or .0012% (adolescent) DMSO. Zebrafish behavior was characterized across several domains including learning, social affiliation, sensorimotor function, predator escape, and novel environment exploration.        Results: Persisting effects of developmental FM 550 exposure included a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in social behavior among all dose groups. Acute FM 550 exposure during adolescence caused hypoactivity and reduced social behavior (p's < 0.05) when the fish were tested 2 h after exposure. These effects were attenuated at the 1 week post exposure testing point        Discussion: Taken together, these data indicate that FM 550 may cause persisting neurobehavioral alterations to social behavior in the absence of perturbations along other behavioral domains and that developmental exposure is more costly to the organism than acute adolescent exposure.

The objective of this work was to investigate the direct effects of long-term exposure to environmental concentrations of pendimethalin over a period of 18 months in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) genitors. To do so, an experimental system consisting of eight similar 400 L tanks with a flow-through of fresh river water was used to perform daily chemical contamination. Fish were exposed to 850 ng/L for one hour and the pendimethalin concentration was then gradually diluted during the day to maintain optimal conditions for the fish throughout the experiment and to achieve a mean theoretical exposure level of around 100 ng L-1 per day. Every November, males and females were stripped to collect eggs and sperm and two new first generations of offspring were obtained. Kinetic sampling revealed differences in immune system parameters and antioxidative defences in the contaminated trout compared to the controls, due to pesticide exposure combined with seasonal changes related to gamete maturation. Moreover, reproductive capacity was significantly affected by exposure to the herbicide; a time lag of more than five weeks was observed for egg maturation in contaminated females and high bioconcentrations of pendimethalin were measured in eggs and sperm.

The quality of bivalve mollusks is closely related to the sanitary conditions of surrounding waters where they are cultivated. Presently, cultivation areas receive large amounts of effluents derived mainly from treated and non-treated domestic, rural, and urban sewage. This contributes to the contamination of mollusks with trace metals, pesticides, other organic compounds, and human pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoan. The aim of this study was to perform a thorough diagnosis of the shellfish growing areas in Florianopolis, on the coast of Santa Catarina. The contamination levels of seawater, sediments, and oysters were evaluated for their microbiological, biochemical, and chemical parameters at five sea sites in Florianopolis, namely three regular oyster cultivation areas (Sites 1, 2, and oyster supplier), a polluted site (Site 3), and a heavily polluted site (Site 4). Samples were evaluated at day zero and after 14 days. Seawater and sediment samples were collected just once, at the end of the experiment. Antioxidant defenses, which may occur in contaminated environments in response to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by organisms, were analyzed in oysters, as well as organic compounds (in oysters and sediment samples) and microbiological contamination (in oysters and seawater samples). The results showed the presence of the following contaminants: fecal coliforms in seawater samples (four sites), human adenovirus (all sites), human noroviruses GI and GII (two sites), Hepatitis A viruses (one site), JC Polyomavirus in an oyster sample from the oyster supplier, Giardia duodenalis cysts, and Cryptosporidium sp oocysts (one site). Among organochlorine pesticides, only DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane) were detected in some sediment and oysters samples in very low levels; site 4 had the highest concentrations of total aliphatic hydrocarbons. PAHs, and linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) found either in oysters or in sediment samples. The major concentration of fecal sterol coprostanol was found at site 4, followed by site 3. After 14 days of allocation in the four selected sites, there was a significant difference in the enzymes analyzed at the monitored spots. The detection of different contaminants in oysters, seawater, and sediment samples in the present study shows the impact untreated or inadequately treated effluents have on coastal areas. These results highlight the need for public investment in adequate wastewater treatment and adequate treatment of oysters, ensuring safe areas for shellfish production as well as healthier bivalve mollusks for consumption.

Transcription of these genes was regulated in response to H2O2, paraquat, or organic peroxides. Expression of katB-lacZ and the observed KatB catalase levels in P. aeruginosa PAO1 were induced up to 250-fold after exposure to oxidative stress-generating compounds. Also, ahpB-lacZ and ahpC-lacZ expression was 90- and 3-fold higher, respectively, upon exposure to paraquat. The dose- and time-response curves revealed that 1 mu M paraquat was sufficient for half-maximal activation of each reporter fusion within 5 min of exposure. Expression of these genes was not observed in a Delta oxyR mutant, indicating that OxyR was essential for this response. The transcriptional start sites of katB-ankB, ahpB, and ahpC-ahpF were mapped, putative OxyR-binding sites were identified upstream of the -35 promoter elements, and direct binding of purified OxyR protein to these target promoters was demonstrated. The oxyR mutant was hypersusceptible to oxidative stress-generating agents, including H2O2 and paraquat, in spite of total KatA catalase activity being comparable to that of the wild type. The oxyR phenotype was fully complemented by a plasmid containing the oxyR gene, while any of the katB, ahpB, or ahpCF genes alone resulted in only marginal complementation. Increased katB-lacZ expression and higher KatB catalase levels were detected in a Delta ahpCF background compared to wild-type bacteria, suggesting a compensatory function for KatB in the absence of AhpCF. In P. aeruginosa, oxyR is located upstream of recG, encoding a putative DNA repair enzyme. oxyR-lacZ and recG-lacZ reporter activities and oxyR-recG mRNA analysis showed that oxyR and recG are organized in an operon and expressed constitutively with regard to oxidative stress from a single promoter upstream of oxyR. Mutants affected in recG but not oxyR were dramatically impaired in DNA damage repair as measured by sensitivity to UV irradiation.

However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood in invertebrates. Mesenchyme cells of the starfish larvae, which allowed Metchnikoff to complete his landmark experiments, are important model for analysis of immune cell migration. The present study investigated the role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-an evolutionarily conserved cytokine that is functionally similar to chemokines-in the larvae of the starfish Patiria (Asterina) pectinifera, which were found to possess two orthologs, ApMIF1 and ApMIF2. ApMIF1 and ApMIF2 clustered with mammalian MIF and its homolog D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT), respectively, in the phylogenetic analysis. In contrast to the functional similarity between mammalian MIF and DDT, ApMIF1 knockdown resulted in the excessive recruitment of mesenchyme cells in vivo, whereas ApMIF2 deficiency inhibited the recruitment of these cells to foreign bodies. Mesenchyme cells migrated along a gradient of recombinant ApMIF2 in vitro, whereas recombinant ApMIF1 completely blocked ApMIF2-induced directed migration. Moreover, the expression patterns of ApMIF1 and ApMIF2 messenger RNA in bacteria-challenged mesenchyme cells were consistent with in vivo observations of cell behaviors. These results indicate that ApMIF1 and ApMIF2 act as chemotactic inhibitory and stimulatory factors, respectively, and coordinately regulate mesenchyme cell recruitment during the immune response in starfish larvae. This is the first report describing opposing functions for MIF- and DDT-like molecules.

The 98 000 km2 region has a high rate of primary production relative to other parts of arctic Canada. About 60 g C.m-2  are fixed annually, of which approximately 90% is contributed by phytoplankton, 10% by ice algae, and 1% by kelp. Phytoplankton production is twofold higher along the south coast of Cornwallis Island than elsewhere in Barrow Strait. Four copepod species, of which Pseudocalanus acuspes is the most important energetically, graze about one-third of the phytoplankton production. Bivalves maintain high biomass but low energy flow, acting as sedimenting agents. Arctic cod is a major component, with 125 000 tonnes being consumed by marine mammals and 23 000 tonnes by seabirds annually. Our hydroacoustic estimate for mean arctic cod density, 0.0022 fish.m-2, is probably too low, partly because we have been unable to quantify dense aggregations of schooling fish. The ecological efficiency of ringed seal is near maximum, with 5% of ringed seal ingestion going to bears and man as seal flesh. The data on total kill and prey consumption in whales and birds is incomplete because they migrate out of the Lancaster Sound region in winter. The food chain is very long, with bears occupying the fifth trophic level; this is reflected by high biomagnification factors for persistent lipophilic pollutants such as PCBs.

The most toxic PCBs are the non-ortho-substituted (""dioxin-like"") congeners that act through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. In humans, perinatal exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is associated with neurodevelopmental toxicity in children. Yet, the full potential for later-life neurobehavioral effects that result from early-life low level exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of developmental exposure to low levels of dioxin-like PCBs on early- and later-life behavioral phenotypes using zebrafish as a model system. We exposed zebrafish embryos to either vehicle (DMSO) or low concentrations of PCB126 (0.3, 0.6, 1.2 nM) for 20 h (4-24 h post fertilization), and then reared them to adulthood in clean water. Locomotor activity was tested at two larval stages (7 and 14 days post fertilization). Adult fish were tested for anxiety-related behavior using the novel tank and shoaling assays. Adult behavioral assays were repeated several times on the same group of fish and effects on intra- and inter-trial habituation were determined. While there was no effect of PCB126 on larval locomotor activity in response to changes in light conditions, developmental exposure to PCB126 resulted in impaired short- and long-term habituation to a novel environment in adult zebrafish. Cyp1a induction was measured as an indicator for AHR activation. Despite high induction at early stages, cyp1a expression was not induced in the brains of developmentally exposed adult fish that showed altered behavior, suggesting that AHR was not activated at this stage.

Flow cytometric results showed that the percentages of apoptotic cells incubated with 20mg L-1 (-)PFF, (+)PFF and rac-PFF for 24h reached 23.4%, 9.2% and 14.2% (P < 0.01), respectively. Hippocampal neurons incubated with (-)PFF, (+)PFF and rac-PFF exhibited a dose-dependent accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and a dose-dependent inhibition of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, implying that the defense system of the tests induces oxidative damage. A statistically significant difference was observed between the two enantiomers at 5mg L-1 and above. Moreover, the results showed that (-)PFF exposure caused a significant loss in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP), an upregulation of Ca2+ and Bax protein expression, a downregulation of Bcl-2 protein expression, and the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in a dose-dependent manner; (+)PFF and rac-PFF exhibited these effects to a lesser degree. All results suggest that PFF induced apoptosis in rat hippocampal neurons via the mitochondria-mediated pathway, and oxidative stress is one of the factors of PFF-induced apoptosis.

Four adult males and two ovulated females were placed in the aquarium together with eight mature male parr. Four of the parr were exposed during the previous 4 days to two concentrations (0.1 or 1.0 mu g l(-1)) of the pyrethroid pesticide cypermethrin (a disrupter of olfactory receptor function) and four of the parr to the solvent ethanol. The behaviour of all fish was followed for 24 h and then blood and milt was collected. Exposure to the higher concentration of cypermethrin disturbed the reproductive behaviour of the parr. They displayed fewer courting events, spent less time near the nesting females and had lower volumes of strippable milt. They also had significantly lower amounts of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) in the blood plasma than the control roup. The higher cypermethrin group also had significantly lower levels of all these variables than the 9 lower cypermethrin group, apart from strippable milt that showed no significant differences between two groups. No significant differences in non-reproductive behaviours were observed between any of the groups. In the control fish, there were significant positive Correlations between (a) the number of courting events and the amount of time spent near the female, (b) blood plasma levels of 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta-P) and time spent near the female and (c) plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P and the number of courting events. Further, in control fish, higher plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P were observed in part-interacting with a female compared to those with no female contacts. A priming experiment confirmed a previous study that cypermethrin damages olfactory reception. Parr exposed to cypermethrin had significantly lower blood plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P and 11-KT than control males after exposure to ovarian fluid and urine (known to contain reproductive priming pheromones).

A variety of pesticides have direct effects on retinoic acid (RA) signaling and as RA signaling has important roles in neurodevelopment, such compounds may cause developmental neurotoxicity through an overlapping adverse outcome pathway. It is hypothesized that a pesticide's embryonic effects on retinoid function may correspond with neurobehavioral disruption later in development. In the current studies, we determined the effects of RA-acting pesticides on neurobehavioral development in zebrafish. Buprofezin and imazalil caused generalized hypoactivity in the larval motility test, whereas chlorothalonil and endosulfan I led to selective hypoactivity and hyperactivity, respectively. With buprofezin, chlorothalonil, and imazalil, hypoactivity and/or novel anxiety-like behaviors persisted in adulthood and buprofezin additionally decreased social attraction responses in adulthood. Endosulfan I did not produce significant adult behavioral effects. Using qPCR analyses of adult brain tissue, we observed treatment-induced alterations in RA synthesis or catabolic genes, indicating persistent changes in RA homeostasis. These changes were compound-specific, with respect to expression directionality, and potential patterns of homeostatic disruption. Results suggest the likely persistence of disruptions in RA signaling well into adulthood and may represent compensatory mechanisms following early life stage exposures. This study demonstrates that early developmental exposure to environmental toxicants that interfere with RA signaling causes short as well as long-term behavioral disruption in a well-established zebrafish behavioral model and expand upon the meaning of the RA adverse outcome pathway, indicating that observed effects likely correspond with the nature of underlying homeostatic effects.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  45,10.1093/toxsci/kfae001,zebrafish;development;neurobehavioral toxicology;retinoic acid receptors;VITAMIN-A;CRITICAL PERIOD;MENTAL-HEALTH;VALPROIC ACID;HOX GENES;ABNORMALITIES;ORIGINS;Pesticides,NA,NA,developmental exposure to pesticides that disrupt retinoic acid signaling causes persistent retinoid and behavioral dysfunction in zebrafish

In vertebrates, the stress response is regulated via neuroendocrine pathways, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis that regulates the secretion of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids have cascading effects on multiple physiological pathways, affecting the metabolic rate, reactive oxygen species production, or immune system. Determining the extent to which natural and anthropogenic environmental factors induce stress responses in vertebrates is of great importance in ecology and conservation biology. Here we study the physiological stress response in spadefoot toad tadpoles (Pelobates cultripes) against three levels of a series of natural and anthropogenic stressors common to many aquatic systems: salinity (0, 6, and 9 ppt), herbicide (0, 1, and 2 mg/L acid equivalent of glyphosate), water acidity (pH 4.5, 7.0, and 9.5), predators (absent, native, and invasive), and temperature (217, 257, and 29 degrees C). The physiological stress response was assessed examining corticosterone levels, standard metabolic rate, activity of antioxidant enzymes, oxidative cellular damage in lipids, and immunological status. We found that common stressors substantially altered the physiological state of tadpoles. In particular, salinity and herbicides cause dramatic physiological changes in tadpoles. Moreover, tadpoles reduced corticosterone levels in the presence of natural predators but did not do so against invasive predators, indicating a lack of innate recognition. Corticosterone and the antioxidant enzyme glutathione reductase were the most sensitive parameters to stress in this study.

The lowest observable effect concentration (LOECs) for the standard measures of survival and growth was 5.6 mu g/L. Two behavioral endpoints were of similar sensitivity to the standard measures: swimming capacity, LOEC of 5.6 mu g/L; and prey strike frequency, LOEC of 5.6 mu g/L. However, aggressive interactions were ten-fold more sensitive than swimming or feeding behavior with a LOEC occurring at 0.6 mu g/L.

The aim of the current study is to investigate whether the exposure of Lithobates catesbeianus tadpoles to different abamectin concentrations [12.5, 25, and 50% of the median lethal concentration (LC50)] leads to behavioral and morphological changes and/or generates possible cytotoxic effects. The aggregation test showed that tadpoles exposed to the highest ABA concentrations did not respond to the stimulus from non-familial and unrelated co-specific species. On the other hand, there was no difference in the total number of crossings in the central line of the herein adopted apparatus between groups; it suggests that ABA did not affect animal locomotion in the aforementioned test, although changes in the normal swimming pattern of tadpoles exposed to the pesticide were recorded in the swimming activity test. In addition, the herein exposed animals did not respond to the predatory stimulus in the antipredator response test; this result suggests defensive response deficit caused by the pesticide. With respect to their oral morphology, tadpoles exposed to ABA presented the lowest scores for mandibular pigmentation and structures, as well as for dentition condition. Finally, it was possible seeing that the exposure to ABA, even at the lowest concentration (12.5% of the LC50), resulted in nuclear changes in the erythrocytes of the animals; these changes became evident in the increased number of micronuclei and in other nuclear abnormalities. Thus, besides confirming the cytotoxic potential of ABA in amphibians, the current study corroborates the hypothesis that the exposure to the herein investigated pesticide leads to behavioral and morphological changes in tadpoles, fact that may negatively reflect on the survival, as well as on natural populations of these individuals.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  22     Cited Reference Count:  83,10.1007/s11356-018-1562-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agrochemicals;Pesticide;Environmental toxicology;Amphibians;BULLFROG TADPOLES;LITHOBATES-CATESBEIANUS;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;OXIDATIVE DAMAGE;ORAL DEFORMITIES;KIN RECOGNITION;LARVAL ANURANS;RANA-SYLVATICA;DANIO-RERIO;BODY-SIZE;Biological Markers,NA,NA,behavioral and mutagenic biomarkers in tadpoles exposed to different abamectin concentrations

Mononuclear or dinuclear neutral or cationic complexes were obtained by reaction of the ligands with 1 or 2 equiv of Pd(C6XF4)(2)(cod) (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene; X = F, H) or the palladium fragment [Pd(eta(3)-2-Me-C3H4)(S)(2)](+) (S = acetone). The reaction of the dinuclear derivatives with 1 equiv of the respective free ligand immediately led to the regeneration of the mononuclear complexes. Except in the case of the synthesis of [{Pd(C6HF4)(2)}{Pd(C6F5)(2)}(bpzpm)], where two similar metallic groups are present, all attempts to obtain dinuclear asymmetric complexes with two different palladium fragments failed. Instead, the dinuclear symmetric complexes were formed. This result could be considered as an example of molecular recognition with the ligand acting as a ditopic receptor. This behavior is comparable to chemical symbiosis but in this case applied to the ligand rather than to the metal center as occurs normally. The polyfluorophenyl rings are situated on average in a perpendicular orientation with respect to the coordination plane. Their restricted rotation results in several atropoisomers for the complexes with m-C6HF4.

The immunostimulatory effects of glucan, chitin, lactoferrin and levamisole for fish and shrimp have been reported. Nutritional factors such as Vitamins B and C, growth hormone and prolactin have also been reported to be immunostimulators. These immunostimulants mainly facilitate the function of phagocytic cells and increase their bactericidal activities. Several immunostimulants also stimulate the natural killer cells, complement, lysozyme and antibody responses of fish. The activation of these immunological functions is associated with increased protection against infectious disease. Resistance to bacterial pathogens such as Vibrio anguillarum, V. salmonicida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia rukeri and Streptococcus spp. and to parasitic infections such as white spot disease can be increased by administration of immunostimulants, but not to intracellular pathogens such as Renibacterium salmoninarum and Pasteurella piscicida. The most effective method of administration of immunostimulants to fish is by injection. Oral and immersion methods have also been reported, but the efficacy of these methods decreases with long-term administration. Overdoses of several immunostimulants induce immunosuppression in fish. The side effects of immunostimulants have not been well-studied. Growth-promoting activity has been noted in fish or shrimp treated with glucan or lactoferrin. Immunostimulants can overcome immune suppression by sex hormones. Thus, the influence of immunostimulants in mature fish should be studied. In conclusion, immunostimulants can reduce the losses caused by disease in aquaculture; however, they may not be effective against all diseases. For the effective use of immunostimulants, the timing, dosages, method of administration and the physiological condition of fish need to be taken into consideration. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Methods: Both low malarious (DDT spray from 1958 to 1976) and high malarious (DDT spray from 1958 to April 2006) villages were selected for the study in Arid zone district Jodhpur, Rajasthan during March-April 2006. Resting behaviour of the species during all its movement rhythms covering 24 h period related to: (i) swarming/mating; (ii) pre- and post-biting rest; (iii) after feed resting between hoping movements; (iv) night and day time resting and; (v) diel activity movements in response to temperature changes, were carried out.        Results: The results showed that household objects like cupboards, furnitures, hanging clothes, goods stacked on loft, stored clothes, cobwebs and floor were the dominant resting sites both in sprayed and unsprayed villages. About 95 and 97% of An. stephensi preferred to rest on household objects of unsprayed and sprayed villages respectively. There was no significant difference in resting behaviour of the species in both groups of villages (p >0.05). The pre-biting resting time was recorded as 5 to 15 min whereas post-biting resting time lasted for 15 to 25 min. After biting outdoor (in courtyard open to sky) species starts entering the rooms at around 2330 hrs. It was observed that during III quarter (0100 to 0400 hrs) maximum species entered into the room were 56% in unsprayed and 62% in sprayed villages. Statistically there was no significant difference in the entry of mosquitoes (p >0.05) in both the groups of villages.        Conclusion: Before DDT era, An. stephensi was found resting at all heights of the walls inside the human dwellings. Present study revealed that An. stephensi is trying to avoid sprayable surfaces and tend to rest on unsprayable surfaces during all its movement rhythms starting from swarming, pre-/post-biting and during hopping movements in the courtyard and thereafter household objects inside the room as final day time resting. It was concluded that changed behaviour of resting of An. stephensi on unsprayable objects in sprayed rooms largely accounted for failure of malaria control. Control of An. stephensi, thus requires an integrated vector control strategy based upon interesectoral, environmental, larviciding with chemical/biolarvicide and use of larvivorous fish wherever feasible.

Accordingly, the present study aimed to assess the modulatory effects of dietary methionine on the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) immune status, inflammatory response and disease resistance to Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp). For this purpose, fish were randomly distributed in three independent groups (three replicates per group) and each was fed the corresponding diet: a control diet (CTRL) formulated to meet the established amino acid requirements for the species; a diet supplemented with methionine at 0.5% of feed weight relative to the CTRL diet (8.2% of methionine concentration above CTRL); and one supplemented with methionine at 1% of feed weight to the CTRL diet (11.8% of methionine concentration above CTRL). To evaluate the immune status of fish fed with each of the diets before being submitted to bacterial infection fish were sampled from each group at 2 and 4 weeks after the beginning of feeding. Non-sampled fish were injected intraperitoneally with Phdp (5 x 10(3) cfu/fish) at 4 weeks after initiation of feeding and the inflammatory response (at 4, 24, and 48 h post-infection) and survival (lasting 21 days post-infection) evaluated. Fish hematological profile, peripheral cell dynamics, plasma humoral immune parameters, leucocyte migration to the inflammatory focus and head-kidney gene expression were evaluated. Results show that methionine dietary supplementation improves seabass cellular immune status without evidence of activation of pro-inflammatory mechanisms. Additionally, the observed enhanced immune status provided by methionine supplementation translated into an improved immune response to infection, as higher cellular differentiation/proliferation and recruitment to the inflammatory focus, improved plasma humoral immune parameters and modulation of key immune-related genes was observed. Lastly, after a bacterial challenge, higher survival was observed in fish fed supplemented diets, ultimately corroborating the positive effect of methionine administration for 4 weeks in the cellular immune status.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  41     Total Times Cited:  45     Cited Reference Count:  41,10.3389/fimmu.2018.02672     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),amino acids;cell proliferation;inflammation;immunostimulation;fish;nutraceutics;SULFUR AMINO-ACIDS;INHIBITS AUTOPHAGY;JUVENILE JIAN;SPARUS-AURATA;METABOLISM;PROTEIN;METHYLATION;MECHANISMS;MODULATORS;TRYPTOPHAN;Methionine,NA,NA,dietary methionine improves the european seabass <i>dicentrarchus labrax<i> immune status inflammatory response and disease resistance

The diversity of potential sources contributes to the likelihood of contaminated marine waters and sediments and increases the probability of uptake by marine organisms. Despite widespread recognition of direct and indirect pathways for contaminant deposition and organismal exposure in coastal systems, spatial and temporal variability in contaminant composition, deposition, and uptake patterns are still poorly known. We investigated these patterns for a suite of persistent legacy contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and chemicals of emerging concern including pharmaceuticals within two Oregon coastal estuaries (Coos and Netarts Bays). In the more urbanized Coos Bay, native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) tissue had approximately twice the number of PCB congeners at over seven times the total concentration, yet fewer PBDEs at one-tenth the concentration as compared to the more rural Netarts Bay. Different pharmaceutical suites were detected during each sampling season. Variability in contaminant types and concentrations across seasons and between species and media (organisms versus sediment) indicates the limitation of using indicator species and/or sampling annually to determine contaminant loads at a site or for specific species. The results indicate the prevalence of legacy contaminants and CECs in relatively undeveloped coastal environments highlighting the need to improve policy and management actions to reduce contaminant releases into estuarine and marine waters and to deal with legacy compounds that remain long after prohibition of use. Our results point to the need for better understanding of the ecological and human health risks of exposure to the diverse cocktail of pollutants and harmful compounds that will continue to leach from estuarine sediments over time. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: E.F.

In all the villages, MDA was carried out by the state health machinery, as part of the national filariasis elimination programme. Thirty-six difficult-to-control villages were grouped as, viz, MDA alone, MDA + EPS and MDA + EPS + PIC arms. Implementation and monitoring of IVC was carried out by the community. After 3 years of IVC, higher reductions in filariometric indices were observed in both the community and vector population. Decline in antigenaemia prevalence was higher in MDA + IVC as compared to MDA alone arm. Vector density dropped significantly (P < 0.05) in both the IVC arms, and nil transmission was observed during post-IVC period. Almost 53.8 and 75.8 % of the cesspits in MDA + EPS and MDA + EPS + PIC arms were closed by the householders, due to the enhanced awareness on vector breeding.

In this study, the effects of exposure to TBT on the antioxidant defense system, Na+-K+-ATPase activity, neurological enzymes activity and Hsp 70 protein level in brain of juvenile common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were studied. Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of TBT (5, 10 and 20 μg/L) for 7 days. Based on the results, with increasing concentrations of TBT, oxidative stress was apparent as reflected by the significant higher levels of oxidative indices, as well as the significant inhibition of all antioxidant enzymes activities. Besides, the activities of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Monoamine oxidases (MAO) and Na+-K+-ATPase were significantly inhibited after exposure to TBT with higher concentrations. In addition, the levels of Hsp 70 protein were evaluated under TBT stress with dose-depended manner.

The tool has been tested in salmon, beef-and-dairy, and fruit juice production sectors. Methods: The SENSE project has evaluated several existing methodologies for environmental impact assessment over the life cycle including also social aspects, in order to deliver a new integral system for the environmental and social assessment of agricultural and aquaculture food products. Results and discussion: The system includes a standardization of a data gathering system, a selection of relevant key environmental performance indicators for food supply chains and a common methodology to perform simplified life cycle impact assessment. The results are based on collected information on the use of resources and emissions generated along the supply chain of food or drink products. The main result is a web-based software tool that is based on a summation of the partial impacts of the different steps in food supply chains. In this software, different actors in the supply chain can enter their own data and link them to the data of other companies. The results obtained in the tool could be used for at least six different approaches: (i) environmental impact assessment of the product, (ii) food chain hot spot identification, (iii) comparison of hypothetical or real improvement scenarios, (iv) assessment of the environmental impact development over the years, (v) benchmarking opportunity for the companies, and (vi) a business to business communication strategy. The scientific robustness of the tool has been tested comparing the obtained results with the same analysis with commercial software. Conclusions: The SENSE tool is a simplified tool designed for food and drink SMEs to assess their sustainability on their own. This cannot be fully compared to a complete LCA study. The testing with SMEs showed that they need additional support for filling in the questionnaires correctly and interpret the results. The simplified evaluation of environmental impacts based on a life cycle approach could lead to benefits to SMEs within the food industry. The future application and development of the tool will be focused on adapting the tool to the Product Environmental Footprint initiative requirements and self-assessment opportunities. © 2015, The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 20; Correspondence Address: S.

By the 1870s, Euro-Americans had extirpated the American bison (Bison bison), introduced cattle, and begun agricultural cultivation in the region. Lesser Prairie-Chicken populations initially increased with changes on the landscape that came with early settlements, with populations sufficiently abundant to support both subsistence and market hunting. The proportion of prairies converted to cropland steadily increased from the late 1800s to the early 1900s. Habitat loss, combined with drought and high winds, precipitated the Dust Bowl, an ecological disaster during the 1930s in the heart of the species' range. By the late 1930s, Lesser Prairie-Chicken populations were reported to be near extirpation in Kansas, New Mexico, and Colorado, with greatly reduced numbers in Texas and Oklahoma. The disaster of the Dust Bowl prompted many of the first landscape conservation efforts to benefit Lesser Prairie-Chickens, including the eventual establishment of the Cimarron and Comanche National Grasslands. Lesser Prairie-Chicken populations generally recovered during the 1940s-1960s, but new threats to the species' habitats emerged during that period. Conversion of grasslands to croplands continued, and development of center-pivot irrigation systems made it possible to farm previously nonarable sand prairie, sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia) prairie, and sand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) prairie, all prime habitats for Lesser Prairie-Chicken. Oil and gas development and associated infrastructure encroached on and degraded Lesser Prairie-Chicken habitats throughout the species' range, most intensively in the Permian Basin of west Texas and adjacent New Mexico. The encroachment of invasive trees on grasslands, facilitated by a century of fire suppression, reached levels intolerable to Lesser Prairie-Chickens and caused further habitat loss within the range of the species. Extensive herbicide treatments of both sand sagebrush and sand shinnery oak prairies have degraded the quality of these remaining habitats. By the late 1900s, only 10%-15% of the historical range remained occupied by Lesser Prairie-Chickens. A petition to list the species as ""threatened"" under the Endangered Species Act was submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1995. The USFWS determined that the listing was ""warranted but precluded"" by higher priorities, leaving the Lesser Prairie-Chicken as a ""candidate"" species. The change in conservation status prompted new research and conservation activity for the species, including land acquisitions. Considerable effort and resources were channeled through the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Lesser Prairie-Chicken populations expanded their range and numbers substantially in Kansas in response to native species grasslands established through the CRP. Much of the conservation activity was monitored through the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Interstate Working Group, which produced three documents that culminated with a range-wide conservation plan put into action in early 2014. Continuing loss and degradation of Lesser Prairie-Chicken habitats due to energy development and prolonged drought prompted the USFWS to list the species as ""threatened"" on May 12, 2014. The listing decision was vacated by a judicial decision in September 2015, creating considerable regulatory uncertainty regarding the legal status of the species. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

So the aim of the present study was to investigate the toxic effects of CuSO4.5H2O by examining oxidative damage markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA) for lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant enzymatic defense system components (glutathione reductase (GR), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT)) in freshwater fish Capoeta umbla (Heckel, 1843) liver, kidney and gill. In this purpose, the 96 h LC50 values (with 95% confidence limits) of CuSO4.5H2O for C. umbla was estimated as a 1.478 mg/L. Three different CuSO4.5H2O sublethal doses (0.185, 0.370 and 0.739 mg/L) were administered to C. umbla at different time intervals (12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h). Antioxidant enzyme activities and MDA levels were measured spectrophotometrically. Liver, kidney and gills samples were collected at the end of the experiment, and analysed for their oxidant–antioxidant status, including MDA level, GR, G6PD, SOD, CAT and GPx activities. Results obtained showed that CuSO4.5H2O, significantly decreased (P<0.05) the GR, G6PD and GPx activities, but increased (P<0.05) the CAT, SOD activities and MDA levels of C. umbla liver, kidney and gill tissue in a dose-dependent manner.

We present a selection of the most commonly used agents to study purines in the nervous system. Some of these compounds, including A1 and A3 AR agonists, P2Y1R and P2Y12R antagonists, and P2X3, P2X4 and P2X7 antagonists, are potentially of clinical use in treatment of disorders of the nervous system, such as chronic pain, neurodegeneration and brain injury. Agonists of the A2AAR and P2Y2R are already used clinically, P2Y12R antagonists are widely used antithrombotics and an antagonist of the A2AAR is approved in Japan for treating Parkinson's disease. The selectivity defined for some of the previously introduced compounds has been revised with updated pharmacological characterization, for example, various AR agonists and antagonists were deemed A1AR or A3AR selective based on human data, but species differences indicated a reduction in selectivity ratios in other species. Also, many of the P2R ligands still lack bioavailability due to charged groups or hydrolytic (either enzymatic or chemical) instability. X-ray crystallographic structures of AR and P2YRs have shifted the mode of ligand discovery to structure-based approaches rather than previous empirical approaches. The X-ray structures can be utilized either for in silico screening of chemically diverse libraries for the discovery of novel ligands or for enhancement of the properties of known ligands by chemical modification. Although X-ray structures of the zebrafish P2X4R have been reported, there is scant structural information about ligand recognition in these trimeric ion channels. In summary, there are definitive, selective agonists and antagonists for all of the ARs and some of the P2YRs; while the pharmacochemistry of P2XRs is still in nascent stages. The therapeutic potential of selectively modulating these receptors is continuing to gain interest in such fields as cancer, inflammation, pain, diabetes, ischemic protection and many other conditions.

Hemlock mortality has been linked to a loss in esthetics, declines in trout habitat, and an increase in safety hazards in public forests. Available options to control HWA vary in terms of cost and environmental impact. As infestations occur often on public lands, which are popular recreation destinations, understanding public knowledge of and attitudes toward HWA control options will be important to any successful control program. Household survey results indicate public support for combating HWA, but public awareness of control options and of HWA in general is low. Survey respondents revealed concerns related to increased risk of wildfire, safety, and reduced quality of recreation but were less concerned with property value reduction or loss of trees on private land. Spraying oil and soap on branches and injecting insecticides into tree trunks were preferred to chemical soil treatments or releasing nonnative predatory beetles.

As biomixtures employ high content of lignocellulosic substrates, their bioaugmentation with ligninolytic fungi represents a novel approach for their enhancement. Nonetheless, the decrease in the concentration of the pesticide may result in sublethal concentrations that still affect ecosystems. Two matrices, a microcosm of rice husk (lignocellulosic substrate) bioaugmented with the fungus Trametes versicolor and a biomixture that contained fungally colonized rice husk were used in the degradation of the insecticide/nematicide carbofuran (CFN). Elutriates simulating lixiviates from these matrices were used to assay the ecotoxicological effects at sublethal level over Daphnia magna (Straus) and the fish Oreochromis aureus (Steindachner) and Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum). Elutriates obtained after 30 d of treatment in the rice husk microcosms at dilutions over 2.5% increased the offspring of D. magna as a trade-off stress response, and produced mortality of neonates at dilutions over 5%. Elutriates (dilution 1:200) obtained during a 30 d period did not produce alterations on the oxygen consumption and ammonium excretion of O. mykiss, however these physiological parameters were affected in O. aureus at every time point of treatment, irrespective of the decrease in CFN concentration. When the fungally colonized rice husk was used to prepare a biomixture, where more accelerated degradation is expected, similar alterations on the responses by O. aureus were achieved. Results suggest that despite the good removal of the pesticide, it is necessary to optimize biomixtures to minimize their residual toxicity and potential chronic effects on aquatic life. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: C.E.

Age-0 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), a species of conservation concern, share similar stream habitats with larval sea lampreys and these streams can be targeted for lampricide applications on a 3- to 5-year cycle. Previous laboratory research found that lake sturgeon smaller than 100 mm could be susceptible to lampricide treatments. We conducted stream-side toxicity (bioassay) and in situ studies in conjunction with 10 lampricide applications in nine Great Lakes tributaries to determine whether sea lamprey treatments could result in in situ age-0 lake sturgeon mortality, and developed a logistic model to help predict lake sturgeon survival during future treatments. In the bioassays the observed concentrations where no lake sturgeon mortality occurred (no observable effect concentration, NOEC) were at or greater than the observed sea lamprey minimum lethal concentration (MLC or LC99) in 7 of 10 tests. We found that the mean in situ survival of age-0 lake sturgeon during 10 lampricide applications was 80%, with a range of 45–100% survival within streams. Modeling indicated that in age-0 lake sturgeon survival was negatively correlated with absolute TFM concentration and stream alkalinity, and positively correlated with stream pH and temperature. Overall survival was higher than expected based on previous research, and we expect that these data will help managers with decisions on the trade-offs between sea lamprey control and the effect on stream-specific populations of age-0 lake sturgeon. © 2016","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 24; Correspondence Address: L.M.

Although it has been documented that they affect the behavior and reproduction of aquatic species, researches investigating cellular detoxification and the defense system in bivalves are scarce. In this study, adult Asian clams (C. fluminea) were exposed to tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP) and tributyl phosphate (TBP) at 20, 200, and 2000 μg/L for 28 d. The results showed no noticeable difference in siphoning behavior. However, the siphoning behavior displayed a trend toward a slight decrease in the treatment groups. GR activity was markedly reduced compared with the control groups, whereas the levels of cyp4 significantly increased following the 2000 μg/L TBP treatments (p < 0.05). Moreover, the levels of gsts1 and gstm1 significantly decreased following all TBEP treatments and were significantly inhibited by 20 μg/L TBP (p < 0.05). The adverse effects on antioxidant enzymes suggested that C. fluminea mainly relies on the antioxidant system to reduce damage without an increase in MDA levels following exposure to a low concentration. Moreover, mRNA expression levels of heat shock proteins (hsp 22, 40, 60, 70, and 90) were significantly down-regulated with TBEP and TBP treatments lower than 200 μg/L (p < 0.05), whereas significant up-regulations were observed for hsp 22 and hsp 70 in response to 2000 μg/L TBP treatment (p < 0.05). Up-regulation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes (abcb1 and abcc1) showed that TBEP and TBP could activate the multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) system to discharge xenobiotics in C. fluminea, which kept its shell closed at high concentrations to prevent xenobiotic entry.

(Poaceae), in the USA. Maize plants expressing Bt toxins targeting the corn rootworm complex have been widely adopted and are the primary insecticidal control measure for this pest in North America. Insect resistance management tactics using various refuge structures have been adopted to ensure Bt products will retain durability. An assumption of the refuge strategy is that males and females emerging from Bt and refuge plantings mate randomly; this has not been tested in the field. We conducted cage studies using field populations of WCR in Indiana, USA, to generate empirical field data on mating rates between beetles emerging from Cry3Bb1-expressing Bt and refuge maize plants. Two refuge configurations were tested; all refuge plants were labeled using the stable isotope 15N. This mark persists in adult beetles after eclosion, allowing for collection and analysis of isotopic ratios of all beetles. Additional data collected included adult emergence rates, timing and sex ratios for each of the treatments, and head capsule size and dry weights of beetles collected. Treatment had a significant effect on dry weight; mean dry weight decreased in Bt-only treatments. Fisher's exact test of proportions of mating pairs of refuge and Bt insects indicated that mating was not random in 20% strip refuges and 5% seed blend treatments. We found high percentages of beetles that fed on Bt-expressing plants as larvae, suggesting that mating between resistant beetles may not be rare even if random mating did occur. © 2016 The Netherlands Entomological Society","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: C.H.

In the present study, we exposed the Hooded oyster Saccostrea cucullata to TBT to investigate histopathological effects and proteome stress response. Animals were exposed to three TBT sub-lethal concentrations, 10, 50 and 150 μg/l for 48 h. TBT produced stress leading to histopathological changes in oyster tissues including mantle, gill, stomach and digestive diverticula. TBT induced mucocyte production in epithelia and hemocyte aggregation in connective tissue. Cell necrosis occurred when exposure dosages were high. Comparative proteome analyses of mantle protein of oysters exposed to 10 μg/l and control animals were analyzed by a 2-DE based proteomic approach. In total, 32 protein spots were found to differ (p < 0.05). Of these, 17 proteins were identified which included 14 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated proteins. TBT induced the expression of proteins involved in defensive mechanisms (HSP-78, HSP-70, aldehyde dehydrogenase and catalase), calcium homeostasis (VDAC-3), cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton-associated proteins, energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Our study revealed that TBT disturbs calcium homeostasis via VDAC-3 protein in mantle and this probably is the key molecular mechanism of TBT acting to distort shell calcification. Moreover, proteins involved in cell structure (tubulin-alpha and tubulin-beta) and protein synthesis were reduced after TBT exposure. Additionally, differential proteins obtained from this work will be useful as potential TBT biomarkers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: S.

The trichlorphon-degrading symbiont Citrobacter freundii (CF-BD) of the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis was recently discovered; however, its intraspecies transmission pathway among flies remains unknown. Here, we use fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), PCR detection, and a series of ingenious experiments to reveal that CF-BD was aggregated in rectal pads associated with the female ovipositor, and the CF-BD symbiont was vertically transmitted via egg surface contamination. Although CF-BD was not detected in ovaries, it was found in deposited eggs. In addition, CF-BD was readily acquired horizontally between larvae or adults via oral uptake, although it was not transferred via mating behavior. Surface sterilization of eggs had a negative effect on the insects, which exhibited a lower body weight and a sharp decrease in fecundity, suggesting important biological roles of CF-BD in the fitness of the host insects. Our findings may also help to explain the high pesticide resistance levels of B. dorsalis. Furthermore, identifying a clear transmission pathway of this organophosphorus-degrading symbiont will be useful for pesticide resistance management and future pest control technologies. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 34; Correspondence Address: G.

Weeds are a major problem in broccoli cultivation. There are still limited information to prevent the yield loss caused by weeds, therefore the herbicide application in broccoli growth were researched. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of several weed control managements to obtain the most effective and efficient weed control in broccoli. Methodology: The research was conducted in Temas Village, Batu Sub-District, East Java (900 m a.s.l) during rainy season, since February until May 2016. This study established using Randomized Block Design consisting of seven treatments with four replications and comprised seven methods of weed control viz: Wy (weedy), Wf (weed free), W15 (weeding at 15 DAT), W15 +30 (weeding at 15 and 30 DAT), O1 + W15 (oxyfluorfen 240 g a.i ha-1 + weeding at 15 DAT), O1.5 (oxyfluorfen 360 g a.i ha-1 ) and O2 (oxyfluorfen 480 g a.i ha-1 ). Data obtained were subjected to an one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 0.05 level, if there is a significance difference will be continued by Fisher's Least Significant Differences (LSD) test at the 0.05 probability level.

Many pesticides are employed on rice crops grown in the Palizada River system, mainly carbofuran, chlorpyrifos, glyphosate, monocrotophos, metomil, edifenfos, benomyl, among others. In order to assess the impact of agricultural activities on human and animal populations from the Palizada River system, mosquito fish (Gambusia yucatana) and black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis) were chosen as bioindicators for the analysis of biomarkers of exposure and effect to pesticides. Farmers and agricultural workers from the communities of El Juncal, Ich-Ek, Suc-Tuc and Castamay were also evaluated because they are exposed to pesticides during application. The integration of information generated in wild fish and exposed in situ reflected a concordance between percentages of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity inhibition during the pesticide application period. Results indicate that whistling ducks are exposed to pesticides (inhibition above 30% of AChE activity), at least during the season of intensive application. All agricultural workers are exposed to dangerous pesticides, and farmers from Suc-Tuc and Ich-Ek have a significant inhibition of AChE activity. It is recommended the use of pesticides that are less aggressive to the environment and human health.

This study aimed to elucidate the effects of chlorothalonil on biochemical biomarkers of oxidative stress in tissues of the fish Danio rerio. To achieve this, animals were exposed for 4 and 7 days, to nominal concentrations of chlorothalonil at 0 mu g/L (DMSO, 0.001%), 0.1 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L, and after the exposure period, the tissues (gills and liver) were removed for biochemical analysis. Antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and enzyme activities, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), were evaluated in both tissues. In addition, the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were also analysed. A significant increase in ROS concentration, ACAP levels, GST and GCL activities and a significant reduction of LPO levels in gills exposed to the highest concentration were observed after 4 days. However, there was a significant reduction of ACAP and CAT activity, as well as a significant increase of GST activity and LPO levels in gills exposed to the lower concentration after 7 days. The liver was less affected, presenting a significant reduction in CAT activity and LPO levels after 4 days. However, a significant increase in SOD activity and LPO levels occurred after 7 days. These results indicate that chlorothalonil, after 4 days, caused activation of the antioxidant defence system in gills of animals exposed to the highest concentration. However, after 7 days, the lowest concentration of this compound caused oxidative stress in this same organ. Also, the results show that gills were more affected than the liver, probably because gills can be involved in chlorothalonil metabolisation. Therefore, it is possible that the liver could be exposed to lower chlorothalonil concentrations or less toxic metabolites due to the metabolism taking place in the gills.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  43,10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105527     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Antioxidant defense system;Biomarkers;Fish;Fungicide;Pesticides;FUNGICIDE CHLOROTHALONIL;BIOLOGICAL-SYSTEMS;SURFACE-WATER;GLUTATHIONE;TOXICITY;2,4,5,6-TETRACHLOROISOPHTHALONITRILE;PESTICIDE;ZEBRAFISH;MECHANISM;ASSAY;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress",NA,NA,chlorothalonil causes redox state change leading to oxidative stress generation in <i>danio rerio<i>

Coastal defense structures such as breakwaters are becoming recognized as large-scale artificial reefs that support abundant and diverse marine communities and play important roles in coastal ecology and management. However, there is limited understanding of how substrate materials used to construct artificial reefs or breakwaters can influence the development of habitat-forming benthic organisms. To assess the influence of substrata on coral recruitment and overall benthic community development, we deployed standard-size tiles of materials used in the construction of break-waters and artificial reefs (concrete, gabbro, granite, and sandstone), along with terra-cotta for comparative purposes, at two breakwaters (DDD, PRT) and two natural reef sites (NR1, NR2) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, for one year. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with post-hoc Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to examine differences in coral recruitment among sites and materials. Coral recruitment was highest at the DDD (4.9 +/- 0.5 recruits 100 cm(-2)), while recruitment was low and did not differ among other sites (PRT: 0.1 +/- 0.04, NR1: 0.3 +/- 0.1, NR2: 0.1 +/- 0.03 recruits 100 cm(-2)). There were significant differences in coral recruitment among materials at DDD, where gabbro had higher recruit densities than concrete and sandstone; sandstone also contained less coral recruits than terra-cotta. Variability associated with low coral recruit densities precluded significant differences among materials at other sites. Overall benthic community structure differed more as a result of differences among sites than among substrate materials. Higher community dissimilarity was observed among sites than among material in SIMPER analysis, and significant differences were only observed among sites in ANOSIM. Univariate comparison of the benthos correlated with community differences in NMS ordination also showed significant differences among sites but not material. Overall, these results indicate that site-specific differences in recruitment patterns are more important in determining early benthic community structure and coral recruitment than are differences among substrate material. However, where coral recruitment is high, these results suggest that gabbro should be used preferentially over concrete or sandstone where it is feasible, but that granite may be a suitable alternative where it is the dominant stone.

Mercury is also delivered to these islands via global atmospheric transport, prevailing ocean currents, and biotransport by migratory species. Mercury contamination of freshwater ecosystems is poorly understood in this region. Total Hg (THg) concentrations were measured in threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) collected from eight lakes at Adak Island, an island in the center of the archipelago with a long military history.

Amphibian larvae are naturally exposed to these pesticides in their aquatic environments located within agricultural areas. We studied the effect of the carbamate carbaryl (CB) and the OP azinphos methyl (AM), compounds extensively used in Northern Patagonian agricultural areas, on reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and the activities of esterases and antioxidant enzymes of the toad Rhinella arenarum larvae. Larvae were exposed 48 h to AM 3 and 6 mg/L or CB 10 and 20 mg/L Cholinesterase and carboxylesterases were strongly inhibited by CB and AM. In insecticide-exposed larvae, carboxylesterases may serve as alternative targets protecting cholinesterase from inhibition. GSH-S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly increased by CB and AM. Superoxide dismutase activity increased in tadpoles exposed to 6 mg/L AM. Conversely, catalase (CAT) was significantly inhibited by both pesticides. GSH levels, GSH reductase and GSH peroxidase activities were not significantly affected by pesticide exposure. GST increase constitutes an important adaptive response to CB and AM exposure, as this enzyme has been related to pesticide tolerance in amphibian larvae. Besides, the ability to sustain GSH levels in spite of CAT inhibition indicates quite a good antioxidant response. In R. arenarum larvae, CAT and GST activities together with esterases could be used as biomarkers of CB and AM exposure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation of tryptophan and methionine on European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) cellular and humoral status. The immunomodulatory effects of tryptophan and methionine during an inflammatory insult was also evaluated after intraperitoneal injection with inactivated Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp).        A practical isonitrogenous (45% crude protein) and isolipidic (16% crude fat) diets was formulated to include fish meal and a blend of plant feedstuffs as protein sources and fish oil as the main lipid source (CRL diet). Two other diets were formulated similar to the control but including L-tryptophan or L-methionine at x2 the requirement level (diets TRP and MET, respectively). European seabass weighing 275 g were fed the experimental diets for a period of 15 days before being sampled (trial 1). Then, fish were subjected to a peritoneal inflammation by intraperitoneally injecting UV killed Phdp (106 colony forming units ml(-1)) and sampled following 4 and 24 h post-injection (trial 2). Fish injected with a saline solution served as control. The haematological profile, peripheral cell dynamics and several plasma immune parameters were determined in trials 1 and 2, whereas cell migration to the inflammatory focus was also determined in trial 2.        MET positively affected European seabass immune status by improving the peripheral leucocyte response, complement activity and bactericidal capacity, a stronger cellular recruitment to the inflammatory focus, and higher plasma peroxidase and bactericidal activities. TRP also seemed to improve immunostimulation, as there was a trend to augment both cell-mediated immunity and humoral capacity. However, TRP failed to improve an inflammatory response, verified by a decrease in blood phagocyte numbers and lack of immune cells recruitment. In summary, it is confirmed that MET has a pronounced influence on the innate immune response to inflammation, which is more evident than TRP, and raises its potential to incorporate in functional feeds to be used in prophylactic strategies against predictable unfavourable events.

In recent decades, the aquaculture sector has experienced a steady growth postulating as a good alternative for seafood production. However, a social debate exits about the differential level of pollutants in wild and farmed species. This study was designed to evaluate the level of pollutants in a sentinel species: Bogue (Boops boops) associated and non-associated to fish-farm cages. A total of 82 chemical substances were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, including persistent (polychlotobiphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCP5)), semi-persistent (bromodiphenyl ethers (BDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), and emerging pollutants (such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and UV-filters). In general, aquaculture-associated bogues showed lower levels of semi-persistent and emerging pollutants than wild-caught fish, especially when sums were considered. Thus, sum of BDEs was significantly lower in the aquaculture group (p = 0.01). A similar trend was also observed for benzo(a)anthracene, the UV-filter 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate and some OPFRs. In the case of persistent pollutants, the sum of dioxin-like PCBs and sum of DDTs were lower in the group of wild-caught bogues (p = 0.034 and p = 0.003, respectively) than in aquaculture-associated bogues, as previously described for some aquaculture species. Fish feed appear as an important factor in the uptake of such substances suggesting a diet intervention to reduce their levels in the aquaculture products. Another interesting result is that for almost all chemical substances analyzed, bogues captured near sewage outfalls showed the highest levels of pollutants, pointing out the need of stringent measures for wastewater treatment units discharging in coastal areas. On the light of these results, further research in specific farmed and wild fish species in relation to their dietary value and pollutant's levels seems to be mandatory.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  82,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.12.107     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Aquaculture;Persistent organic pollutants;Emerging pollutants;Organophosphorus flame retardants;Sunscreen;Chlorpyrifos;POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS;POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS;ORGANOPHOSPHORUS FLAME RETARDANTS;FARMED ATLANTIC SALMON;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS;ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES;ORGANIC POLLUTANTS;SEA-TURTLES;HALOGENATED COMPOUNDS;AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT;Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia,NA,NA,comparative analysis of selected semipersistent and emerging pollutants in wildcaught fish and aquaculture associated fish using bogue <i>boops boops<i> as sentinel species

Although the regulon that these factors control is known in many bacteria, similar data are not available for Klebsiella pneumoniae. To address this data gap, oxidative stress was artificially induced in K. pneumoniae MGH78578 using paraquat and the corresponding oxidative stress regulon recorded using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). The soxS gene was significantly induced during oxidative stress, and a knockout mutant was constructed to explore its functionality. The wild type and mutant were grown in the presence of paraquat and subjected to RNA-seq to elucidate the soxS regulon in K. pneumoniae MGH78578. Genes that are commonly regulated both in the oxidative stress and soxS regulons were identified and denoted as the oxidative SoxS regulon; these included a group of genes specifically regulated by SoxS. Efflux pump-encoding genes and global regulators were identified as part of this regulon. Consequently, the isogenic soxS mutant was found to exhibit a reduction in the minimum bactericidal concentration against tetracycline compared to that of the wild type. Impaired efflux activity, allowing tetracycline to be accumulated in the cytoplasm to bactericidal levels, was further evaluated using a tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP1) accumulation assay. The soxS mutant was also susceptible to tetracycline in vivo in a zebrafish embryo model. We conclude that the soxS gene could be considered a genetic target against which an inhibitor could be developed and used in combinatorial therapy to combat infections associated with multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae.

Azinphos-methyl has been found in water from this region throughout the year at a maximum concentration of 22.48 mu g L-1 during the application period. Toxicological studies on local non-target species have been performed mostly on vertebrates, while mollusks, which could be more sensitive, have not been studied so far. This work aims to characterize cholinesterase (ChE) and carboxilesterase (CE) activities of Chilina gibbosa, a freshwater gastropod native to southern Argentina and Chile. These enzymes, together with neurotoxicity signals, are evaluated herein after as sensitive biomarkers of exposure to azinphos-methyl at environmentally relevant concentrations. Effects of azinphos-methyl on antioxidant defenses: glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) are also studied in order to complete a set of biomarkers with different sensitivity and specificity, to propose C. gibbosa as a sentinel species. The highest specific activity was obtained with acetylthiocholine as substrate, followed by propionylthiocholine (83% in comparison to acetylthiocholine) and butyrylthiocholine (19%). The lowest K-m and the highest efficiency for ChE were obtained with acetylthiocholine. Regarding CEs activities, a higher efficiency was obtained with p-nitrophenyl butyrate than with p-nitrophenyl acetate. Eserine produced significant inhibition of ChE activity (81% with 0.001 mM and 98% with 1 mM) while iso-OMPA did not produce any significant effect on ChE. Our results show that C. gibbosa ChE is very sensitive to azinphos-methyl (CI50 0.02 mu g L-1) while CEs are inhibited at higher concentrations (CI50 1000 mu g L-1). CEs have been reported to be more sensitive to OPs than ChEs in most of the aquatic invertebrates protecting the organisms from neurotoxic effects. In contrast, C gibbosa, has ChE which are much more sensitive to azinphos-methyl than CEs and shows marked signs of neurotoxicity. Regarding antioxidant defenses, GSH levels were significantly increased by 0.02 and 20 mu g L-1 azinphos-methyl (80 and 103%, respectively), CAT activity was increased 85% only at 0.02 mu g L-1 and SOD and GST did not show any significant response. Since ChE activity, neurotoxicity signs, GSH and CAT are sensitive biomarkers of acute exposure to azinphos-methyl at environmental concentrations C. gibbosa could be included as sentinel species in monitoring programs of pesticide hazard in regions of Argentina and Chile.

Debates regarding the need to control aquatic plants, how Much vegetation to control and where, and the herbicides chosen can be divisive. This paper will focus on the use patterns and technical features of aquatic herbicides and factors that Should be considered when implementing a herbicide program for aquatic plant management in reservoirs. Both the angling community and general public often have misconceptions regarding herbicide use patterns, plant selectivity and nontarget impacts, and management objectives. There are currently 10 herbicide active ingredients registered for aquatic use. Glyphosate and imazapyr are used strictly for emergent aquatic plant control while copper, endothall, and fluridone are used almost exclusively for submersed plant control. The herbicides diquat, carfentrazone, penoxsulam, triclopyr, and 2,4-D are used for both emergent and submersed plant control. Many of the registered herbicides have been used since the 1950s and 1960s for aquatic plant management. Each compound has unique properties that impact the recommended use rates and use patterns, label restrictions, and plant selectivity. There are also several new herbicides that are Currently being evaluated for aquatic plants. While herbicides are used in a wide variety of aquatic systems, reservoirs often present unique challenges due to high-flow events and vegetation growing in narrow strips along the shoreline or in open flats. Rapid dilution or dispersion of the herbicide from the target area remains a significant technical challenge in reservoirs. The introduction of invasive plants Such as hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata and Eurasian watermilfoil Myriophyllum spicatum has increased the complexity of management decisions. These fast-growing submersed species can be viewed as both beneficial and detrimental to various reservoir systems. While some see these plants as invasive species that require management, others see them as providing valuable habitat in systems with limited native vegetation. Despite both social and environmental challenges, aquatic herbicides continue to provide reliable, relatively rapid results and site-specific aquatic plant management at a wide variety of scales.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  55,,SPECIES SELECTIVITY EVALUATION;LAKE FLURIDONE TREATMENTS;EURASIAN WATERMILFOIL;LARGEMOUTH BASS;POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS;MESOCOSM EVALUATION;PLANT COMMUNITY;ENDOTHALL;SEMINOLE;HYDRILLA;Vegetables,NA,NA,the use of herbicides for managing aquatic vegetation in southern reservoirs

The experiment was conducted randomly with two treatments: control and TCF (0.5 mg L-1). No mortality or changes in hematological profile were recorded for the fish. On the other hand, we found that TCF exposure caused behavioral, metabolic and hormonal changes that modified the response patterns of the immune and enzymatic defense system in muscle and liver tissues. Increased plasma cortisol and glucose combined with the reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle and liver tissue after 96-h of TCF exposure indicates chemical stress. In response to this harmful situation, we observed changes in the immune system that lead to an increased number of leukocytes, thrombocytes, monocytes, lysozyme and leukocyte respiratory burst activity. Furthermore, we associate the increased activity of glutathione-S-transferase in liver tissue as a strategy fish use to combat the effects of TCF. Thus, we conclude that TCF affects the physiologic parameters of Nile tilapia, which can generate irreversible situations of recovery of the clinical condition. Such fact highlights the need to search for new compounds that could replace TCF, that have no or few adverse effects on fish species.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.22034/IAR.2020.1904943.1071     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Aquaculture;Toxicology;Chemotherapy;Trichlorfon;LEUKOCYTES RESPIRATORY BURST;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;OXIDATIVE STRESS;INNATE IMMUNITY;COMMON CARP;FISH;DIAZINON;GLUTATHIONE;LYSOZYME;AQUACULTURE,NA,NA,physiological and biochemical responses of nile tilapia <i>oreochromis niloticus<i> to acute trichlorfon exposure

Four mechanistic models, including biomass conversion, digestion or gastrointestinal magnification, micelle-mediated diffusion, and fat-flush diffusion, are evaluated. The models contain many similarities and represent an evolution in understanding of chemical bioaccumulation processes. An important difference between the biomagnification models is whether intestinal absorption of an ingested contaminant occurs solely via passive molecular diffusion through serial resistances or via facilitated diffusion that incorporates an additional advective transport mechanism in parallel (i.e., molecular ferrying within gastrointestinal micelles). This difference has an effect on the selection of physicochemical properties that best anticipate the bioaccumulative potential of commercial chemicals in aquatic and terrestrial food chains. Current regulatory initiatives utilizing K-OW threshold criteria to assess chemical bioaccumulation potential are shown to be unable to identify certain bioaccumulative substances in air-breathing animals.

Our objectives were to: (1) characterize littoral zone macroinvertebrate communities in surface mine lakes; (2) identify factors that influence macroinvertebrate diversity and community structure; and (3) examine the utility of some commonly used bioassessment metrics to assess habitat quality based on macroinvertebrates. Fourteen lakes on a 1133 ha parcel in southern Illinois were sampled in spring 2003 using a dip net that was swept over two (small lakes) or three (large lakes) littoral zone transects. Three hundred macroinvertebrates were randomly removed from each sample and identified. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to examine relationships between several physicochemical and biological variables and macroinvertebrates. Oligochaetes were typically the most abundant taxon, followed by Hyalella, Chironomidae, Physella and Caenis. Seventy percent of the macroinvertebrates collected from the lakes were predators, while collector-gatherers and scrapers constituted 20% and 9%, respectively. Macroinvertebrate richness was positively related to sunfish abundance and macrophyte cover (R-2 = 0.91, P = 0.001). Simpson diversity was positively related to lake area, percent rock and gravel substrates and simazine concentration and negatively related to bank slope and transparency (R-2 = 0.92, P = 0.0003). Richness and diversity metrics, % Oligochaeta, % Chironomidae, % insect taxa and % dominance varied across lakes, while a Hilsenhoff index and the EPT index appeared less useful for biological assessments in these habitats.

Currently, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying E. piscicida-host cross-talk remain obscure. In this study, we revealed that E. piscicida could increase microtubule-associated protein L chain 3 (LC3) puncta in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) monocytes/macrophages and a carp cell line, Epithelioma papulosum cyprini. The autophagic response was confirmed by detecting the colocalization of E. piscicida with LC3-positive autophagosomes and LysoTracker-probed lysosomes in the cells. Moreover, we unveiled the autophagic machinery targeting E. piscicida by which the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptor 1 (NOD1) functioned as an intracellular sensor to interact and recruit autophagy-related gene (ATG) 16L1 to the bacteria. Meanwhile, E. piscicida decreased the mRNA and protein levels of NOD1 and ATG16L1 in an estrogen-related receptora-dependent manner, suggesting a possible mechanism for this bacterium escaping autophagy. Subsequently, we examined the effects of various E. piscicida virulence factors on NOD1 expression and found that two of them, EVPC and ESCB, could reduce NOD1 protein expression via ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, an intrinsic regulator IFN-gamma was found to enhance the colocalization of E. piscicida with NOD1 or autophagosomes, suggesting its involvement in the interaction between autophagy and E. piscicida. Along this line, a short-time treatment of IFN-gamma caused intracellular E. piscicida clearance through an autophagy-dependent mechanism.

In previous studies we have demonstrated the importance of the glutathione (GSH) metabolism in the resistance of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) to thiocarbamate herbicides. The present work studied the effects of the antioxidant and glutathione pro-drug N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) on the survival of a natural population of A. anguilla exposed to a lethal concentration of dichlorvos, focusing on the glutathione metabolism and the enzyme activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and caspase-3 as biomarkers of neurotoxicity and induction of apoptosis, respectively. Fish pre-treated with NAC (I mmol kg(-1), i.p.) and exposed to 1.5 mg l(-1) (the 96-h LC85) of dichlorvos for 96 It in a static-renewal system achieved an increase of the GSH content, GSH/GSSG ratio, hepatic glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutamate:cysteine ligase (GCL), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (gammaGT) activities, which ameliorated the glutathione loss and oxidation, and enzyme inactivation, caused by the OP pesticide. Although NAC-treated fish presented a higher survival and were two-fold less likely to die within the study period of 96 h, Cox proportional hazard models showed that hepatic GSH/GSSG ratio was the best explanatory variable related to survival. Hence, tolerance to a lethal concentration of dichlorvos can be explained by the individual capacity to maintain and improve the hepatic glutathione redox status. Impairment of the,GSH/GSSG ratio can lead to excessive oxidative stress and inhibition of caspase-3-like activity, inducing cell death by necrosis, and, ultimately, resulting in the death of the organism. We therefore propose a reconsideration of the individual effective dose or individual tolerance concept postulated by Gaddum 50 years ago for the log-normal dose-response relationship. In addition, as NAC increased the tolerance to dichlorvos, it could be a potential antidote for OP poisoning, complementary to current treatments. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Non-specific humoral factors include growth inhibiting substances, e.g. transferrin and antiproteases; lysins, e.g. lysozyme, C-reactive protein (CRP), bactericidal peptides and most importantly, complement which has lytic, proinflammatory, chemotactic and opsonic activities thus making a link with non-specific phagocyte responses. These are primarily executed by neutrophils and macrophages. The phagocytes contain many hydrolytic enzymes and when stimulated by bacteria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the hydroxyl radical, via generation of superoxide anions and nitric oxide. ROS are highly bactericidal. In addition, the neutrophils possess large quantities of myeloperoxidase (MPO) which generates bactericidal hypohalite ions from halide ions and H2O2. Macrophages can receive MPO from neutrophils and this may enhance their bactericidal activity. Antibody constitutes a specific humoral defence by inhibiting bacterial adherence or invasion of non-phagocytic host cells and neutralising bacterial toxins. Antibody can act as an opsonin and by activating complement by the classical pathway may lyse the bacterial cell, activate inflammation, phagocyte influx and further enhance phagocytosis. Macrophage bactericidal activity can be markedly increased by cytokines released by T lymphocytes on contact with their specific antigen. Pathogenic bacteria have evolved many ways of subverting these defence mechanisms of fish. These include the in vivo production of high affinity iron uptake systems (e.g. siderophores and their surface receptors, in Aeromonas salmonicida, Vibrio anguillarum). Some bacteria e.g. V. anguillarum strains of serotype 01, while being resistant to the alternative pathway of complement activation in normal serum, are killed in immune serum. In other bacteria, surface layers, capsules and elongated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 0-antigens protect against classical complement-mediated killing (e.g. A. salmonicida, Photobacterium piscicida, V. anguillarum serotype 02 respectively). While some important pathogens (e.g. P. piscicide)are readily killed by macrophages, others (A. salmonicida) possess specialised superoxide dismutase and catalase to resist ROS and are toxic themselves to macrophages. Renibacterium salmoninarum uses antibody, complement and other serum components to activate the respiratory burst of macrophages on immediate contact thus exhausting this macrophage bactericidal mechanism before the bacterium is phagocytosed. Subsequently, R, salmoninarum is taken up by the macrophage where it multiplies as an intracellular pathogen. However, these two highly adapted pathogens, A. salmonicida and R. salmoninarum are both killed by activated macrophages indicating that the whole concerted efforts of specific and non-specific, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are required for immunity against these two important pathogens.

In gills MDA increased showing oxidative damage probably because of an inefficient antioxidant defense. This response evidenced the important role of gills as an organ of direct contact with waterborne contaminants.

Both compounds are nonionic surfactants produced by the alkoxylation of ethylene oxide with tallow amine, and they are used in variety of industries such as textiles, paints, metal working, agriculture, and polish manufacture. Fish were exposed to six concentrations of TA15 (0.2-4.0 mg/L) or TH30 (8-140 mg/L) for 96 h. The LC50 for TA15 was 2.08 mg/L and for TH30 47.32 mg/L. The main clinical signs observed in fish exposed to 4 mg/L of TA15 and 32 to 140 mg/L of TH30, were lethargy, loss of shoaling behavior, respiratory distress, changes in swimming pattern, such as, loss of balance and abnormal buoyancy, prolapse of the lower lip and superior location in the water column. The highest concentrations of these compounds induced nervous signs and collapse. The relevant macroscopic lesions were skin and fins erosions with necrotic lysis of the caudal peduncle. In addition, hemorrhages in mouth, branchial arches, and petechial hemorrhages in skin were observed. An increased fluid in the celomic cavity and meningeal hemorrhages were also evident. Organs as gills, liver, brain, and anterior kidney presented severe lesions at the highest concentrations of each compound. For the first time, it is reported lesions in interrenal tissues and choroidal bodies, as well as severe telencephalic lesions associated with the POEA toxicity. These last lesions were more severe in fish exposed to TA15 than to TH30, although the pattern of injuries was similar with both substances. According to the Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemical (GHS) by the United Nations, we reported that TA15 is classified as Acute Category 2 and TH30 is Acute Category 3 for white cachama.

The gills of the fish are the primary corridor for molecular exchange between the internal milieu of a fish and its environment. Gills perform numerous functions such as oxygen uptake and CO excretion, osmoregulation, acid-basic balance, excretion of nitrogenous compounds and taste. Hazardous chemicals present in water may alter the morphology of the epithelial cells of gills of the fish, which may affect the process of diffusion of gases and ultimately the overall health of the fish. To prove this fact Cyprinus carpio communis Linn. was kept in water for 30 days having low concentration of 0.038 ppm (1\10(th) of LC50) of monocrotophos and an attempt was made to study the different types of degenerations produced in the epithelial cells of gills as compared to the normal epithelial cells of gills of this culturable fish using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) technique. The ultrastructural changes due to the toxic exposure at finerscale were thinning of microridges, upliftment of epithelial cells, development of hyperplasia, decrease in the density of mucous cells which are considered to be the first line of defence and total dystrophy of epithelial tissue. Thus, it is opined that a low concentration of monocrotophos has the potential to bring different type of degenerations at finer scale hence affecting the fish's health drastically and altering the fitness of the fish in water even having insignificant amount of this toxicant in the ambient water.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  20,,Cyprinus carpio communis Linn.;epithelial cells;gills;monocrotophos;SEM;FRESH-WATER FISH;CHLORPYRIFOS;Epithelial Cells,NA,NA,impact of low dose of organophosphate monocrotophos on the epithelial cells of gills of <i>cyprinus carpio communis<i> linn sem study

Basic information on the developmental and reproductive performance of the predator as a function of food is largely lacking. In the present study, development, reproduction and growth rates were determined for A. limonicus on four economically important pests: Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), broad mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) (Acari: Tarsonemidae) and two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). The life history traits of females fed on these different target prey were compared with those of females offered Carpoglyphus lactis L. (Acari: Carpoglyphidae), which is the standard food source for mass-producing this predator. Additionally, three commercially available non-prey food sources with potential for use in the mass production or as supplementary food to sustain populations of the predator in the field were tested: the commercial pollen product Nutrimite (consisting of pollen of narrow-leaved cattail, Typha angustifolia L.), frozen eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and frozen eggs of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann (Diptera: Tephritidae). Survival rates of immature A. limonicus were high (>94% survival) on all tested foods except on T. vaporariorum and T. urticae (76.0% and 17.1%, respectively). The fastest development was obtained when mites were fed on T. angustifolia, whereas the longest developmental times were obtained on T. urticae and T. vaporariorum. When females were offered P. latus, no reproduction was observed, despite a high prey consumption in both the juvenile and adult stages. The reproductive performance of A. limonicus fed on T. vaporariorum was significantly lower than that on F. occidentalis. Furthermore, no second generation could be obtained on a diet solely consisting of T. vaporariorum. Population growth rates were highest when A. limonicus was fed on Nutrimite, E. kuehniella or C lactis, and exceeded those on a diet consisting of their natural prey, F. occidentalis. The phytoseiid showed cannibalistic behavior when maintained on E. kuehniella and C. capitata eggs and T. angustifolia pollen, with females consuming their own eggs. The rate of cannibalism was dependent on the food source offered, but always resulted in reduced population growth rates. This cannibalistic behavior should be taken into account when selecting food sources for mass rearing of A. limonicus or supporting its populations in the field. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Oxidative stress in other organisms is associated with aging as well as with periods of rapid growth, which occurs in young brown trout. We measured protein carbonyls, 20S proteosome activity and glutathione (GSH) levels in farmed Salmo trutta in four different age groups from 5 months to 3 years. We found an increase in protein carbonyls and a decrease in 20S proteosome activity in both brain and liver tissues of the fish with increasing size and age. Total GSH levels in liver tissue declined as fish aged and the GSSG:GSH ratio increased. Five month and 1 year old trout were treated with paraquat (PQ) to induce oxidative stress. Five month old fish showed no changes in the measured parameters while 1 year old fish had both an increase in protein carbonylation in liver tissue and a decrease in 20S proteosome activity in brain tissue. These results indicate that oxidative stress biomarkers are affected by age or rapid growth in brown trout, and that individuals of different ages respond differently to oxidative stress induced by PQ.

A synthetic pyrethroid, cypermethrin, is licensed for use on fish farms to control sea lice infestations as a formulation called Excis((R)). In this study, uptake of cypermethrin from Exci((R)) exposure is investigated through the use of gas chromatography with mass-spectrometry. The effects of Excis((R)) on mussels are also examined by measuring the neutral red retention time of lysosomes, aerial survival and shell closure. The isomeric ratios of cis:trans cypermethrin measured in mussels are around 80:20; a marked increase from 40:60 to which the mussels were exposed. This is most likely due to preferential metabolism of trans-isomers, as the same response is seen in vertebrates. There is a pronounced behavioural effect of shell closure, where mussels exposed to 1000 mug/l cypermethrin shut their shells within an hour of exposure. Arguments are presented for this effect being either a voluntary response on recognition of cypermethrin, or an effect arising from an involuntary action of cypermethrin on the adductor muscle. Even at 1000 mug/l cypermethrin, neutral red retention time and aerial survival are not affected. The data suggest that the responses of mussels shown here are unlikely to occur in the field, even at the concentrations of cypermethrin used in fish cages, for the treatment of sea lice.

Methods This review draws on research projects conducted in partnership with the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation living along the St. Lawrence River as well as published research by others on water contamination at Akwesasne. Quantitative and qualitative methods including toxicological and epidemiological methods, surveys, and ethnographic studies are included. Results Pollution of a river with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) contaminated local fish, a major, traditional, food source. Following health advisories to avoid consuming local fish, consumption and PCB levels decreased. PCB levels were negatively associated with health outcomes. In adolescents, higher PCB levels were associated with advanced sexual maturation in females, reduced testosterone in males and reduced thyroxine levels in young adults. Avoiding fish consumption altered traditional dietary patterns and social interactions, generational transmission of knowledge, and relations between generations, all of which impacted cultural forms and may have added to the perceived injustices in this Native American community. Items substituted for fish may have contributed to increasing rates of obesity as well.

The main goal of our study was to evaluate if variations in the water quality of Suquia river basin affect the reproductive biology of Cnesterodon decemmaculatus and determine if the responses provided by the species can be considered as biomarkers of river quality. This assessment was performed through the measurement of morphological, histological and somatic parameters in adult males collected at four sampling sites during the beginning and the end of the breeding season. The water quality evaluation carried out through the estimation of a water quality index (WQI) and pesticides concentrations in water, revealed a pollution gradient along the studied basin. The same variation pattern was registered for the somatic index. In addition, the analysis of the morphology of the male copulatory organ (gonopodium) showed that individuals collected at Cordoba city had the lowest Gonopodium-Somatic Index (Gonop-SI) value, while those sampled at the most polluted site showed abnormalities in the small structures of the gonopodium. On the other hand, few histological alterations were found in the liver whereas no alterations were found in gonads along the river. The results obtained allowed us to characterize the environmental conditions of the studied basin and demonstrated the water quality deterioration along the Suquia River. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The lack of research into simultaneous use of antibiotic and immunomodulation in the Acipenseridae has created the need for effective methods of prevention and treatment of the diseases affecting these species, especially in relation to intensive rearing and breeding with adapted technologies. The Siberian sturgeons administered oxytetracycline intraperitoneally @ 100 mg/kg BW and 24 hours post-injection the fish were immersed in lysozyme dimer @ 100 mu g/l water for 30 minutes. The impact of oxytetracycline used together with or separately from lysozyme dimer on the morphology of head kidney in Siberian sturgeon was determined. The results of microscopic evaluation of this organ revealed the formation of morphological lesions resulting from the administration of the antibiotic: hyperaemia and regressive lesions in the epithelium of renal tubules - parenchymatous and vacuolar degeneration, necrosis and hyaline casts in the lumen of renal tubules. The domination of hematopoietic cells over lymphocytes, necrosis of hematopoietic cells, proliferation of lymphoid cells, presence of melano-macrophages and less-frequent macrophages were observed.

Although sophisticated techniques such as chromatography and spectrometry provide more accurate and conclusive results, screening tests allow a much higher throughput of samples at a lower cost and with less operator training, so larger numbers of samples can be analysed. Biosensors combine a biological recognition element (enzyme, antibody, receptor) with a transducer to produce a measurable signal proportional to the extent of interaction between the recognition element and the analyte. The different uses of the biosensing instrumentation available today are extremely varied, with food analysis as an emerging and growing application. The advantages offered by biosensors over other screening methods such as radioimmunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, fluorescence immunoassay and luminescence immunoassay, with respect to food analysis, include automation, improved reproducibility, speed of analysis and real-time analysis. This article will provide a brief footing in history before reviewing the latest developments in biosensor applications for analysis of food contaminants (January 2007 to December 2010), focusing on the detection of pathogens, toxins, pesticides and veterinary drug residues by biosensors, with emphasis on articles showing data in food matrices. The main areas of development common to these groups of contaminants include multiplexing, the ability to simultaneously analyse a sample for more than one contaminant and portability.

Tritici) are two of the most prevalent and serious winter wheat diseases in the field, which caused heavy yield loss of winter wheat all over the world. It is necessary to quantitatively identify different diseases for spraying specific fungicides. This study examined the potential of quantitative distinction of powdery mildew and yellow rust by using hyperspectral data with continuous wavelet transform at canopy level. Spectral normalization was processing prior to other data analysis, given the differences of the groups in cultivars and soil environment. Then, continuous wavelet features were extracted from normalized spectral bands using continuous wavelet transform. Correlation analysis and independent t-test were used conjunctively to obtain sensitive spectral bands and continuous wavelet features of 350~1 300 nm, and then, principal component analysis was done to eliminate the redundancy of the spectral features. After that, Fisher linear discriminant models of powdery mildew, stripe rust and normal sample were built based on the principal components of SBs, WFs, and the combination of SBs & WFs, respectively. Finally, the methods of leave-one-out and 55 samples which have no share in model building were used to validate the models. The accuracies of classification were analyzed, it was indicated that the overall accuracies with 92.7% and 90.4% of the models based on WFs, were superior to those of SFs with 65.5% and 61.5%; However, the classification accuracies of Fisher 80-55 were higher but no different than leave-one-out cross validation model, which was possibly related to randomness of training samples selection. The overall accuracies with 94.6% and 91.1% of the models based on SBs & WFs were the highest; The producer' accuracies of powdery mildew and healthy samples based on SBs & WFs were improved more than 10% than those of WFs in Fisher 80-55. Focusing on the discriminant accuracy of different disease, yellow rust can be discriminated in the model based on both WFs and SBs & WFs with higher accuracy; the user' accuracy and producer' accuracy were all up to 100%. The results show great potential of continuous wavelet features in discriminating different disease stresses, and provide theoretical basis for crop disease identification in wide range using remote sensing image. © 2016, Peking University Press.

Specifically, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has the third highest estimated burden of foodborne diseases per population, after the African and South-East Asia regions. However, it is difficult to determine what the burden is since little is published in peer-reviewed journals or government reports for public access. This chapter reviews 16 autonomous nations, namely, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia (KSA), Syrian Arab Republic (Syria), United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen. Countries range in size from Bahrain with 1.8 million inhabitants to Pakistan with a population of 184 million. Agriculture and local food production is much influenced by water availability for irrigation. Water shortages are most severe in the Gulf countries which rely on aquifers, desalination, and recycled waste water for most of their water supplies. This means that most food is imported which is expensive if not subsidized through petrodollars. This impacts food security which is a particular concern in countries under conflict, particularly, Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Gastrointestinal infections are frequent in this region from Salmonella Typhi and other Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, rotavirus, hepatitis A virus, parasites, and more rarely from Aeromonas, Yersinia enterocolitica, Brucella spp., and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Reports indicate that children are the most susceptible and that many isolates are multidrug resistant. Chemical contamination of water supplies and crops are probably more of a concern than published reports indicate, because of widespread indiscriminate use of fertilizers, antibiotics, and pesticides, coupled with increased industrial pollution affecting the water supplies. Like many other parts of the developing world, foodborne disease surveillance is limited and outbreaks are most often reported through the Press but with insufficient detail to determine the etiological agents and the factors contributing to the outbreaks, leading to speculation to the cause by those interested or responsible for food prevention and control. However, there are some well investigated outbreaks in the region that have those details, and reveal where the shortcomings of both the establishments and the inspection systems have been. Where the causative agents are known, the kinds of pathogens are generally similar to those found in the West, e.g., Salmonella, but many outbreaks seem to have short incubation periods that point to a toxin of some kind of chemical or biological origin, but these are almost never identified. Because of sectarian warfare, residents and refugees have been given food that has made them sick and solders? have been deliberately poisoned. Research has been focused on microbial contamination of locally-sold foodstuffs and manager and employee knowledge of food safety and hygienic conditions in food preparation establishments. An innovative pilot project in Qatar is to use seawater and sunlight for raising crops through the Sahara Forest Project. All countries have some kind of food establishment inspection system, but they tend to be punitive if faults are found in management or employees on the premises rather than being used for their education for improving food safety. Restaurants may be closed down and owners and employees fined for often unspecified infringements. However, some food control agents are moving towards employee training through seminars and courses before problems occur, which is a good disease prevention strategy. Unfortunately, many of the food handlers are from Asian countries with languages other than Arabic and English, which makes effective food safety communication and training difficult. Tourists visiting popular resorts in Turkey and Egypt have suffered from foodborne illnesses, usually of unknown origin but poor hygienic conditions are blamed with law suits following, and the adverse publicity affects the long-term viability of some of these resorts. Food exports, important for local economies, have occasionally been contaminated resulting in recalls and sometimes illnesses and deaths, notably fenugreek seeds from Egypt (E. coli O104:H4), pomegranate arils from Turkey (hepatitis A virus), and tahini from Lebanon (Salmonella). Overall, in recent decades, the Middle East has made strides towards improving food safety for both residents and foreign visitors or ex-pat workers. However, within the countries there are large discrepancies in the extent of effective public health oversight including food safety and food security. Currently, almost all of the countries are involved to a greater or lesser extent in the civil wars in Syria and Yemen, or are affected through political tensions and strife in Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Turkey.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate POPs burden, and its determinants, in a population at high risk of suffering CVD enrolled in the PREDIMED Study (Spanish acronym for PREvention by means of MEDiterranean Diet). This cohort was formed by 343 participants (55–80 y.o.), which were selected for a preventive nutritional intervention for CVD based on the Mediterranean Diet. Relevant information on demographic, behavioral, dietary, and socioeconomic characteristics was obtained from each participant through a specific questionnaire, and their anthropometric and clinical measurements were recorded. In addition, the levels of 35 POPs were determined in serum samples taken before the beginning of the nutritional intervention. All the samples showed detectable levels of, at least, one POP, being DDT-derivatives and marker-PCBs the most frequently detected compounds. Our results showed that people at high risk for CVD showed a higher level of contamination by POPs as compared to other studies done in cohorts of Western people at no special risk of CVD. Although educational level seems to be a relevant determinant for POPs burden in our population, the main determining factor seems to be the diet. Thus, while the intake of food of animal origin was significantly associated with levels of PCBs, especially in men, the intake of vegetal-origin food was positively related to levels of organochlorine pesticides, indicating a different dietary source for these two groups of chemicals. Our results showing that subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease present elevated POPs burden might have a relevant public health impact given the generalized and difficult to avoid exposure to POPs and the elevated worldwide frequency of the CVD. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 29; CODEN: ENVRA,10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.053,"Canary Islands;Cardiovascular disease;Dietary habits;Persistent organic pollutants;PREDIMED;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cardiovascular Diseases;Diet, Mediterranean;Environmental Exposure;Environmental Pollutants;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Risk;Spain;Animalia;1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethane;1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene;1,1,1 trichloro 2 (2 chlorophenyl) 2 (4 chlorophenyl)ethane;aldrin;alpha hexachlorocyclohexane;beta hexachlorocyclohexane;chlorphenotane;cholesterol;delta hexachlorocyclohexane;dieldrin;endosulfan;endrin;gama hexachlorocyclohexane;hexachlorobencene;hexachlorobenzene;hexachlorocyclohexane;mitotane;o,p' dde;olive oil;organochlorine derivative;organochlorine pesticide;polychlorinated biphenyl derivative;triacylglycerol;unclassified drug;pollutant;cardiovascular disease;demography;diet;disease incidence;food intake;health impact;health risk;persistent organic pollutant;public health;questionnaire survey;serum;adult;aged;anthropometry;Article;bakery product;biscuit;blood level;cardiovascular risk;cereal;cholesterol blood level;clinical evaluation;cohort analysis;controlled study;dairy product;dietary intake;educational status;female;fish product;fruit;high risk population;human;legume;major clinical study;male;meat;Mediterranean diet;middle aged;multicenter study (topic);nut;primary prevention;priority journal;quality control;randomized controlled trial (topic);sex difference;smoking;social status;triacylglycerol blood level;vegetable;wine;blood;chemically induced;environmental exposure;risk;very elderly",NA,NA,determinants of increasing serum pops in a population at high risk for cardiovascular disease results from the predimedcanarias study

Simultaneously, attention is drawn to infectious or environmental threats against which appropriately composed immunoprophylaxis can be used in production cycles. Fish culture is intensifying in Poland and globally, which means that the role of prevention and well-designed prophylaxis is of increasing significance to the prevention and treatment of fish diseases. Currently, 33 fish species are cultured in Poland as stocking material or for production. The primary methods for preventing diseases in controlled fish culture are ensuring the welfare of fish and other prophylactic methods, including immunoprophylaxis. Many infectious and non-infectious threats that can cause direct losses and limit fish culture are present in the aquatic environment. Fish diseases generally stem from the simultaneous action of many factors that coincide and are difficult to distinguish. Pesticides (organochlorine insecticides, organophosphorus herbicides), aromatic hydrocarbons, pentachlorophenol, heavy metals, and chemotherapeutics are particularly toxic to fish. Biodegradation, which is continual in aquatic environments, is a process by which toxic and other substances that negatively affect fish become bioavailable and impact the immune system, the functioning of which is a specific bioindicator of environmental quality. Innate immunity plays a key role in the defense against disadvantageous factors, which also include pathogens. Immunomodulation methods can protect resistance mechanisms, thereby increasing disease prevention and treatment in controlled fish culture. © 2016 Author(s). © Copyright by Stanisław Sakowicz Inland Fisheries Institute in Olsztyn.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: E.

Females exposed to Thiodan® were divided into four treatments: (i) without acclimation and without food, (ii) without acclimation and with food, (iii) with acclimation for 10 days and without food; (iv) with acclimation for 10 days and with food. In this study, it was noted that the action of Thiodan® at sub-lethal concentrations in a static system did not affect the morphology of follicular development. However, the treatments with acclimation showed lower numbers of primary and secondary follicles when compared to fish from treatments without acclimation. For the groups exposed to Thiodan®, a greater number of atretic follicles were observed compared to the control groups. The follicular diameter of secondary follicles in fish exposed to Thiodan® in the treatment with acclimation and with food was highest in the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the mean gonadosomatic (GSI) and hepatosomatic (HSI) indices of treatments with acclimation were lower than those for treatments without acclimation.

South Africa is also one of few countries to still actively spray DDT as malaria vector control. The aim of the study was to determine the degree to which aquatic biota in selected rivers of the world renowned Kruger National Park (KNP) are exposed to by use of OCPs in the catchments outside the KNP and how this exposure relates to human health. Tigerfish (Hydrocynus vittatus) are economically important apex predators and was selected as bioindicator for this study. Fish were sampled from the KNP sections of the Luvuvhu, Letaba and Olifants rivers during the high and low flow periods from 2010 to 2011 within the KNP and 19 OCPs were determined in muscle tissue using GC-ECD techniques. Significant flow related and spatial OCP bioaccumulation was observed. Tigerfish from the Luvuvhu River displayed the highest OCP bioaccumulation. Concentrations of the majority of the OCPs including the DDTs were the highest levels ever recorded from South African freshwater systems and in many cases the concentrations were higher than most contaminated areas from around the world. The concentrations found in H. vittatus muscle also exceeded maximum residue levels in edible fat as set by the European Union. The health risk assessment also demonstrated that the levels of OCPs pose very high cancer risks to the local populations consuming tigerfish, as high as 2 in 10 increased risk factor. This is of concern not only when managing the water resources of the conservation area but also for surrounding communities consuming freshwater fish.

The most commonly seen DHL is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with t(14;18) and t(8;14) or t(8;22) resulting in overexpression of BCL2 and MYC, respectively. The increased proliferation due to MYC overexpression, without the ability for an apoptotic brake as a result of BCL2 overexpression, results in ‘the perfect storm of oncogenesis’. Thus this disease presents a number of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for the hematologist. The first and foremost challenge is to recognize the DHL. As different morphological entities can be affected it is incumbent on pathologists and clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion especially in disease that appears unusually aggressive or refractory to therapy. Diagnosis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a sensitive and specific method for detection of the disease but is time-consuming and expensive. While detection by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is sensitive and correlates with survival, standardized methods for this are not widely agreed upon. The second and equally important challenge in DHL is optimizing clinical outcome in a group of patients for whom the prognosis is widely regarded as poor. While improvements have been achieved by dose escalating standard chemotherapeutic regimens, many patients continue to do badly. Furthermore as a disease of aging many patients are unsuitable for dose-intensive chemotherapy regimens. There are now multiple novel targeted agents in various stages of clinical development that offer hope for better outcomes without undue toxicity. Among the most exciting of these developments include specific inhibitors of both BCL2 and MYC. © 2015, © The Author(s), 2015.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 17; Correspondence Address: M.A. Anderson; The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, 1G Royal Parade, 3052, Australia; email: manderson@wehi.edu.au",10.1177/2040620715608091,"BCL-2;diffuse large B-cell lymphoma;double hit lymphoma;MYC;4 (4 chlorophenyl) 2,3,9 trimethyl 6h thieno[3,2 f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3 a][1,4]diazepine 6 acetic acid tert butyl ester;4 [4 (4' chloro 2 biphenylylmethyl) 1 piperazinyl] n [4 [3 dimethylamino 1 (phenylthiomethyl)propylamino] 3 nitrobenzenesulfonyl]benzamide;6 (4 chlorophenyl) n ethyl 8 methoxy 1 methyl 4h [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3 a][1,4]benzodiazepine 4 acetamide;alisertib;antineoplastic agent;cpi 0610;cyclophosphamide;cytarabine;doxorubicin;etoposide;ibrutinib;ifosfamide;methotrexate;Myc protein;navitoclax;prednisolone;protein bcl 2;rituximab;unclassified drug;venetoclax;vincristine;aging;Burkitt lymphoma;cancer chemotherapy;cancer prognosis;carcinogenesis;chromosome translocation 14;chromosome translocation 18;chromosome translocation 22;chromosome translocation 8;clinical trial (topic);dosage schedule comparison;drug mechanism;drug megadose;drug research;drug safety;drug targeting;drug tolerability;fluorescence in situ hybridization;gene overexpression;human;immunohistochemistry;large cell lymphoma;lymphoma;nonhodgkin lymphoma;nonhuman;phase 1 clinical trial (topic);priority journal;protein analysis;protein expression;Review;sensitivity and specificity;stem cell transplantation;Lymphoma",NA,NA,current challenges and novel treatment strategies in double hit lymphomas

Optimization was carried out where experimental parameters were determined for the treatment of each pesticide. Both pesticides were totally eliminated by UV/H2O2 system under optimal conditions. However, significant differences were found: CBF degradation was influenced by both parameters and their interactions, while IPR degradation was not statistically affected by initial pH. Interestingly, analysis of degradation pathways showed a major influence of photolysis process and oxidation due to hydrogen peroxide for the CBF degradation, while the synergistic combination between both of them played the most relevant role during IPR degradation. A mixture of both pesticides was also submitted to UV/H2O2 action in which a lower rate was observed for IPR elimination while CBF was not affected.

They support livelihoods through marine and coastal industries such as fishing, aquaculture, energy extraction and tourism. They provide spaces for recreation, play and relaxation. For the many of us who live at the coasts, the marine environment provides a sense of place and identity. Indeed, in some locations, particularly small island nations, our seas and coasts define cultures and cultural practices such as ‘pearling’ (the traditional sea use of harvesting pearls from oyster beds in Bahrain) have even been entered into the World Heritage List. However, our oceans and coasts face many challenges (UNEP/GPA 2006). The Deepwater Horizon-BP oil spill is a stark reminder of the dependence of coastal communities on healthy seas. Considered the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry, the spill led to extensive damage to the marine environment as well as impacts on other marine industries such as fishing and tourism. Oil spills are but one threat to the marine environment. In 1992, the Canadian Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, John Crosbie, declared a moratorium on the northern Cod fishery after six Canadian populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) collapsed largely due to overexploitation. In 2011, 28.8 per cent of fish stocks were estimated as overfished (FAO 2014) which causes negative ecological consequences as well as leading to reductions in fish production, with negative social and economic consequences. Dredging and trawling also has major impacts on the ecological communities of the sea floor. Other problems include rising levels of micro-plastics and waste detritus in general, water quality issues such as the impacts of agricultural fertiliser and pesticide runoff, the dumping of toxic wastes in the deep sea and the introduction of non-native species. On top of these sea levels are rising, oceans are becoming more acidic and sea currents are changing as a result of climate change. The need for improved stewardship of coastal and marine resources is increasingly evident around the globe.

The literature was searched systematically using key words 'occupational dermatoses,' 'occupational skin disease' and name of each Asian country. Ninty five full-text articles were considered relevant and evaluated. Some of the dermatoses seen in industrial workers in Asian countries are similar to those in Western countries, including dermatoses due to chromate in construction and electroplating workers, epoxy resin, and chromate in painters, wood dust in workers in the furniture industry, azo dyes in textile workers and formaldehyde and chromates in those working in the leather and dyeing industries, dermatoses in domestic workers, chefs and health-care workers. Dermatoses in workers engaged in agriculture, beedi (tiny cigars) manufacture, agarbatti (incense sticks) production, fish processing, carpet weaving, sanitation and those working in coffee plantations and coal mines appear to be unique to Asian countries.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) confirmed the molecular imprinting of endosulfan on membrane matrix. Sensing of the endosulfan by voltammetry followed this. The electrochemical potential is additional information enhancing the selectivity of the sensor. It can be concluded that MIP-based voltammetric sensors are very promising analytical tool for the development of highly selective analytical sensor.

A technique that involves sterilization and release of males into wild populations of the same species can be useful in the control of invasive or pest species. Asterile-male release technique (SMRT) was used on a novel vertebrate system, the invasive Sea Lamprey Petromyzon marinus in the Great Lakes, in an attempt to control population size. Sea Lamprey populations in the Great Lakes have been suppressed since the 1950s by (1) pesticide applications to kill larvae in streams and (2) barriers to block upstream spawning migrations. Here, we present a literature review and meta-analysis of the SMRT by using a case study from the St. Marys River, where the SMRT was applied as an experimental method of Sea Lamprey control from 1991 to 2011. Observations obtained from the St. Marys River during and after SMRT application were used to evaluate whether the SMRTwas effective at suppressing reproduction. Males were successfully sterilized and exhibited normal mating behaviors. The survival of embryos in nests was lower during the years when the SMRTwas applied (32%) than during the post-SMRT period (67%). The overall distribution of embryo viability in the river shifted after the SMRT was applied. During the SMRT application period, the observed ratios of sterile males to normal (fertile) males on nests were significantly different than expected, possibly due to an underestimation of adult Sea Lamprey abundance in the St. Marys River. Even at lower sterile male: normal male ratios, the number of viable embryos produced would have declined, but the level of reproductive suppression required to overcome recruitment variability was unclear. We discuss the effectiveness of the SMRT as it pertains to the Sea Lamprey, and we highlight difficulties in data interpretation and provide future direction for similar control programs. © American Fisheries Society 2016.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: G.

Laos and Thailand are countries in south-east Asia where the disease is endemic in both urban and rural areas. Household water storage containers, which are favourable breeding sites for dengue mosquitoes, are common in these areas, due to intermittent or limited access to water supply. This study assessed the effect of household water management and socio-demographic risk factors on Aedes aegypti infestation of water storage containers. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 239 households in Laos (124 suburban and 115 rural), and 248 households in Thailand (127 suburban and 121 rural) was conducted. Entomological surveys alongside semi-structured interviews and observations were conducted to obtain information on Ae. aegypti infestation, socio-demographic factors and water management. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models were used to assess risk factors associated with Ae. aegypti pupal infestation. Results: Household water management rather than socio-demographic factors were more likely to be associated with the infestation of water containers with Ae. aegypti pupae. Factors that was significantly associated with Ae. aegypti infestation were tanks, less frequent cleaning of containers, containers without lids, and containers located outdoors or in toilets/bathrooms. Conclusions: Associations between Ae. aegypti pupae infestation, household water management, and socio-demographic factors were found, with risk factors for Ae. aegypti infestation being specific to each study setting. Most of the containers did not have lids, larvicides, such as temephos was seldom used, and containers were not cleaned regularly; factors are facilitating dengue vector proliferation. It is recommended that, in Lao villages, health messages should promote proper use and maintenance of tightly fitted lids, and temephos in tanks, which were the most infested containers. Recommendations for Thailand are that small water containers should be cleaned weekly. Furthermore, in addition to health messages on dengue control provided to communities, attention should be paid to larval control for indoor containers in rural villages. Temephos or other immature control measures such as the use of pyriproxyfen, antilarval bacteria, or larvivorous fish should be used where temephos resistance is prevalent. Dengue control is not possible without additional adult mosquito control and community participation. © 2017 The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: N.

At LM level WSR extract treatment showed restoration of normal luminal characteristics of PCT & DCT and renal corpuscles but it failed to minimize abortive glomerulus, necrotic renal tubules with hypertrophied area, haemorrhagical clots & chronic venous congestion. At TEM level, WSR extract showed maximum retrieval in the cytoarchitecture of cuboidal epithelial cells of renal tubules and renal corpuscles. Concomitant treatment of endocel and WSR showed a very little sign of anomalies in renal tissues. A non-significant change was marked in control group when treated only with WSR extract.

Macrophages, which play a key role in inflammation, host defense, and reactions against a spectrum of autologous and foreign invaders, are crucial for innate immunity. However, cytotoxicity and apoptosis of macrophages caused by organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have so far received little attention. In this study, we used AF as a model chemical to investigate the cytotoxic effects of OCPs on mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Results from cell viability and apoptosis assays showed that AF induced apparent apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, AF induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage and resulted in the alteration of a series of signaling molecules including up-regulation of p53 and cytochrome c protein levels, decline of the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio, and activation of the caspases cascade through caspase-9 and caspase-3. These results, for the first time, revealed that the increase of endogenous ROS and DNA damage comediating OCP-induced apoptosis in macrophages may be by the mitochondria and p53 signal pathway. Our results suggested that macrophages are involved in AF-induced adverse immune effects.

France) and associated vegetation. A decade later, tree survival, total height, and stem caliper were significantly greater after site preparation by broadcast burning, slashing and burning, spraying Tordon 101 and burning, or aerial spraying of glyphosate than for manually spot-clearing vegetation at planting time, or no site preparation, and the differences were still increasing. Protecting seedlings from animals, primarily mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa), with plastic mesh tubing resulted in 13 percent higher survival; and protected trees averaged 6 percent taller, 9 percent larger in stem diameter, and 49 percent more in volume than unprotected trees at 10 years. Protection improved seedling performance in every site-preparation treatment.        Site preparation by burning reduced total cover the most, from 50 to 5 percent or less. Vegetation recovery in all treatments was rapid; original levels were exceeded by midsummer 1981, the first posttreatment growing season. Total cover on spot-cleared areas almost equaled that on unprepared areas by 1982 but not until 1985 or later on burned or sprayed areas. Herbaceous vegetation was a much higher proportion of total cover for 5 years after burning or spraying than after spot-clearing or no site preparation, but eventually all areas were dominated by woody vegetation. Removal of the overstory by logging fostered diversity among dominant plant species and initiated successional trends in all areas. Site preparation caused large differences in the frequency of occurrence and surface area dominated by individual species but only minor increases in the total number of species. Dynamics of individual species or groups are shown by the frequency, cover, and average height of their dominance in each treatment over time.        Site preparation by burning or spraying and protection from foraging animals were required to obtain more than minimum tree stocking and growth, even in moist coastal conditions. The study results are most specific to the salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis Pursh) brush type but certainly have wider applicability throughout the Coast Ranges and beyond wherever a heavy cover of competing vegetation develops rapidly and populations of foraging mammals are high.

It is thought that more subtle dysregulation of this system, which might be achievable via dietary (i.e. hypervitaminosis A) or pharmacological (i.e. valproic acid) exposure in humans, will manifest on behavioral domains including sociability, without overt physical abnormalities.        Methods: During early life, zebrafish were exposed to low doses of two chemicals that disrupt retinoid signaling. From 0 to 5 dpf, larvae were reared in aqueous solutions containing retinoic acid (0, 0.02, 0.2 or 2 nM) or valproic acid (0, 0.5, 5.0 or 50 mu M). One cohort of zebrafish was assessed using a locomotor activity screen at 6-dpf; another was reared to adulthood and assessed using a neurobehavioral test battery (startle habituation, novel tank exploration, shoaling, and predator escape/avoidance).        Results: There was no significant increase in the incidence of physical malformation among exposed fish compared to controls. Both retinoic acid and valproic acid exposures during development disrupted larval activity with persisting behavioral alterations later in life, primarily manifesting as decreased social affiliation.        Conclusions: Social behavior and some aspects of motor function were altered in exposed fish; the importance of examining emotional or psychological consequences of early life exposure to retinoid acting chemicals is discussed.

The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is currently considered an environmental friendly alternative to the employ of pyrethroids, carbamates and microbial agents (e.g. Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis), since AgNPs are easy to produce, effective and stable in the aquatic environment. However, their biophysical features showed wide variations according to the botanical agent using for the green synthesis, outlining the importance of screening local floral resources used as reducing and stabilizing agents. In this study, we focused on the biophysical properties and the mosquitocidal action of Quisqualis indica-fabricated AgNPs. AgNPs were characterized using spectroscopic (UV, FTIR, XRD) and microscopic (AFM, SEM, TEM and EDX) techniques. AFM, SEM and TEM confirmed the synthesis of poly-dispersed AgNPs with spherical shape and size ranging from 1 to 30 nm. XRD shed light on the crystalline structure of these AgNPs. The acute toxicity of Quisqualis indica extract and AgNPs was evaluated against malaria, arbovirus, and filariasis vectors, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, as well as on three important non-target aquatic organisms. The Q. indica leaf extract showed moderate larvicidal effectiveness on Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 220.42), Ae. aegypti (LC50 = 203.63) and An. stephensi (LC50 = 185.98). Q indica-fabricated AgNPs showed high toxicity against Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 14.63), Ae. aegypti (LC50 = 13.55) and An. stephensi (LC50 = 1252), respectively. Notably, Q indica-synthesized AgNPs were moderately toxic to non-target aquatic mosquito predators Anisops bouvieri (LC50 = 653.05 mu g/mL), Diplonychus indicus (LC50 = 860.94 mu g/mL) and Gambusia affinis (LC50 = 2183.16 mu g/mL), if compared to the targeted mosquitoes. Overall, the proposed one-pot biogenic fabrication of AgNPs using Q. indica is a low-cost and eco-friendly tool in the fight against Zika virus, malaria and filariasis vectors, with little impact against non-target aquatic mosquito predators.

In coral reef-fishes, the movement of larvae from planktonic to reef environments (recruitment) represents a major life-history transition. This transition requires larvae to rapidly identify and respond to sensory cues to select a suitable habitat that facilitates survival and growth. This 'recruitment' is critical for population persistence and resilience. In aquarium experiments, larval Acanthurus triostegus preferentially used their right-eye to investigate a variety of visual stimuli. Despite this, when held in in situ cages with predators, those larvae that previously favored their left-eye exhibited higher survival. These results support the ""brain's righthemisphere"" theory, which predicts that the right-eye (i.e. left-hemisphere) is used to categorize stimuli while the left-eye (i.e. right-hemisphere) is used to inspect novel items and initiate rapid behavioral-responses. While these experiments confirm that being highly lateralized is ecologically advantageous, exposure to chlorpyrifos, a pesticide often inadvertently added to coral-reef waters, impaired visual-lateralization. This suggests that chemical pollutants could impair the brain function of larval fishes during a critical life-history transition, potentially impacting recruitment success.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  25     Total Times Cited:  25     Cited Reference Count:  95,10.1038/s41598-017-09381-0     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),GREAT-BARRIER-REEF;LEFT-RIGHT ASYMMETRY;BEHAVIORAL LATERALIZATION;FRENCH-POLYNESIA;BRAIN LATERALIZATION;SOCIAL-STIMULI;CLIMATE-CHANGE;EYE USE;HABITAT SELECTION;ZEBRAFISH LARVAE;Pesticides;Vision Disorders,NA,NA,exposure to agricultural pesticide impairs visual lateralization in a larval coral reef fish

In coastal North Carolina, USA, this dominance by brown seaweeds is facilitated by omnivorous fishes, which feed both on red and green algae and on herbivorous amphipods that graze brown algae. When fish are removed in the field, brown seaweeds are replaced by red seaweeds, and herbivorous amphipods are more abundant. Using an array of large (similar to 4000 L) outdoor mesocosms, we tested three mechanistic hypotheses for this pattern: fish feeding facilitates brown algal dominance (1) by removing red and green algal competitors, (2) by removing amphipods and reducing their feeding on brown seaweeds, or (3) through an interaction of these mechanisms. Our experiments revealed strong impacts of both fish and amphipods, and a key role for the interaction, in structuring this community. When both fish and amphipods were removed (the latter with dilute insecticide), space was rapidly dominated and held for 17 weeks by fast-growing, primarily filamentous green algae. In contrast, when either fish, amphipods, or both were present, green algae were cropped to a sparse turf, and space was more rapidly dominated by larger macroalgae. The impacts of amphipods and fish on late-successional macroalgal assemblages were comparable in magnitude, but different in sign: red seaweeds prevailed in the amphipod-dominated treatment, whereas browns dominated in the presence of fish. Laboratory feeding assays and amphipod densities in the tanks suggested that the significant effects of amphipods were attributable largely, if not exclusively, to the single amphipod species Ampithoe longimana, which fed heavily on brown macroalgae. Our experimental removal of red and green algae failed to enhance cover of brown algae significantly; however, the latter reached substantially lower cover in the grazer-removal treatment, where green algae were very abundant, than in the fish-only treatment, where green algae were sparse. Thus, our results support the third hypothesis: fish-mediated dominance of brown algae involves both suppression of grazing amphipods and removal of algal competitors. Although collective impacts of fish and amphipods on this benthic community were generally comparable in magnitude, impacts normalized to each grazer's aggregate biomass were consistently higher for amphipods than for fish, sometimes by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Thus, the impacts of grazing amphipods (specifically A. longimana) on the benthic community were both strong and disproportionate to their biomass. These experimental results imply that grazing amphipods, which are ubiquitous in marine vegetation but poorly understood ecologically, may play important roles in the organization of benthic communities, particularly where predation pressure is low.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  306     Total Times Cited:  362     Cited Reference Count:  126,10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070[0237:SIOGAO]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"amphipods;Ampithoe longimana;community organization;Diplodus holbrooki;food webs;mesocosms;North Carolina, USA;seaweeds;trophic cascade;PHYTAL ANIMAL COMMUNITIES;HERBIVOROUS MARINE AMPHIPOD;CAPITA INTERACTION STRENGTH;SEAWEED CHEMICAL DEFENSES;REEF ALGAL COMMUNITIES;SECONDARY PRODUCTION;SPECIES-DIVERSITY;FISH PREDATION;ZOSTERA-MARINA;SEAGRASS MEADOWS",NA,NA,strong impacts of grazing amphipods on the organization of a benthic community

Total PCBs and p,p'=-DDE body burdens increased with fish length, but concentrations generally increased only poorly to moderately, which suggested steady-state contaminant uptake commensurate with aggressive feeding and dilution related to rapid growth characteristic of YOY bluefish within a subestuary. High condition factors paired with elevated contamination levels in bluefish from the Lower Hudson River, as compared with bluefish from Newark Bay with poor condition factors paired with elevated contamination levels, suggested that PCBs and pesticides alone may not determine condition in these fish. We found dissimilar patterns of prominent PCB congeners in bluefish from adjacent subestuaries (e.g., Newark Bay and Lower Hudson River) suggesting separate contaminant sources. Total PCB normalized fingerprints of PCB congeners permitted statistical discrimination among YOY bluefish specimens from various estuaries with a potential to differentiate subpopulations on scales to less than 20 km. This unexpected fidelity to nursery estuaries may have implications for the management strategies.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  47,10.1139/cjfas-2015-0369     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),REPRODUCTIVE BIOMARKER RESPONSES;POMATOMUS-SALTATRIX;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS;CHEMICAL CONTAMINANTS;HEALTH INDICATORS;HUDSON;FISH;BAY;PATTERNS;GROWTH,NA,NA,contaminant bioaccumulation dynamics in youngoftheyear bluefish subpopulations in new york bight with a special reference to the condition and nursery area fidelity subsequent to recruitment

Our oily water sample was taken from the de-oiling Haoud Berkaoui station entering, which is located 770km in southern of Algiers); the AOPs investigated are TiO2/UV (photocatalysis) and TiO2/UV/Fe2+/H2O2 (photocatalysis-Fenton's reagent). This method is used as an alternative or in addition to the conventional treatment techniques (coagulation-flocculation-decantation and filtration...etc). In this work, first we copulated between the two photocatalytic methods (TiO2/UV) and the Fenton's reagent (H2O2/Fe+2) and then we studied the effect of various experimental factors on the treatment process: pH, initial concentration for each of the TiO2, H2O2, Fe2+, and oil pollutants and finally temperature. The study showed a marked improvement in efficiency on the treated water quality in terms of color, turbidity, and COD under optimized conditions (oil concentration, quantity of catalysts, temperature, Fenton's reagent concentration, and the pH of the solution).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  49,10.1007/s13201-019-0916-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),UV irradiation;Fenton's reagent;Pollutant;Photocatalysis;TiO2;COD;Advanced oxidation process;PHOTO-FENTON;DEGRADATION;REMOVAL;REAGENT;TIO2;4-CHLOROPHENOL;HYDROCARBONS;PESTICIDE;PEROXIDE;KINETICS,NA,NA,combined photocatalytic and fenton oxidation for oily wastewater treatment
