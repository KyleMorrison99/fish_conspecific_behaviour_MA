Crypsis is an important behavioural and physiological response in many crustaceans modulated by monoamine and pigment dispersing/concentrating hormones. This study aimed to develop a test methodology and investigate the effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine, on a chromatophore index and overall carapace ‘darkness’ in the common sand shrimp Crangon crangon. Adult shrimp were exposed for either 1 h, 1 day or 1 week across a range of nominal fluoxetine concentrations (10 ng/L, 100 ng/L and 1000 ng/L) and the chromatophore index or carapace percentage ‘darkness’ was recorded following 30 min on white and black substrates. These experiments were repeated three times using different specimens. Animals became significantly darker (~20%) on darker background and lighter on light backgrounds as one might expect. However, time periods over which the animals were recorded had a significant impact on the colouration suggesting habituation to laboratory conditions. Fluoxetine exposure came up as a significant factor in two of the three trials for the chromatophore index but the results was inconsistent between trials. There was a high degree of correlation between the chromatophore index and the percentage darkness analyses however, there was no significant effects for fluoxetine exposure with the percentage darkness data. We conclude that the effects on antidepressants on colour change remain inconclusive from these experiments and we discuss potential areas to improve the repeatability of the experiments. © 2020, The Author(s).",,10.1007/s10646-020-02272-7,Fluoxetine;Antidepressive Agents,32857222,NA,effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine on pigment dispersion in chromatophores of the common sand shrimp crangon crangon repeated experiments paint an inconclusive picture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A video tracking system was employed to analyse two swimming traits (total distance moved and average speed) of the larvae simultaneously after 3 days of exposure to the pesticide at 2 °C. The behavioural results were also interpreted according to biochemical responses to oxidative stress (OS) induced by chlorpyrifos, based on malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCC) content. Both distance and speed significantly decreased after 72 h of exposure to chlorpyrifos concentrations of ≥ 110 ng L−1, under which significant OS was detected as lipid peroxidation (level of MDA) and protein carbonylation (level of carbonyl). Analysis of altered swimming behaviour, along with MDA and carbonyl content, indicated that ≥ 110 ng L−1 contamination levels of the insecticide cause the organism to reallocate energy normally used for locomotor activity to repair cell damage, which might explain the strong impairment to locomotor performance. Locomotor performance is an ecologically relevant trait for elucidating the population dynamics of key species, with disturbance to this trait having long-term negative impacts on population and community structure. Therefore, chlorpyrifos insecticides represent a serious ecological risk for mountain aquatic species based on the detrimental effects observed in the current study, as the tested concentrations were those at which the insecticide is found in many Alpine rivers of Italy. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s11356-019-06467-2,,31630352,NA,behavioural and biochemical alterations by chlorpyrifos in aquatic insects an emerging environmental concern for pristine alpine habitats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasingly, pharmaceutical pollutants are documented to disrupt ecologically important physiological and behavioural traits in exposed wildlife. However, little is known about potential impacts of pharmaceutical exposure on among-individual variation in these traits, despite phenotypic diversity being critical for population resilience to environmental change. Furthermore, although wildlife commonly experience multiple stressors contemporaneously, potential interactive effects between pharmaceuticals and biological stressors—such as predation threat—remain poorly understood. To redress this, we investigated the impacts of long-term exposure to the pervasive pharmaceutical pollutant fluoxetine (Prozac®) on among-individual variation in metabolic and behavioural traits, and the combined impacts of fluoxetine exposure and predation threat on mean metabolic and behavioural traits in a freshwater fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Using a mesocosm system, guppy populations were exposed for 15 months to one of two field-realistic levels of fluoxetine (nominal concentrations: 30 and 300 ng/L) or a solvent control. Fish from these populations were then tested for metabolic rate (oxygen uptake) and behaviour (activity), both before and after experiencing one of three levels of a predation treatment: an empty tank, a non-predatory fish (Melanotaenia splendida) or a predatory fish (Leiopotherapon unicolor). Guppies from both fluoxetine treatments had ∼70% lower among-individual variation in their activity levels, compared to unexposed fish. Similarly, fluoxetine exposure at the higher dosage was associated with a significant (26%) reduction in individual-level variation in oxygen uptake relative to unexposed fish. In addition, mean baseline metabolic rate was disrupted in low-fluoxetine exposed fish, although mean metabolic and behavioural responses to predation threat were not affected. Overall, our study demonstrates that long-term exposure to a pervasive pharmaceutical pollutant alters ecologically relevant traits in fish and erodes among-individual variability, which may be detrimental to the stability of contaminated populations globally. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114450,Phenotype,32283454,NA,chronic exposure to a pervasive pharmaceutical pollutant erodes amongindividual phenotypic variation in a fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clay minerals are among the oldest and cheapest adsorbents used for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants. However, despite their significant adsorption properties, little is known about their potential to remove organic contaminants such as pharmaceutical products from wastewater effluents. Hence, based on the latest published articles this review aims to standardize the adsorption properties of clay minerals for the removal of PPs. Specifically, the charge state of PPs appears to play a key role in their adsorption mechanism. In order to overcome the limitations of batch experiments (i.e. idealized solutions, static conditions) and design of a field solution, the impact of external parameters on the adsorption capacities of clay minerals is reviewed. The effect of thermal treatment and acid activation of clay minerals is also assessed in order to better understand the consequences of such modifications on the adsorption properties of clay-based adsorbents. Finally, even if most authors agree on the potential of clay-based adsorbents for the removal of PPs from wastewater, there remain significant gaps in the existing literature that need to be filled, with the aim of forecasting the real potential of clay-based treatment for the removal of pharmaceutical products at industrial scale. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,10.1080/10643389.2019.1663065,,NA,NA,raw and modified clays and clay minerals for the removal of pharmaceutical products from aqueous solutions state of the art and future perspectives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, we investigated effects of long-term exposure to the pervasive pharmaceutical contaminant fluoxetine (Prozac) and acute temperature stress on reproductive behaviors and activity levels in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Fish were exposed to environmentally realistic fluoxetine concentrations (measured average: 38 or 312 ng/L) or a solvent control for 15 months using a mesocosm system. Additionally, fish were subjected to one of three acute (24 h) temperature treatments: cold stress (18 °C), heat stress (32 °C), or a control (24 °C). We found no evidence for interactive effects of fluoxetine exposure and temperature stress on guppy behavior. However, both stressors had independent impacts. Fluoxetine exposure resulted in increased male coercive copulatory behavior, while fish activity levels were unaffected. Under cold-temperature stress, both sexes were less active and males exhibited less frequent reproductive behaviors.

Animals exhibit species-specific and sex specific behaviors. Previous experiments within ecotoxicology using amphipods as models have either not separated by sex or have on the assumption that they may create more variability in the results. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of time (which controlled light conditions), sex, and the interaction of time and sex on the swimming velocity in males and females of the marine amphipod Echinogammarus marinus. E. marinus exhibited a phototactic response to light, as is consistent with previous findings. It was determined that females swim significantly faster than males and that this response was enhanced during periods when the lights were switched off. This suggests that a greater understanding of the baseline unconditioned behaviors of experimental organisms is needed to avoid impacts of unknown variables on results. The results of this study reveal significant sexual differences in the baseline behavior of E. marinus which has implications for future research in ecotoxicology. It is recommended that in future research specimens be separated by sex prior to experimentation, in order to account for possible behavioral differences such as those observed in the present studies. This study also highlights the need for thorough observation of behavior over shorter time intervals as larger intervals may miss short-term variations. © Copyright © 2020 Cherry, Kohler and Ford.",,10.3389/fmars.2020.00370,,NA,NA,sex specific differences recorded in the behavior of an amphipod implications for behavioral toxicology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two antibiotics were selected due to their frequent use in association (i.e. co-trimoxazole) in a 5:1 ratio (SMX:TMP) for medication purposes, generating a unique opportunity to globally evaluate the validity of this ratio based on concentration values. Several parameters (e.g. sorption, biodegradation) may affect the theoretical SMX/TMP ratio. However, the collected data highlighted the good agreement between the theoretical ratio and the experimental one, especially in wastewater treatment plant influents and hospital effluents. Only livestock effluents displayed a very high SMX/TMP ratio, indicative of the very significant use of sulfonamide alone in this industry. Conversely, several countries displayed low SMX/TMP ratio values, highlighting local features in the human pharmacopoeia.

Based on recent literature in fish, we highlight four interesting research perspectives to better understand the effects of pollutants on the links between fish behavior, cognition and fitness. First, (1) we review the neurotoxic effects of pollutants on fish behavior, personality, and cognition. These behavioral and cognitive effects could in turn affect the level of exposure to pollutants, potentially generating feedback loops that may amplify the effects of pollutants on fish fitness. Second, we propose that (2) the effects of pollutants should be studied in a multistress context, i.e., in realistic environmental conditions in combination with other stressors, because some stressors could amplify the behavioral effects of pollutants on fitness. Third (3), existing studies show that physiology, personality, cognition, and fitness components are often linked in syndromes. Pollutants could lead to syndrome disruption, which could affect the evolutionary trajectories of exposed populations. Future studies should thus focus on the complex links between traits to better understand the consequences of stressors on evolutionary trajectories. Fourth, (4) exposure to chronic pollution could lead to local adaptation or maladaptation, which could result into high intraspecific variability of sensitivity among wild populations. In addition, evolutionary responses to pollution could constrain, or be constrained by evolutionary responses to other stressors. We thus encourage future studies to use integrative approaches to bridge the gap between ecotoxicology, cognitive ecology and evolutionary ecology in a multistress framework to tackle these exciting questions and improve our ability to predict the effects of anthropogenic stressors on wildlife. © Copyright © 2020 Jacquin, Petitjean, Côte, Laffaille and Jean.",,10.3389/fevo.2020.00086,,NA,NA,effects of pollution on fish behavior personality and cognition some research perspectives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zinc accumulates in soils and mobilises into plant tissue where it may be consumed to potentially toxic levels by leaf feeding insects, including developing pollinators. While zinc tolerance thresholds have been previously assessed in insect pollinators, most observations are limited to model organisms and pest species. We lack understanding of zinc tolerance in insects of conservation concern. We assess dietary zinc tolerance of developing caterpillars from wild populations of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), a species of conservation concern, whose caterpillars are commonly exposed to elevated dietary zinc exposure in milkweed plants along roadsides. We contrast monarch zinc tolerance with that of cabbage white butterfly caterpillars (Pieris rapae), a non-native pest species. Tolerance was assessed by rearing caterpillars on artificial diets containing varying levels of zinc. Zinc reduced monarch survival at levels as low as 344 mg kg−1 but positively impacted cabbage white survival at 227 and 738 mg kg−1. Cabbage whites also displayed prolonged development time, smaller adult body size, and slower growth rate, consistent with the possibility that zinc tolerance had fitness costs. Our results support previous observations that heavy metal tolerance varies between species and highlight the importance of broadening our understanding of tolerance to insect species of conservation concern before drawing general conclusions about insect susceptibility to heavy metal pollution. Nonetheless, our results suggest that zinc pollution alone is unlikely a risk in developing roadside habitat for monarch butterflies. © 2020 The Royal Entomological Society",,10.1111/icad.12404,Zinc,NA,NA,assessing zinc tolerance in two butterfly species consequences for conservation in polluted environments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite being banned in various countries, HGP use is still common in beef production around the world. The androgenic steroid 17β-trenbolone (17β-TB) is a HGP that commonly enters surface waters via livestock effluent run-off. Here, we used a flow-through system to expose wild-caught adult male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to an environmentally realistic level of 17β-TB (average measured concentration = 2 ng/L) for 21 days. We then compared the response of exposed and unexposed males to sequentially presented large and small stimulus (unexposed) females. Due to a positive size-fecundity relationship, larger females are generally expected to be preferred by males. While we found no evidence that the size of a previously encountered female affected the amount of courtship or coercive ‘sneak’ mating behaviour performed by males during the second presentation, males from both exposure treatments conducted more frequent courting events towards larger females during both presentations, suggesting an absolute preference for greater female size. Further, across both presentations, 17β-TB exposure caused a shift in male mating strategy towards increased coercive sneaking behaviour, although male sequential investment into mating effort was not impacted at the tested dosage. In combination, our findings demonstrate that exposure to a field-realistic level of a widespread agricultural pollutant alters male mating strategies in fish, and contribute to a growing understanding of sub-lethal impacts of chemical contaminants on complex behaviours in wildlife. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134991,,31757546,NA,disruption of male mating strategies in a chemically compromised environment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While wild-caught zebrafish exposed to concentrations of the anxiolytic drug oxazepam as low as 0.57 μg L−1 showed a reduction in the response to conspecific alarm pheromone, laboratory strain AB did not respond to the alarm cue, and consequently, the anxiolytic effect of oxazepam could not be measured.

The secondary objective was to characterize the accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in 3 tissues (gills, adductor muscles and foot) in clams exposed for 10 days to crude oil alone or under multistress conditions (n = 5 clams per condition) and then to compare the accumulation and behaviour of clams under these conditions. The response of clams to crude oil alone or under multistress conditions was visually and statistically significant and not confounded by the other disturbances tested, despite large variations in water temperature. In the presence of crude oil, the behaviour of clams was characterized by an increase in valve-closure duration, a decrease in valve-opening amplitude and an increase in valve agitation index. In the presence of crude oil, the clam behaviour showed no direct relationship with PAH accumulation in the gills, adductor muscles or foot, although hypothetical mechanisms are discussed. This work supports the growing interest in studying the behaviour of bivalve mollusks in the context of biomonitoring of the aquatic environment surrounding oil facilities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.105381,,31869578,NA,asiatic clam corbicula fluminea exhibits distinguishable behavioural responses to crude oil under seminatural multiple stress conditions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Turbidity interferes with vision for aquatic organisms, potentially altering predator–prey interactions. We studied the effects of these disturbances in Trinidadian streams by surveying predators and their shared prey both in streams with versus without quarries as well as in a focal stream before and after the establishment of a quarry. Then, to evaluate whether differential foraging success in turbid water might underlie abundance patterns of predators, we experimentally induced turbidity in mesocosms and measured predator foraging success. Upstream quarry presence had a dramatic effect on the benthic structure of streams, greatly increasing siltation. A substantial decrease in the abundance of a diurnal cichlid predator (Crenicichla frenata) was associated with quarry presence, while a nocturnal erytherinid predator (Hoplias malabaricus) was equally as abundant in streams with or without quarries. The density of their shared prey, the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) remained unchanged. In mesocosm trials, Crenicichla were less successful predators with turbidity, whereas Hoplias performed equally across turbidities. These foraging success results help explain differences in demographic shifts in response to turbidity for both predators. By relating short-term effects of an anthropogenically altered visual environment on species interactions to abundance patterns of predators and prey, this study helps to identify an important mechanism whereby changes to species’ visual ecology may have long-term effects on population biology. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,10.1111/fwb.13425,Prednisolone,NA,NA,altered visual environment affects a tropical freshwater fish assemblage through impacts on predatorprey interactions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wildlife will be exposed to environmental chemicals from the water they drink, from the environment in which they live, from the foods that they eat, and from the air that they breathe. Some chemicals, such as mercury and PCBs, have the ability to bioaccumulate within the tissues of animals and can present a potential of toxicity to humans that may consume these animals as a source of food.

Although much is known about the effects of these environmental estrogens on the reproductive physiology and behavior of individuals within species, comparatively less is known about how these compounds alter the outcomes of interactions between species. Furthermore, few studies have considered how the effects of contaminants are modulated by natural variation in abiotic factors, such as temperature. To help fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a factorial experiment to examine the independent and combined effects of estrone (E1) and temperature on the outcome of predator prey interactions between two common North American freshwater fishes, fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Larval fathead minnows and adult sunfish were exposed to either a low (mean6standard deviation, 90.1618 ng/L; n=16) or high (4146147 ng/L; n=15) concentration of E1 or to a solvent control for 30 days at one of four natural seasonal temperatures (15C, 18C, 21C, and 24C) before predation trials were performed. Exposure to E1 was associated with a significant increase in larval predation mortality that was independent of temperature. Across all temperature treatments, approximately 74% of control minnows survived; this survivorship significantly exceeded that of minnows exposed to either concentration of E1 (49% and 53% for minnows exposed to the low and high concentrations, respectively). However, exposure to E1 also impaired the prey-capture success of sunfish, partially mitigating predation pressure on exposed minnows. Overall prey-capture success by sunfish showed an inverted U-shaped distribution with temperature, with maximal prey consumption occurring at 21C. This study illustrates the vulnerability of organismal interactions to estrogenic pollutants and highlights the need to include food web interactions in assessments of risk. © 2020 OUP.

These growing anthropogenic disturbances represent major and relatively new environmental challenges for many animals, and invariably alter selection on traits adapted to previous environments. Those species that survive often have moved from their original habitat or modified their phenotype through plasticity or genetic evolution. Based on the most recent advances in this research area, we predict that wild individuals with highly plastic capacities, relatively high basal stress level, and that are generally shy—in other words, individuals displaying a reactive phenotype—should better cope with sudden and widespread HIREC than their counterparts' proactive phenotypes. If true, this selective response would have profound ecological and evolutionary consequences and can therefore impact conservation strategies, specifically with respect to managing the distribution and abundance of individuals and maintaining evolutionary potential. These insights may help design adaptive management strategies to maintain genetic variation in the context of HIREC.

As such, it has a great potential to generalize and synthesize our understanding of many ecological problems. Here, we give an overview of how a metacommunity perspective can provide useful insights for conservation biology, which aims to understand and mitigate the effects of anthropogenic drivers that decrease population sizes, increase extinction probabilities, and threaten biodiversity. We review four general metacommunity processes—environmental filtering, biotic interactions, dispersal, and ecological drift—and discuss how key anthropogenic drivers (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, and nonnative species) can alter these processes. We next describe how the patterns of interest in metacommunities (abundance, occupancy, and diversity) map onto issues at the heart of conservation biology, and describe cases where conservation biology benefits by taking a scale-explicit metacommunity perspective. We conclude with some ways forward for including metacommunity perspectives into ideas of ecosystem functioning and services, as well as approaches to habitat management, preservation, and restoration. © 2020 The Authors.

To understand how behavioural studies could be used in regulatory decision-making we: (1) assessed the legal obstacles to using behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation; (2) analysed the known cases of use of behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation; and (3) provided examples of behavioural endpoints of relevance for population level effects. We conclude that the only legal obstacle to the use of behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation is whether an endpoint is considered to be relevant at the population level or not. We also conclude that ecotoxicity studies investigating behavioural endpoints are occasionally used in the EU chemicals regulation, and underscore that behavioural endpoints can be relevant at the population level. To improve the current use of behavioural studies in regulatory decision-making contribution from all relevant stakeholders is required. We have the following recommendations: (1) researchers should conduct robust, well-designed and transparent studies that emphasize the relevance of the study for regulation of chemicals; (2) editors and scientific journals should promote detailed, reliable and clearly reported studies; (3) regulatory agencies and the chemical industry need to embrace new behavioural endpoints of relevance at the population level. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,10.1039/c9em00463g,"Social Control, Informal;Social Control, Formal",31898699,NA,emerging investigator series use of behavioural endpoints in the regulation of chemicals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As they are often not appropriately removed by sewage treatment plants, pharmaceutical compounds end up in surface water environments worldwide at concentrations in the ng to μg L−1 range. There is a need to further explore single compound and mixture effects using e.g. in vivo test model systems. We have investigated, for the first time, behavioral effects in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to a binary mixture of an antidepressant drug (citalopram) and a synthetic opioid (tramadol). Citalopram and tramadol have a similar mode of action (serotonin reuptake inhibition) and are known to produce drug-drug interactional effects resulting in serotonin syndrome (SS) in humans. Zebrafish embryo-larvae were exposed to citalopram, tramadol and 1:1 binary mixture from fertilization until 144 h post-fertilization. No effects on heart rate, spontaneous tail coiling, or death/malformations were observed in any treatment at tested concentrations. Behavior (hypoactivity in dark periods) was on the other hand affected, with lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) of 373 μg L−1 for citalopram, 320 μg L−1 for tramadol, and 473 μg L−1 for the 1:1 mixture. Behavioral EC50 was calculated to be 471 μg L−1 for citalopram, 411 μg L−1 for tramadol, and 713 μg L−1 for the 1:1 mixture.

Both, especially the freshwater fish Danio rerio and the shrimp Atyaephyra desmarestii, have been tested experimentally for their avoidance response and have showed the ability to escape from toxic effects. As the behavior of avoiding or not the contamination might be altered in the presence of other factors, the aim of the current study was to verify whether the avoidance response of both species, when exposed jointly (multispecies tests), to a copper gradient is different from the avoidance response observed in monospecies tests. The avoidance was assessed in a multi-compartmented exposure system, in which a copper gradient was simulated. Organisms were tested individually and together. Both species avoided potentially toxic copper concentrations; however, shrimps were slightly more sensitive in the monospecies tests: AC50 (avoidance concentration for 50% of the population) of 60 (53–68) μg/L for the zebrafish and 50 (45–56) μg/L for the shrimp. In the multispecies tests, the sensitivity pattern changed: the avoidance response by the fish [AC50: 30 (14–46) μg/L] was greater than by the shrimps [AC50: 70 (22–141) μg/L]. Although the AC50 values are in the same order of magnitude, a slight trend to change the avoidance pattern was observed in the shrimps during multispecies test: the avoidance was lower and time-delayed. This behavioral change could be linked to the stress caused by the zebrafish sharing the space with the shrimps, perhaps increasing the territorialism of the fish, or a delay in the shrimps detecting the risk of contamination. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109757,,31606638,NA,might the interspecies interaction between fish and shrimps change the pattern of their avoidance response to contamination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In raw WWE, the concentration of PPs is indeed far lower than the concentration of other organic molecules. Among the adsorbents tested, kaolinite displayed the lowest adsorption capacity of both PPs and other organic molecules, compared to raw montmorillonite which presented the highest adsorption capacity. The sodium-exchanged montmorillonite displayed intermediate adsorption properties, highlighting the key role of divalent inorganic cations in the adsorption of non-cationic PPs and other organic molecules.

Hence, it is vital to determine the interactive effect of one pollutant with the other when they coexist in the environment. In the present study, the effect of antibiotic – tetracycline (TC) on the toxicity of P25 n-TiO2 was studied with marine microalgae, Chlorella sp. The impact of TC (1 mg L−1) on five different concentrations of n-TiO2 (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg L−1) under both visible and UV-A illuminations was evaluated. Effective diameter of n-TiO2 in ASW at 0th h increased from 690.69 ± 19.55 nm (0.25 mg L−1) to 1183.04 ± 37.10 nm (0.25 mg L−1 + 1 mg L−1) and 971.51 ± 14.61 nm (4 mg L−1) to 1324.12 ± 11.59 nm (4 mg L−1 + 1 mg L−1) in presence of TC. A significant increase in the toxicity of 4 mg L−1 n-TiO2 upon the addition of TC (68.16 ± 0.37% under visible and 80.21 ± 0.3% under UV-A condition) was observed. No significant difference in toxicity was observed between visible and UV-A illuminations. Further the toxicity data was corroborated through the measurement of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities. Independent action model showed antagonistic effect for lower concentrations of n-TiO2 and additive effect for higher concentrations of n-TiO2 when present in mixture with TC under both illuminations. For the higher mixture concentration of 4 mg L−1 n-TiO2 and 1 mg L−1 TC, the percentage TC removal was about 55.29% and 30% and the corresponding TOC removal was found to be 54.29% and 31.04% under visible and UV-A illuminations respectively.

Wastewater-dominated environments are often riddled by a myriad of stressors, such as chemical and thermal stressors. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an environmentally relevant concentration of a commonly prescribed antidepressant, venlafaxine (VFX) [1.0 μg/L], in addition to a 5°C increase in water temperature on zebrafish metabolism. Fish were chronically exposed (21 days) to one of four conditions: (i) 0 μg/L VFX at 27°C; (ii) 1.0 μg/L VFX at 27°C; (iii) 0 μg/L VFX at 32°C; (iv) 1.0 μg/L VFX at 32°C. Following exposure, whole-body metabolism was assessed by routine metabolic rate (RMR) measurements, whereas tissue-specific metabolism was assessed by measuring the activities of major metabolic enzymes in addition to glucose levels in muscle. RMR was significantly higher in the multi-stressed group relative to Control. The combination of both stressors resulted in elevated pyruvate kinase activity and glucose levels, while lipid metabolism was depressed, as measured by 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase activity. Citrate synthase activity increased with the onset of temperature, but only in the group treatment without VFX. Catalase activity was also elevated with the onset of the temperature stressor, however, that was not the case for the multi-stressed group, potentially indicating a deleterious effect of VFX on the anti-oxidant defense mechanism. The results of this study highlight the importance of multiple-stressor research, as it able to further bridge the gap between field and laboratory studies, as well as have the potential of yielding surprising results that may have not been predicted using a conventional single-stressor approach. © Copyright © 2019 Mehdi, Bragg, Servos and Craig.",,10.3389/fphys.2019.01431,Antidepressive Agents,NA,NA,multiple stressors in the environment the effects of exposure to an antidepressant venlafaxine and increased temperature on zebrafish metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These systems are routinely affected by multiple stressors from anthropogenic activities, and increasingly influenced by global megatrends (e.g., the food–energy–water nexus, demographic transitions to cities) and climate change. Here we report priority research questions from the Global Horizon Scanning Project, which aimed to identify, prioritize, and advance environmental quality research needs from an Australasian perspective, within a global context. We employed a transparent and inclusive process of soliciting key questions from Australasian members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. Following submission of 78 questions, 20 priority research questions were identified during an expert workshop in Nelson, New Zealand. These research questions covered a range of issues of global relevance, including research needed to more closely integrate ecotoxicology and ecology for the protection of ecosystems, increase flexibility for prioritizing chemical substances currently in commerce, understand the impacts of complex mixtures and multiple stressors, and define environmental quality and ecosystem integrity of temporary waters. Some questions have specific relevance to Australasia, particularly the uncertainties associated with using toxicity data from exotic species to protect unique indigenous species. Several related priority questions deal with the theme of how widely international ecotoxicological data and databases can be applied to regional ecosystems. Other timely questions, which focus on improving predictive chemistry and toxicology tools and techniques, will be important to answer several of the priority questions identified here. Another important question raised was how to protect local cultural and social values and maintain indigenous engagement during problem formulation and identification of ecosystem protection goals. Addressing these questions will be challenging, but doing so promises to advance environmental sustainability in Oceania and globally. 2019 The Authors.

Toxicological effects of arsenic are relatively well-known, but much less studied are its effects on behavioral endpoints, which may have considerable evolutionary and population-level consequences. Here we investigated the effects of exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of arsenic (0, 10 and 100 μg/L) for 96-hours on female preference for male color (i.e. red versus blue) in Betta splendens, an increasingly popular fish model for contaminant-induced behavioral dysfunction. Further, we examined whether arsenic exposure altered anxiety-like behaviors using a standard scototaxis test (preference for light or dark), as well as measured tissue cortisol concentrations to increase our understanding of possible mechanisms driving behavioral responses. We found exposure to 100 μg/L arsenic results in a loss of female preference for red males, and arsenic exposed females showed increased anxiety-like behavior. The loss in preference for male coloration may have been driven by anxiety, as preference for red was negatively correlated with anxiety-like behavior for all fish. Interestingly, increase in anxiety-like behavior occurred without a parallel increase in cortisol. Female preference for red colored males may confer fitness benefits, and this study highlights important arsenic-induced behavioral changes that could have population level consequences. © 2019 The Author(s)Environmental science; Environmental pollution; Environmental toxicology; Endocrinology; Toxicology; Ecology; Zoology; Behavioral effects; Mate choice; Metalloid contaminant; Siamese fighting fish; Scototaxis © 2019 The Author(s)",,10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02646,Anxiety;Arsenic,NA,NA,ecologically relevant arsenic exposure alters female mate preference and anxietylike behavior in betta splendens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of wildlife to pollutants has the capacity to adversely affect animal communication and behaviour across a wide range of sensory modalities-by not only impacting the signalling environment, but also the way in which animals produce, perceive and interpret signals and cues. Such disturbances, particularly when it comes to sex, can drastically alter fitness. Here, we consider how pollutants disrupt communication and behaviour during mate choice, and the ecological and evolutionary changes such disturbances can engender.We explain how the different stages of mate choice can be affected by pollution, from encountering mates to the final choice, and how changes to these stages can influence individual fitness, population dynamics and community structure. We end with discussing how an understanding of these disturbances can help inform better conservation and management practices and highlight important considerations and avenues for future research.

Assessment of the effect of chemical contaminants on behaviours relating to fitness and trophic interactions for example, requires incorporating predator-prey interactions to create impact assessments. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a controlled substance but is still regularly used as a form of mosquito control. There is little explicit information on the effect of DDT on animal behaviour and the consequent effects upon trophic interactions. This study uses a 3 × 2 factorial design to assess the feeding behaviour of Xenopus laevis toward Culex sp. larvae when supplied with different prey cues. We also assess the behavioural responses of mosquito larvae when supplied with no threat cue and predator threat cues when exposed to 0 µg/L, 2 µg/L and 20 µg/L DDT. There was a significant “DDT exposure” x “prey cue” interaction whereby DDT significantly decreased the foraging behaviour of X. laevis towards live prey cues, however there was no effect of DDT on X. laevis response to olfactory prey cues. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane exposure caused mosquito larvae to appear hyperactive regardless of DDT concentration. Mosquito larvae anti-predator response was significantly dampened when exposed to 2 µg/L DDT, however when exposed to 20 µg/L the anti-predator responses were not impaired. Our results indicate a complex interplay in trophic interactions under DDT exposure, wherein effects are mediated depending on species and concentration. There are possible implications regarding reduced anti-predator behaviour in the prey species but also reduced foraging capacity in the predator, which could drive changes in ecosystem energy pathways. We demonstrate that in order to quantify effects of pesticides upon trophic interactions it is necessary to consider ecologically relevant behaviours of both predator and prey species. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s10646-019-02075-5,Prednisolone,31278447,NA,assessing predatorprey interactions in a chemically altered aquatic environment the effects of ddt on xenopus laevis and culex sp larvae interactions and behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rayyan-1227188867,Shifts in seawater chemistry disrupt trophic links within a simple shoreline food web,2019,1,1,,298549,190,4,,"Jellison B.M., Gaylord B.",,,Springer Verlag,,"Marine intertidal systems have long served as focal environments for ecological research, yet these environments are changing due to the entry of human-produced carbon dioxide into seawater, which causes ‘ocean acidification’ (OA). One component of OA is a decline in seawater pH, an alteration known to disrupt organism behaviors underlying predator–prey interactions. To date, however, studies examining OA’s effects on feeding relationships consider predominantly simple direct interactions between consumers and their food sources. Here, we extended these established approaches to test how decreased seawater pH might alter cascading effects that span tiered linkages in trophic networks. We employed a model shoreline food web incorporating a sea star predator (Leptasterias hexactis), an herbivorous snail prey (Tegula funebralis), and a common macroalgal resource for the prey (Mazzaella flaccida). Results demonstrate direct negative effects of low pH on anti-predator behavior of snails, but also weakened indirect interactions, driven by increased snail consumption of macroalgae even as sea stars ate more snails. This latter outcome arose because low pH induced ‘foolhardy’ behaviors in snails, whereby their flight responses were supplanted by other activities that allowed for foraging. These findings highlight the potential for human-induced changes in seawater chemistry to perturb prey behaviors and trophic dynamics with accompanying community-level consequences. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s00442-019-04459-0,,31327076,NA,shifts in seawater chemistry disrupt trophic links within a simple shoreline food web,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rayyan-1227188869,Mate choice in a changing world,2019,1,1,,14647931,94,4,,Candolin U.,,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,,"Human activities by altering environmental conditions are influencing the mate choice of animals. This is by impacts on: (i) the production and expression of traits evaluated by mate choosers; (ii) the transmission of information about potential mates to choosers; (iii) the reception and processing of the information by choosers; and (iv) the final mate choice. Here, I first discuss how these four stages of the mate-choice process can be altered by environmental change, and how these alterations, in turn, can influence individuals, populations, and communities. Much evidence exists for human-induced environmental changes influencing mate choice, but the consequences for the fitness of courters and choosers are less well known, and even less is known about the impact on population dynamics, species interactions and community composition. More evidence exists for altered mate-choice systems influencing interspecific matings and thereby community composition and biodiversity. I then consider whether plastic adjustments and evolutionary changes can rescue adaptive mate-choice systems, and reflect on the possibility of non-adaptive mate-choice systems becoming less maladaptive under environmental change. Much evidence exists for plastic adjustments of mate-choice systems, but whether these are adaptive is seldom known, as is the contribution of genetic changes. Finally, I contemplate the possibility of mate-choice systems rescuing populations from decline in changing environments. I explain how this is context dependent with both positive and negative outcomes possible. In summary, while much evidence exists for human-induced environmental changes influencing mate-choice systems, less is known about the consequences for ecological and evolutionary processes. Considering the importance that mate choice plays in determining individual fitness and population viability, the effects of environmental change on mate-choice systems should be considered in studies on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of human disturbances to habitats. © 2019 Cambridge Philosophical Society",,10.1111/brv.12501,,30762277,NA,mate choice in a changing world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, large-scale exposures are still very rare due to prohibitive costs, the availability of replicated habitats, and the potential for exposure to cause lasting damage to the environment. Here, we evaluated the viability of internal slow-release implants as an alternative method for manipulating CEC exposures in aquatic wildlife using two fat-based carriers (coconut oil and vegetable shortening). We treated roach (Rutilus rutilus) with implants containing a high (50 μg/g), low (25 μg/g), or control (0 μg/g) concentration of the behavior-modifying pharmaceutical oxazepam. We then measured oxazepam uptake in four tissues (plasma, muscle, liver, and the brain) over 1 month. The two carriers released oxazepam differently: coconut oil was the superior implant type because it delivered a more consistent dose across time, while vegetable shortening released oxazepam rapidly at the start of the exposure period. For both carriers and treatments, the brain and liver contained the most oxazepam. Overall, the method is a promising technique for controlled manipulations of pharmaceuticals in fish, and we have provided some of the first data on the suitability and contaminant release kinetics from different implant types. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acs.est.9b01975,,31067036,NA,slowrelease implants for manipulating contaminant exposures in aquatic wildlife a new tool for field ecotoxicology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, implementation of waste management systems and wastewater treatment infrastructure is not yet meeting these global megatrends. Herein, pharmaceuticals are indicators of an urbanizing water cycle; antidepressants are among the most commonly studied classes of these contaminants of emerging concern. In the present study, we performed a unique global hazard assessment of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in water matrices across geographic regions and for common wastewater treatment technologies. SSRIs in the environment have primarily been reported from Europe (50%) followed by North America (38%) and Asia-Pacific (10%). Minimal to no monitoring data exists for many developing regions of the world, including Africa and South America. From probabilistic environmental exposure distributions, 5th and 95th percentiles for all SSRIs across all geographic regions were 2.31 and 3022.1 ng/L for influent, 5.3 and 841.6 ng/L for effluent, 0.8 and 127.7 ng/L for freshwater, and 0.5 and 22.3 ng/L for coastal and marine systems, respectively. To estimate the potential hazards of SSRIs in the aquatic environment, percent exceedances of therapeutic hazard values of specific SSRIs, without recommended safety factors, were identified within and among geographic regions. For influent sewage and wastewater effluents, sertraline exceedances were observed 49% and 29% of the time, respectively, demonstrating the need to better understand emerging water quality hazards of SSRIs in urban freshwater and coastal ecosystems.

Accordingly, we investigated the effects of two field-realistic levels of the SSRI fluoxetine (61 and 352 ng/L) on sociability and anxiety-related behaviors in eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) for 28 days. Additionally, we measured whole-body tissue concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. We found that fluoxetine altered anxiety-related behavior but not sociability. Specifically, female fish showed reduced anxiety-related behavior at the lower treatment level, while males showed an increase at the higher treatment level. In addition, we report a biomass-dependent and sex-specific accumulation of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine, with smaller fish showing higher relative tissue concentrations, with this relationship being more pronounced in males.

Here, we investigated impacts of 21-day exposure of wild-caught male eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to a field-realistic level of the veterinary pharmaceutical 17β-trenbolone—a growth-promoting steroid used extensively in beef production worldwide and a potent androgenic endocrine disruptor repeatedly detected in surface waters affected by livestock effluent run-off. First, we examined male boldness, activity, and exploratory behaviour in a novel environment (maze arena) and found no significant effect of 17β-trenbolone exposure. Second, the same males were tested in a reproductive assay for their tendency to associate with a stimulus (unexposed) female behind a partition. Exposed males exhibited reduced association behaviour, taking longer to first associate with, and spending less time within close proximity to, a female. Third, all males were assayed for sperm function (computer-assisted sperm analysis, sperm viability) or quantity (total sperm count) and, although no significant main effects of 17β-trenbolone were seen on sperm traits, exposure altered the relationship between male morphology and sperm function. Lastly, morphological traits were assessed and exposed males were found to have, on average, increased mass relative to length. In combination, these results demonstrate that exposure to a field-realistic level of 17β-trenbolone can produce subtle but important trait alterations in male fish—including context-specific behavioural changes, disruption of key sperm function trade-offs, and altered morphology—with potential impacts on exposed wildlife. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.382,,30743111,NA,contextspecific behavioural changes induced by exposure to an androgenic endocrine disruptor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, short-term effects of fluoxetine exposure were analysed in the common goby Pomatoschistus microps, an estuarine resident fish species. Two experiments were conducted with fish exposed to: i)fluoxetine concentrations within the μg/L range for 96 h (0.1, 0.5, 10 and 100 μg/L)and ii)fluoxetine concentrations within the mg/L range for 1 h (1, 5 and 10 mg/L). Acute toxicity was assessed via multiple biomarker responses, namely: activity levels of antioxidant (superoxide dismutase and catalase)and detoxification enzymes (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and glutathione S-transferase); and biomarkers of effects (lipid peroxidation and DNA damage)and of neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase inhibition). Furthermore, behavioural responses concerning activity (active time, movement delay and number of active individuals)and feeding (number of feeding individuals)were also recorded and analysed. Acute fluoxetine exposure for 96 h (in the μg/L range)reduced antioxidant CAT activity with increasing concentrations but had no significant effect on SOD activity. Biotransformation enzymes showed bell-shaped response curves, suggesting efficient fluoxetine metabolism at concentrations up to 10 μg/L. No significant damage (LPO and DNAd)was observed at both concentration ranges (μg/L and mg/L), yet 1 h exposure to higher fluoxetine concentrations (mg/L range)inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity (up to 37%).

While some evidence supports this assumption in mammals and birds, exposure to certain pyrethroids can affect concentrations of hormones vital to reproduction in fish. Thus, we hypothesized that pyrethroid exposure impacts fish reproductive behavior and the expression of genes associated with reproduction. We tested our hypothesis by examining effects of the widely used pyrethroid pesticide, bifenthrin, on the reproductive behaviors of the broadly distributed livebearing western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis. We exposed sexually mature female fish to one of five environmentally relevant concentrations of bifenthrin and conducted behavioral assays to assess reproductive, social, and space use behaviors before and after exposure. We did not detect changes in behaviors measured in response to bifenthrin. However, exposure was associated with increased expression of an estrogen receptor gene (ER-α) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in brain tissue at bifenthrin concentrations at concentrations of 5.90 and 24.82 ng/L, and 5.90 and 12.21 ng/L, respectively. Our study supports the perspective that the use of multiple endpoints through integrative approaches is essential for understanding the cumulative impact of pollutants.

One such contaminant is the anxiolytic oxazepam, a psychoactive pharmaceutical that is frequently detected in surface waters globally. Despite growing interest in understanding how wildlife respond to anxiolytics, synergistic effects of pharmaceuticals and other abiotic (e.g. temperature) and biotic (e.g. predation risk) stressors remain unclear. Here, using a multi-stressor approach, we investigated effects of 7-day oxazepam exposure (6.5 μg/L) on anxiety-related behaviours in juvenile European perch (Perca fluviatilis). The multi-stressor approach was achieved by exposing perch to oxazepam at two temperatures (10 °C and 18 °C), and at two predation risk regimes—generated using chemical cues from the northern pike (Esox lucius). Our exposures resulted in a successful uptake of the drug from the water, i.e., oxazepam was measured in perch muscle tissue at 50 ± 17 ng/g (mean ± SD). We found significant oxazepam-induced effects on boldness, with 76.7% of the treated fish entering the white background (i.e. ‘exposed’ area where exposure to presumed risks are higher) within the first 5 min, compared to 66.6% of the control fish. We also found a significant effect of temperature on total time spent freezing (i.e. staying motionless). Specifically, fish in the low temperature treatments (oxazepam, predation) froze for longer than fish in high temperatures. Our multi-stressor study is the first to uncover how anxiety-related behaviours in wild juvenile fish are altered by changes in water temperature and perceived predation risk.

In fish, previous studies have shown that both visual and chemical cues play an important role in mate choice. As such, contaminant-induced changes in either transmission or perception of mate choice cues could have direct implications for individual's fitness. One widespread contaminant of environmental concern is 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen used in the contraceptive pill. Here, we investigated the impacts of EE2 exposure (28 days; measured concentration 14 ng/L) on visual and chemical communication in wild guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Using a standard dichotomous mate choice assay, we first gave individual males (either control or EE2-exposed) the opportunity to court two size-matched females (one control and one EE2-exposed) using only visual cues. We then introduced chemical cues of females (control and EE2-exposed) to the trial tank. We found that there was no significant effect of EE2-treatment on total time males spent associating with the females, when given only visual cues. There was, however, a significant effect on male courtship behaviour, with both control and EE2-exposed males spending more time performing ‘sigmoid’ displays towards the visual cues of control females compared to EE2-exposed females. When males were presented with both visual and chemical female cues simultaneously, we found that males spent more time courting control females that were paired with EE2-chemical cues. Not only does our study uncover a previously unknown behavioural impact of EE2-exposure on chemical cues, but demonstrates that EE2-exposure can exert complex effects on visual and chemical communication in a mate choice context. Finally, we contribute to the discussion of intraspecific variability by providing data on the potential trade-offs underpinning contaminant-induced behavioural changes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.01.006,Ethinyl Estradiol;Estradiol,30658282,NA,the endocrine disruptor 17αethinyl estradiol alters male mate choice in a freshwater fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One widespread contaminant of major concern is the antidepressant fluoxetine, which can affect behavioural and physiological processes in non-target species. Despite this, effects of fluoxetine on wildlife behaviour have seldom been investigated across multiple fitness-related contexts, especially at environmentally realistic concentrations. Accordingly, we examined impacts of 35-day fluoxetine exposure at two environmentally relevant concentrations (31 and 374 ng/L) across a suite of fitness-related contexts in wild-caught male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). First, we investigated anxiety-related behaviours (boldness, exploration and activity) in a novel environment (maze arena) and found no significant impacts of exposure. Second, we tested effects of fluoxetine in a reproductive context, including mating behaviour and sperm quality. We found that, relative to controls, fluoxetine exposure resulted in males spending a greater amount of time pursuing females. Further, low-exposed males were more likely to attempt copulation than unexposed males. Lastly, we investigated across-context behavioural correlations, and how fluoxetine exposure might affect such relationships. A significant positive correlation was detected in control fish between activity levels in the maze and time spent pursuing females in the reproductive assay. This relationship was disrupted by fluoxetine at both exposure levels. This is the first evidence that field-detected concentrations of a pharmaceutical pollutant can disturb across-context behavioural correlations in wildlife.

One such pollutant is the antidepressant fluoxetine, which has been detected in surface waters globally at levels that recent studies suggest can alter physiology and behaviour in aquatic organisms. However, wildlife exposed to pharmaceutical contaminants are typically confronted with multiple stressors simultaneously, including predation risk, which is a particularly important natural stressor that can have direct (e.g. mortality) and indirect (e.g. changed prey behaviour) fitness effects. Accordingly, we investigated potential impacts of environmentally realistic fluoxetine exposure on reproductive behaviour in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) under predation risk. Specifically, we tested whether fluoxetine exposure altered mating behaviour in male and female guppies in the presence of either a predatory spangled perch (Leiopotherapon unicolor) or a non-predatory rainbowfish (Melanotaenia splendida) control. We found that fluoxetine and the presence of a predatory spangled perch did not interact to affect reproductive behaviour. We also found that, independent of a predatory threat, fluoxetine exposure altered male mating strategy, with males in the high treatment conducting significantly more coercive ‘sneak’ copulations, whereas the number of courtship displays performed was not significantly affected. Moreover, while fluoxetine exposure did not significantly affect the amount of time that males and females spent following one another, we found that females, but not males, followed a potential partner less when in the presence of the predatory fish. Finally, both sexes reacted to the risk of predation by spending less time in close proximity to a predator than a non-predator. In combination, our findings highlight the capacity of fluoxetine to influence processes of sexual selection at field-realistic concentrations and emphasise the importance of considering multiple stressors when assessing impacts of pharmaceutical pollutants on the behaviour of wildlife. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.09.046,Fluoxetine;Prednisolone,30212693,NA,the pharmaceutical pollutant fluoxetine alters reproductive behaviour in a fish independent of predation risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because some pharmaceuticals are designed to modulate human behaviour, measuring the impacts of exposure to pharmaceuticals on fish behaviour has become a valuable endpoint. While laboratory studies have shown that pharmaceuticals can affect fish behaviour, there is a lack of understanding if behaviour is similarly affected in natural environments. Here, we exposed sea trout (Salmo trutta) smolts to two concentrations of two pharmaceutical pollutants often detected in surface waters: temazepam (a benzodiazepine, anxiolytic) or irbesartan (an angiotensin II receptor blocker, anti-hypertensive). We tested the hypothesis that changes to behavioural traits (anxiety and activity) measured in laboratory trials following exposure are predictive of behaviour in the natural environment (downstream migration). Measures of anxiety and activity in the laboratory assay did not vary with temazepam treatment, but temazepam-exposed fish began migrating faster in the field. Activity in the laboratory assay did predict overall migration speed in the field. In contrast to temazepam, we found that irbesartan exposure did not affect behaviour in the laboratory, field, or the relationship between the two endpoints. However, irbesartan was also not readily taken up into fish tissue (i.e. below detection levels in the muscle tissue), while temazepam bioconcentrated (bioconcentration factor 7.68) rapidly (t1/2 &lt; 24 h). Our findings add to a growing literature showing that benzodiazepine pollutants can modulate fish behaviour and that laboratory assays may be less sensitive at detecting the effects of pollutants compared to measuring effects in natural settings. Therefore, we underscore the importance of measuring behavioural effects in the natural environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.11.028,,30576864,NA,investigating tissue bioconcentration and the behavioural effects of two pharmaceutical pollutants on sea trout salmo trutta in the laboratory and field,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One HPG of particular concern is 17β-trenbolone, which is persistent in freshwater habitats and can affect the development, morphology and reproductive behaviors of aquatic organisms. Despite this, few studies have investigated impacts of 17β-trenbolone on non-reproductive behaviors linked to growth and survival, like boldness and predator avoidance. None consider the interaction between 17β-trenbolone and other environmental stressors, such as temperature, although environmental challenges confronting animals in the wild seldom, if ever, occur in isolation. Accordingly, this study aimed to test the interactive effects of trenbolone and temperature on organismal behavior. To do this, eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were subjected to an environmentally-relevant concentration of 17β-trenbolone (average measured concentration 3.0 ± 0.2 ng/L) or freshwater (i.e. control) for 21 days under one of two temperatures (20 and 30 °C), after which the predator escape, boldness and exploration behavior of fish were tested. Predator escape behavior was assayed by subjecting fish to a simulated predator strike, while boldness and exploration were assessed in a separate maze experiment. We found that trenbolone exposure increased boldness behavior. Interestingly, some behavioral effects of trenbolone depended on temperature, sex, or both. Specifically, significant effects of trenbolone on male predator escape behavior were only noted at 30 °C, with males becoming less reactive to the simulated threat. Further, in the maze experiment, trenbolone-exposed fish explored the maze faster than control fish, but only at 20 °C. We conclude that field detected concentrations of 17β-trenbolone can impact ecologically important behaviors of fish, and such effects can be temperature dependent. Such findings underscore the importance of considering the potentially interactive effects of other environmental stressors when investigating behavioral effects of environmental contaminants.

However, despite being shown to alter key fitness-related processes (e.g., development, reproduction) in various non-target species, relatively little is known about the potential for HGPs to alter ecologically important behaviours, especially across multiple contexts.

First, we found that 17β-trenbolone-exposed fish were more active and exploratory in a novel environment (i.e., maze arena), while boldness (i.e., refuge use) was not significantly affected. Second, when tested for sociability, exposed fish spent less time in close proximity to a shoal of stimulus (i.e., unexposed) conspecific females and were, again, found to be more active. Third, when assayed for foraging behaviour, exposed fish were faster to reach a foraging zone containing prey items (chironomid larvae), quicker to commence feeding, spent more time foraging, and consumed a greater number of prey items, although the effect of exposure on certain foraging behaviours was dependent on fish size. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential for exposure to sub-lethal levels of veterinary pharmaceuticals to alter sensitive behavioural processes in wildlife across multiple contexts, with potential ecological and evolutionary implications for exposed populations.

Male guppies prefer to mate with larger females because such females are generally more fecund. Hence, males gain direct fitness benefits by being choosy.

Comparatively little consideration has been given to the potential behavioral impacts of exposure, which may also have fitness consequences for individuals. Moreover, MPs can serve as vectors for endocrine-disrupting chemicals and other locally co-occurring contaminants known to impair behavioral responses. This project aimed to determine whether MPs alone or in association with a common environmental EDC (17-alpha ethinyl estradiol; EE2) alter reproductive behavior and decision-making in fish. Male and female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed to MPs associated with either a low (10 ng/L; MPEE2 10) or high (50 ng/L, MPEE2 50) concentration of EE2, or MPs without EE2 (MPvirgin) for 30 days via a dietary feeding protocol. Behavioral trials were conducted on Day 31 to determine the effects of exposure on male–female social interactions. The expression of male sexually selected traits, including courtship, was unaffected by exposure. However, non-exposed females in all treatment groups trended toward discrimination against exposed males, which reached statistical significance for the MPEE2 50 group. Female fish exposed to MPs, alone or in association with EE2, were equally likely to approach and associate with non-exposed and exposed males. The results from this study suggest that MPs may alter social behavior in fishes and that the behavioral impacts of exposure may be more strongly pronounced in females than males.

Untreated effluent–exposed fish showed extremely altered behaviour (air gulping, erratic and speedy movements, increased opercular activity) and morphology (deposition of dyes on skin and scales, high pigmentation, mucus exudation). Significantly increased micronuclei (1.61-, 1.28-, 1.38-fold) and aberrant cell frequency (1.37-, 1.45-, 1.28-fold) was observed in untreated group as compared to treated group after 15, 30, and 45 days of exposure. Tail length, % tail intensity, tail moment and olive tail moment were also enhanced in all the exposed tissues. However, maximum damage was noticed in gill tissues showing 1.19-, 1.37-, 1.34- and 1.50-fold increased TL, %TI, TM and OTM in untreated group as compared to treated group after 45 days of exposure. On comparing untreated and treated groups, increased blood parameters and significantly reduced white blood cell count (WBC) were noticed in treated group. Significantly enhanced alterations in biochemical parameters were also analysed in untreated group. Reduced alterations in enzymological levels of fishes exposed to treated effluent indicate lesser toxic nature of the degraded metabolites of dye. Histological analysis in fishes exposed to untreated effluent showed several deformities in liver (necrosis, congestion, fusion of cells and melanomacrophage infiltration) and gill tissues (necrosis, bending of lamellae and severe aneurysm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis further reaffirmed the pathologies observed in histological analysis. Fewer structural alterations were noticed in treated effluent fishes. The results concluded that untreated effluent inflicted toxicity potential on morphology as well as physiological defects in fish, and the severity increased with increasing duration of exposure, whereas reduction in toxicity in microbially treated groups can be analysed for aquacultural purposes owing to their lesser toxic nature. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s11356-023-30057-y,,37824055,NA,assessment of textile industry effluent untreated and microbially treated induced genotoxic haematological biochemical histopathological and ultrastructural alterations in fresh water fish channa punctata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to clarify these research inconsistencies by investigating estrogenicity of biomass extracts from both environmental freshwater blooms and laboratory cyanobacterial and algae cultures by in vitro reporter bioassay. Biomasses of 8 cyanobacterial and 3 algal species from 7 taxonomic orders were extracted and tested. Next to this, samples of environmental water blooms collected from 8 independent water bodies dominated by phytoplankton species previously assessed as laboratory cultures were tested. The results showed undetectable or low estrogenicity of both freshwater blooms and laboratory cultures with E2 equivalent concentration (EEQ) in a range from LOQ up to 4.5 ng EEQ/g of dry mass. Moreover, the co-exposure of biomass extracts with environmentally relevant concentration of model estrogen (steroid hormone 17β-estradiol; E2), commonly occurring in surface waters, showed simple additive interaction. However, some of the biomass extracts elicited partially anti-estrogenic effects in co-exposure with higher E2 concentration. In conclusion, our study documents undetectable or relatively low estrogenic potential of biomass extracts from both environmental freshwater blooms and studied laboratory cultured cyanobacterial and algae species. Nevertheless, in case of very high-density water blooms, even this low estrogenicity (detected for two cyanobacterial species) could lead to EEQ content in biomass reaching effect-based trigger values indicating potential risk, if recalculated per water volume at field sites. However, these levels would not occur in water under realistic environmental scenarios and the potential estrogenic effects would be most probably minor compared to other toxic effects caused by massive freshwater blooms of such high densities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140015,Estrogens,37657694,NA,potential risk of estrogenic compounds produced by water blooms to aquatic environment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven locations of varying distance to the WWTPs were included. Twelve genes involved in xenobiotic defense (CYP1A, HSP70), thyroid function (DIO1), lipid and glucose metabolism (FABP1, FASN, GLUT2, PPAR (Formula presented.), PPAR (Formula presented.)), protein synthesis (18S rRNA, RPS4X), and reproduction (ER (Formula presented.), VTG) revealed several differences between these impacted sites. A key finding of the present study was that males exhibited VTG transcript levels either equivalent or exceeding female levels of this gene at all sites investigated, indicating widespread exposure of estrogenic contaminants throughout Burrard Inlet. Furthermore, the induction of hepatic CYP1A was observed due to possible downstream sites being subjected to a larger influx of certain planar halogenated and non-halogenated hydrocarbons from multiple industrial contributors. This study also revealed significant differences between the sites examined and in genes involved in transcriptional regulation and synthesis of proteins, lipids and glucose metabolism, and thyroid hormone metabolism.

Fishes are the main group of organisms studied in aquatic toxicology, and their behaviours, including feeding, courtship, parental care, and territoriality, are essential to their health. Cichlids are one of the most abundant fish families and are both economically and ecologically relevant. In this review, we found that metals, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and endocrine disruptor chemicals are the main groups of pollutants that have been studied in the context of cichlid behaviour. African tilapias are the most evaluated cichlids on this topic, and Nile tilapia was the most frequently studied species. Exposure to these pollutants has been shown to affect cichlid fish behaviours in aspects including erratic swimming, activity versus inactivity, preference for the bottom and/or the surface of the tank, aggressiveness, feeding, predation, and reproduction. Oxidative stress, failures in neurotransmission, energetic imbalances, and histopathological damage are among the most common mechanisms underlying the behavioural changes. It is necessary to establish a set of integrative criteria for evaluating the ecotoxicological behaviour of cichlid fish, given the current lack of standardised methods. It is also important to consider more pollutants—both individually and in combination—such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluoroalkyl substances, and microplastics, due the increasing relevance of these pollutants of emerging concern. In line with this, cichlid fish species with reduced native distributions are suitable study species to provide information for the conservation of freshwater environments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",,10.1007/s10641-022-01376-9,,NA,NA,effects of chemical pollution on the behaviour of cichlid fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few studies have focused on cholesterol and reproductive health. To investigate the toxic effects of different cholesterol levels on the spermatogenesis of rare minnows, we regulate the cholesterol content in fish by feeding them a high-cholesterol diet and cholesterol inhibitor pravastatin, and cholesterol levels, sex hormone (T and 11KT) levels, testis histology, sperm morphology and function, and the expression of genes related to sex hormone synthesis were investigated. The research findings indicate that increasing cholesterol levels significantly increases the liver weight and hepatic–somatic index, as well as the total cholesterol and free cholesterol levels in the testis, liver, and plasma of rare minnow, while inhibiting cholesterol has the opposite effect (p < 0.05). However, both increasing and decreasing cholesterol levels can suppress rare minnow testicular development, as evidenced by a decrease in testis weight, lowered gonadosomatic index, suppressed sex hormone levels, and reduced mature sperm count. Further exploration revealed that the expression of sex hormone synthesis-related genes, including star, cyp19a1a, and hsd11b2, was significantly affected (p < 0.05), which may be an important reason for the decrease in sex hormone synthesis and consequent inhibition of testicular development. At the same time, the fertilization ability of mature sperm in both treatment groups significantly decreased. Scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence polarization tests showed that reducing cholesterol levels significantly increased the rate of sperm head cell membrane damage, while both increasing and decreasing cholesterol levels led to a reduction in sperm cell membrane fluidity, which may be the main reason for the decrease in sperm fertilization ability. This study demonstrates that both increasing and decreasing the levels of cholesterol are detrimental to the fish spermatogenesis, providing fundamental information for the study of fish reproduction and also a reference for the causes of male reproductive dysfunction. © 2023 by the authors.",,10.3390/ijms24087492,"Spermatogenesis;Cholesterol, Dietary",37108655,NA,effects of dietary cholesterol regulation on spermatogenesis of gobiocypris rarus rare minnow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EDCs are pervasive in our environment, in particular in our waterways, making aquatic wildlife especially vulnerable to their effects. Many of these EDCs are able to bind to and activate oestrogen receptors, causing aberrant oestrogen signalling. Craniofacial development is an oestrogen-sensitive process, with oestrogen receptors expressed in chondrocytes during critical periods of development. Previous studies have demonstrated a negative effect of high concentrations of oestrogen on early craniofacial patterning in the aquatic model organism, the zebrafish (Danio rerio). In order to determine the impacts of exposure to an oestrogenic EDC, we exposed zebrafish larvae and juveniles to either a high concentration to replicate previous studies, or a low, environmentally relevant concentration of the oestrogenic contaminant, 17α-ethinylestradiol. The prolonged / chronic exposure regimen was used to replicate that seen by many animals in natural waterways. We observed changes to craniofacial morphology in all treatments, and most strikingly in the larvae-juveniles exposed to a low concentration of EE2. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the developmental stage at which exposure occurs can greatly impact phenotypic outcomes, and these results allow us to understand the widespread impact of oestrogenic endocrine disruptors.

However, figures from around the world show that more than half of all pharmaceuticals prescribed, administered, or sold are disposed of incorrectly. When pharmaceuticals are used improperly or misused, it can have a substantial negative impact on ecosystems and species, especially when unused medications are improperly disposed of. Drug manufacturing industries are one of the important sources of environmental pollution.Pharmaceuticals cannot be removed from wastewater using a single technology.Drug manufacturing chemicals cannot be removed from wastewater treatment facilities; as a result, these chemicals seep into aquatic systems. The main pathway of chemicals into the aquatic environment is through the disposal of effluents from wastewater treatment plants. Pharmaceutical industrial wastewater contains significantly higher levels of pollutants because of the presence of organic matter, which is non-biodegradable. Several studies and data analysis have identified specific chemical components that are toxic to living species. The presence of pharmaceutical effluents in environment is alarming due to their highly toxic nature, which includes genotoxicity and mutagenic potential. Severe pollution occurs when wastewater that has not been properly treated is released into an aquatic environment. These effluents pollute the environment in a way that harms human health, economic growth, and aquatic ecosystems. As more and more treated wastewater is used to irrigate crops for sustainable water management, resistant bacteria might find their way into our food. Complex pharmacological mixes may change behaviour, accumulate in tissues, cause reproductive harm, and impede cell growth when exposed to them over an extended period of time at low concentrations. Research suggests that human reproductive systems may get affected when exposed to pharmaceuticals and other xenobiotics in potable water. These effluents exhibited various chromosomal aberrations, namely c-mitosis, chromosome loss, chromosome break, micro-nucleated cells, etc., indicating the poisonous and genotoxic effects of pollutants present in the pharmaceutical waste water. Thus, we can say that pharmaceutical industries are producing lifesaving drugs on one hand but also producing life threatening wastes and effluents on the other hand. © 2023 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

These differences put into a central play the understanding of variations in the mechanisms of toxic action. To address such a broad question, a global systems toxicology approach is fundamental, from genome diversity to the physiological and functional module integration, notably in the context of human-derived environmental settings. Animals exhibit conserved and divergent sensitivities to external stimuli. Yet, neither is the extent of genetic variation underlying such dissimilar responses is far from fully assessed nor is the contribution of evolutionary processes. Thus, considering this physiological range a simple, yet intrinsically complex question, arises: how do man-made chemicals “exploit” the physiological animal biodiversity? Metazoa endocrine systems encompass an intricate network of signaling cascades that, when disturbed beyond their homeostatic regulation, leads to episodes of disruption with developmental and physiological impairment. A flurry of studies has disclosed the harmful effects resulting from the environmental exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). EDCs act in many cases as high-affinity ligands of transcription factors, the nuclear receptors (NRs). Several studies have revealed NR exploitation (agonist/antagonist) by EDCs, with dire outcomes. Importantly, a variable NR gene repertoire has been found in different Metazoa lineages, mostly with unknown repercussions on mechanisms of endocrine function. Decisively also, is whether orthologous receptors and enzymes remained functionally stable over evolutionary time scales. Besides a handful of model animal species, our knowledge remains extremely sparse and fragmented. In this chapter, we explore the case of NR as an instructive test case to investigate the relevance of genome biodiversity and of multilevel approaches to understand the mode of action of xenobiotics. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Growth and behavior of larvae as evidenced by locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviors were measured 8 d after EE2 treatment and a depuration period of 20 d. Exposure to 0.5 nM EE2 induced a significant increase in cyp19a1b expression levels, while upregulation of gnrh2, kiss1, and cyp19a1b expression was noted after 8 d at 50 nM EE2. Standard length at the end of the exposure phase was significantly lower in larvae exposed to 50 nM EE2 than in control; however, this effect was no longer observed after the depuration phase. The upregulation of gnrh2, kiss1, and cyp19a1b expression levels was found in conjunction with elevation in locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviors in larvae.

ATZ is one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and a known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). The behavior of sailfin mollies is well documented in the scientific literature. Moreover, they are ecologically important indicators of environmental health, widely distributed among the mangroves along the Gulf Coast of the Southeastern US where significant amounts of ATZ are introduced via runoff and storm water drainage from coastal households, businesses, and farms. Four sets of experiments designed to assess ATZ’s impact on various aspects of male and female reproductive behavior, aggression, anxiety, and boldness were conducted following 12 weeks of exposure to 1 or 15 ppb water-borne ATZ, along with a no-exposure control group. Results indicated that the behavior of ATZ-exposed individuals differed from those of controls: ATZ exposure affected which stimulus fish (a male vs. a female) subject females preferred to associate with while also affecting female strength of preference for males of larger body size and their sexual receptivity to conspecific males in general. ATZ-exposed males also showed reduced overall responsiveness to conspecific stimuli and directed significantly less aggression toward their mirror image compared with controls. Finally, ATZ exposure affected multiple aspects of male and female behavior that are often used as proxies for boldness and anxiety. Overall, ATZ exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behaviors attributed to sexual receptivity, mate choice and motivation to mate, aggression, as well as boldness and anxiety. These ATZ-induced behavioral changes may adversely affect the long-term health of natural populations exposed to similar, environmentally realistic concentrations and add to a growing body of empirical data demonstrating substantial fitness consequences of exposure to sublethal concentrations of this known EDC. © 2023 by the author.",,10.3390/w15020306,,NA,NA,environmentally realistic waterborne atrazine exposure affects behavior in poecilia latipinna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to this, the development of highly efficient detection and remediation technologies is required to assess the contamination by EOCs. Traditional detection methods and remediation technologies have some major drawbacks, like high-cost and time-intensive methodologies that are needed to overcome to assess the growing contamination of marine environments. The use of electrochemical sensors, especially electrochemical biosensors, is a promising alternative for in situ monitoring the concentration of EOCs. Regarding the degradation of EOCs, the role of technologies employed at WWTPs is crucial to reduce the discharge of contaminants to marine ecosystems.

These wastes have complex matrices, necessitating the implementation of in vivo and in vitro tests in order to investigate their estrogenic effects. However, most current in vivo methods are limited by the toxic effect of livestock waste due to their high concentrations of organic matter. Here we propose a novel in vivo microinjection method which is able to avoid this limitation. In this study, the estrogen content of slurry-based irrigation water extracts from dairy cattle farms was examined using a classical in vitro and the newly developed in vivo method. The limitations of the in vitro system, with its absence of endogenous steroid hormone receptors and subsequent lack of elucidating complex interactions involving the estrogen receptor (ER), are complemented by the in vivo fish test, which allows for a more complete assessment of estrogenicity and toxicity to vertebrate animals. In vitro screenings were performed with the ISO 19040–1:2018 Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES). The YES test showed estrogenic activity in all 32 tested samples, which ranged from 5 to 50518 ng/L in EEQ (E2-Estradiol equivalents). The in vivo microinjection method was developed using a Tg(vtg1:mCherry) transgenic zebrafish embryo model. This model is able to eliminate secondary symptoms of hypoxia that may occur during normal aqueous exposure to high organic matter extracts. Using the microinjection method, a total of 12 samples, out of the 32 samples examined, presented no observable estrogenic effects in fish embryos based on integrated density values. In samples where the fish test showed no estrogenic effect, the liver of the larvae was significantly damaged due to sample toxicity. Our results clearly show that the combination of these methods provides a highly effective screening tool for samples containing high concentrations of organic matter. © 2022 The Authors",,10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107830,Microinjections;Estrogens;Yeasts,NA,NA,microinjection based zebrafish embryo test for the detection of estrogenic substances in slurry based irrigation water and its combined application with yeast estrogen screen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our findings reveal that both species presented some degree of reproductive disturbance when inhabiting an affected site, but the specific alterations differed depending on the species, sex, and season. During the reproductive season, 17β-estradiol levels were elevated in females of both species living in polluted areas, while no differences in androgen levels were observed in either species or season. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) was affected in both sexes of S. oculatus during the non-reproductive season, while the gonadal stages were mainly affected in both sexes of P. brasilianus.

Laboratory studies have shown that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of metformin can alter metabolic pathways and impact the growth of early life stage (ELS) fish; however, it is unknown whether these effects occur in wild populations. Herein, we evaluate whether findings from laboratory studies are representative and describe the relative sensitivities of both populations. Duplicate exposures (0, 5, or 50 μg/L metformin) were conducted using wild- and lab-spawned fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryos. Apart from the water source, exposure conditions remained constant. Wild embryos were exposed to previously dosed lake water to account for changes in bioavailability, while reconstituted freshwater was used for the laboratory study. Developmental metformin exposure differentially impacted the growth and morphology of both cohorts, with energy dyshomeostasis and visual effects indicated. The fitness of wild-spawned larvae was impacted to a greater extent relative to lab-spawned fish. Moreover, baseline data reveal important morphological differences between wild- and lab-spawned ELS fatheads that may diminish representativeness of lab studies. Findings also confirm the bioavailability of metformin in naturally occurring systems and suggest current exposure scenarios may be sufficient to negatively impact developing fish. © 2022 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acs.est.2c01079,Metformin,35748754,NA,comparative effects of embryonic metformin exposure on wild and laboratoryspawned fathead minnow pimephales promelas populations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this manuscript we have collected information on the adverse effects of pollutants (heavy metals, environmental steroids, and agrochemicals), present in Chascomús lake, Argentina, either at environmentally relevant and pharmacological concentrations on reproduction, embryonic development, and larval survival of pejerrey fish Odontesthes bonariensis. During development, it has been reported that 17β-estradiol (E2) feminized and reduced larval survival, while 17α-ethinyl-estradiol (EE2) not only feminized but also affected both embryo and larval survival. In adult male fish, treatments with EE2 and E2 + EE2 were able to increase mRNA abundance of gnrh3 and cyp19a1b and decreased those of gonadotropin receptors (fshr and lhcgr). Heavy metals such as cadmium, chromium, and copper negatively affected sperm quality, diminishing the motility. Also, a decrease in the percentage of hatching rate and larval survival was also observed with the same metals, highlighting zinc as the most detrimental metal. Furthermore, all these metals altered the expression of hypothalamic and pituitary genes related to reproduction in male pejerrey (gnrh1,2,3; cyp19a1b; fshb; lhb; fshr and, lhcgr). Moreover, in all cases pyknotic cells, corresponding to the degeneration of the germ cells, were observed in the testes of exposed fish. For agrochemicals, exposure of male pejerrey to environmental concentrations of glyphosate did not cause alterations on the endocrine reproductive axis. However, male pejerrey with gonadal abnormalities such as the presence of intersex (testis-ova) gonads were found in other Pampa´s lakes with high concentrations of atrazine and glyphosate associated with soybean and corn crops near their coasts. These types of studies demonstrate that pejerrey, an endemic species with economic importance inhabiting the Pampas shallow lakes, can be used as a sentinel species. It should be noted that increased pollution of aquatic ecosystems and the effects on the reproduction of organisms can lead to a decline in fish populations worldwide. Which, added to overfishing and other external factors such as global warming, could cause an eventual extinction of an emblematic species.

These pharmaceuticals have been marketed as mood-altering drugs, specifically targeting the monoaminergic signaling in the brain of humans. However, the monoaminergic systems are highly conserved and involved in the modulation of a multitude of endocrine functions in vertebrates. While most studies exploring possible impact of antidepressants on fish have focused on behavioural perturbations, a smaller spotlight has been placed on the endocrine functions, especially related to reproduction, growth, and the stress response. The purpose of this review is to highlight the possible role of antidepressants as endocrine disruptors in fish. While studies linking the effects of environmentally relevant levels of antidepressant on the endocrine system in fish are sparse, the emerging evidence suggests that early-life exposure to these compounds have the potential to alter the developmental programming of the endocrine system, which could persist as long-term and multigenerational effects in teleosts.

A test of the vector hypothesis,2022,1,1,,20457758,12,2,,"Swank A., Blevins K., Bourne A., Ward J.",,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,"Microplastics (MPs) are widespread in aquatic environments and have become a critical environmental issue in recent years due to their adverse impacts on the physiology, reproduction, and survival of aquatic animals. Exposure to MPs also has the potential to induce sub-lethal behavioral changes that can affect individual fitness, but these effects are understudied. Many plastic additives introduced during the manufacture of MPs are known endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that mimic the action of natural hormones, alter sexual and competitive behavior, and impair reproductive success in fish. In addition, EDCs and other aquatic contaminants may adhere to MPs in the environment, the latter of which may serve as transport vectors for these compounds (i.e., the vector hypothesis). In this study, we staged territorial contests between control males, and males exposed to virgin MP particles or to MPs previously immersed in one of two environmentally relevant concentrations of 17-alpha ethinyl estradiol (EE2; 5 ng/L and 25 ng/L) to evaluate the independent and synergistic effects of exposure to MPs and a common environmental estrogen on male–male aggression and competitive territory acquisition in a freshwater fish, Pimephales promelas. Short-term (30 days) dietary exposure to MPs did not impair the ability of males to successfully compete for and obtain a breeding territory. Overall levels of aggression in control and exposed males were also similar across trial series. These results help to fill a critical knowledge gap regarding the direct and indirect (vector-borne) effects of MPs on the reproductive behavior of aquatic vertebrates in freshwater systems. © 2022 The Authors.

The identification of indirect biomarkers of effect could be a key factor in determining early adverse outcomes from exposure to low doses of BPA. Thus, this study on mice aims to evaluate and identify indirect biomarkers of effect through the analysis of their blood biochemistry, and of certain reproduction parameters after exposure to different BPA concentrations (0.5, 2, 4, 50, and 100 µg/kg BW/day) in drinking water over generations. Our results showed that there were no modifications in the reproductive parameters evaluated, like estrous cycle duration, litter size, or the percentage of the young alive at reaching the weaning stage, at the exposure levels evaluated. However, there were modifications in the biochemical parameters, e.g., alterations in the glucose levels, that increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the breeders at the higher exposure doses (50 and 100 µg/kg BW/day in F1; 50 µg/kg BW/day in F2 and 100 µg/kg BW/day in F3), that would suggest that the BPA could induce hyperglycemia and its complications in adult animals, probably due to some damage in the pancreas cells; albumin, that increased in the breeders exposed to the highest dose in F1 and F3, inferring possible hepatic alterations. Further, total proteins showed a diminution in their values in F1 and F2, except the group exposed to 100 µg/kg BW/day, whereas in F3 the values of this parameter increased with respect to the control group, this aspect likely being related to a possible hepatic and renal alteration. Based on these results, glucose, albumin, and total proteins could initially be considered as early indicators of indirect effect after prolonged exposure to low BPA doses over generations. © 2022 by the authors.

The emphasis of the research was on the negative effects of mercaptophos exposure on Cyprinus carpio. Fish were subjected to sub-lethal amounts of mercaptophos at low (0.83 ppm) and high (2.1 ppm) concentrations for 12, 24, 48, and 96 h. The levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyl (PC), and glutathione (GSH) were tested in the fish liver. Plasma cortisol and testosterone levels, as well as a histological examination of liver tissue, were also assessed. C. carpio treated with mercaptophos had lower testosterone levels and higher cortisol levels at all time intervals. Mercaptophos exhibited oxidative stress in C. carpio, which causes a time-and concentration-dependent augmentation of liver LPO and PC levels, which is linked to hepatic GSH depletion. A low concentration of mercaptophos caused atrophy of pancreatic acinar cells as well as the detection of karyolysis nuclei, according to histological alterations in hepatic tissue. Treatment with a high dosage of mercaptophos resulted in hypertrophy of Kupffer cells as well as coagulative necrosis of pancreatic tissue. Furthermore, short-term mercaptophos exposure reduced testosterone and cortisol levels in C. carpio, which are associated with the development of oxidative stress. Changes in hormone levels and oxidative stress markers in C. carpio may therefore aid in the prediction of disease. © 2021 The Authors",,10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100959,Oxidation-Reduction;Biological Markers,NA,NA,mercaptophos impacts on redox status biomarkers of common carp cyprinus carpio as an endocrine disruptor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This triggered the need for more EU-wide surface water monitoring data on these micropollutants, before they can be considered for inclusion in the list of priority substances regularly monitored in aquatic ecosystems. The revision of the priority substance list of the WFD offers the opportunity to incorporate more holistic bioanalytical approaches, such as effect-based monitoring, alongside single substance chemical monitoring. Effect-based methods (EBMs) are able to measure total biological activities (e.g., estrogenic activity or cyxlooxygenase [COX]-inhibition) of specific group of substances (such as estrogens and NSAIDs) in the aquatic environment at low concentrations (pg/L). This makes them potential tools for a cost-effective and ecotoxicologically comprehensive water quality assessment. In parallel, the use of such methods could build a bridge from chemical status assessments towards ecological status assessments by adressing mixture effects for relevant modes of action. Our study aimed to assess the suitability of implementing EBMs in the WFD, by conducting a large-scale sampling and analysis campaign of more than 70 surface waters across Europe. This resulted in the generation of high-quality chemical and effect-based monitoring data for the selected Watch List substances.

Comparison between effect-based and conventional analytical chemical methods showed that the chemical analytical approach for steroidal estrogens resulted in more (76%) non-quantifiable data, i.e., concentrations were below detection limits, compared to the EBMs (28%).

VTG mRNA in the liver of reproductively mature female samples was isolated, amplified, and sequenced. There were 430 bp fragments of VTG, corresponding to a 143 amino acid sequence obtained from eyebrow goby. The partial protein sequence exhibited similar identities with the phosvitin motif of VTG in other gobies.

Specifically, we provide examples of how endocrine signals are used to guide the development of conservation hatcheries, to reveal how exposure to environmental stressors can affect development and growth, to enable assisted reproduction, to mitigate the impacts of climate change and endocrine-disrupting chemicals on fish reproduction, and to facilitate the management of invasive species. We also examine how non-invasive sampling techniques, profiling of steroid hormones, and the integration of endocrinology with emerging fields such as ecotoxicogenomics and host-microbiome interactions will have impacts on future conservation efforts. Finally, we identify limitations for the broader application of endocrinology in fish conservation and opportunities for fish endocrinologists to make meaningful contributions to the most urgent conservation challenges of our time. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/bs.fp.2022.04.006,Endocrinology,NA,NA,applied aspects of fish endocrinology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EDCs are leading to the degradation of fish habitats, reducing their spawning potential and possibly their population parameters (e.g. growth, maturation), by preventing fish from breeding and rebuilding their populations. Therefore, search-ing for new welfare indicators such as AVT and IT and developing research procedures mimicking environmental conditions using a versatile fish model is extremely important. Discussion: Fish species such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) and round goby (Neogobius melanosto-mus) can be recommended as very suitable models for studying estrogenic EDCs on the AVT/IT system and other hormones involved in the neuroendocrine regulation of physiological processes in fish. Conclusion: These studies would not only improve our understanding of the effects of EDCs on vertebrates but could also help safeguard the well-being of aquatic and terrestrial organisms from the harmful effects of these compounds. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.",,10.2174/1871530321666210202150947,Vasotocin;Arginine,33530920,NA,endocrinedisrupting compounds in fish physiology with emphasis on their effects on the arginine vasotocinisotocin system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using estrogen biosensor zebrafish models, we found that estrogen activity in the embryonic brain occurs from early neurogenesis specifically in a type of glia in the olfactory bulb (OB), which we name estrogen-responsive olfactory bulb (EROB) cells. In response to estrogen, EROB cells overlay the outermost layer of the OB and interact tightly with olfactory sensory neurons at the olfactory glomeruli. Inhibiting estrogen activity using an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI182, 780 (ICI), and/or EROB cell ablation impedes olfactory glomerular development, including the topological organisation of olfactory glomeruli and inhibitory synaptogenesis in the OB. Furthermore, activation of estrogen signalling inhibits both intrinsic and olfaction-dependent neuronal activity in the OB, whereas ICI or EROB cell ablation results in the opposite effect on neuronal excitability. Altering the estrogen signalling disrupts olfaction-mediated behaviour in later larval stage. We propose that estrogens act on glia to regulate development of OB circuits, thereby modulating the local excitability in the OB and olfaction-mediated behaviour. © 2022.

This is because the conventional wastewater treatment methods are inefficient in identifying and removing such contaminants. Aiming for a long-term, effective solution to this issue, Adsorption was proposed. Although several adsorbents are already present in the market, which have proved beneficial in removing such ECs, not all are affordable.

This was achieved using integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, along with histopathological examinations. Sharpbelly, an indigenous freshwater fish widely distributed in East Asia, were collected by pole fishing from three sampling sites in the Ba River. These sampling sites include a mid-stream site near a wastewater outfall and a reference site located upstream and a far field comparison site located downstream. In sharpbelly collected near the wastewater discharge, the oocyte development was activated, compared to the other two sites. Histopathological alterations in the fish ovaries were likely due to the upregulated steroid hormone biosynthesis process, as suggested by the differentially expressed genes (e.g., hsd3b, hsd17b1) and differentially accumulated metabolites (e.g., pregnenolone). Additionally, under the stress of effluents containing phenolic compounds, genes related to the signaling pathways for oxidative phosphorylation and leukocyte transendothelial migration were dysregulated, suggesting the potential induction of inflammation and several ovarian diseases. Overall, these findings suggest that effluents containing phenolic compounds influence ovary development and reproductive function of female sharpbelly. Whether there is any resulting dysfunction of folliculogenesis, abnormality of ovulation, production of premature eggs and/or potential induction of ovarian cancers remains to be determined by further studies, for a better evaluation on effluents containing phenolic compounds to the fish fertility and the health of their offspring, and even the stability of the wild fish population.

A decrease in reproductive success and neurobehavioral impairment are well-documented signs of endocrine disruption in animals and humans. Phthalates are a large class of chemicals that have a wide range of industrial applications, including plastics manufacturing, food packaging, children’s toys, medical equipments, cosmetics and personal care products. The presence of phthalates and their metabolites in serum, urine, semen, and breast milk have been widely reported. Studies in human and animal populations have proved that phthalates may induce changes in puberty, the development of testicular dysgenesis syndrome, neurodevelopmental and neurobehvioral abnormalities, cancer, and fertility disorders in both males and females. To inhibit microbial growth and extend product shelf life, parabens are frequently used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, personal care products and as food additives. Studies have confirmed that the ubiquitous presence of parabens may be linked to infertility, neurodevelopmental disorders, carcinogenesis, spermatogenesis, and pregnancy. At the hormonal level, these chemicals can disrupt the release of hypothalamic, pituitary, and peripheral hormones. At the intracellular level, they can interfere with nuclear receptors, membrane receptors, intracellular signaling pathways, and modulate gene expression.

A. ocellaris display post-maturational sex change from male to female in nature. Sexually immature, male fish were paired together and fed twice daily with normal food (control), food containing BPA (100 μg/kg), or EE2 (0.02 μg/kg) (n = 9 pairs/group). Aggression toward an intruder male was measured at 1, 3, and 6 months. Blood was collected at 3 and 6 months to measure estradiol (E2), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), and Vtg. At the end of the study, fish were euthanized to assess gonad morphology and to measure expression of known sexually dimorphic genes in the brain. Relative to control, BPA decreased aggression, altered brain transcript levels, increased non-vitellogenic and vitellogenic eggs in the gonad, reduced 11-KT, and increased plasma Vtg. In two BPA-treated pairs, both individuals had vitellogenic eggs, which does not naturally occur. EE2 reduced 11-KT in subordinate individuals and altered expression of one transcript in the brain toward the female profile.

Previous studies on HF-FPW have demonstrated various toxicological responses of aquatic organisms as consequences of combined exposure to high salinity, dissolved organic compounds and particle/suspended solids-bound pollutants. Noteworthy is the lack of studies illustrating the potentially toxic effects of the FPW suspended solids (FPW-SS). In this study, we investigated the acute and sublethal toxicity of suspended solids filtered from six authentic FPW sample collected from two fracturing wells, using a sediment contact assay based on early-life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio). PAHs profiles and acute toxicity tests provided initial information on the toxic potency of the six samples. Upon exposure to sediment mixture at two selected doses (1.6 and 3.1 mg/mL), results showed adverse effects in larval zebrafish, as revealed by increased Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity. Transcriptional alterations were also observed in xenobiotic biotransformation (ahr, pxr, cyp1a, cyp1b1, cyp1c1, cyp1c2, cyp3a65, udpgt1a1, udpgt5g1), antioxidant response (sod1, sod2, gpx1a, gpx1b) and hormone receptor signaling (esr1, esr2a, cyp19a1a, vtg1) genes. The results demonstrated that even separated from the complex aqueous FPW mixture, FPW-SS can induce toxicological responses in aquatic organisms' early life stages.

These chemical compounds can harm the proliferation of aquatic life causing several problems among which a reduction in population density, biodiversity of species and a variation in fish sex are considered. Due to the similarity between the function of hormone receptor systems in human beings and animals, there is a great concern about the possible human health effects. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are identified as a group of harmful natural and synthetic compounds that are able to mimic endogenous hormones altering their functions, metabolism and biosynthesis. Being lipophilic molecules, many EDCs bind to hydrophobic pouches in steroid receptors, such as the androgen and estrogen receptors, that play a crucial role in vertebrate development and reproduction. Certainly, reproductive dysfunction in fish such as deviated male to female sex ratios, reduced fertility, reproductive tract abnormalities, early puberty, obesity and numerous cancers represent some health effects related to EDCs exposure. EDCs affect a great number of genes transcription, which required the development of new tools to supervise the total EDCs effects. The appearance of immense parallel sequencing for examining gene transcription offers a delicate tool for evaluating the effects of EDCs on humans and vertebrates and elucidates EDCs mode of action. In aquatic life, fish are found to be the principal hazard organisms for EDCs exposure. Zebrafish preserve many developmental pathways similar to that found in humans. Consequently, zebrafish becomes an important model system to study endocrine disruptors, specifically in the early stages of organs development due to the translucence of their embryos. © 2021, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

While laboratory studies suggest that these estrogens should not persist because of fast degradation rates, elevated concentrations in surface waters impacted by agricultural activities are commonly observed. Using a combination of measured data and a stream-hyporheic zone (HZ) model applied to a 100 km reach in a tile-drained catchment, we show that the HZ can increase the persistence of estrogens. Field data reveal high concentrations of sorbed estrogens in sediments and elevated in-stream concentrations during low-flow summer months, suggesting that the HZ acts as a source of estrogens when transport into the streams is minimal. Model results provide further insight into the underlying mechanisms that enable sustained estrogen concentrations in streams, with the HZ acting as a source of dissolved estrogens for 95% of the year. We show that stream water interactions with the HZ may lead to overall suppression of degradation processes and an increase in the persistence of estrogens. Results suggest that when the model considered exchange in the HZ, approximately 28%–49% of estrogen mass remained in the stream ecosystem, while all estrogen mass was degraded in a 100-km reach in the model without the HZ. The remaining mass increased with increasing estrogen sorption coefficient, and this would potentially increase the lag time for lowering estrogen concentrations in surface water bodies even when inputs have ceased. Our findings highlight the importance of including HZ dynamics in estrogen transport models. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

To explore the presence and effects of these EDCs in a natural setting, juvenile and adult male fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, were held in cages upstream and downstream of the effluent site of a wastewater treatment plant for 21 days and subsequently tested for changes in reproductive behaviors and production of vitellogenin. Additionally, estrogenic activity in the stream was measured using a yeast bioassay. Estrogenicity was found to be significantly higher downstream of the wastewater effluent when compared to levels upstream. Vitellogenin levels did not show a correlational pattern with levels of estrogenicity in the water, but two measures of reproductive behaviors occurred significantly less often in downstream males than upstream males. This suggests that a brief (three-week) exposure to stream water containing wastewater treatment plant effluent can bring about changes in reproductive behavior of fish and that behavior may be more sensitive to low levels of environmental endocrine disruptors than vitellogenin production. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of this work is to determine the total concentration and the homological distribution in rivers and there sediments, in central Israel.

The APEOs' concentration level decreases as the sample is taken from a deeper layer of the sediment. A possible explanation for this is that in APEOs molecules, the hydrophilic fraction (CH2-CH2-O) increases the APEOs' absorption into sediment layers close to water, being saturated with water. In addition, the organic biofilm in the sediment layers used as schmutzdecke can reduce the concentration levels of APEOs that penetrates the deep layers of the sediment.

Bisphenol A (BPA), one of the most pervasive endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), is hazardous for reproductive, immune, and neurological systems. However, no evidence of BPA toxicity to the male-pregnant animals is available. Herein, the reproductive toxicity of BPA was evaluated in lined seahorses (Hippocampus erectus) following exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (10, 100, and 1000 μg/L) through physiological, histological, and transcriptional analyses. Our results indicated BPA bioaccumulation to be positively correlated with exposure doses in both sexes. Ovarian failure was only observed in the high-dose BPA treatment group, accompanied by the apoptosis of follicular cells and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes. However, brood pouches maintenance were surprisingly inhibited at low concentration, and transcriptomic analysis revealed disturbed profiles of genes involved in the extracellular matrix and cell-cell adhesion pathways. Interestingly, seahorse testes were less sensitive to BPA exposure than that in other teleosts. Thus, our study suggests that BPA at environmentally relevant concentrations might cause reproductive dysfunction in seahorses, potentially exerting adverse effects on the seahorse population since most of them inhabit shallow coastal areas with prevalent estrogenic contaminants. © 2020",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141805,Hippocampus,32911163,NA,bioaccumulation and reproductive toxicity of bisphenol a in malepregnant seahorse hippocampus erectus at environmentally relevant concentrations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The circadian clock is a transcriptional oscillator responsible for entraining 24-hour rhythms of physiology, behavior and metabolism. Extensive bidirectional cross talk exists between circadian and endocrine systems and circadian rhythmicity is present at all levels of endocrine control, from synthesis and release of hormones, to sensitivity of target tissues to hormone action. In mammals, a range of hormones directly alter clock gene expression and circadian physiology via nuclear receptor (NR) binding and subsequent genomic action, modulating physiological processes such as nutrient and energy metabolism, stress response, reproductive physiology and circadian behavioral rhythms. The potential for EDCs to perturb circadian clocks or circadian-driven physiology is not well characterized. For this reason, we explore evidence for parallel endocrine and circadian disruption following EDC exposure across species. In the reviewed studies, EDCs dysregulated core clock and circadian rhythm network gene expression in brain and peripheral organs, and altered circadian reproductive, behavioral and metabolic rhythms. Circadian impacts occurred in parallel to endocrine and metabolic alterations such as impaired fertility and dysregulated metabolic and energetic homeostasis.

Increased notochord length was seen in 0.001 µM exposed larvae and decreased in 0.1 µM exposed larvae across all age groups. Positive OMR was significantly increased at 1 and 2 weeks post-exposure in larvae exposed to 0.1 µM BPA when they were 72 hpf or 7 dpf, while positive OMR was increased after 2 weeks of recovery in larvae exposed to 0.001 µM BPA at 72 hpf. A time-delayed increase in eye diameter occurred in both BPA treatment groups at 72 hpf exposure; while a transient increase occurred in 7 dpf larvae exposed to 0.1 µM BPA.

rayyan-1227188939,Fish reproductive biology – Reflecting on five decades of fundamental and translational research,2021,1,1,,166480,300,NA,,Zohar Y.,,,Academic Press Inc.,,"Driven by the broad diversity of species and physiologies and by reproduction-related bottlenecks in aquaculture, the field of fish reproductive biology has rapidly grown over the last five decades. This review provides my perspective on the field during this period, integrating fundamental and applied developments and milestones. Our basic understanding of the brain-pituitary–gonadal axis led to overcoming the failure of farmed fish to ovulate and spawn in captivity, allowing us to close the fish life cycle and establish a predictable, year-round production of eggs. Dissecting the molecular and hormonal mechanisms associated with sex determination and differentiation drove technologies for producing better performing mono-sex and reproductively-sterile fish. The growing contingent of passionate fish biologists, together with the availability of innovative platforms such as transgenesis and gene editing, as well as new models such as the zebrafish and medaka, have generated many discoveries, also leading to new insights of reproductive biology in higher vertebrates including humans. Consequently, fish have now been widely accepted as vertebrate reproductive models. Perhaps the best testament of the progress in our discipline is demonstrated at the International Symposia on Reproductive Physiology of Fish (ISRPF), at which our scientific family has convened every four years since the grandfather of the field, the late Ronald Billard, organized the inaugural 1977 meeting in Paimpont, France. As the one person who has been fortunate enough to attend all of these meetings since their inception, I have witnessed first-hand the astounding evolution of our field as we capitalized on the molecular and biotechnological revolutions in the life sciences, which enabled us to provide a higher resolution of fish reproductive and endocrine processes, answer more questions, and dive into deeper comprehension. Undoubtedly, the next (five) decades will be similarly exciting as we continue to integrate physiology with genomics, basic and translational research, and the small fish models with the aquacultured species. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113544,,32615136,NA,fish reproductive biology reflecting on five decades of fundamental and translational research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PFOS has various biological toxicity, especially disturbing the endocrine system. However, few studies have systematically evaluated its effect on sexual behaviors alteration and reproduction-related genes. This study was performed to assess the effect of PFOS exposure on sexual behaviors and genes in hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal–liver (HPGL) axis in adult zebrafish. Methods: Male adult zebrafish were exposed to PFOS (0, 2, 20, and 200 μg/L) and 5 μg/L estradiol (E2) continuously for 21 days. Sexual behaviors were analyzed by zebrafish behavior tracking system and the mRNA levels of HPGL-related genes was detected by RT-qPCR. Results: Body weight of the fish was increased in 2, 200 μg/L PFOS and E2 groups, and body length was increased with exposure to 2 μg/L PFOS and E2. The hepatic-somatic index was decreased significantly after 2 and 20 μg/L PFOS treatments. Highest PFOS (200 μg/L) and E2 exposure impaired standard zebrafish sexual behaviors significantly such as chasing, nose-tail and tail-touching. In brains, the genes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHr) were down-regulated with exposure to PFOS with linear trend and E2 exposure, and follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were also down-regulated with exposure to 20 and 200 μg/L PFOS. In livers, the genes vitellogenin 1 and 3 were upregulated with some concentrations of PFOS and E2, but estrogenic receptor α, β2 were upregulated in any concentration of PFOS and E2. In testes, the expressions of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, luteinizing hormone receptor, and androgen receptor genes were all significantly down-regulated with any exposure concentration of PFOS and E2. Conclusions: PFOS may alter the zebrafish reproductive system by disrupting endocrine activity and impairing sexual behaviors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115585,Sulfones;Liver;Sexual Behavior,33254718,NA,perfluorooctane sulfonate exposure alters sexual behaviors and transcriptions of genes in hypothalamicpituitarygonadalliver axis of male zebrafish danio rerio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, in December of 2016, a field survey was conducted on a C. decemmaculatus population inhabiting the Girado Creek downstream of the Chascomus city wastewater effluent discharge. After 90 d of exposure, EE2 was able to histologically skew the sex ratio toward females and inhibit the full gonopodium development since the lowest tested concentration (LOEC = 30 ng/L). At higher concentrations, EE2 was toxic, inducing mortality in a concentration-dependent fashion (90 d-LC50 = 109.9 ng/L) and altering the gonadal histoarchitecture, causing neither testes nor ovaries discernible histologically (LOEC = 100 ng/L). In addition, a novel response, perianal hyperpigmentation, was discovered been induced by the EE2 exposure in a concentration-dependent fashion (90 d-EC50 = 39.3 ng/L). A higher proportion of females and perianal hyperpigmentation were observed in wild fish collected from the Girado Creek. The major reached conclusions are: i) EE2 induce different effects on the sexual traits of C. decemmaculatus when exposed from early-life or adult stages. ii) The most sensitive effects observed in the laboratory occur in a creek receiving wastewater effluent. iii) The perianal hyperpigmentation comes-up as a promising biomarker of exposure to estrogenic compounds. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111176,Hyperpigmentation;Sex Ratio;Gonads,32846301,NA,effects of 17αethinylestradiol on sex ratio gonadal histology and perianal hyperpigmentation of cnesterodon decemmaculatus pisces poeciliidae during a fulllifecycle exposure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed that BPA concentration in water was negatively correlated to rainfall while NP concentrations in both phases were positively related to rainfall. The spatial distribution of NP in the lake water was season specific with the lakeshore area higher than the central area during the wet season and a reversed pattern during the dry season. The spatial distributions of sediment-associated NP and BPA in both phases were not significantly different among seasons. Contrary partition tendencies were observed for BPA and NP that BPA tended to desorb from sediment and NP tended to be adsorbed during the wet season while the trends were reversed during the dry season.

Freshwater ecosystems are vulnerable to chemical effects and wildlife populations, including fish, can be exposed to concentrations known to cause adverse effects at the individual level. Wild fish populations are also often subjected to numerous other stressors simultaneously which in temperate climates often include sustained periods of food limitation. The potential interactive effects of chemical exposures and food limitation on fish populations are however difficult to establish in the field. Mechanistic modelling approaches can be employed to help predict how the physiological effects of chemicals and food limitation on individuals may translate to population-level effects. Here an energy budget-individual-based model was developed and the control (no chemical) model was validated for the three-spined stickleback. Findings from two endocrine active chemical (EAC) case studies, (ethinyloestradiol and trenbolone) were then used to investigate how effects on individual fecundity translated into predicted population-level effects for environmentally relevant exposures. The cumulative effects of chemical exposure and food limitation were included in these analyses. Results show that effects of each EAC on the population were dependent on energy availability, and effects on population abundance were exacerbated by food limitation. Findings suggest that chemical effects and density dependent food competition interact to determine population responses to chemical exposures. Our study illustrates how mechanistic modelling approaches might usefully be applied to account for specific chemical effects, energy budgets and density-dependent competition, to provide a more integrated evaluation of population outcomes in chemical risk assessments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105483,Food,32408005,NA,applying a mechanistic model to predict interacting effects of chemical exposure and food availability on fish populations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early life exposure to EDCs may permanently alter phenotypes through to adulthood. In addition, the effects of EDCs may not be isolated to a single generation − offspring may indirectly be impacted, via non-genetic processes. Here, we analyzed the effects of paternal atrazine exposure on behavioral traits (distance moved, exploration, bottom-dwelling time, latency to enter the top zone, and interaction with a mirror) and whole-brain mRNA of genes involved in the serotonergic system regulation (slc6a4a, slc6a4b, htr1Aa, htr1B, htr2B) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). F0 male zebraFIsh were exposed to atrazine at 0.3, 3 or 30 part per billion (ppb) during early juvenile development, the behavior of F1 progeny was tested at adulthood, and the effect of 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment on mRNA transcription was quantified. Paternal exposure to atrazine significantly reduced interactions with a mirror (a proxy for aggression) and altered the latency to enter the top zone of a tank in unexposed F1 offspring. Bottom-dwelling time (a proxy for anxiety) also appeared to be somewhat affected, and activity (distance moved) was reduced in the context of aggression. slc6a4a and htr1Aa mRNA transcript levels were found to correlate positively with anxiety levels in controls, but we found that this relationship was disrupted in the 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment group. Overall, paternal atrazine exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behavioral traits and showed signs of serotonergic system dysregulation, demonstrating intergenerational effects.

This inhibition is not seen in the estuarine killifish, or mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), even when exposed to 100 ng/L EE2. This relative insensitivity to EE2 exposure indicates species-specific mechanisms for compensating for exogenous estrogenic exposure. This review compares various reproductive responses elicited by EE2 in mummichog to other common model teleosts, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), identifying key endpoints where mummichog differ from other studied fish. For example, EE2 accumulates primarily in the liver/gall bladder of mummichog, which is different than zebrafish and fathead minnow in which accumulation is predominantly in the carcass. Despite causing species-specific differences in fecundity, EE2 has been shown to consistently induce hepatic vitellogenin in males and cause feminization/sex reversal during gonadal differentiation in larval mummichog, similar to other species. In addition, while gonadal steroidogenesis and plasma steroid levels respond to exogenous EE2, it is generally at higher concentrations than observed in other species. In mummichog, production of 17β-estradiol (E2) by full grown ovarian follicles remains high; unlike other teleost models where E2 synthesis decreases as 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-prenen-3-on levels increase to induce oocyte maturation. New evidence in mummichog indicates some dissimilarity in gonadal steroidogenic gene expression responses compared to gene expression responses in zebrafish and fathead minnow exposed to EE2. The role of ovarian physiology continues to warrant investigation regarding the tolerance of mummichog to exogenous EE2 exposure.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation of the Rue (R. graveolens L.) extract (1, 10 and 100 mg/kg in feed) on the courtship behaviors and sexual hormones of adult male guppy (Poecilia reticulate) for 30 days. Fish were fed 100 mg/kg Rue extract that showed a significant increase in 17 β-estradiol (E2) level, while the testosterone (T) level and the ratio of T/E2 were significantly decreased compared to the control group. Furthermore, Rue dietary significantly decreased the courtship behaviors in the male guppy in a dose-depended manner. The males at the highest dose group (100 mg/kg) showed less copulation attempts, in compare to control males. In addition, times spent in sigmoid display and with the females were significantly decreased in the males fed diets containing 10 and 100 mg/ kg of Rue extract. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between courtship behaviors and T level, while negatively correlated with E2 concentrations. In conclusion, these results indicate that R. graveolens acts as anti-androgenic endocrine disruptor, and adversely affected the courtship behaviors and sex hormones of maleguppy, which can result in impaired reproduction. © 2020, Connect Journal.",,,Sexual Behavior,NA,NA,effects of dietary rue ruta graveolens extract on the courtship behaviors and sexual hormones of male guppy poecilia reticulate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, very few studies have investigated the effects of short-term exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations of DEHP during early developmental stages and its chronic effects. This study monitored the long-term effects of transient exposure to DEHP in early life stages (F0 generation) and its subsequent fertilization success in F1 generation using Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes, as model organism. Embryos (4 h post-fertilization, 4 hpf) of Japanese medaka were exposed to 0.001 ppb, 0.1 ppb, or 10 ppb DEHP for 21 days and returned to control water (without DEHP) for maturation (4 months old). At day 9 of the exposure study, mortality was significantly increased in medaka embryos (before hatching) treated with 0.001 ppb and 10 ppb DEHP. Continual exposure of young hatchlings for an additional 12 days (a total of 21 days of exposure) resulted in a significant increase in mortality in fish exposed to 0.001 ppb, 0.1 and 10 ppb DEHP. Significant reduction in egg production was observed in adult female medaka (4 months old) with prior exposure to 0.1 ppb and 10 ppb DEHP for 21 days during early development. Fertilization and hatching success were also significantly reduced in breeding pairs with prior exposure to 0.001 ppb, 0.1 ppb and 10 ppb DEHP during early life stage. Histological analysis of adult male gonads revealed a significant decline in mature sperm count accompanied by an increase in interstitial space in fish exposed to 0.1 ppb and 10 ppb DEHP during early development. Likewise, the amount of vitellogenic (mature) oocytes observed in the ovaries of adult female with transient exposure to 0.1 ppb and 10 ppb DEHP was significantly reduced when compared with the solvent control group.

One critical effect that contamination can have in aquatic systems is modifications of reproductive behaviors. In this study, we hypothesized that oxazepam, a common anxiolytic drug and aquatic contaminant previously shown to induce anti-anxiety behavior in salmonids, also affects the reproductive behavior of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). To test this hypothesis, small sexually mature Atlantic salmon males (mature parr) were exposed to concentrations of oxazepam comparable to that of effluent water (1.9 µg/L). After 5 days of exposure, their reproductive behavior was compared with that of unexposed control individuals. Behavior was monitored in a large-scale flume aquarium that also contained a large male and a female to mimic natural spawning conditions for Atlantic salmon. Three behaviors were quantified for the mature parr; (a) amount of courting behavior towards female, (b) proximity to female, and (c) amount of attacks received from the large male. In contrast to our hypothesis, no difference in either courting behavior, proximity to female, or received aggression could be found between exposed and control male parr. Hence, our results indicate that there is no acute effect of the highest levels of oxazepam concentration reported for urban environments on spawning behavior of mature male parr, although chronic effects could not be ruled out. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",,10.1111/jai.13980,Anti-Anxiety Agents;Oxazepam,NA,NA,environmentally relevant concentrations of the common anxiolytic pharmaceutical oxazepam do not have acute effect on spawning behavior in mature male atlantic salmon salmo salar parr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, some cyanobacteria species have been identified as a source of estrogenic effects in aquatic animals. To explore possible estrogenic effects of Microcystis aeruginosa (an often-dominant cyanobacteria species) on zooplankton, we examined effects of cyanobacteria exudates (MaE, 2 × 104 and 4 × 105 cells/ml) on reproduction in Daphnia magna. We analyzed physiological, biochemical and molecular characteristics of exposed Daphnia via both chronic and acute exposures. MaE at both low and high cell density enhanced egg number (15.4% and 23.3%, respectively) and reproduction (37.7% and 52.4%, respectively) in D. magna similar to 10 μg/L estradiol exposure. In addition, both MaE of low and high cell densities increased population growth rate (15.8% and 19.6%, respectively) and reproductive potential (60% and 83%, respectively) of D. magna. These exudates promoted D. magna reproduction by stimulating 17β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) activity and production of ecdysone and juvenile hormone, and by enhancing vitellogenin biosynthesis via up-regulating expression of Vtg1 and Vtg2. However, increased expression (6.6 times higher than controls) of a detoxification gene (CYP360A8) indicated that MaE might also induce toxicity in D. magna. Reproductive interference of zooplankton by blooming cyanobacteria might negatively affect foodwebs because MaE-induced zooplankton population increase would enhance grazing and reduce abundance of edible algae, thereby adding to the list of known disruptive properties of cyanobacterial blooms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.133909,Cyanobacteria;Estradiol Congeners;Estrogens,31454606,NA,blooming cyanobacteria alter water flea reproduction via exudates of estrogen analogues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such EDC exposure to the F1 fetuses also reaches the germ cells that become the F2 generation. Previously, we demonstrated that adult social and communicative behaviors such as ultrasonic vocalizations and mating behaviors were altered by EDCs in F2 rats, especially males. In the current study, we used the brains of these F2 males to ascertain the underlying molecular changes in the hypothalamus related to these behavioral outcomes. Their progenitors were Sprague-Dawley rat dams, treated on pregnancy days 8 to 18 with one of three treatments: a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture, Aroclor 1221, selected because it is weakly estrogenic; the anti-androgenic fungicide vinclozolin (VIN); or the vehicle, 6% dimethylsulfoxide in sesame oil (VEH). In adulthood, F1 male and female offspring were bred with untreated partners to generate paternal or maternal lineages of the F2 offspring, the subjects of molecular work. Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted in the medial preoptic area (POA) and the ventromedial nucleus (VMN) of the hypothalamus, selected for their roles in social and sexual behaviors. Of the genes assessed, steroid hormone receptors (estrogen receptor α, androgen receptor, progesterone receptor) but not dopamine receptors 1 and 2 or DNA methyltransferase 3a expression were altered, particularly in the VIN males. Several significant correlations between behavior and gene expression were also detected.

Larval exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan was sufficient to cause adverse effects in adults and their offspring. TCS exposure delays metamorphosis and impairs fecundity and fertility. Offspring from TCS-exposed fish show decreased survival and delayed maturation, but their reproductive capacity is not altered.

Here we study EE2 effects on gene expression around the onset of sex differentiation in a population of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) that suffers from sex ratio distortions. We exposed singly-raised embryos to one dose of 1 ng/L EE2, studied gene expression 10 days before hatching, at the day of hatching, and around the end of the yolk-sac stage, and related it to genetic sex (sdY genotype). We found that exposure to EE2 affects expression of a large number of genes, especially around hatching. These effects were strongly sex-dependent. We then raised fish for several months after hatching and found no evidence of sex reversal in the EE2-exposed fish.

In this brief study, we wanted to evaluate the effect of the analgesic-antipyretic acetaminophen (paracetamol, PCM) that somehow gets in the water bodies. PCM is highly consumed because of its potentially fewer side effects than other similar acting drugs. This, however, leads to more excretion and accumulation. Although apparently less toxic in pharmacologic dose, it is highly toxic in overdose. This can be expected to occur in aquatic system where the bioaccumulation can be toxic to the inhabitants. In fact, we observed quite alarming results on fish in the laboratory. Behavioral alterations were the first to set in. There were increased activities of the marker enzymes, alkaline phosphatase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase in brain relating to altered behavior. Moreover, catalase levels decreased denoting impairment in the antioxidant defense mechanism. The gill morphology was also altered.

We recently reported that zebrafish larvae transiently exposed to the pharmaceutical EDC 4-OH-A display visual deficits as adults. Here, we examine whether these long-term effects are due to compound-induced morphological and/or cellular changes. Zebrafish aged 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, or 7 days post-fertilization (larvae) or 3-4mos (adults) were exposed to either 4-OH-A or PCB 1254 for 24 h.

In general, indices of larval growth and development were not altered by 24 h exposure to either compound. 4-OH-A potently inhibited aromatase activity, while PCB 1254 did not, with inhibition continuing even after removal from treatment.

However, in some cases, other exposure routes can be more practical and relevant. Micro-injection into the yolk of fish embryos could offer a particular advantage for administering hydrophobic compounds, such as many endocrine disruptors. Single-dose micro-injection was compared with continuous aquatic exposure in terms of compound accumulation and biological responses. 17α-Ethinyl estradiol (EE2) was used as a model compound. First, the optimal solvent and droplet size were optimized, and needle variation was assessed. Next, biological endpoints were evaluated. The accumulated internal dose of EE2 decreased over time in both exposure scenarios. Estrogen receptor activation was concentration/injected dose dependent, increased daily, and was related to esr2b transcription. Transcription of vitellogenin 1 (vtg1) and brain aromatase (cyp19a1b) was induced in both scenarios, but the cyp19a1b transcription pattern differed between routes. Injection caused an increase in cyp19a1b transcripts from 48 hours post fertilization (hpf) onward, whereas after aquatic exposure the main increase occurred between 96 and 120 hpf. Some malformations only occurred after injection, whereas others were present for both scenarios. We conclude that responses can differ between exposure routes and therefore micro-injection is not a direct substitute for, but can be complementary to aquatic exposure. Nevertheless, vtg1and cyp19a1b transcription and estrogen receptor activation are suitable biomarkers for endocrine disruptor screening in both scenarios.

The results showed that (PS)2 significantly reduced testosterone (T) levels, spermatogenic cyst number and sperm motility, impeded spermatogenic cell differentiation in male guppies and delayed embryo development in females. These results indicated that (PS)2 could cause reproductive toxicity in guppies. We also examined mRNA expression of indices involved in the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis and reproductive behaviors. We found that 200 and 2000 ng/L (PS)2 decreased T synthesis by downregulating 17βHSD and CYP17 mRNA levels, and upregulating the mRNA level of CYP19a1a, which converted T to 17β-estradiol. (PS)2 also upregulated GnRH1, FSHβ LHβ and LHR mRNA levels, a positive feedback regulation due to the decrease of T levels in male guppies. Furthermore, (PS)2 significantly decreased CYP19a1b mRNA levels in all three exposure groups and thus reduced the display frequency of male guppies.

Here, we measure how the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying male behaviour affect mating success and sperm competition in the ocellated wrasse (Symphodus ocellatus). In this species, males exhibit three alternative reproductive types. “Nesting males” provide parental care, defend territories and form cooperative associations with unrelated “satellites,” who cheat by sneaking fertilizations but help by reducing sperm competition from “sneakers” who do not cooperate or provide care. To measure the fitness consequences of the mechanisms underlying these social interactions, we used “phenotypic engineering” that involved administering an androgen receptor antagonist (flutamide) to wild, free-living fish. Nesting males treated with flutamide shifted their aggression from sneakers to satellite males and experienced decreased submissiveness by sneaker males (which correlated with decreased nesting male mating success). The preoptic area (POA), a region controlling male reproductive behaviours, exhibited dramatic down-regulation of androgen receptor (AR) and vasotocin 1a receptor (V1aR) mRNA following experimental manipulation of androgen signalling. We did not find a direct effect of the manipulation on male mating success, paternity or larval production. However, variation in neuroendocrine mechanisms generated by the experimental manipulation was significantly correlated with changes in behaviour and mating success: V1aR expression was negatively correlated with satellite-directed aggression, and expression of its ligand arginine vasotocin (AVT) was positively correlated with courtship and mating success, thus revealing the potential for sexual selection on these mechanisms. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,10.1111/mec.14999,Interpersonal Relations,30586201,NA,experimentally induced variation in neuroendocrine processes affects male reproductive behaviour sperm characteristics and social interactions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to identify the presence and seasonality of putative endocrine disrupting chemicals or other factors associated with these observations, a comprehensive reevaluation was conducted between September 2012 and June 2014. Here, we collected smallmouth bass from three physically partitioned reaches along the river to measure biomarkers of estrogenic endocrine disruption in smallmouth bass. In addition, polar organic chemical integrative samples (POCIS) were deployed to identify specific chemicals associated with biological observations. We did not observe biological differences across reaches indicating the absence of clear point source contributions to the observation of intersex. Interestingly, intersex prevalence and severity decreased in a stepwise manner over the timespan of the project. Intersex decreased from 92.8% to 28.1%. The only significant predictor of intersex prevalence was year of capture, based on logistic regression analysis. The mixed model of fish length and year-of-capture best predicted intersex severity. Intersex severity was also significantly different across late summer and early spring collections indicating seasonal changes in this metric. Plasma vitellogenin and liver vitellogenin Aa transcript abundance in males did not indicate exposure to estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals at any of the four sample collections. Analysis of chemicals captured by the POCIS as well as results of screening discrete water samples or POCIS extracts did not indicate the contribution of appreciable estrogenic chemicals. It is possible that unreported changes in land-use activity have ameliorated the problem, and our observations indicate recovery. Regardless, this work clearly emphasizes that single, snap shot sampling for intersex may not yield representative data given that the manifestation of this condition within a population can change dramatically over time. © 2018",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.167,Estrogens,30055487,NA,temporal evaluation of estrogenic endocrine disruption markers in smallmouth bass micropterus dolomieu reveals seasonal variability in intersex,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are diverse shape and size and are ingested by organisms. In this study, goldfish (Carassius auratus) were exposed via diet to three types of virgin MPs material types and shapes including fibers, fragments, and pellets. After six weeks of exposure, various sub-lethal effects, but no mortality, was observed. Fish exposed to plastic showed significant weight loss compared with the control. Fibers were found in the gills, gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and feces were not likely to accumulate in the GIT. Pronounced and severe alterations were found in the livers of fish exposed to fibers. The distal intestine showed more pronounced and severe changes compared to the proximal intestine, likely due to an intake of fibers. The ingestion of fibers caused the highest frequencies of progressive and inflammatory changes in the livers and intestines. This is in accordance with the higher organ index in these organs compared to other texa. Conversely, fragments and pellets were not ingested but chewed and expelled. Chewing process resulted in damages to the jaws as ranging from slight exfoliation to deep incisions. The highest frequency of regressive and circulatory (e.g., dilated sinusoids) changes was found in fish exposed to fragments, specifically in the upper and lower jaw, and in lower jaw and liver, respectively. Together, these results demonstrate that ingestion and chewing of MPs lead to damages in various organs and tissues of the gastrointestinal system, and suggest that different materials can have drastically different impacts on fish. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.09.031,,30237044,NA,effects of virgin microplastics on goldfish carassius auratus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can be attributed to the relatively few sex differences found in adult brain transcriptomes. Environmental and hormonal factors can influence sex-specific behavior. Androgen treatment stimulates behavioral masculinization. Sex dimorphic gene expression in developing teleost brains and the molecular basis for androgen-induced behavioral masculinization are poorly understood. In this study, juvenile zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated with 100 ng/L of 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (MT) during sexual development from 20 days post fertilization to 40 days and 60 days post fertilization. We compared brain gene expression patterns in MT-treated zebrafish with control males and females using RNA-Seq to shed light on the dynamic changes in brain gene expression during sexual development and how androgens affect brain gene expression leading to behavior masculinization. We found modest differences in gene expression between juvenile male and female zebrafish brains. Brain aromatase (cyp19a1b), prostaglandin 3a synthase (ptges3a), and prostaglandin reductase 1 (ptgr1) were among the genes with sexually dimorphic expression patterns. MT treatment significantly altered gene expression relative to both male and female brains. Fewer differences were found among MT-treated brains and male brains compared to female brains, particularly at 60 dpf. MT treatment upregulated the expression of hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 2 (hsd11b2), deiodinase, iodothyronine, type II (dio2), and gonadotrophin releasing hormones (GnRH) 2 and 3 (gnrh2 and gnrh3) suggesting local synthesis of 11-ketotestosterone, triiodothyronine, and GnRHs in zebrafish brains which are influenced by androgens. Androgen, estrogen, prostaglandin, thyroid hormone, and GnRH signaling pathways likely interact to modulate teleost sexual behavior.

Among the processes used, ‘Advanced Oxidative Processes’ (AOP’s) stands out, by means of heterogeneous photocatalysis for the removal of these organic pollutants present in the environment. The paper’s main point is on the synthesis of photocatalysts WO3-SBA-15 in the molar ratios Si/W (10, 25, 50, and 75) and the photocatalytic activity in the degradation process of 17α-ethynylstradiol (EE2), present in several water contaminants. The catalysts prepared were characterized by XRD, XRF, Raman, FTIR, UV-vis, adsorption, and desorption of nitrogen, and to determine the photocatalytic activity, frequency of turnover (TOF) was used. Through the characterizations, it can be observed that insertion of nanoparticles in WO3 did not cause changes in the mesoporous structure of the SBA-15 and there is presence of monoclinic, triclinic, and orthorhombic phases of WO3. The photocatalytic activity showed to be dependent on the calcination temperature and the molar ratio of the catalysts WO3-SBA-15, being the sample WO3-SBA-15(50) at 600 °C which presented the greatest degradation potential in the degradation of 17α-ethynylstradiol, with 98%, using ultraviolet radiation, for 4 h.

These systems are a suspected source of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) that may be responsible for endocrine disrupting effects to resident fish species in Minnesota Lakes. This study assessed localized porewater concentrations of TOrCs in near-shore environments across five Minnesota Lakes. Sampling sites were designated as either likely (HOME) or unlikely (REF) to receive OWTS discharges based on their proximity to shoreline households. Sampling sites also served as sunfish spawning habitats concurrently studied for biological impacts to resident adult males. Two-group hypothesis tests demonstrated significantly (p =.02) higher total TOrC concentrations in HOME (Mean = 841 ng/L) versus REF (Mean = 222 ng/L) sites. HOME sites also contained a wider suite of TOrC detections relative to REF sites. The distance to the nearest household (most proximal distance; MPD) negatively correlated (r = −0.62) with total TOrC concentrations. However, 2,4-D and DEET were major contributors to these total concentrations, suggesting that anthropogenic influence from households may not be exclusively attributed to OWTS discharges. Further, TOrC presence and elevated nitrogen concentrations in REF site porewater suggest additional, non-household TOrC discharges to these lakes. Significantly higher blood concentrations of vitellogenin (p =.03) and 11-ketotestosterone (p =.01) were observed in adult male sunfish captured from HOME versus REF sites. Comparisons between chemical and biological data indicate enhanced bioactive effects of co-contaminants. The findings from this study demonstrate multiple diffuse transport pathways contribute to the presence of biologically active TOrC mixtures in Minnesota Lakes, and mitigation efforts should consider minimizing residential inputs of chemicals associated with both outdoor and OWTS activity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.01.123,,29898522,NA,trace organic contaminant torc mixtures in minnesota littoral zones effects of onsite wastewater treatment system owts proximity and biological impact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many compounds of anthropogenic as well as natural origin can contribute to the overall estrogenicity of surface waters and some of them can exhibit adverse effects on aquatic biota even in very low concentrations. This study focused on freshwater ponds and reservoirs affected by water blooms and determined the estrogenic activity of water by in vitro bioassay as well as concentrations of several important groups of estrogenic compounds (estrogenic hormones, alkylphenols, and phytoestrogens) by LC-MS/MS analyses. Estrogenic hormones were found at concentrations up to 7.1 ng.L−1, similarly to flavonoids, whose concentrations did not exceed 12.5 ng.L−1. Among alkylphenols, only bisphenol A and 4-tert-octylphenol were detected in levels reaching 100 ng.L−1 at maximum. Estrogenic activity of water samples varied from below the quantification limit to 1.95 ng.L−1. There does not seem to be any general causal link of the massive phytoplankton occurrence with the estrogenicity of water or concentration of phytoestrogens, since they showed no direct relationship with the phytoplankton abundance or composition across sites. The contribution of the analysed compounds to the estrogenic activity was calculated in three scenarios. In minimum scenario, just the compounds above quantification limit (LOQ) were taken into account and for most samples, only minor part (&lt;6%) of the biological activity could be explained. In the mean and maximum scenarios, we included also compounds below LOQ into the calculations at the level of LOQ/2 and LOQ, respectively. In these cases, a considerable part of the estrogenic activity could be attributed to the possible presence of steroid estrogens below LOQ. However, for the samples with estrogenic activity greater than 1 ng.L−1, more than 50% of the estrogenic activity remained unexplained even in the maximum scenario. Probably other compounds or possible interactions between individual substances cause the estrogenic activity in these types of water bodies and in this case, the results of LC-MS/MS analyses cannot sufficiently predict the biological effects. A complex approach including bioassays is needed when assessing the estrogenicity of these types of surface waters. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.watres.2018.02.040,Body Water,29486257,NA,estrogenic activity and contributing compounds in stagnant water bodies with massive occurrence of phytoplankton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KET exposure at an environmentally relevant concentration (0.004 μM) to 40 μM conferred specific patterns in larval swimming behavior during 24 h. At 14 days, such exposure induced dose- and/or time-dependent alteration on reactive oxygen species induction, the activity of antioxidants catalase and superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase and malondialdehyde contents in fish bodies. KET-induced oxidative stress disrupted the expression of acetylcholinesterase and p53-regulated apoptosis pathways and increased caspase expression in medaka larvae. The toxic responses of medaka larvae, in terms of chemical effects, were qualitatively analogous to those of zebrafish and mammals.

While studying the reproductive physiology of this fish, an estrogenic endocrine disruption was discovered. We managed showing that it was mainly due to soybased diet containing estrogenic isoflavones. Because the rainbow trout reared in the same conditions did not exhibit such a disruption, we studied the effects of soy isoflavones at different steps of the estrogen endocrine pathways in both species. We managed to show that sturgeon was 50 times more sensitive to estrogenic soy isoflavones than trout. We also showed that this difference of sensitivity was not linked to differences at the estradiol synthesis step nor at the estradiol blood transport step. It was neither due to differences at the estradiol receptor levels nor at the liver cell level. The 50 times difference of sensitivity between the two species was linked to a difference in isoflavone bioavailability due to different xenobiotics detoxifying efficiency of the liver. Genistein, the main soy estrogenic compound, was shown to exhibit deleterious effect on trout reproduction. Until now the effect of this compound and of others from soy is still unknown on sturgeon reproduction due to the late reproductive maturity of this species.

The presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the aquatic environment may affect fitness by changing morphology or altering behaviors like courtship and exploration. Most research on EDC-generated behavioral effects has focused on estrogen mimics and reproductive endpoints. Far fewer studies have examined the effects of other types of EDCs or measured non-reproductive behaviors. EDCs with antiandrogenic properties are present in waterways yet we know little about their effects on exposed individuals although they may produce effects similar to those caused by estrogen mimics because they act on the same hormonal pathway. To examine the effects of antiandrogens on boldness, this study exposed male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, to a high or low dose of one of two antiandrogens, vinclozolin or flutamide, and observed behavior in three boldness assays, both before and after exposure. Overall, antiandrogen exposure increased boldness behavior, especially following exposure to the higher dose. Whether or not antiandrogen exposure influenced boldness, as well as the nature and intensity of the effect, was assay-dependent. This demonstrates the importance of studying EDC effects in a range of contexts and, at least within this species, suggests that antiandrogenic compounds may generate distinct physiological effects in different situations. How and why the behavioral effects differ from those caused by exposure to an estrogen mimic, as well as the potential consequences of increased activity levels, are discussed. Exposure to an antiandrogen, regardless of dose, produced elevated activity levels and altered shoaling and exploration in male Siamese fighting fish.

This action is possible mainly due to the presence of steroid receptors in the different immune cell types. Much evidence suggests that the immune system of fish is vulnerable to xenosteroids, which are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. In vivo and in vitro assays have amply demonstrated that oestrogens interfere with both the innate and the adaptive immune system of fish by regulating the main leukocyte activities and transcriptional genes. They activate nuclear oestrogen receptors and/or G-protein coupled oestrogen receptor. Less understood is the role of androgens in the immune system, mainly due to the complexity of the transcriptional regulation of androgen receptors in fish. The aim of this manuscript is to review our present knowledge concerning the effect of sex steroid hormones and the presence of their receptors on fish leukocytes, taking into consideration that the studies performed vary as regard the fish species, doses, exposure protocols and hormones used. Moreover, we also include evidence of the probable role of progestins in the regulation of the immune system of fish. © 2017 by the authors.

It is therefore vital to develop the necessary tools to predict and detect these effects as early as possible. Biomarkers of contaminant exposure and effect are widely applied to this end, and a significant amount of research has focused on development and validation of sensitive and diagnostic biomarkers. However, progress in the use biomarkers that can be measured using non-destructive techniques has been relatively slow and there are still many difficulties to overcome in the development of sound methods. This paper systematically quantifies and reviews studies that have aimed to develop or validate non-destructive biomarkers in wildlife, and provides an analysis of the successes of these methods based on the invasiveness of the methods, the potential for universal application, cost, and the potential for new biomarker discovery. These data are then used to infer what methods and approaches appear the most effective for successful development of non-destructive biomarkers of contaminant exposure in wildlife. This review highlights that research on non-destructive biomarkers in wildlife is severely lacking, and suggests further exploration of in vitro methods in future studies. Studies on non-destructive biomarker discovery in threatened wildlife are limited. Presently the use of cell lines is minimal in this context but presents a promising tool to enhance currently used methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.envpol.2017.11.044,Biological Markers,29156442,NA,charting a path towards nondestructive biomarkers in threatened wildlife a systematic quantitative literature review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Environmental risk assessment (ERA) seeks to protect wildlife populations and prospective assessments rely on extrapolation from individual-level effects established for laboratory fish species to populations of wild fish using arbitrary safety factors. Population susceptibility to chemical effects, however, depends on exposure risk, physiological susceptibility, and population resilience, each of which can differ widely between fish species. Population models have significant potential to address these shortfalls and to include individual variability relating to life-history traits, demographic and density-dependent vital rates, and behaviors which arise from inter-organism and organism–environment interactions. Confidence in population models has recently resulted in the EU Commission stating that results derived from reliable models may be considered when assessing the relevance of adverse effects of EACs at the population level. This review critically assesses the potential risks posed by EACs for fish populations, considers the ecological factors influencing these risks and explores the benefits and challenges of applying population modeling (including individual-based modeling) in ERA for EACs in fish. We conclude that population modeling offers a way forward for incorporating greater environmental relevance in assessing the risks of EACs for fishes and for identifying key risk factors through sensitivity analysis. Individual-based models (IBMs) allow for the incorporation of physiological and behavioral endpoints relevant to EAC exposure effects, thus capturing both direct and indirect population-level effects. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,10.1080/10408444.2017.1367756,Risk Assessment,28929839,NA,capturing ecology in modeling approaches applied to environmental risk assessment of endocrine active chemicals in fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pervasive nature of EDCs within aquatic environments and their multiple sub-lethal effects make assessments of their impact especially important but also highly challenging. Herein, we review the data on EDC effects in aquatic systems focusing on studies assessing populations and ecosystems, and including how biotic and abiotic processes may affect, and be affected by, responses to EDCs. Recent research indicates a significant influence of behavioural responses (e.g. enhancing feeding rates), transgenerational effects and trophic cascades in the ecological consequences of EDC exposure. In addition, interactions between EDCs and other chemical, physical and biological factors generate uncertainty in our understanding of the ecological effects of EDCs within aquatic ecosystems. We illustrate how effect thresholds for EDCs generated from individual-based experimental bioassays of the types commonly applied using chemical test guidelines [e.g. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)] may not necessarily reflect the hazards associated with endocrine disruption. We argue that improved risk assessment for EDCs in aquatic ecosystems urgently requires more ecologically oriented research as well as field-based assessments at population-, community- and food-web levels. © 2017 The Authors.

The main objective was to investigate if infrastructure upgrades at the Kitchener MWWTP in 2012 resulted in a recovery of this response in the post-upgrade period (2013–2016). Two supporting studies showed that the fall season is appropriate for measuring in vitro sex steroid production because it provides stable detection of steroid patterns, and that the sample handling practiced in the present study did not introduce a bias. Infrastructure upgrades of the Kitchener MWWTP resulted in significant reductions in ammonia and estrogenicity. After the upgrades, 11-ketotestosterone production by MWWTP-exposed fish increased in 2013 and it continued to recover throughout the study period of 2014 through 2016, returning to levels measured in reference fish. Testosterone production was less sensitive and it lacked consistency. The Waterloo MWWTP underwent some minor upgrades but the level of ammonia and estrogenicity remained variable over time. The production of 11-ketotestosterone and testosterone in rainbow darter below the Waterloo MWWTP was variable and without a clear recovery pattern over the course of the present study. The results of the present study demonstrated that measuring production of sex steroids (especially 11-ketotestosterone) over multiple years can be relevant for assessing responses in fish to environmental changes such as those resulting from major infrastructure upgrades.

Indeed, recent work explicitly performed under environmentally realistic conditions reveals that chemical contaminants can have both direct and indirect effects at multiple levels of organization by influencing animal behaviour. Altered behaviour reflects multiple physiological changes and links individual- to population-level processes, thereby representing a sensitive tool for holistically assessing impacts of environmentally relevant contaminant concentrations. Here, we show that even if direct effects of contaminants on behavioural responses are reasonably well documented, there are significant knowledge gaps in understanding both the plasticity (i.e. individual variation) and evolution of contaminant-induced behavioural changes. We explore implications of multi-level processes by developing a conceptual framework that integrates direct and indirect effects on behaviour under environmentally realistic contexts. Our framework illustrates how sublethal behavioural effects of contaminants can be both negative and positive, varying dynamically within the same individuals and populations. This is because linkages within communities will act indirectly to alter and even magnify contaminant-induced effects. Given the increasing pressure on wildlife and ecosystems from chemical pollution, we argue there is a need to incorporate existing knowledge in ecology and evolution to improve ecological hazard and risk assessments. © 2019 The Authors.",,10.1098/rspb.2018.1297,,30135169,NA,direct and indirect effects of chemical contaminants on the behaviour ecology and evolution of wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further review also include highlights on the fate of PPCPs in agricultural soils receiving treated wastewater irrigation or biosolids amendment, and plant uptake of PPCPs under laboratory and field conditions. PPCPs have shown to be released to the environment and may cause significant impacts on different environmental aspects. Plant roots showed their abilities to uptake and transfer of PPCPs into plant tissues.

The presence of these products, designed to modulate human physiology and behaviour, has created concern over whether PhACs similarly affect aquatic organisms. Though laboratory studies are beginning to address the effects of individual PhACs on fish behaviour, few studies have assessed the effects of exposure to complex, realistic wastewater effluents on fish behaviour. In this study, we exposed a wild, invasive fish species—the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus)—to treated wastewater effluent (0%, 50% or 100% effluent dilutions) for 28 days. We then determined the impact of exposure on fish aggression, an important behaviour for territory acquisition and defense. We found that exposure to 100% wastewater effluent reduced the number of aggressive acts that round goby performed. We complimented our behavioural assay with measures of pharmaceutical uptake in fish tissues. We detected 11 of 93 pharmaceutical compounds that we tested for in round goby tissues, and we found that concentration was greatest in the brain followed by plasma, then gonads, then liver, and muscle. Fish exposed to 50% and 100% effluent had higher tissue concentrations of pharmaceuticals and concentrated a greater number of pharmaceutical compounds compare to control fish exposed to no (0%) effluent. Exposed fish also showed increased ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in liver tissue, suggesting that fish were exposed to planar halogenated/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHHs/PAHs) in the wastewater effluent. Our findings suggest that fish in effluent-dominated systems may have altered behaviours and greater tissue concentration of PhACs. Moreover, our results underscore the importance of characterizing exposure to multiple pollutants, and support using behaviour as a sensitive tool for assessing animal responses to complex contaminant mixtures, like wastewater effluent. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.06.073,Organ Specificity,28672246,NA,exposure to wastewater effluent affects fish behaviour and tissuespecific uptake of pharmaceuticals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mammals and birds, the organizational period is typified by a surge of sex hormones during differentiation of specific neural circuits; whereas activational effects are dependent upon later increases in these same hormones at sexual maturation. Depending on the reproductive organ or brain region, initial programming events may be modulated by androgens or require conversion of androgens to estrogens. The prevailing notion based upon findings in mammalian models is that male brain is sculpted to undergo masculinization and defeminization. In absence of these responses, the female brain develops. While timing of organizational and activational events vary across taxa, there are shared features. Further, exposure of different animal models to environmental chemicals such as xenoestrogens such as bisphenol A-BPA and ethinylestradiol-EE2, gestagens, and thyroid hormone disruptors, broadly classified as neuroendocrine disrupting chemicals (NED), during these critical periods may result in similar alterations in brain structure, function, and consequently, behaviors. Organizational effects of neuroendocrine systems in mammals and birds appear to be permanent, whereas teleost fish neuroendocrine systems exhibit plasticity. While there are fewer NED studies in amphibians and reptiles, data suggest that NED disrupt normal organizational-activational effects of endogenous hormones, although it remains to be determined if these disturbances are reversible.

Our results suggest that the presence of a Y chromosome increases aggressiveness in females. However, since the same relationship between aggressiveness and the Y chromosome is not observed in males, we can hypothesize that the differences in aggressiveness are not directly dependent on the genotype but on the sex reversal procedures applied on young fry during their sexual differentiation to produce these breeders.

Except for caffeine, all substances tested (dichlorvos, 2.4-dinitrotoluene, 4-nonylphenol, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) produced significant toxic effects in neuromasts at EC10 concentrations. Depending on the test substances and their location along the lateral line, specific neuromasts differed in sensitivity. Generally, neuromasts proved more sensitive in the pulse exposure scenario. Whereas for neomycin and copper sulfate neuromasts located along the anterior lateral line were more sensitive, posterior lateral line neuromasts proved more sensitive for the other test substances. Nuclear fragmentation could not only be associated with all test substances, but, albeit at lower frequencies, also with negative controls, and could, therefore, not be assigned specifically to chemical damage. The study thus documented that for a comprehensive evaluation of lateral line damage both neuromasts from the anterior and the posterior lateral line have to be considered. Given the apparently rapid regeneration of hair cells, pulse exposure seems more appropriate for the identification of lateral line neurotoxicity than continuous exposure. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.cbpc.2016.11.001,,27847309,NA,an optimized method to assess ototoxic effects in the lateral line of zebrafish danio rerio embryos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both anthropogenic and natural compounds contribute to overall estrogenic activity in freshwaters. Recently, estrogenic potencies were also found to be associated with cyanobacteria and their blooms in surface waters. The present study developed and compared the solid phase extraction and LC-MS/MS analytical approaches for determination of phytoestrogens (8 flavonoids - biochanin A, coumestrol, daidzein, equol, formononetin, genistein, naringenin, apigenin – and 5 sterols - ergosterol, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, brassicasterol) and cholesterol in water. The method was used for analyses of samples collected in stagnant water bodies dominated by different cyanobacterial species. Concentrations of individual flavonoids ranged from below the limit of detection to 3.58 ng/L. Sterols were present in higher amounts up to 2.25 μg/L. Biological potencies of these phytoestrogens in vitro were characterized using the hERα-HeLa-9903 cell line. The relative estrogenic potencies (compared to model estrogen - 17β-estradiol) of flavonoids ranged from 2.25E-05 to 1.26E-03 with coumestrol being the most potent. None of the sterols elicited estrogenic response in the used bioassay. Estrogenic activity was detected in collected field water samples (maximum effect corresponding to 2.07 ng/L of 17β-estradiol equivalents, transcriptional assay). At maximum phytoestrogens accounted for only 1.56 pg/L of 17β-estradiol equivalents, contributing maximally 8.5% of the total estrogenicity of the water samples. Other compounds therefore, most likely of anthropogenic origin such as steroid estrogens, are probably the major drivers of total estrogenic effects in these surface waters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.12.006,Phytoestrogens;Estrogens,27974267,NA,phytoestrogens and sterols in waters with cyanobacterial blooms analytical methods and estrogenic potencies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fishes exhibit sexual plasticity, but the underlying mechanisms of environmental effects on their reproduction are unclear even in the well-established teleost research model, the zebrafish. Here we established the conditions to study the effects of elevated temperature on zebrafish sex. We showed that sex ratio response to elevated temperature is family-specific and typically leads to masculinization (female-To-male sex reversal), resulting in neomales. These results uncovered genotype-by-environment interactions that support a polygenic sex determination system in domesticated (laboratory) zebrafish. We found that some heat-Treated fish had gene expression profiles similar to untreated controls of the same sex, indicating that they were resistant to thermal effects. Further, most neomales had gonadal transcriptomes similar to that of regular males. Strikingly, we discovered heat-Treated females that displayed a normal ovarian phenotype but with a ""male-like"" gonadal transcriptome. Such major transcriptomic reprogramming with preserved organ structure has never been reported. Juveniles were also found to have a male-like transcriptome shortly after exposure to heat.

In the latest decades, it has been established that zebrafish sex is determined by genetic factors on a polygenic basis, as various candidate genes with sex dimorphic expression, as well sex-linked loci have been identified in different zebrafish strains. However, it has been evidenced that sex determination in this species is also influenced by environmental factors. For instance, temperature can have a crucial role in zebrafish sex determination. Likewise, the exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), the most studied zebrafish sex changing factor, can strongly influence the course of sex differentiation and unbalance the sex ratio of zebrafish populations. Despite this, so far the influence of environmental factors is still less understood and only few studies have addressed this topic. Therefore, this review intends to gather current knowledge on the environmental factors involved in sex determination of zebrafish and identify important gaps in this research area.

Although our understanding of how wastewater effluent impacts fish reproduction is growing, we know very little about how effluent affects non-reproductive physiology and behaviours associated with fitness (such as aggression and activity). To better understand how fish cope with chronic exposure to wastewater effluent in the wild, we caged round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) for three weeks at different distances from a wastewater outflow. We evaluated the effects of this exposure on fish survival, behaviour, metabolism, and respiratory traits. Fish caged inside the WWTP and close to the outfall experienced higher mortality than fish from the reference site. Interestingly, those fish that survived the exposure performed similarly to fish caged at the reference site in tests of aggressive behaviour, startle-responses, and dispersal. Moreover, the fish near WWTP outflow displayed similar resting metabolism (O2consumption rates), hypoxia tolerance, haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, and blood-oxygen binding affinities as the fish from the more distant reference site.

Their small size makes them bioavailable to a range of organisms and studies have reported ingestion across the food chain. Few studies have demonstrated physical transfer of microplastics between organisms, and no research has assessed the ecological impacts of transferred microplastics and contaminants over different trophic levels. Contaminants associated with plastics can alter animal behaviour; thus, exploring changes in behaviour may be fundamental in understanding ecosystem effects of microplastics. This study explored the effects of microplastics and associated contaminants through the food chain in the marine intertidal zone. We exposed beach hoppers, Platorchestia smithi, to environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics and then fed them to Krefft's frillgobies, Bathygobius krefftii, ray-finned fish that inhabit shallow coastal ecosystems. We tested fish personality to see whether there were any changes that could be attributed to trophic transfer of microplastics, as even subtle changes in behaviour can have cascading effects on other organisms and the wider ecosystem. Exploring behavioural changes in response to contaminant exposure is a developing area in ecotoxicology due to its increased sensitivity compared with the traditional LD50 approach. While gobies readily ingested contaminated beach hoppers, we detected no effect of microplastic trophic transfer on fish personality relative to control groups. While chronic exposure studies assessing a suite of behaviours are required, it is possible that the transfer of microplastics via trophic interactions does not provide an additional exposure pathway for contaminants through the food web. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour",,10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.10.035,,NA,NA,trophic transfer of microplastics does not affect fish personality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to causing physiological changes, EDCs often target fitness-related behaviors such as locomotion and courtship. Ethinylestradiol (EE2) is an estrogen mimic that has been found to reduce courtship and aggression in males. However, the consequences of these reductions are not always explicitly addressed. One way in which EE2 may lead to decreased fitness occurs when males respond differently to exposed vs. unexposed conspecifics. To examine this, video playback was used to determine whether male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, respond differently to exposed and unexposed males. Males were presented with four different combinations of videos of males played simultaneously: exposed swimming and unexposed swimming, exposed courting and unexposed courting, unexposed courting and unexposed courting, and exposed courting and exposed courting. Males directed more behaviors to the unexposed than the exposed courting male when presented simultaneously, likely because these unexposed males were perceived as a greater threat to mating success. Additionally, males spent more time tracking and gill flaring, two behaviors that are indicative of fight intent, when presented with two courting unexposed males. This combination could be considered the most threatening because there are two rival vigorously courting males present. These results suggest that EE2 exposure could result in exposed males receiving decreased attention from other males. However, since EE2 exposure also decreases competitive and courtship abilities, this would be far outweighed by the costs. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",,10.1111/eth.12572,Estrogens,NA,NA,court like you mean it male siamese fighting fish are less attentive to courting males that have been exposed to an estrogen mimic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their effects at the central nervous system level have been poorly studied until now. Notwithstanding, progesterone, although still widely considered primarily a sex hormone, is an important agent affecting many central nervous system functions. Herein, we investigated the effects of a large set of synthetic ligands of the nuclear progesterone receptor on the glial-specific expression of the zebrafish brain aromatase (cyp19a1b) using zebrafish mechanism-based assays. Progesterone and 24 progestins were first screened on transgenic cyp19a1b-GFP zebrafish embryos. We showed that progesterone, dydrogesterone, drospirenone and all the progesterone-derived progestins had no effect on GFP expression. Conversely, all progestins derived from 19-nortesterone induced GFP in a concentration-dependent manner with EC50 ranging from the low nM range to hundreds nM. The 19-nortestosterone derived progestins levonorgestrel (LNG) and norethindrone (NET) were further tested in a radial glial cell context using U251-MG cells co-transfected with zebrafish ER subtypes (zfERα, zfERβ1 or zfERβ2) and cyp19a1b promoter linked to luciferase. Progesterone had no effect on luciferase activity while NET and LNG induced luciferase activity that was blocked by ICI 182,780. Zebrafish-ERs competition assays showed that NET and LNG were unable to bind to ERs, suggesting that the effects of these compounds on cyp19a1b require metabolic activation prior to elicit estrogenic activity. Overall, we demonstrate that 19-nortestosterone derived progestins elicit estrogenic activity by inducing cyp19a1b expression in radial glial cells. Given the crucial role of radial glial cells and neuro-estrogens in early development of brain, the consequences of exposure of fish to these compounds require further investigation. © 2016.",,10.1016/j.taap.2016.05.019,Progesterone Congeners;Brain,27245768,NA,several synthetic progestins disrupt the glial cell specificbrain aromatase expression in developing zebra fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significantly higher prevalence of mycobacteriosis and pathological changes were documented in burbot (Lota lota) from Mjøsa compared to burbot from Losna. Further, transcriptional profiling identified changes in gene expression in burbot from Mjøsa compared to burbot from Losna associated with drug metabolism enzymes and oxidative stress. POP extracted from burbot liver oil from the two lakes was used to expose zebrafish (Danio rerio) during two consecutive generations. During both generations, POP mixtures from both lakes increased the rate of mortality, induced earlier onset of puberty, and skewed sex ratio toward males. However, opposite effects on weight gain were found in exposure groups compared to controls during the two generations. Exposure to POP from both lakes was associated with suppression of ovarian follicle development. Analyses of genome-wide transcription profiling identified functional networks of genes associated with weight homeostasis, steroid hormone functions, and insulin signaling. In human cell studies using adrenocortical H295R and primary porcine theca and granulosa cells, exposure to lake extracts from both populations modulated steroid hormone production with significant difference from controls.

The mechanisms are likely multiple since different progestins interact with other steroid receptors in addition to progesterone receptors. Puberty is the process when animals first acquire the capability to reproduce and it comprises maturation of sperm and eggs. In zebrafish, puberty is initiated around 45 days post fertilization (dpf) in females and around 53–55 dpf in males, and is marked by increased production of pituitary gonadotropins. We exposed juvenile zebrafish from 20 to 80 dpf to the androgenic progestin levonorgestrel at concentrations of 5.5, 79 and 834 ng L−1 and to the non-androgenic progestin progesterone at concentrations of 3.7, 77 and 1122 ng L−1, during sexual differentiation and puberty. Levonorgestrel exposure caused 100% males even at the lowest concentration tested whereas progesterone did not affect the sex ratio. Transcript levels of the gonadal genes amh, CYP11B and CYP19a1a indicated that the masculinizing effect of levonorgestrel occurred very rapidly. Transcript concentrations of gonadotropins in pituitaries were low in control fish at 44 dpf, but high at 55 dpf and onward. In fish exposed to levonorgestrel or progesterone gonadotropin transcript concentrations were high already at 44 dpf, indicating that both progestins caused precocious puberty. Gonad histology at 50 dpf confirmed a well advanced sexual maturation, but only in males. Our results show that progestins can affect sexual development in fish and that the androgenic progestin levonorgestrel induces a male phenotype at concentrations similar to those detected in aquatic environments. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.06.010,Bias (Epidemiology);Puberty,27348263,NA,developmental exposure to progestins causes male bias and precocious puberty in zebrafish danio rerio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Synthetic progestins are components of human contraceptive and hormone replacement pharmaceuticals. Both progestogens and progestins enter the environment through a number of sources, and have been shown to cause profound effects on reproductive health in various aquatic vertebrates. Progestins are designed to bind human progesterone receptors, but they also have been shown to strongly activate androgen receptors in fish. Levonorgestrel (LNG) activates fish androgen receptors and induces development of male secondary sex characteristics in females of other species. Although behavior has been postulated to be a sensitive early indicator of exposure to certain environmental contaminants, no such research on the reproductive behavior of gestagen-exposed fish has been conducted to date. The goal of our study was to examine the exposure effects of a human contraceptive progestin, LNG, on the reproductive development and behavior of the viviparous eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). Internal fertilization is a requisite characteristic of viviparous species, and is enabled by an androgen driven elongation of the anal fin into the male gonopodium (i.e., phallus). In this study, we exposed adult mosquitofish to ethanol (EtOH control), 10 ng/L, and 100 ng/L LNG for 8 d using a static replacement exposure design. After 8 d, a subset of males and females from each treatment were examined for differences in the 4:6 anal fin ratio. In addition, paired social interaction trials were performed using individual control males and control females or females treated 10 ng/L or 100 ng/L LNG. Female mosquitofish exposed to LNG were masculinized as evidenced by the elongation of the anal fin rays, a feature normal to males and abnormal to females. LNG caused significant increases in the 4:6 anal fin ratios of female mosquitofish in both the 10 ng/L and 100 ng/L treatments, although these differences were not significant between the two treatments. LNG caused significant increases in the 4:6 anal fin ratio of males exposed to 100 ng/L, with no effects observed in the 10 ng/L treatment. In addition, the reproductive behavior of control males paired with female mosquitofish exposed to 100 ng/L LNG was also altered, for these males spent more time exhibiting no reproductive behavior, had decreased attending behavior, and a lower number of gonopodial thrusts compared to control males paired to control female mosquitofish. Given the rapid effects on both anal fin morphology and behavior observed in this study, the mosquitofish is an excellent sentinel species for the detection of exposure to LNG and likely other 19-nortestosterone derived contraceptive progestins in the environment. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ygcen.2016.01.007,Reproductive Behavior,26795917,NA,aqueous exposure to the progestin levonorgestrel alters anal fin development and reproductive behavior in the eastern mosquitofish gambusia holbrooki,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gestodene is a human contraceptive progestin and a potent activator of fish androgen receptors. Our objective was to test the effects of gestodene on reproductive behavior and associated egg deposition in the fathead minnow. After only 1 day, males exposed to ng/L of gestodene were more aggressive and less interested in courtship and mating, and exposed females displayed less female courtship behavior. Interestingly, 25% of the gestodene tanks contained a female that drove the male out of the breeding tile and displayed male-typical courtship behaviors toward the other female. Gestodene decreased or arrested egg deposition with no observed gonadal histopathology. Together, these results suggest that effects on egg deposition are primarily due to altered reproductive behavior. The mechanisms by which gestodene disrupts behavior are unknown.

Estuarine water samples were collected from Sihchong Creek and Baoli Creek estuaries, Taiwan, in March of 2012 to assess the whole effluent toxicity (WET) of domestic wastewater produced by the local residents and tourists. Chemical analysis detected various pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the field water samples. Some of these PPCPs are endocrine disrupting chemicals. In the laboratory-based bioassay, breeding pairs were exposed to the water samples (Sihchong, Baoli, and control) for 21 days. Cumulative number of eggs spawned was significantly higher in the Sihchong group. While fish swimming activity was not affected, sexual behavior of the male fish was significantly induced in both Sihchong and Baoli groups. Male and female gonad histology was not affected. Expression level of biomarker genes CYP1A1, HSP70, and VTG was significantly induced in the Sihchong group. This study indicates that the mixture of contaminants contained in the estuarine water may cause endocrine disrupting effects in fish. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.02.057,Gene Expression;Sexual Behavior,26919805,NA,endocrine disrupting effects of domestic wastewater on reproduction sexual behavior and gene expression in the brackish medaka oryzias melastigma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of these products are designed for human physiology but owing to the conservative nature of vertebrate evolution they also tend to have effects on aquatic organisms and fishes in particular when they find their way into aquatic systems via wastewater effluent. One area of research has focused on reproductive control and the associated hormone treatments. Many of these hormones affect the reproductive physiology of fishes and may cause feminization of male reproductive traits. Alternative medicines have also been widely used particularly in traditional cultures but few of these alternative treatments have been assessed with respect to their potential impact on aquatic ecosystems. Rue (Rutagraveolens) has been used as a male contraceptive in traditional medicines but its effects on fish behavior and reproductive anatomy have yet to be established. Here we show that treating Siamese fighting fish, Bettasplendens, with extract of rue has a significant effect on key aggressive/reproductive behaviors and the propensity to explore novel objects (boldness). In all cases the respective behaviors were reduced relative to controls and sham injected fish. Histological analysis of the testes revealed that rue exposure reduced the number of spermatozoa but increased the number of spermatocytes relative to controls. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,10.1007/s10646-016-1639-5,,26924199,NA,the toxicological effect of ruta graveolens extract in siamese fighting fish a behavioral and histopathological approach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we show that continuous exposure of male mice from early development to the adult life (140 days) to unrestricted drinking of wastewater collected from a municipal sewage treatment plant, is associated with an increased adipose deposition and weight gain during adulthood because of altered body homeostasis. In parallel, bisphenol A (BPA) at the administration dose of 5 μg/kg/body weight, shows an increasing effect on total body weight and fat mass. In vitro, a solid phase extract (SPE) of the wastewater (eTW), caused stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation at dilutions of 0.4 and 1 % in the final culture medium which contained a concentration of BPA of 40 nM and 90 nM respectively. Pure BPA also promoted adipocytes differentiation at the concentration of 50 and 80 μM. BPA effect in 3T3-L1 cells was associated to the specific activation of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in undifferentiated cells and the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) in differentiated cells. BPA also activated the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma (PPARγ) upregulating a minimal 3XPPARE luciferase reporter and the PPARγ-target promoter of the aP2 gene in adipose cells, while it was not effective in preadipocytes. The pure estrogen receptor agonist diethylstilbestrol (DES) played an opposite action to that of BPA inhibiting PPARγ activity in adipocytes, preventing cell differentiation, activating ERα in preadipocytes and inhibiting ERα and ERβ regulation in adipocytes. The results of this work show that the drinking of chemically-contaminated wastewater promotes fat deposition in male mice and that EDs present in sewage are likely responsible for this effect through a nuclear receptor-mediated mechanism. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.taap.2016.02.023,Cell Differentiation,26944108,NA,municipal wastewater affects adipose deposition in male mice and increases 3t3l1 cell differentiation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, ESRs of only a limited number of species have been characterized. We investigated the functional diversity and molecular basis or ligand sensitivity of ESRs among ray-finned fish species (Actinopterygii), the most variable group within vertebrates. We cloned and characterized ESRs from several key species in the evolution of ray-finned fish including bichir (Polypteriformes, ESR1 and ESR2) at the basal lineage of ray-finned fish, and arowana (Osteoglossiformes, ESR1 and ESR2b) and eel (Anguilliformes, ESR1, ESR2a and ESR2b) both belonging to ancient early-branching lineages of teleosts, and suggest that ESR2a and ESR2b emerged through teleost-specific whole genome duplication, but an ESR1 paralogue has been lost in the early lineage of euteleost fish species. All cloned ESR isoforms showed similar responses to endogenous and synthetic steroidal estrogens, but they responded differently to non-steroidal estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) (e.g., ESR2a exhibits a weaker reporter activity compared with ESR2b). We show that variation in ligand sensitivity of ESRs can be attributed to phylogeny among species of different taxonomic groups in ray-finned fish.

Although the enzyme is currently only known from a few closely related denitrifying bacterial strains affiliated to the Rhodocyclaceae, it clearly marks a universally occurring mechanism used for attacking recalcitrant substrates in the absence of oxygen. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase belongs to subfamily 2 of the DMSO reductase-type molybdenum enzymes together with paralogous enzymes involved in the oxygen-independent hydroxylation of p-cymene, the isoprenoid side chains of sterols and even possibly n-alkanes; the subfamily also extends to dimethylsulfide dehydrogenases, selenite, chlorate and perchlorate reductases and, most significantly, dissimilatory nitrate reductases. The biochemical, spectroscopic and structural properties of the oxygen-independent hydroxylases among these enzymes are summarized and compared. All of them consist of three subunits, contain a molybdenum-bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor, five Fe-S clusters and a heme b cofactor of unusual ligation, and are localized in the periplasmic space as soluble enzymes. In the case of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase, it has been determined that the heme b cofactor has a rather high redox potential, which may also be inferred for the paralogous hydroxylases. The known structure of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase allowed the calculation of detailed models of the reaction mechanism based on the density function theory as well as QM-MM (quantum mechanics - molecular mechanics) methods, which yield predictions of mechanistic properties such as kinetic isotope effects that appeared consistent with experimental data. © 2016 S.

Previous studies on phthalates have reported anti-androgenic activity in mammals, causing concerns of their potential effects on the reproduction of aquatic organisms. Another group of environmental endocrine disrupters, steroidal estrogens, are known to inhibit steroid biosynthesis in the gonads, but the effects related to spermatogenesis are not well understood in fish. In this study, three-spined sticklebacks were exposed to di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and 17α ethinyl-oestradiol (EE2) at nominal concentrations 35. μg/L and 40 ng/L, respectively, for four days. The aim of the study was to obtain insight into the acute transcriptional responses putatively associated with endocrine disruption. RNA samples from eight individual male fish per treatment (including controls) were used in microarray analysis, covering the expression of approximately 21,000 genes. In the EE2 treatment the results show transcriptional downregulation of genes associated with steroid biosynthesis pathway and up-regulation of genes involved in pathways related to epidermal growth factor signaling and xenobiotic metabolism. The transcriptional response to DBP was in general weaker than to EE2, but based on enrichment analysis, we suggest adverse effects on retinoid metabolism, creatine kinase activity and cell adhesion. Among the genes showing highest fold changes after DBP treatment compared to control was the teleost fish -specific cytochrome P450 17A2.

Adverse effects associated with EDC exposure have been documented in aquatic biota and there is widespread interest in the characterization and understanding of their modes of action. Fish are considered one of the primary risk organisms for EDCs. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are increasingly used as an animal model to study the effects of endocrine disruptors, due to their advantages compared to other model organisms. One approach to assess the toxicity of a compound is to identify those patterns of gene expression found in a tissue or organ exposed to particular classes of chemicals, through new technologies in genomics (toxicogenomics), such as microarrays or whole-genome sequencing. Application of these technologies permit the quantitative analysis of thousands of gene expression changes simultaneously in a single experiment and offer the opportunity to use transcript profiling as a tool to predict toxic outcomes of exposure to particular compounds.

One group of chemical contaminants with the potential to disrupt the mechanisms of female mate choice is endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs); a broad class of environmental pollutants that can interfere with the endocrinology of organisms at extremely low concentrations. Recent research has revealed that estrogenic EDCs can affect female mate choice in fish, but the impact of androgenic EDC exposure is yet to be studied. To address this, we investigated the effects of an environmentally relevant concentration of trenbolone - an androgenic steroid used as a growth promoter in the cattle industry - on female mate choice in wild-caught guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We exposed male and female guppies to 17β-trenbolone for 21 days (measured concentration 4. ng/L) via a flow-through system, and found that trenbolone-exposed female guppies spent less time associating with males, and were less choosy, compared to unexposed females. In contrast, trenbolone had no impact on male reproductive behavior or morphology. This is the first study to show that androgenic EDC exposure can disrupt female mate choice, highlighting the need for studies to investigate the behavioral impacts of environmental contaminants on both sexes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.09.019,,26466515,NA,exposure to an agricultural contaminant 17βtrenbolone impairs female mate choice in a freshwater fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, Japanese medaka were exposed to 1.5. mg/L of bisphenol A or lignin-derived bisphenol for 60 days, and the expressions of various biochemical markers, effects on reproduction, and histopathology were evaluated. The results showed that concentrations of liver vitellogenin of LD-BP exposed males were approximately 125% higher compared to the control males. Total number of eggs from the BPA and LD-BP exposed fish was approximately 47% (p< 0.001) and 25% (p< 0.05) less than the control fish, respectively. Total number of brood was lower from the BPA (46%, p< 0.05) and LD-BP (17%, p< 0.05) exposed fish than that of the control fish. Relative to the control fish, catalase and glutathione- S-transferase were significantly affected by the two chemicals in all tested tissues. BPA and LD-BP caused lipid peroxidation in all the tested tissues. Furthermore, acetylcholinesterase and α-glucosidase activity were significantly inhibited. Histopathological analysis showed that both the testis and ovary were mildly damaged by both chemicals. LD-BP affected medaka slightly more severe than BPA except on the reproduction, which was most likely due to different uptake, translocation, binding to targets and metabolism. Our results demonstrated that chronic exposure to both chemicals caused several adverse effects to medaka.

The acute toxicities of the model substances and the sediment extracts were determined by means of the fish embryo test as specified in OECD TG 236, and concentrations as low as the effective concentration at 10 % inhibition (EC10) were used as the highest test concentration in the acetylcholinesterase test in order to avoid nonspecific systemic effects mimicking neurotoxicity. Among the model compounds, only the known acetylcholinesterase inhibitors paraoxon-methyl and chlorpyrifos produced a strong inhibition to about 20 and 33 %, respectively, of the negative controls. For the sediment extracts, a reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity to about 60 % could only be shown for the Vering Canal sediment extracts; this could be correlated to high contents of acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as identified by chemical analyses. Co-incubation of the Vering Canal sediment extracts with chlorpyrifos at EC10 concentrations each did not significantly increase the inhibitory effect of chlorpyrifos, indicating that the mode of action of acetylcholinesterase inhibition by the sediment-borne PAHs is different to that of the typical acetylcholinesterase blocker chlorpyrifos.

Synthetic progestins are used for contraception and as P4 for medical treatments as well. Despite significant use, their ecotoxicological implications are poorly understood. Only about 50% of the progestins in use have been analyzed for their environmental occurrence and effects in aquatic organisms. Here we critically summarize concentrations and effects of progestins in aquatic systems. P4 and progestins were mostly detected when analyzed for, and they occurred in the low ng/L range in wastewater and surface water. In animal farm waste and runoff, they reached up to several μg/L. P4 and synthetic progestins act through progesterone receptors but they also interact with other steroid hormone receptors. They act on the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis, lead to oocyte maturation in female and sperm motility in male fish. Additionally, other pathways are affected as well, including the circadian rhythm. Effects of P4, mifepristone and eleven synthetic progestins have been studied in fish and a few compounds in frogs and mussels. Environmental risks may be associated with P4, dydrogesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate, where transcriptional effects were found at highest environmental levels. Reproductive effects occurred at higher levels. However, norethindrone, levonorgestrel and norgestrel compromised reproduction at environmental (ng/L) concentrations. Thus, some of the progestins are very active endocrine disrupters. This review summarizes the current state of the art and highlights risks for fish.

Both EE2 and QUIN inhibited spawning but did so through different mechanisms. EE2 affected follicular development (reduced ovarian size and reduction in the proportion of cortical alveolus, vitellogenic and mature follicle stages), steroidogenesis (reduced expression of aromatase), maturation (reduced luteinizing hormone receptor expression) and ovulation (reduced expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and the nuclear progesterone receptor). Although EE2 alters the proportion of follicle stages within the ovary, the downregulation of gene expression as a consequence of EE2 exposure was primarily due to a decline in expression of the genes of interest in vitellogenic and mature ovarian follicles. QUIN targeted ovulation via a reduction of the steroid 17α,20β dihydroxy-4-prenen-3-one (17α,20β-P) and decreased expression of the prostaglandin metabolizing enzyme cyclooxygenase 2. This study demonstrates the usefulness in defining the impacts of toxicants at the molecular and cellular, organ and whole organism level and how connections between these impacts can be used to describe the adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) that mediate toxicant action. Histological analysis and gene expression were effective tools in defining the AOPs of QUIN and EE2 while the measurement of reproductive hormones level did not provide much valuable information regarding the toxicant's mode of action. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ygcen.2015.01.013,Quinacrine,25644209,NA,inhibition of spawning in zebrafish danio rerio adverse outcome pathways of quinacrine and ethinylestradiol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cascading effects from molecular responses to adverse outcomes at the population level are well-established in a few cases. Conventional risk assessment is hardly applicable to EDCs: because they are active at very low doses, effects vary deeply according to developmental stages, and in many cases the dose-response is nonmonotonic. In silico and in vitro tools should be developed for prioritization of potential EDCs. However, in vivo assays remains indispensable, particularly full life-cycle and multigeneration assays.

Many aquatic species, such as fish, amphibians, aquatic reptiles and mammals, are exposed daily to high concentrations of BPA and ethinyl estradiol (EE2), estrogen in birth control pills. In this review, we will predominantly focus on BPA and EE2, well-described estrogenic EDCs. First, the evidence that BPA and EE2 are detectable in almost all bodies of water will be discussed. We will consider how BPA affects sexual and neural development in these species, as these effects have been the best characterized across taxa. For instance, such chemicals have been in many cases reported to cause sex-reversal of males to females. Even if these chemicals do not overtly alter the gonadal sex, there are indications that several EDCs might demasculinize male-specific behaviors that are essential for attracting a mate. In so doing, these chemicals may reduce the likelihood that these males reproduce. If exposed males do reproduce, the concern is that they will then be passing on compromised genetic fitness to their offspring and transmitting potential transgenerational effects through their sperm epigenome. We will thus consider how diverse epigenetic changes might be a unifying mechanism of how BPA and EE2 disrupt several processes across species. Such changes might also serve as universal species diagnostic biomarkers of BPA and other EDCs exposure. Lastly, the evidence that estrogenic EDCs-induced effects in aquatic species might translate to humans will be considered. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ygcen.2014.09.014,Ethinyl Estradiol;Estradiol;Estrogens,25277515,NA,effects of the environmental estrogenic contaminants bisphenol a and 17αethinyl estradiol on sexual development and adult behaviors in aquatic wildlife species,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Male-typical behaviors are often reduced after exposure, suggesting that exposure may have population-level effects. One way in which exposure may exert population-level effects is by interfering with communication within a network of individuals. Acute exposure to the estrogen mimic 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) disrupts the ability of male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, to modify their behavior during male-male interactions when an audience is present. However, it is unknown whether audience effects during male-female interactions may be similarly altered. To examine this, male-female pairs that were given an acute exposure to EE2 or remained unexposed interacted in the presence of a female, male, or no audience. Sex differences were found between unexposed males and females. More interactant-directed gill flaring was displayed by control males when a male audience was present while control females performed this behavior more in the presence of an audience, regardless of sex. Both males and females in the control group performed more interactant-directed tail beats in the presence of a female audience. EE2 exposure made all audience effects disappear as treated males and females did not differ in their responses between audience types. These results demonstrate that acute exposure to EE2 may disrupt behavioral adjustments to audience type within a social network. This disruption may, in turn, influence population dynamics in this species as both males and females use information obtained from observing interactions in later encounters with the observed individuals. © 2015.",,10.1016/j.beproc.2015.02.008,,25697944,NA,acute exposure to 17αethinylestradiol disrupts audience effect on malefemale interactions in betta splendens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted whole-lake additions of an active component of the birth control pill (17α-ethynylestradiol; EE2) that resulted in the collapse of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) population. Here we quantify physiological, population, and genetic characteristics of this population over the 7 years after EE2 additions stopped to determine if complete recovery was possible. By 3 years post-treatment, whole-body vitellogenin concentrations in male fathead minnow had returned to baseline, and testicular abnormalities were absent. In the spring of the fourth year, adult size-frequency distribution and abundance had returned to pretreatment levels. Microsatellite analyses clearly showed that postrecovery fish were descendants of the original EE2-treated population. Results from this whole-lake experiment demonstrate that fish can recover from EE2 exposure at the biochemical through population levels, although the timelines to do so are long for multigenerational exposures.

We have previously demonstrated that the reproductive behavior of male zebrafish, Danio rerio, remain intact after lifelong exposure to low concentrations of EE2 (0.05 and 0.5ngL-1), concentrations high enough to cause morphological alterations of the male phenotype. Despite normal courtship behavior, the reproductive output is suppressed when these males were paired with unexposed females. In this study, we include the female courtship behavior in the analyzes of EE2's effects on behavior. Groups of male zebrafish were exposed to nominally 0, 1, 3 and 10ngL-1 of EE2 from hatching to adulthood and subsequently individually paired with an unexposed female. Eleven distinct elements of the reproductive behavior were then extracted and analyzed using an automated video tracking system. Subsequently, male brains were isolated and the expression of genes encoding estrogenic receptors ERα, ERβ1 and ERβ2, the androgen receptor AR, and the aromatase cyp19a1b were compared with the expression in brains of unexposed males. (In this article gene expression is taken synonymous to transcription, although it is acknowledged that it can also be regulated by, e.g., mRNA and protein stability, and translation). The results confirmed that the male reproductive behavior was unaffected by the EE2 treatments. Also, the expressions of genes encoding estrogen and androgen receptors were unaffected. Only the gene encoding aromatase was 0.6 fold down-regulated. In contrast, and most surprisingly, nearly all the elements in the female courtship behavior were significantly disturbed, despite the fact that these females had never been exposed to EE2; most likely elicited by differences in male morphology, pheromones or some other unrevealed mechanism. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.01.020,Reproductive Behavior,25646721,NA,disrupted reproductive behavior in unexposed female zebrafish danio rerio paired with males exposed to low concentrations of 17αethinylestradiol ee2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we focus on recent published evidence of the harmful effects of EDCs on reproductive function in zebrafish, including skewed sex ratio, immature gonads, diminished sexual behaviour, decreased sperm count, reduced spawning and fertilization. These impairments mostly result from disruption to sex-steroid hormones induced by endocrine disruptors. We also discuss other effects of exposure to EDCs. In EDC exposure research, despite incomplete assessments of altered gonad histopathology and sexual behaviour, these present potential effective biomarkers or pathways for evaluating the reproductive function in zebrafish on EDC exposure. To date, the pernicious effects of some EDCs on the reproductive performance in laboratory zebrafish are well understood; however, similar alterations remain for further determination in wild-type fish and more kinds of EDCs. More studies should be performed under established scientific regulatory criteria to investigate the impact of EDCs on reproduction in zebrafish.

This iterative pathway of aptamer generation consists of sequential positive and counterselection steps. The present research aimed to select two sets of ssDNA aptamers which both are able to bind to different functional groups on the cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene ring of 17β-estradiol (E2). By repetitively switching between positive selection steps using E2 as target molecule and counterselection steps with nortestosterone as countermolecule, aptamers were successfully selected against the hydroxylated aromatic A ring of E2. Additionally, an aptamer which binds the upper segments of the B, C and D ring of the cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene ring of E2 was generated after repetitively swapping between positive selection steps with E2 as target molecule and counterselection steps with dexamethasone as countermolecule. Epitope specificity of the aptamers was demonstrated by evaluating their binding responses toward a number of steroid hormones structurally related to E2.

Here we evaluated the effect of BDE-47 exposure on sexual and reproductive behaviors in zebrafish (. Danio rerio). Methods: We used a charge-coupled device camera to evaluate 3 standard male zebrafish sexual behaviors-chasing, female association and induced female spawning-and assessed effects on reproductive success in female zebrafish that mated with exposed males. Results: After 21-day BDE-47 exposure, the frequency and total time of males associating with females was dose-dependently decreased. With the highest BDE-47 exposure, 1000. μg/L, the frequency of inducing spawning was decreased. Sexual behaviors and spawning outcome were closely associated in both control and exposure groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed BDE-47 exposure and total time of female association as the main factors contributing to induced female spawning behaviors, which affected final egg production. Multiple stepwise regression analysis suggested that female association and induced spawning by males were associated with egg production. Meanwhile, fecundity was lower for BDE-47-treated groups than controls, with only a significant difference with the highest dose. BDE-47 exposure at 100 and 1000. μg/L in males decreased fertilization rate, but BDE47 had no effect on hatching rate.

We show that perch became more active while damselfly behaviour was unaffected, illustrating that behavioural effects of pharmaceuticals can differ between species. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prey consumption can be an important exposure route as on average 46% of the pharmaceutical in ingested prey accumulated in the predator. This suggests that investigations of exposure through bioconcentration, where trophic interactions and subsequent bioaccumulation of exposed individuals are ignored, underestimate exposure.

While the majority of generated transformation products are likely benign, substantial conservation of structure in transformation products can imply conservation or even creation of bioactivity across multiple biological end points and thus incomplete mitigation of ecological risk. Therefore, focusing solely on parent compound removal for contaminants of higher relative risk, the most common approach to fate characterization, provides no mechanistic relationship to potential biological effects and is inadequate as a comprehensive metric for reduction of ecological risks.

However, the effects of fluoxetine on reproductive and paternal behavior in fish remain understudied, particularly at environmentally relevant concentrations. In the current study, we therefore tested the hypothesis that waterborne fluoxetine at an environmentally relevant concentration (540 ng/l), disrupts specific reproductive and paternal behaviors in male Siamese fighting fish at distinct reproductive phases. A pre-post test design was adopted to investigate specific behavioral responses at the individual fish level in response to male conspecific intruders at two different distances from the nest across four distinct reproductive phases (before bubblenest construction, following bubblenest construction, after spawning and after hatching of the larvae). In the control specimens, the measured behaviours were not different between the spawning times and among the interactions in either distance to nest at the different reproduction phases. Our results indicate that fluoxetine specifically disrupts characteristic paternal territorial aggression behaviour only after spawning and hatching of the larvae, while male behaviour in previous reproductive phases is unaffected by fluoxetine exposure. Results of comparison between males at 1st spawning and specimens exposed to fluoxetine at 2nd spawning showed that the first reaction of the nest-holding males to the intruders, duration of fin spreading, number of bites, and 90° turn, and the frequency of sweeps were different between the spawning times after spawning or hatching of embryos. However, interaction of spawning time and reproduction phase was significant on biting behaviour. These results demonstrate that fluoxetine exposure at environmental concentrations negatively affects territorial defense behaviour in fighting fish during parental care after larval hatching, which may have possible implications on reproductive success and population dynamics. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,10.1007/s10646-014-1345-0,Fluoxetine;Aggression,25213287,NA,fluoxetine inhibits aggressive behaviour during parental care in male fighting fish betta splendens regan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, the presence in the environment of some compounds termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can cause adverse effects on reproduction by interfering with the endocrine system. In some cases, exposure to EDCs leads to the animal feminization and male fish may develop oocytes in testis (intersex condition). Mugilid fish are well suited sentinel organisms to study the effects of reproductive EDCs in the monitoring of estuarine/marine environments. Up-regulation of aromatases and vitellogenins in males and juveniles and the presence of intersex individuals have been described in a wide array of mullet species worldwide. There is a need to develop new molecular markers to identify early feminization responses and intersex condition in fish populations, studying mechanisms that regulate gonad differentiation under exposure to xenoestrogens. Interestingly, an electrophoresis of gonad RNA, shows a strong expression of 5S rRNA in oocytes, indicating the potential of 5S rRNA and its regulating proteins to become useful molecular makers of oocyte presence in testis. Therefore, the use of these oocyte markers to sex and identify intersex mullets could constitute powerful molecular biomarkers to assess xenoestrogenicity in field conditions. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI.",,10.3390/md12094756,,25222666,NA,mugilid fish are sentinels of exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds in coastal and estuarine environments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endocrine disrupting chemicals are prevalent and persistent in aquatic ecosystems worldwide. These chemicals are known to have marked effects on the morphology and behavior of exposed individuals and, as such, may serve as a potential influence on behavioral syndromes. However, both the effects of exposure on behaviors beyond courtship and aggression and how exposure might affect behavioral variation at the individual level are understudied. To address this question, we examined boldness behavior in female Siamese fighting fish in three different assays (Novel Environment, Empty Tank, Shoaling) both before and after they were exposed to the estrogen mimic, 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2). EE2 influences courtship, aggression, and boldness in males of this species but its effects have not been examined in females, to our knowledge. Females were tested multiple times in each assay before and after exposure so that behavioral consistency could be examined. A behavioral syndrome for boldness and activity level occurred across the three assays. The reductions in boldness and loss of the behavioral syndrome that resulted from EE2 exposure were surprising and suggest that the effects of EE2 exposure on female behavior and physiology should be examined more frequently. This study is one of the first to examine the effects of EE2 in females as well as on correlated behaviors and emphasizes the importance of examining the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals on individual behavioral variation and consistency. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.yhbeh.2014.08.005,,25161058,NA,acute exposure to 17αethinylestradiol alters boldness behavioral syndrome in female siamese fighting fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it is beyond the scope of this review to provide a comprehensive examination of all of these neuroendocrine disruptors, we will focus on select representative examples. Organochlorine pesticides bioaccumulate in neuroendocrine areas of the brain that directly regulate GnRH neurons, thereby altering the expression of genes downstream of GnRH signaling. Organochlorine pesticides can also agonize or antagonize hormone receptors, adversely affecting crosstalk between neurotransmitter systems. The impacts of polychlorinated biphenyls are varied and in many cases subtle. This is particularly true for neuroedocrine and behavioral effects of exposure. These effects impact sexual differentiation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and other neuroendocrine systems regulating the thyroid, metabolic, and stress axes and their physiological responses. Weakly estrogenic and anti-androgenic pollutants such as bisphenol A, phthalates, phytochemicals, and the fungicide vinclozolin can lead to severe and widespread neuroendocrine disruptions in discrete brain regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus, resulting in behavioral changes in a wide range of species. Behavioral features that have been shown to be affected by one or more these chemicals include cognitive deficits, heightened anxiety or anxiety-like, sociosexual, locomotor, and appetitive behaviors. Neuroactive pharmaceuticals are now widely detected in aquatic environments and water supplies through the release of wastewater treatment plant effluents. The antidepressant fluoxetine is one such pharmaceutical neuroendocrine disruptor. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that can affect multiple neuroendocrine pathways and behavioral circuits, including disruptive effects on reproduction and feeding in fish. There is growing evidence for the association between environmental contaminant exposures and diseases with strong neuroendocrine components, for example decreased fecundity, neurodegeneration, and cardiac disease. It is critical to consider the timing of exposures of neuroendocrine disruptors because embryonic stages of central nervous system development are exquisitely sensitive to adverse effects. There is also evidence for epigenetic and transgenerational neuroendocrine disrupting effects of some pollutants. We must now consider the impacts of neuroendocrine disruptors on reproduction, development, growth and behaviors, and the population consequences for evolutionary change in an increasingly contaminated world. This review examines the evidence to date that various so-called neuroendocrine disruptors can induce such effects often at environmentally-relevant concentrations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ygcen.2014.02.005,,24530523,NA,current concepts in neuroendocrine disruption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is increasing evidence that THs are also involved in gonadal differentiation and reproductive function. Changes in TH status affect sex ratios in developing fish and frogs and reproduction (e.g., fertility), hormone levels, and gonad morphology in adults of species of different vertebrates. In this review, we have summarized and compared the evidence for cross-talk between the steroid hormone and thyroid axes and present a comparative model. We gave special attention to TH regulation of sex steroid synthesis and action in both the brain and gonad, since these are important for gonad development and brain sexual differentiation and have been studied in many species. We also reviewed research showing that there is a TH system, including receptors and enzymes, in the brains and gonads in developing and adult vertebrates. Our analysis shows that THs influences sex steroid hormone synthesis in vertebrates, ranging from fish to pigs.

Chemicals that disrupt androgen signalling and steroidogenesis can result in an imbalanced conversion of testosterone (T) into 17β-estradiol (E2) and other androgens such as 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT). Therefore, a better understanding of how chemicals perturb these pathways is warranted. In this study, the brain, liver, and testes of Silurana tropicalis were exposed ex vivo to the human drug finasteride, a potent steroid 5α-reductase inhibitor and a model compound to study the inhibition of the conversion of T into 5α-DHT. These experiments were conducted (1) to determine organ specific changes in sex steroid production after treatment, and (2) to elucidate the transcriptomic response to finasteride in testicular tissue. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure hormone levels in media following finasteride incubation for 6. h. Finasteride significantly increased T levels in the media of liver and testis tissue, but did not induce any changes in E2 and 5α-DHT production. Gene expression analysis was performed in frog testes and data revealed that finasteride treatment significantly altered 1,434 gene probes. Gene networks associated with male reproduction such as meiosis, hormone biosynthesis, sperm entry, gonadotropin releasing hormone were affected by finasteride exposure as well as other pathways such as oxysterol synthesis, apoptosis, and epigenetic regulation. For example, this study suggests that the mode of action by which finasteride induces cellular damage in testicular tissue as reported by others, is via oxidative stress in testes. This data also suggests that 5-reductase inhibition disrupts the expression of genes related to reproduction. It is proposed that androgen-disrupting chemicals may mediate their action via 5-reductases and that the effects of environmental pollutants are not limited to the androgen receptor signalling. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ygcen.2014.01.018,Transcriptome;Gene Expression Profiling;Finasteride,24530632,NA,transcriptomic profiling in silurana tropicalis testes exposed to finasteride,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research has focused on the effects of estrogenic, androgenic, and thyroidogenic compounds, but there is a growing body of literature on the reproductive health exposure effects of environmental gestagens on aquatic wildlife. Gestagens include native progestogens, such as progesterone, and synthetic progestins, such as gestodene and levonorgestrel, which bind progesterone receptors and have critically important roles in vertebrate physiology, especially reproduction. Roles for progestogen include regulating gamete maturation and orchestrating reproductive behavior, both as circulating hormones and as secreted pheromones. Gestagens enter the aquatic environment through paper mill effluent, wastewater treatment plant effluent, and agricultural runoff. A number of gestagens have been shown to negatively affect reproduction, development, and behavior of exposed fish and other aquatic wildlife at ng/L concentrations, and these compounds have been measured in the environment at single to 375. ng/L. Given the importance of endogenous progestogens in the regulation of gametogenesis, secondary sex characteristics, and reproductive behavior in vertebrates and the documented exposure effects of pharmaceutical progestins and progesterone, environmental gestagens are an emerging class of contaminants that deserve increased attention from researchers and regulators alike. The potential for environmental gestagens to affect the reproductive health of aquatic vertebrates seems evident, but there are a number of important questions for researchers to address in this nascent field. These include identifying biomarkers of gestagen exposure; testing the effects of environmentally relevant mixtures; and determining what other physiological endpoints and taxa might be affected by exposure to environmental gestagens. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ygcen.2014.03.038,,24759355,NA,sources concentrations and exposure effects of environmental gestagens on fish and other aquatic wildlife with an emphasis on reproduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DHT is produced by the reduction of the double-bond of testosterone by a group of enzymes called 5 alpha-reductases of which there can be multiple isoforms (i.e., srd5a1, srd5a2, and srd5a3). Data from amphibians suggest that the expression of the srd5a genes occurs in early development, and continues until adulthood; however insufficient data exist in fish species, where DHT is thought to be relatively biologically inactive. Here, we demonstrate that fathead minnow (FHM; Pimephales promelas) developing embryos and adults express srd5a enzyme isoforms. During FHM embryogenesis, both srd5a1 and srd5a3 mRNA levels were significantly correlated in expression levels while srd5a2 showed a more unique pattern of expression. In adult FHMs, males had significantly higher levels of srd5a2 in the liver and gonad compared to females. In the male and female liver, transcript levels for srd5a2 were more abundant compared to srd5a1 and srd5a3, suggesting a prominent role for srd5a2 in this tissue. Interestingly, the ovary expressed higher mRNA levels of srd5a3 than the testis. Thus, data suggest that srd5a isoforms can show sexually dimorphic expression patterns in fish. We also conducted a literature review of the biological effects observed in embryonic and adult fish and amphibians after treatments with DHT and DHT-related compounds. Treatments with DHT in teleost fishes and amphibians have resulted in unexpected biological responses that are characteristic of both androgens and anti-androgens. For example, in fish DHT can induce vitellogenin in vitro from male and female hepatocytes and can increase 17β-estradiol production from the teleost ovary. We propose, that to generate further understanding of the roles of DHT in non-mammals, studies are needed that (1) address how DHT is synthesized within tissues of fish and amphibians; (2) examine the full range of biological responses to endogenous DHT, and its interactions with other signaling pathways; and (3) investigate how DHT production varies with reproductive stage. Lastly, we suggest that the Srd5a enzymes can be targets of endocrine disruptors in fish and frogs, which may result in disruptions in the estrogen:androgen balance in aquatic organisms. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ygcen.2014.06.011,,NA,NA,reprint of current perspectives on the androgen 5 alphadihydrotestosterone dht and 5 alphareductases in teleost fishes and amphibians,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extracts of passive samplers were analysed using HPLC fractionation in combination with an invitro androgen receptor antagonist screen (YAS). Anti-androgenic activity was detected in extracts from silicone strips and POCIS A/B at (mean±SD) 1.1±0.1 and 0.55±0.06mg flutamide standard equivalents/sampler respectively, but was not detected in LDPE sampler extracts. POCIS samplers revealed higher selectivity for more polar anti-androgenic HPLC fractions compared with silicone strips. Over 31 contaminants were identified which showed inhibition of YAS activity and were potential anti-androgens, and these included fungicides, germicides, flame retardants and pharmaceuticals.

Studies on mammals indicate that exposures to some chemicals during embryonic development at concentrations that do not produce anatomical malformations may nevertheless produce behavioral deficits later in life, an example of delayed effects. There have been reports of delayed effects in aquatic organisms. Delayed behavioral effects of mercury, chlorinated and other pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and some synthetic hormones in the environment have been reported in fishes and invertebrates; in some cases behavioral effects are manifested years after the exposure. Another type of delayed behavioral effect results from exposure of mature females before fertilization (maternal exposure). Even when embryos and larvae are reared in clean water, offspring may manifest abnormal behaviors following maternal exposure. The reported behavioral changes are generally deleterious and compromise the fitness of the animal in its natural environment. Delayed effects and their impacts on fitness are not considered in standard short-term embryo bioassays, which will therefore underestimate neurotoxicity.

One common group of chemical pollutants present in wastewater are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which can induce morphological and behavioural changes in aquatic organisms. The aim of this study was to compare the reproductive behaviour and morphology of a freshwater fish, the mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), collected from two sites (wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and a putative pristine site). The mosquitofish is a sexually dimorphic livebearer with a coercive mating system. Males inseminate females using their modified anal fin as an intromittent organ. Despite this, females are able to exert some control over the success of male mating attempts by selectively associating with, or avoiding, certain males over others. Using standard laboratory assays of reproductive behaviour, we found that mosquitofish males living in close proximity to WWTP showed increased mating activity compared to those inhabiting a pristine site. More specifically, during behavioural trials in which males were allowed to interact with females separated by a transparent divider, we found that WWTP-males spent more time associating with females. Concordant with this, when males and females were subsequently allowed to interact freely, WWTP-males also spent more time chasing and orienting towards the females. As a result, females from both sites showed more interest towards the WWTP-site males. Male anal fin morphology, however, did not differ between sites. Our study illustrates that lifetime exposure to WWTP-effluents can greatly affect male behaviour. The results underscore the importance of behaviour as a potential tool for investigating unknown contaminants in the environment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.02.001,,24569133,NA,altered reproductive behaviours in male mosquitofish living downstream from a sewage treatment plant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated for the first time effects of environmental androgens on oocyte maturation and effects of anti-androgens on androgen-induced oocyte maturation, using Xenopus GVBD in vitro. Trenbolone and nandrolone, two environmental androgens, were found to induce Xenopus GVBD at low concentrations. The potential of trenbolone to induce GVBD was approximately 100-fold lower than that of testosterone, while nandrolone had a several-fold lower potential than testosterone. Our findings have aroused new concerns for effects of environmental androgens on amphibian oocyte maturation at environmentally relevant concentrations, and suggested that Xenopus GVBD can be used to test androgenic activity of suspicious environmental androgens. Androgen receptor (AR) antagonist flutamide at 10. μM only exhibited a weakly inhibitory effect on androgen-induced GVBD, while another known AR antagonist vinclozolin had no effect even at high concentrations. The results show that Xenopus GVBD is not sensitive to AR-mediated environmental anti-androgens. In contrast to flutamide and vinclozolin, methoxychlor (a weaker AR antagonist) inhibited dramatically androgen-induced GVBD, suggesting that androgen-induced Xenopus GVBD can be used to study non-AR-mediated effects of chemicals on oocyte maturation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,10.1016/j.tiv.2013.12.003,Oocytes,24362045,NA,environmental antiandrogenic chemicals affect germinal vesicle breakdown gvbd of xenopus laevis oocytes in vitro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The negative effect of human activity on sex differentiation and reproductive output in fish is so diverse that it has been difficult to encompass it in a single book. This book serves as the first attempt to do so. Unlike in mammals, the expression of a host of sex differentiation genes in fish is mostly controlled by environmental factors. Not surprisingly, environmental sex differentiation is ubiquitous in fish. Overexploitation by capture fisheries does not disrupt sex differentiation but crowding in aqua-farms does, by reducing accessibility to food supply. Some of the man-made chemicals routinely used worldwide mimic endogenous hormones. For example endosulfan, which is widely used in developing countries, disrupts endogenous hormones and feminizes fish. For the first time, this book views endocrine disruption from the point of labile early life and non-labile adult stages. It shows that sex can irreversibly be reversed, when exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during early labile stages but reversibly impairs reproductive output on exposure to EDCs during non-labile adult stage. A consequence of climate change, elevated temperature, and declining oxygen and pH levels is that it masculinises genetic female fish. Fish display a remarkable ability to postpone the labile period. Besides postponement, some primary and tertiary gonochores have two distinct labile periods amenable to temperature and hormonal manipulations. Hermaphrodites have retained the period until the end of the adult stage and are capable of sex change/reversal more than once in both male and female directions. © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,10.1201/b17948,,NA,NA,environmental sex differentiation in fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Geneva, Switzerland) both recently published major and highly authoritative reviews of endocrine disrupting chemicals in the natural environment and their effects on reproduction and health in both humans and wildlife. One surprising conclusion to emerge from these reviews was that there are relatively few well documented reports of endocrine disruption (ED) in wild mammals, mainly because much of the available evidence is correlative and does not conclusively demonstrate that the chemicals in question cause the physiological and phenotypic problems attributed to them. However, based on strong evidence from studies of wild birds, reptiles, invertebrates, and laboratory animals, it is difficult to imagine that wild mammals would be the exception. This chapter is therefore included to emphasize the point that the role of reproductive science within wildlife conservation is much broader than a narrow focus on artificial breeding technologies. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,10.1007/978-1-4939-820-2_4,,25091906,NA,impacts of endocrine disrupting chemicals on reproduction in wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, feminization of artificially reared offspring by feeding of specific living organisms has never been reported. Methods: Different food (including Limnodilus spp collected from the wild) and time treatment were applied to southern catfish. In addition, EDCs in Limnodilus spp., an annelid worm collected from wild contaminated small streams, was detected by LC-MS (Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). Serum estradiol-17. β and vitellogenin (VTG) levels and gonadal Sf1, Dmrt1, Foxl2, Cyp19. a1. a expression levels in the catfish were measured through Estradiol/VTG EIA Kit and real-time PCR. Results: Here we report that feeding of Limnodilus spp. resulted in complete feminization of southern catfish, which has a 1:1 sex ratio in wild conditions. Furthermore, HPLC analysis showed that the extraction of Limnodilus spp. contained EDCs, including bisphenol A (BPA), diethylstilbestrol (DES), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), which were further confirmed by LC-MS. Feeding southern catfish using commercial diets sprayed with EDCs cocktail also resulted in 100% female, whereas the control fish displayed approximate 1:1 sex ratio. Limnodilus spp. fed fish displayed similar serum estradiol-17. β and VTG levels and gonadal Sf1, Dmrt1, Foxl2, Cyp19. a1. a expression levels to those of female control. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that EDCs in Limnodilus spp. cause southern catfish feminization by affecting aromatase expression and endogenous estrogen level.

AhR agonist activity and genotoxic response were frequently detected in samples collected during different seasons. In particular, dry-season water and sediment samples from Erren River showed strong AhR agonist activity (201-1423ngL-1 and 1374-5631ngg-1 β-naphthoflavone equivalents) and high genotoxic potential. Although no significant correlation was found between AhR agonist activity and genotoxicity, potential genotoxicants in sample extracts were suggested to be causative agents for yeast growth inhibition in the AhR-responsive reporter gene assay. After high performance liquid chromatography fractionation, AhR agonist candidates were detected in several fractions of Erren River water and sediment extracts, while possible genotoxicants were only found in water extracts. In addition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the typical contaminants showing high AhR binding affinity, were only minor contributors to the AhR agonist activity detected in Erren River sediment extracts. Our findings displayed the usefulness of bioassays in evaluating the extent of environmental contamination, which may be helpful in reducing the chances of false-negative results obtained from chemical analysis of conventional contaminants.

While the relationship between boldness across contexts and between boldness and aggression are frequently investigated, little is known about how these relationships might change because of environmental disturbances such as exposure to endocrine disrupters. 17α-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) is an oestrogen mimic that is prevalent in aquatic ecosystems worldwide and has severe, negative impacts on the behaviour and physiology of exposed organisms. To assess how EE2 affects boldness and decision making, male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, received repeated trials of three boldness assays (novel environment, empty tank and novel object) and one decision-making assay (a dummy male and female presented simultaneously) before and after exposure to acute, nominal doses of EE2. A control group of males received the same number of trials but was not exposed to EE2. When subjects were unexposed, a behavioural syndrome was found for boldness across contexts. In addition, boldness was positively correlated with aggression in the decision-making context. EE2 exposure disrupted this behavioural syndrome. In summary, EE2 exposure reduced overall behavioural response in all contexts, disrupted the behavioural syndrome and reduced behavioural consistency. Thus, even nominal, short-term exposure to EE2 can have dramatic effects on multiple levels of behaviour and potentially generate severe fitness consequences on exposed aquatic species.

Surprisingly, EDC-induced effects on fish sexual behaviour have been poorly studied despite the fact that even subtle alterations might contribute to a disruption of sexual interactions, thus negatively impacting reproduction. As the few assessments on sexual behaviour have been conducted in species with orthodox sex roles, it might be argued that sex-role reversed species might provide a potentially complementary system to further explore the effects of EDCs on reproduction. In the present study, two pipefish species with distinct degrees of sex-role reversal were selected to further elucidate the impact of chronic EE2 exposure on sexual behaviour and reproduction-related endpoints. The obtained results indicate that, independently of the degree of sex role reversal, courtship behaviour seems to resist oestrogenic chemical exposure. However, exposure to environmentally relevant EE2 levels did induce a complete absence of pregnancies at 18ng/L. Even though pregnancies were observed at intermediate concentrations, the percentage of non-transferred or misplaced oocytes increased and a dose-dependent decrease of oocyte volume was observed. Imbalances in the oogenesis process, induction of vitellogenin in males and the absence of pregnancies highlight that environmental relevant concentrations of EE2 have the potential to negatively affect pipefish populations, most of them inhabiting coastal areas where oestrogenic contamination is more prevalent. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2013.10.043,,24220198,NA,estrogenic chemical effects are independent from the degree of sex role reversal in pipefish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DHT is produced by the reduction of the double-bond of testosterone by a group of enzymes called 5 alpha-reductases of which there can be multiple isoforms (i.e., srd5a1, srd5a2, and srd5a3). Data from amphibians suggest that the expression of the srd5a genes occurs in early development, and continues until adulthood; however insufficient data exist in fish species, where DHT is thought to be relatively biologically inactive. Here, we demonstrate that fathead minnow (FHM; Pimephales promelas) developing embryos and adults express srd5a enzyme isoforms. During FHM embryogenesis, both srd5a1 and srd5a3 mRNA levels were significantly correlated in expression levels while srd5a2 showed a more unique pattern of expression. In adult FHMs, males had significantly higher levels of srd5a2 in the liver and gonad compared to females. In the male and female liver, transcript levels for srd5a2 were more abundant compared to srd5a1 and srd5a3, suggesting a prominent role for srd5a2 in this tissue. Interestingly, the ovary expressed higher mRNA levels of srd5a3 than the testis. Thus, data suggest that srd5a isoforms can show sexually dimorphic expression patterns in fish. We also conducted a literature review of the biological effects observed in embryonic and adult fish and amphibians after treatments with DHT and DHT-related compounds. Treatments with DHT in teleost fishes and amphibians have resulted in unexpected biological responses that are characteristic of both androgens and anti-androgens. For example, in fish DHT can induce vitellogenin in vitro from male and female hepatocytes and can increase 17β-estradiol production from the teleost ovary. We propose, that to generate further understanding of the roles of DHT in non-mammals, studies are needed that (1) address how DHT is synthesized within tissues of fish and amphibians; (2) examine the full range of biological responses to endogenous DHT, and its interactions with other signaling pathways; and (3) investigate how DHT production varies with reproductive stage. Lastly, we suggest that the Srd5a enzymes can be targets of endocrine disruptors in fish and frogs, which may result in disruptions in the estrogen:androgen balance in aquatic organisms. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.09.019,,24095809,NA,current perspectives on the androgen 5 alphadihydrotestosterone dht and 5 alphareductases in teleost fishes and amphibians,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intersex condition has been documented in both wild and laboratory animals, including fish, amphibians, and reptiles. In aquatic animals, intersex is often viewed as a signature effect of exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds. At least 37 fish species from 17 families have been identified with intersex gonads in 54 field survey studies. However, reports of the occurrence of intersex at reference sites have led to speculation that a baseline level of intersex is ""normal"". The objective of this critical review was to assess factors potentially associated with baseline levels of intersex in fish and to examine the mechanisms involved in the intersex condition in order to identify priority research areas. Based on current literature, the relationship between intersex and physiological parameters such as plasma sex steroids and vitellogenin is not well characterized or conclusive. Moreover, the literature is not definitive on whether field studies are distinguishing between natural intersex and intersex due to stressors. High throughput transcriptomics will improve understanding of how intersex condition manifests after exposure to aquatic pollution and it is recommended that studies consider both males with and without intersex that inhabit the same polluted site in order to differentiate pathways associated with xenobiotic responses versus molecular pathways associated with intersex. Other experimental design considerations for field studies examining intersex include data collection on life history (e.g. migratory patterns) and improved reference site characterization. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.04.005,,23603430,NA,intersex in teleost fish are we distinguishing endocrine disruption from natural phenomena,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate if variations in salinity or temperature conditions of EE2-exposed mummichog modify the effect on whole organism reproductive endocrine status and gonadal steroidogenesis. Mummichog were exposed in vivo for 14 days to 0, 50 and 250ng/L EE2 in 0, 16 and 32ppt salinity at 18°C and to 0 and 250ng/L EE2 at 10, 18 and 26°C at 16ppt. There was a little overall effect of salinity on measured endpoints. In the salinity exposure, 250ng/L EE2-exposed females had significantly reduced 17β-estradiol (E2) levels. Increased temperature triggered gonadal growth in both sexes and increased plasma E2 and E2 production and decreased 11-KT (11-ketotestosterone) production. EE2 counteracted the effect of temperature by depressing gonadal growth in males. In both exposures, EE2 effects on testosterone (T) production were variable. The use of steroidogenic precursors (25-OH-cholesterol, and/or pregnenolone and/or testosterone) in the in vitro gonadal incubations indicated decreased E2 production in females and 11-KT production in males were predominately due to suppression of the terminal conversion step between T and E2 or 11-KT. Ovarian aromatase A (cyp19a) gene expression at 16ppt and 18°C was not affected by 250ng/L EE2 (the only treatment combinations tested). Overall, temperature is a factor regulating northern mummichog reproduction; EE2 overrides its effects and disrupts the terminal step of steroidogenesis.

Sex ratio and vitellogenin (VTG) induction are the mandatory endocrine endpoints within this test, whereas gonad staging is only included as an option. In the present study, five FSDTs with zebrafish (Danio rerio) were conducted with EDCs with different modes of action (17α-ethinylestradiol, dihydrotestosterone, 17β-trenbolone, prochloraz and 4-tert-pentylphenol). Results document that not only sex ratio and VTG production of the exposed fish were massively affected, but also gonad maturation. As a novel approach for the quantification of gonad maturation in zebrafish, the maturity index was developed to allow not only an improved assessment of dose-dependent EDC-related effects on gonad maturation, but also statistical analysis of histological data.

Most importantly, the maturity index often helped to find appropriate interpretations for results that seemed contradictory at first sight.

Environmental toxicants are a serious health concern, and numerous studies have been devoted to studying the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The effects of EDCs on steroidogenic enzymes may influence steroid secretion and thus lead to reproductive toxicity. To predict hormonal balance disruption on the basis of data on aromatase activity and mRNA level modulation obtained in vitro on granulosa cells, we developed a mathematical model for the last gonadal steps of the sex steroid synthesis pathway. The model can simulate the ovarian synthesis and secretion of estrone, estradiol, androstenedione, and testosterone, and their response to endocrine disruption. The model is able to predict ovarian sex steroid concentrations under normal estrous cycle in female rat, and ovarian estradiol concentrations in adult female rats exposed to atrazine, bisphenol A, metabolites of methoxychlor or vinclozolin, and letrozole. © 2013 Quignot, Bois.",,10.1371/journal.pone.0053891,Computer Simulation;Rats,23326527,NA,a computational model to predict rat ovarian steroid secretion from in vitro experiments with endocrine disruptors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rayyan-1227189074,Endocrine disruption,2013,1,1,,,NA,NA,,Hamlin H.J.,,,CRC Press,,"The endocrine system is a chemical information network made up of certain glands, called endocrine glands, that produce and secrete chemical messages, or hormones. Hormones are important regulators of nearly every aspect of vertebrate life including metabolism, growth, reproduction, and development (Bern, 1990). Certain chemicals in the environment, both man-made and naturally occurring, have the ability to disrupt normal endocrine function, and are collectively referred to as endocrine-disrupting contaminants (EDCs) (Colborn, 1992). Kavlock et al. define an EDC as “an exogenous agent that interferes with the production, release, transport, metabolism, binding, action or elimination of natural hormones in the body responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis and the regulation of developmental processes” (Kavlock et al., 1996). Although other definitions of EDCs currently exist (Colborn, 1992, Chang et al., 2009), it is clear that any chemical with the ability to mimic or antagonize endogenous hormones has the potential to cause a variety of adverse health outcomes. The extent of harm an EDC can impart on an individual or population depends on a variety of factors: the concentration and duration of exposure to the EDC, the species and life stage of the individual, and environmental factors such as season, temperature, salinity, and the presence of other contaminants (Figure 7.1). Although potential EDCs are not usually released into the environment intentionally, most chemicals eventually end up in aquatic systems and waterways, which have been called the “ultimate sink” for environmental pollutants. Fishes are particularly susceptible to exposure to pollutants because they are continually exposed to the aquatic medium and can take up the chemicals through absorption or ingestion. In addition, many EDCs readily bioaccumulate in the fishes’ fat stores, and can also bio-magnify up the food chain, and in this way cause appreciable body burdens of EDCs from relatively low environmental concentrations. Fishes are ideally suited to studies of EDC exposure because they have a demonstrated sensitivity to EDCs. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,NA,NA,endocrine disruption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the effect of the dietary intake of 5 μg EE2/g food on different processes of testicular physiology, ranging from steroidogenesis to pathogen recognition, at both pre-spermatogenesis (pre-SG) and spermatogenesis (SG) reproductive stages, of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.), a marine hermaphrodite teleost. A differential effect between pre-SG and SG specimens was detected in the sex steroid serum levels and in the expression profile of some steroidogenic-relevant molecules, vitellogenin, double sex- and mab3-related transcription factor 1 and some hormone receptors. Interestingly, EE2 modified the expression pattern of some immune molecules involved in testicular physiology. These differences probably reflect a developmental adjustment of the sensitivity to EE2 in the gilthead seabream gonad. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI.",,10.3390/md11124973,Gene Expression;Military Personnel;Cytokines;Gonads,24335523,NA,the effect of 17αethynylestradiol on steroidogenesis and gonadal cytokine gene expression is related to the reproductive stage in marine hermaphrodite fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared fitness-related behavioral traits, breeding activity, and the effects of exposure to the environmental estrogen ethinylestradiol (EE 2) on reproduction in a laboratory (Wild Indian Karyotype, WIK) strain and a wild-caught population (Bangladesh, BLD01) of Danio rerio (zebrafish). In WIK fish, males with higher observed heterozygocity were more active reproductively and more successful in securing parentage, but these relationships were not apparent in the BLD01 fish. The frequency of reproductive behaviors increased in WIK zebrafish for exposure to 0.4 ng/L EE2, which was not apparent in the BLD01 zebrafish. The different strains showed the same threshold for hepatic vitellogenin gene (vtg) induction (2.2 ng EE 2/L), but results suggested an elevated response level in the BLD01. There were no effects on total egg production up to 2.2 ng EE2/L in either population; however, there was reduced egg fertilization rate at 2.2 ng EE2/L in the BLD01 fish. These results show consistency in the general responses to EE2 between these two genetically divergent strains of zebrafish, but also illustrate differences in their breeding biology and response sensitivities. These findings highlight the need for due consideration of the source (and genetics) of populations used in ecological risk assessment for accurate comparisons among studies. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/es302416w,Breeding,23034054,NA,comparative breeding and behavioral responses to ethinylestradiol exposure in wild and laboratory maintained zebrafish danio rerio populations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The histopathology of internal tissues of white sucker was compared to contaminant levels in fish tissue and bed sediment. Gut contents were examined to determine preferential prey and thus potential pathways for the bioaccumulation of chemicals from bed sediments. Male and female fish were tested separately. Lesions and other necroses were observed in all fish collected during both years of sample collection, indicating that fish in Rock Creek have experienced some form of environmental stress. No direct cause and effect was determined for chemical exposure and compromised fish health, but a substantial weight of evidence indicates that white sucker, which are bottom-eeding fish and low-order consumers in Rock Creek, are experiencing some reduction in vitality, possibly due to immunosuppression.

Our study aimed to investigate knowledge and behaviors of farmers related to pesticide use and their relation to educational level and health locus of control. Health locus of control is the degree to which individuals believe that their health is controlled by internal or external factors. Methods A cross-sectional randomized approach was used to collect data from 335 farmers in Mahmoudiya region, Egypt using an interview questionnaire. Results were analyzed using Pearson Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Student t -test and ANOVA. Results The average age of farmers was 34 years and 61% of them didn't receive school education. School education was related to higher levels of knowledge and behaviors. Farmers who received school education had more knowledge about the negative effects of pesticides on health and routes of contamination with pesticides. They also had higher scores on reading labels of pesticides containers and taking precautions after coming in contact with pesticides. Regarding health locus of control, higher internal beliefs were significantly related to higher knowledge and behaviors scores, while there was no significant relation between chance and powerful others beliefs with knowledge or behaviors. Conclusion In the present study, higher level of education and lower level of internal beliefs were related to better knowledge and safer use of pesticides among Egyptian farmers. We recommend that strategies for raising internal beliefs must be included in health education programs that aim to ameliorate pesticides use among farmers.",,,Pesticide use;Knowledge;Behavior;Health locus of control;Egypt;Internal-External Control;Pesticides;Health Education;Health Educators;Cesarean Section,NA,NA,effect of education and health locus of control on safe use of pesticides a cross sectional random study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Larger farms and higher densities of fish usually rely on the use of pharmaceuticals to avoid disease outbreaks with associated economic losses for the producers. It is therefore of vital importance to understand the behavior of such compounds in aquaculture matrices and if residues are present upon consumption. For this reason several works on antibiotic accumulation are described in the present work. The first chapter provides a contemporary review on integrated multitrophic aquaculture systems (IMTAs), with focus on food safety issues that could be associated with it. The principle behind IMTAs is that several species from different trophic levels are co-cultured in proximity with each other, and the wastes from one species are food for others (extractive species). However, as filter organisms capable of filtering high amounts of nutrients from the surrounding waters, these extractive species will also accumulate chemicals that are used in these systems, mostly used to treat the main species of the system (usually finfish). An overview on the types of aquaculture and types of organisms used in IMTAs can be found in the review, as well as on pesticides, antiparasitics, antifoulings, persistent organic pollutants, metals, and antibiotics that can be present in such systems and food matrices. Chapter II and III focused on the retention of several antibiotics by the two main species produced in aquaculture in the Mediterranean region: Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Based on their use in aquaculture, five antibiotics (sulfadiazine (SDZ), trimethoprim (TRI), flumequine (FLU), oxolinic acid (OXO), and oxytetracycline (OTC)) were incorporated into ...",,,accumulation;antibiotics;aquaculture;contamination;European seabass;food safety;Gilthead seabream;IMTAs;pharmaceuticals;residues;seaweed;sustainability;Ulva;withdrawal times;acumulação;antibióticos;aquacultura;contaminação;dourada;fármacos;macroalga;resíduos;robalo;segurança alimentar;sustentabilidade;tempos de retirada;Domínio/Área Científica::Ciências Naturais::Ciências Biológicas,NA,NA,accumulation of pharmaceuticals in aquaculture matrices from fish to algae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

En este contexto, la aplicación de tecnologías avanzadas como los procesos de tratamiento de agua mediante ozonación ha surgido como un enfoque prometedor para abordar la eliminación de compuestos orgánicos recalcitrantes, especialmente PhACs y salvaguardar la calidad de nuestro fuentes de agua. La ozonación se destaca como una tecnología versátil y poderosa capaz de atacar directa y selectivamente compuestos orgánicos, especialmente bajo condiciones de pH ácido. Simultáneamente, bajo condiciones de pH alcalino, el ozono puede sufrir descomposición a través de un mecanismo de reacción en cadena y generar radicales hidroxilo (HO•) altamente reactivos y menos selectivos. A pesar de su alta efectividad como técnica de tratamiento de agua, la ozonación convencional enfrenta dos desventajas principales: la mineralización incompleta y, en consecuencia, acumulación de subproductos de reacción desconocidos, así como limitaciones en la transferencia de masa gas-líquido. Este trabajo de tesis de doctorado se enfoca en contribuir al conocimiento existente sobre los diferentes procesos avanzados de oxidación (AOPs) basados en ozono como estrategias para mejorar o intensificar el rendimiento químico del proceso de ozonación para la eliminación de PhACs. Además, tiene como objetivo ampliar el conocimiento sobre la evaluación del rendimiento de un contactor de membrana para la ...",,,540 - Química y ciencias afines;660 - Ingeniería química;600 - Tecnología (Ciencias aplicadas);Purificación de aguas residuales;Oxidación;Transformación de residuos;Ozono;Contaminantes de preocupación emergente;Tratamiento de aguas residuales;Ozone;Contaminants of emerging concern;Wastewater treatment,NA,NA,degradation of pharmaceuticals from municipal wastewater effluents by ozonebased advanced oxidation processes degradación de compuestos farmacéuticos presentes en efluentes de aguas residuales municipales mediante procesos de oxidación avanzadabasados en ozono,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rayyan-1227190254,Ecotoxicological bioassays as complementary tools for the risk assessment of contaminated soils,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,"Bori Dols, Jaume",http://hdl.handle.net/2117/109817,eng,Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya,,"Versió amb una secció encriptada, per drets de l'editor ; Environmental impacts associated to the unstoppable growth of human population are threatening ecosystems worldwide. Among them, soil ecosystems are becoming increasingly degraded due to their unsustainable use and management, which is leading to the loss of a key resource that is fundamental to life on the planet. As the interface between land, air and water, soil ecosystems perform many cultural, economic, environmental, and social functions that are worthy of protection. During the last decades, several legislative tools have been created with varying success aiming to ensure soil protection. Even so, soils are major sinks of anthropogenic pollutants and, in consequence, human-induced contamination still represents a serious threat for soil ecosystems due to the massive release of metals, hydrocarbons and pesticides (among others). In this context, the application of methodologies for the proper assessment and remediation of contaminated soils has become mandatory if their ability to perform their functions is to be preserved. The risks associated to soil contamination have been traditionally evaluated through chemical quantification of pollutants. Unfortunately, such techniques have proven insufficient to properly assess soil pollution because they can only focus on concentrations of specific contaminants and they obviate the interactions between pollutants, soil matrix and soil inhabiting organisms. Ecotoxicity bioassays, on the other hand, do integrate all these interactions and can become very valuable tools for a better and more realistic assessment of the effects of contaminants in soil ecosystems. In this work, chemical analysis together with terrestrial and aquatic ecotoxicity bioassays are applied to samples from contaminated sites and to artificially-contaminated soils in order to evaluate their associated ecological risks. The suitability of different ecotoxicity tests is assessed according to the nature of the soil contaminant, and the parameters responsible of the toxicity to organisms are analyzed. The selected bioassays include measurements on different endpoints (mortality, reduced growth, etc.), exposure times (acute or chronic), effective responses (lethal or sublethal), and organisms (earthworms, collembolans, plants, bacteria, algae, daphnids and fishes). This study proves that the application of ecotoxicity bioassays is not only useful but also desirable as a complementary tool for a reliable assessment of contaminated soils. In Chapter 1, the problem of soil contamination, the main soil pollutants and the available tools for soil risk assessment are briefly introduced. The hypothesis of this work and its main objectives are also presented. Finally, the methodology applied during the performance of this work is summarized. In Chapter 2, the environmental threats of soils surrounding and abandoned mercury mine in Valle del Azogue (Almería, Spain) are studied. Chapter 3 assesses the risks associated to an abandoned F-Ba-Pb-Zn mining area in Osor (Girona, Spain). Chapter 4 evaluates the ecological impacts of soils from the abandoned mercury mining district of Almadén (Ciudad Real, Spain). In Chapter 5, the remediation procedure of a hydrocarbon-contaminated soil is assessed through ecotoxicity tests and chemical analysis and their suitability as monitoring tools of hydrocarbon degradation is studied. In Chapter 6, the risks that field doses of the (until recently) massively-applied insecticide imidacloprid (commercial formulation Confidor®) pose for the terrestrial and aquatic compartments are studied. Chapter 7 presents an alternative procedure to test the behavioral response of collembolans Folsomia candida in avoidance tests. Chapter 8 includes the most relevant information and presents the main conclusions. ; Els impactes ambientals associats a l’imparable creixement de la població humana estan amenaçant els ecosistemes de tot el món. D’entre ells, els ecosistemes terrestres es veuen cada vegada més degradats degut a un ús i administració insostenibles, els quals estan conduint a la pèrdua d’un recurs fonamental per a la vida al planeta. Com a interfase entre la terra, l’aire i l’aigua, els ecosistemes terrestres realitzen multitud de funcions culturals, econòmiques, ambientals i socials que cal protegir. A tal efecte, durant les últimes dècades s’han creat diverses eines legislatives enfocades a assegurar la protecció dels sòls, les quals han tingut un èxit variable. No obstant això, els sòls són un dels principals destins dels contaminants antropogènics i, en conseqüència, la contaminació induïda per l'home encara representa una seriosa amenaça per als ecosistemes terrestres a causa de l'alliberament massiu de metalls, hidrocarburs i plaguicides (entre d'altres). En aquest context, l’aplicació de metodologies adequades per a l’avaluació i remediació de sòls contaminats ha esdevingut obligatòria si es vol preservar la seva capacitat per a desenvolupar les seves funcions. Tradicionalment els riscs associats a la contaminació del sòl han estat avaluats a través de quantificacions químiques de contaminants. Malauradament, aquestes tècniques han demostrat ser insuficients per a una adequada valoració de la contaminació del sòl ja que només poden centrar-se en les concentracions de contaminants específics i obvien les interaccions entre contaminants, la matriu del sòl i els organismes que l’habiten. D’altra banda, els bioassajos d’ecotoxicitat integren totes aquestes interaccions i poden esdevenir eines valuoses per a una avaluació millor i més realista dels efectes dels contaminants en els ecosistemes terrestres. En aquest treball s’han aplicat anàlisis químics conjuntament amb bioassajos d’ecotoxicitat terrestre i aquàtica a fi d’avaluar els riscs ecològics associats a mostres d’emplaçaments contaminats i a sòls contaminats artificialment. La idoneïtat dels diferents tests d’ecotoxicitat s’ha avaluat d’acord a la naturalesa del contaminant del sòl i s’han analitzat els paràmetres responsables de la toxicitat vers els organismes. Els bioassajos seleccionats inclouen mesures de diferents paràmetres (mortalitat, creixement reduït, etc.), temps d’exposició (aguda o crònica), respostes efectives (letal o subletal), i organismes (cucs de terra, col·lèmbols, plantes, bacteris, algues, dàfnids i peixos). Aquest estudi demostra que l’aplicació de bioassajos d’ecotoxicitat no només és útil sinó desitjable com a eina complementaria per a una avaluació fidedigna dels sòls contaminats. En el Capítol 1 s’introdueix breument la problemàtica de la contaminació del sòl, els seus principals contaminants i els mètodes disponibles per a l’avaluació del risc associats als sòls. També es presenten la hipòtesi d’aquest treball i els seus principals objectius. Finalment es resumeix la metodologia aplicada durant la realització d’aquesta tesi. En el Capítol 2 s’estudia l’amenaça ambiental que representen els sòls situats al voltant d’una mina de mercuri abandonada a la Vall del Azogue (Almeria, Espanya). Al Capítol 3 s’avaluen els riscs associats a una zona minera de F-Ba-Pb-Zn abandonada a l’àrea d’Osor (Girona, Espanya). Al Capítol 4 s’avaluen els impactes ecològics dels sòls del districte miner de mercuri abandonat a Almadén (Ciudad Real, Espanya). En el Capítol 5 s’avalua el procés de remediació d’un sòl contaminat amb hidrocarburs a través d’assajos d’ecotoxicitat i anàlisis químics i se n’estudia la seva idoneïtat com a eines de monitoratge de la degradació d’hidrocarburs. En el Capítol 6 s’estudien els riscs que representen per als ambients terrestres i aquàtics les dosis d’aplicació d’imidacloprid (formulació comercial Confidor®), un insecticida fins fa poc aplicat massivament. El Capítol 7 presenta un procediment alternatiu per a testejar la resposta conductual dels col·lèmbols Folsomia candida en assajos d’allunyament.

However, the indiscriminate and extensive use of these represents one of the main environmental and public health problems throughout the world. Once released into the environment, agrochemicals can contaminate rivers, the water table, air, soil and food. Thus, the analysis of environmental risks due to the inadequate use and handling of agrochemicals in crops and their management has become more relevant in recent years.

Histopathological studies, mutagenic, genotoxic and Poecilia reticulata (Guppy) were motivated by the scarcity of data in the literature concerning the effects of the formulation of the herbicide Roundup Transorb®. With everything, we sought to ascertain the effects produced by this formulation that is widely used in the Midwest of the country. This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity and mutagenic and genotoxic herbicide R. Transorb® in liver, gill and erythrocytes of the guppy, calculating and applying the LC50 test micronucleus (MN) and Comet assay (AC). The toxicity bioassays were performed to calculate the LC50;12-96h, to evaluate the effects of sublethal concentrations of herbicide subjected to acute treatment. We used 36 adult fish, weighing on average 0.496 g ± 0.28 g to calculate the LC50 and 75 adult fish also carry the MN and AC. During exposure to the herbicide was observed fish behavior at all concentrations and controlled chemical and physical changes of water. The erythrocytes were obtained by centrifugation of the gills being added to precipitate fetal calf serum, and then dripped on the slides to make the smear and electrophoresis. For the analysis of plates, 75.000 cells were counted and stipulate the frequency of occurrence of Nuclear Morphological Changes (AMNs) and AC were analyzed for 100 cells per specimen. The LC50; 12, 24, 48, 72 e 96h of R. Transorb® were 11:24, 8:55, 6.5, 6.10 and 5.65μl/L, respectively, indicating that this species is very sensitive to the herbicide studied in relation to other tropical species analyzed. These factors may be related to different formulations of herbicides and their respective surfactants. It was found that the mortality rate of fish poisoned by the herbicide increased as exposure concentrations increased. The values of LC50,12-96h show a downward trend over time, suggesting that during periods of reduced exposure will require greater amounts of herbicide to cause mortality of 50% of the population of animals. Animals exposed to the herbicide showed behavioral changes varied, such as aggressiveness, irritability, loss of the escape reflex, darkening of the body surface and banging against the wall of the aquarium. In addition, R. Transorb® hitológicas induced liver changes appreciably impairing the normal functioning of this organ. In MN and EC was possible to detect significant genotoxic and mutagenic effects in erythrocytes and gill cells, occurring gradual increase in the number of cells with AMNs and ADN damage under higher concentrations,indicating concentration-dependent effect. This herbicide has acute toxicity to guppy, promoting behavioral changes, possibly acting in a manner damaging to the liver but also in the nervous system and gill. These results also suggest that the formulation of this herbicide has genotoxic and mutagenic in erythrocytes and gill cells detected by the MN and AC. Therefore, it confirms the high risk of herbicide to the environment, its contamination may present a strong threat to populations of fish and other organisms both vertebrates and invertebrates and human health. ; Os efeitos de substâncias tóxicas, mutagênicas e genotóxica sobre órgãos-alvos e o genoma de peixes tem sido objeto de muitos estudos, sobretudo daqueles que buscam estabelecer respostas destes órgãos e dos genes aos estímulos ambientais. Estudos histopatológicos, mutagênicos, genotóxicos e em Poecilia reticulata (Guppy) foram motivados pela escassez de dados na literatura referente aos efeitos provocados pela formulação do herbicida Roundup Transorb®. Com tudo, pretendeu-se conhecer os efeitos produzidos por essa formulação que é bastante utilizada no Centro-Oeste do país. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar a ação tóxica, mutagênica e genotóxica do herbicida R. Transorb® em fígado, brânquia e eritrócito do guppy, calculando a CL50 e aplicando Teste de Micronúcleo (MN) e Ensaio Cometa (EC). Os bioensaios de toxicidade foram realizados para calcular a CL50,12-96h, avaliar os efeitos das concentrações subletais do herbicida submetido a tratamento agudo. Utilizou-se 36 peixes adultos, pesando em média 0,496g ± 0,28g para cálculo da CL50 e 75 peixes também adultos para realizar o MN e EC. Durante a exposição ao herbicida observou-se o comportamento dos peixes em todas as concentrações e controlada as variações químicas e físicas da água. Os eritrócitos foram obtidos pela centrifugação das brânquias sendo adicionado soro fetal bovino ao precipitado, e posteriormente gotejado sobre as lâminas para realizar o esfregaço e eletroforese. Para a análise das lâminas, foram contadas 75.000 células e estipulada a frequência de ocorrência de Alterações Morfológicas Nucleares (AMNs), e para EC foram analisadas 100 células por espécime. A CL50; 12, 24, 48, 72 e 96 h do R. Transorb® foram de 11.24; 8.55; 6.5; 6.10 e 5.65μl/L, respectivamente, indicando que esta espécie é bastante sensível ao herbicida estudado em relação às demais espécies tropicais analisadas. Esses fatores podem estar relacionados às diferentes formulações dos herbicidas e seus respectivos surfactantes. Verificou-se que a porcentagem de mortalidade dos peixes intoxicados pelo herbicida aumentou à medida que as concentrações de exposição aumentaram. Os valores da CL50; 12- 96 h apresentam tendência de queda ao longo do tempo, sugerindo que em períodos de menor exposição serão necessárias quantidades maiores de herbicida para causar a mortalidade de 50% da população de animais. Os animais expostos ao herbicida apresentaram alterações comportamentais variadas, tais como: agressividade; irritabilidade; perda do reflexo de fuga; escurecimento da superfície corporal e choque contra a parede do aquário. Além disso, o R. Transorb® induziu alterações hitológicas hepáticas prejudicando de forma sensível o funcionamento normal deste órgão. No MN e EC foi possível detectar efeitos mutagênicos e genotóxicos significativos nos eritrócitos e células da brânquia, ocorrendo aumento gradual no número de células com AMNs e com danos ao DNA de acordo com aumento das concentrações, indicando efeito concentração-dependente. Este herbicida apresenta toxidade aguda para guppy, promovendo alterações comportamentais, agindo possivelmente de forma danosa não só no fígado, mas também no sistema nervoso e branquial. Tais resultados sugerem também que a formulação deste herbicida possui ação genotóxica e mutagênica em eritrócitos e células branquiais detectados através dos MN e EC. Por tanto, se confirma o alto risco deste herbicida ao meio ambiente, sua contaminação pode apresentar forte ameaça para as populações de peixes e outros organismos tanto vertebrados como invertebrados e saúde do homem.",,,Poecilia reticulata;Herbicida;Glifosato;Ensaio cometa;Teste micronúcleo;Pesticides;Glyphosate;Comet assay;Micronucleos test;CNPQ::CIENCIAS BIOLOGICAS,NA,NA,efeitos tóxicos e genotóxicos do herbicida roundup transorb® em guppy poecilia reticulata submetido a tratamento agudo toxic effects and genotoxicity of roundup transorb® in guppypoecilia reticulata submitted to acute treatment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physical, chemical and microbiological parameters (turbidity, temperature, pH, Phosphorus, Total Solids, Filterable Solids, Total Coliforms, E. Coli, COD, conductivity, nitrate, DO, BOD) were analyzed to assess the changes of these characteristics during sampling. There were two sampling campaigns in one rainy season and another in the dry season. Samples were collected at six points in the watercourse Meia Ponte, within the boundaries of the Goiânia. The samples were analyzed by UHPLC at LBGQA (UFScar).The compounds analysed were caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, carbamazepine, atenolol, propranolol, triclosan, estrone, 17-β-estradiol, 17αethinylestradiol. The physical, chemical and microbiological and Water-Quality Index -WQI indicated that the same river at the point where this capture held in poor condition with evidence of contamination by sewage. Nine Of the eleven emerging pollutants studied were detected at concentrations between 0.61- ng. L-1 22 ng. L-1. The highest concentrations were found in point 3, after the release of STP(Sewage Treatment Plant) Hélio Seixo de Brito in the dry season and the lowest in point 1 where it is held to capture WTP (Water Treatment Plant) Eng Rodolfo José da Costa e Silva, in the rainy season.

L -1) was detected in the points after the STP Hélio Seixo Brito in the dry season. The load calculation in this study showed that the behavior of the load did not follow the concentration at all times for all compounds. Some compounds had greater input in the rainy season even when its highest concentration was found in the dry season and others maintained high loads independent of the flow. A PCA was calculated correlating emerging pollutants detected and physical parameters, chemical and microbiological. And was identified a correlation between collection points and also between the variables. ; Diversos estudos indicam a presença de poluentes emergentes em água superficial essas substâncias não contempladas pela legislação são provenientes de lançamentos de efluentes com pouco ou nenhum tratamento.

Foram realizadas duas campanhas amostrais uma no período chuvoso e outro no período de estiagem. As amostras foram coletadas em seis pontos no curso d’água Meia Ponte, dentro do perímetro do município de Goiânia. As amostras foram analisadas por meio do UHPLC do LBGqA da UFScar e os compostos cafeína, ibuprofeno, naproxeno, diclofenaco, carbamazepina, atenolol, propanolol, triclosan, estrona, 17-β-estradiol, 17α-etinilestradiol foram analisados. Os parâmetros físicos, químicos e microbiológico e o Índice de Qualidade Água- IQA indicaram que o rio mesmo no ponto onde realizada captação esta numa condição ruim com indícios de contaminação por esgoto. Dos onze poluentes emergentes estudados nove foram detectados com concentrações entre 0,61 ng. L-1 a 22µg.l-1.

However, TCF is a pesticide with moderate toxicity in vertebrates and, therefore, its application can be an intensifier of damage on the physiological and biochemical responses in fish already facing problems in environmental quality such as the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2). Thus, in this study, an investigation approach was adopted considering the effects of TCF on the health of fish isolated or associated with high [CO2] in the water. Two experiments were developed to investigate such effects: Experiment 1: Nile tilapia exposure to TCF for 96 h was investigated. In this study, we registered behavioral, metabolic and hormonal changes that modified the response patterns of the immune and enzymatic defense systems in the muscle and liver tissues. There was an increase in plasma cortisol and glucose combined with a reduction in acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle and liver tissue after 96 h of exposure to TCF, indicating chemical stress. In response to this harmful situation, we observed changes in the immune system that lead to an increase in the number of leukocytes, thrombocytes, monocyte respiratory activity, lysozyme and leukocytes. In addition, we associate the increased activity of GST in liver tissue as a strategy used by fish to combat the effects of TCF. Therefore, we conclude that the TCF affects the physiological parameters of Nile tilapia, which can generate irreversible effects of recovery of the clinical condition. In experiment 2: Nile tilapia exposure to TCF alone or associated with discharge [CO2] for 48 h was investigated. In this study, we found that the association of experimental conditions intensified the damage to the blood tissue of fish. The reduction in the number of RBC and Ht (%) reveals a deficiency in the transport of O2, offset by the increase in Hb. The reduction in leukocytes and thrombotics indicates less immunological resistance to fight pathogenic ...",,,Aquicultura;CO2 da água;Pesticida;Toxicologia;Biomarcadores de efeito;Aquaculture;CO2 from water;Pesticide;Toxicology;Effect biomarkers;CIENCIAS BIOLOGICAS::FISIOLOGIA;Trichlorfon,NA,NA,exposição da tilápia do nilo oreochromis niloticus ao triclorfon e a hipercarbia isolados ou associados exposure of nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus to trichlorfon and hypercarbia isolated or associated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite having the genome completely sequenced and the behavior and physiology well reported, there are some issues related to the housing and management of these animals that are still poorly understood. Considering the issues regarding the housing of the zebrafish, we aimed to investigate whether different cues, used alone or together, would interfere in zebrafish behavior. In this study, we detected that the animals have different behaviors when in the presence of isolated cues and together, therefore, we emphasize the importance of the description and detailing of the conditions of housing of these fish. After the development of this first article, we had the idea of working with imidacloprid (IMI). IMI is an insecticidal pesticide used globally in the treatment of seeds and leaves of crops such as vegetables, sugar beet, cotton and tobacco. The use of IMI is mainly due to its high insecticidal potential and low toxic potential in mammals, acting as a specific nicotinic acetylcholine agonist for invertebrate receptors. However, non-target species have been affected by this compound, which can cause from the mortality of these animals to endocrine and physiological changes in sublethal concentrations, mostly based on the LC50/LD50 (concentration/dose capable of killing 50% of the population tested), in chronic or acute exposures, within 96 hours. However, little is known about the effect that concentrations already detected in the environment and in periods shorter than 96 hours can have on non-target organisms. Therefore, our aim was to analyze whether an IBI (imidacloprid-based insecticide) alters behavior, cortisol levels and redox status in zebrafish, in a 30-minute exposure protocol and at environmentally relevant concentrations.

There is growing evidence that changes to water conditions due to global change and waterborne pollution can impair coral-reef fish sensory abilities to locate settlement habitats that maximize growth while minimizing mortality risk. However, the inner mechanisms of such impairments remain unknown. In this thesis, I have examined the recruitment phase of the convict surgeonfish Acanthurus triostegus, and determined that the ecological, morphological, physiological and behavioral changes occurring at recruitment correspond to a metamorphosis mediated by thyroid hormones (TH). Then, I investigated whether this metamorphosis is prone to endocrine disruption under anthropogenic disturbances such as elevated sea water temperature and agricultural pesticide pollution. I demonstrated that such pressures can reduce TH levels at a critical developmental stage in coral-reef fishes, impairing their metamorphic processes such as intestine remodeling, sensory organ maturation, and sensory abilities acquisition, further increasing their mortality rates. Overall, this thesis is a holistic analysis that addresses molecular, histological, anatomical, and behavioral assays of multiple stressors affecting coral-reef fish recruitment. It indicates the importance of a proper endocrine function during coral-reef fish recruitment, highlighting the need for a better understanding of these processes for coral-reef conservation. ; Le maintien et le renouvellement des populations de poissons coralliens dépendent en grande partie du recrutement larvaire, c’est-à-dire de l’installation des larves pélagiques dans les habitats récifaux adultes, et de leur survie après s’être métamorphosées en juvéniles.

Another family of flame retardants, also classified as POPs, polybrominated diphenil ethers (PBDEs), was also studied and quantified using already optimized and validated methods. The presence of target POPs in environmentally protected areas of the Iberian Peninsula has been evaluated using seagull eggs as bioindicators. Two species, namely yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) and Audouin´s gull (Larus Audouinii), have been selected for this purpose. The former is an abundant and widely distributed species with scavenging and opportunistic behavior, while the later is more vulnerable, even though the population is growing during recent years and new colonies are emerging, and showed a strict fish-based diet. Pollution levels detected in gull eggs were dominated by PCBs, followed by various OCPs. Among OCPs, high levels of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) were found, which is a metabolic and degradation product of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a pesticide widely used during the last decades of the 20th century, which showed high toxicity for birds, being able to reduce the reproduction success because it may affect the eggshell thickness and prevent hatching when present at high enough levels. PBDEs were also widespread in the marine environments of the Iberian Peninsula but at lower levels. Audouin´s gull eggs showed higher pollution levels than yellow-legged gulls from the same colonies, suggesting differences in their feeding habits and their bioaccumulation capacity of POPs.

Temperature rising affect the toxic properties of pollutants and the sensitiveness of organisms to chemicals stress. Inversely, chemical exposure may decrease the thermal tolerance of ectothermic species, as fish. In this context, we studied the response of a biological model in aquatic toxicology, the goldfish (Carassius auratus), to individual and combined chemical and thermal stresses. In this aim, we exposed the goldfish to environmental relevant concentrations of herbicide and fungicide mixtures at two temperatures for 96 hours or 16 days. The fish responses were assessed from the molecular level to individual endpoints, including omic approaches (proteomic and metabolomic), biochemical analyses (cortisol, antioxidant defenses, cellular energy allocation), indexes (somatic and condition factors) and behavioral assays (sediment reworking, activity, exploration and feeding). Our results showed that individual chemical or thermal stresses induced a general stress response including biochemical, metabolic, physiological and behavioral compensations. The absence of deleterious effect on the global condition of fish suggested the implementation of an efficient and adaptive stress response, while the hypoactivity of fish exposed to pesticide mixtures could entrain a decreased performance and fitness into the wild. At the opposite, the combined chemical and thermal stresses induced reciprocal inactivation of the stress response, with antagonism effect on cortisol secretion, antioxidant defense induction and metabolic compensation. However, increased effect on behavioral traits and decreased global condition of fish were observed. Our study showed that temperature rising sensitized fish to pesticide exposure.

For practicality it is important that as many pesticides as possible are compared using a common technique. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for multi-residue detection techniques, because of its sensitivity and specificity. This thesis comprises a detailed analysis and critical review of the mass spectrometric behaviour of over 600 commonly encountered pesticides and related compounds. The work described in this thesis was undertaken in two tranches, one old and one new. The former experimental work was performed during the author’s employment at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food (Harpenden, Hertfordshire, UK) and at Unilever Research (Colworth House, Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, UK). The data helped underpin the analytical work of the UK national pesticide residues monitoring surveillance team and the pesticide formulations safety team. Qualitative and quantitative aspects were both important, e.g. for identification and characterisation of active ingredients, contaminants and degradation products in technical pesticide formulations, as well as unambiguous detection and/or confirmation of residue levels in UK fruit and vegetables. The latter experimental work was undertaken recently (2015) at the Cardiff School of Chemistry during the preparation of this thesis. The newly acquired data helped confirm the validity and robustness of the original data, and helped to better understand them. Understanding the complex and sometimes unexpected behaviour of molecules during their extraction/analysis is essential, especially when performing trace analysis at the parts per billion level.

One of the main interests in the study of these models is to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively the impact of interactions between different populations with their habitat or between them, such as: atoms or molecules, neurons, bacteria, plants, animals and even pests or infected individuals for example. Mathematical models describe the growth of these populations for the purpose of making predictions, contribuing in the decision making if there is need for the application of control in these biological systems. In this work, we defend the use of biological control, which consists in regulating population growth through human intervention or natural enemies, being very efficient in pest control and at the same time reducing the use of pesticides, becoming less invasive to nature. The aim of this work is to study two population reaction-diffusion models: the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation for a species, and the modified Lokta-Volterra system with diffusion for two species, both in one dimension, with and without control. These models describe the dispersion of individuals in which the population growth occurs in the form of a wavefront, advancing at a constant velocity to the empty regions until reaching the supporting capacity of the medium, thus, admitting a traveling wave type solution, which allows a qualitative analysis of the solution through the theory of stability and the finding of approximate solutions. From the study carried out on both models without the influence of regulators, the theory of linear optimal control is applied considering biological systems that need the introduction of control strategies to achieve the wanted balance or stabilize below economic and/or biological damages.

To evaluate the effect of leachate under laboratory exposure, we used 32 individuals of the species C. macropomum distributed in groups of 8 specimens exposed to individual tanks with a capacity of 6 liters, containing water slurry in three different dilutions (1:100, 1:1000 and 1:10,000) for a period of 96 hours of exposure. Another group of eight specimens were exposed only to well water, considered as the control group. The environmental impact assessment of the presence of toxic dumps in Lake Macurany was performed in situ by exposure of specimens of C. macropomum, in cages with a volume of 9L in two different exposure times, 24 and 48. Under the experimental conditions used were 30 individuals in group 3 specimens exposed at a point downstream of the trash, and another group of 30 subjects ...",,,Chorume;Biomarcadores;Colossoma Macropomum;Parintins;Biotecnologia,NA,NA,biomarcadores de efeito do chorume da lixeira pública de parintinsam em tambaqui colossoma macropomum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Para ello, se llevaron a cabo ensayos de depredación combinando tratamientos con depredador y presas expuestos y no expuestos a plaguicidas, sobre los cuales se evaluaron y contrastaron las respuestas etológicas y metabólicas. Los resultados demostraron que el tratamiento donde depredador y presas no fueron expuestos a plaguicidas presentó las mayores tasas de depredación, mientras que el tratamiento donde depredador y presas fueron simultáneamente expuestos a los plaguicidas presentó las menores tasas de depredación. Los renacuajos expuestos a F, Gly y TFS redujeron la actividad natatoria y la respiración, y además, alteraron los niveles normales de actividad de la AChE y la BChE, al igual que S. marmoratus.

To that effect, predation tests, mixing treatments with both, predator and prey being exposed and not exposed to pesticides, were carried out and their ethological and metabolic responses were evaluated and contrasted. Results showed that the treatment where predator and prey were not exposed to pesticides presented higher predation rates, whereas the treatment where predator and prey were simultaneously exposed to pesticides showed the lowest predation rates. Tadpoles exposed to F, Gly and TFS reduced their swimming activity as well as their breathing, and also, modified the normal levels of AChE and BChE activity, same as S. marmoratus did. As a conclusion, this study demonstrated that pesticides F, Gly and TFS altered the interaction between predator and prey among S. marmoratus and amphibian larvae, interfering in ethological responses from prey and metabolic ones from both, prey and predator. ; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas ; Universidad Nacional del Litoral",,,Interacción depredador-presa;Plaguicidas;Enzimas;Comportamiento;Renacuajos;Anguilas;Predator-prey interaction;Pesticides;Enzymes;Behavior;Tadpoles;Eels;Argentina;Prednisolone,NA,NA,respuestas a plaguicidas y su relación con las interacciones depredadorpresa en anfibios amphibia anura de agroecosistemas del litoral mesopotámico de argentina replies to pesticides and their relationship with predatorprey interactions in amphibians amphibia anura mesopotamian coastal agroecosystem of argentina,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Salmonid populations in the Bay-Delta have been declining, including the endangered Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Previous studies suggest that estrogenic compounds can inhibit smoltification, and the pyrethroid pesticide bifenthrin has been shown to have estrogenic effects. Thus, the objective of my research was to investigate the effects of bifenthrin and climate change stressors on the neuroendocrine response of juvenile salmonids. Trout alevin and fry were exposed to 110C, 16.40C and 190C temperatures and then immediately challenged to sea water (SW) for 24 hours. Trout parr were slowly acclimated to SW and simultaneously exposed to the same temperature regime. Estradiol-17β, cortisol, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine hormone levels were measured in blood serum or whole animal homogenates using ELISAs. Brain growth hormone 1, brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2, and gill Na+/K+ ATPase mRNA levels were measured using qPCR. Alevin were more sensitive to salinity than temperature, and fry were more susceptible to increasing temperatures, thus demonstrating stage-dependent responses to climate change stressors. To evaluate the combined effects of bifenthrin and temperature, Chinook alevin, fry, and parr were exposed to the same temperature stressors for 10 days (alevin) or 14 days (fry and parr) and, in the final 96 hours of rearing, fish were exposed to 0, 0.15, or 1.5µg/L bifenthrin. The same endpoints were measured as in the trout, with the addition of quantifying testosterone levels, the expression of brain dopamine receptor 2α, and measuring brain dopamine levels. In addition, a predator avoidance Y-Maze behavioral assay was conducted on parr. Bifenthrin significantly impacted olfactory-mediated predator avoidance behaviors in parr.

These salamanders can be used for both field- and lab-based work as they are human-tolerant (Arenas et al. 2015). Some of the biological fields using RBS as a model organism include terrestrial ecology, amphibian ecology, evolutionary biology, regeneration, ecotoxicology, and animal behavior (Fisher-Reid et al. 2021). These salamanders are ecologically influential in forest ecosystems, where their biomass in some locations exceeds that of birds during peak breeding season and may be equal to that of all small mammals combined (Burton & Likens 1975). Of the eight most studied salamanders RBS is the only Plethodontid salamander; RBS is an important inclusion considering that more than half of all salamander species are part of the family Plethodontidae and many of the species are declining (Fisher-Reid et al. 2021). Because RBS are highly philopatric and abundant, studies of its population genetics have been used to ask biogeographic questions at a variety of spatial and temporal scale (Fisher-Reid et al. 2013, Cameron et al. 2017). In ecotoxicology, RBS have been used to study how military waste products and pesticides enter and affect terrestrial food webs (Johnson et al. 2004, 2007, 2010; Bazar et al. 2008, 2009, 2010). In animal behavior, RBS has been used to describe changes in territorial behavior based on food availability (Jaeger et al. 2016). Considering that amphibians are the most threatened vertebrate class due anthropogenic changes to their habitat, it is important that more amphibian model organisms are included in research so that we may understand them better with the aim to conserve them. This master’s research and thesis focuses on two ways in which we can use RBS as a model organism.

This is compounded by regional differences in temperature, wind patterns, underwater topography, and primary productivity that extend from the ocean’s surface to depths of thousands of meters. Many organisms that inhabit the marine environment navigate many environmental changes as they move between regions in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The ability to navigate through different habitat types indicates that marine animals may be adaptable to multiple environments; however, it also suggests that they may be exposed to multiple hazards, including hazards of anthropogenic origin. Rates of anthropogenic inputs of chemicals and litter to the atmosphere and the ocean are increasing. However, many effects of anthropogenic compounds on marine life are only beginning to be understood. In this dissertation, I assessed foraging ecology, contaminants, and the effects of contaminants, in seabirds, which are unique among marine animals because they hunt for fishes and squid from the air, but breed on land. Land-based breeding enables them to be easily studied, and they are good samplers of the vast ocean because they travel tens to thousands of kilometers from the breeding colony to forage. I first tested the hypothesis that seabirds’ foraging behaviors are related to local oceanographic habitats, and that they exhibit behavioral plasticity to exploit the marine environment. GPS-tracking and remotely-sensed environmental data of four species of boobies (Sula spp.) demonstrated adaptable behaviors that changed depending on the type of oceanographic habitat in which boobies foraged (e.g. based on depth, sea surface temperature and topography). Second, I measured blood-based persistent organic pollutants (POP) and mercury contaminant concentrations in boobies and two species of frigatebirds (Fregata spp.) from four colonies in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. I combined blood-based contaminant measurements with two measures of foraging ecology ...",,,Ecology;Biology;Environmental science;Gulf of California;Hawaii;marine ecology;ornithology;Pacific Ocean;pesticide,NA,NA,the foraging ecology of seabirds in relation to contaminant exposure and oceanographic habitat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The general objective was to understand the effects of the pesticide on the early life stages of the fish, and to evaluate the suitability of these stages as indicators of contaminated environments. Egg, yolk-sac and larval stages that had been exposed to 300, 120, 90, 60, 30, 10, 5, and 0 g/L of Lindane at 25°C exhibited a 14d-LC of 44 g/L. Similarly, the same stages exposed to 300, 120, 90, 60, 30, 10, and 0 g/L of Lindane at 18°C exhibited a 14d-LC of 37 g/L. Lower temperature thus seemed to increase the susceptibility of the fish to the pesticide. Mortality data were also used to determine the sensitivity of the early developmental stages of fish to the pesticide. At 25°C, the larval stage was the most sensitive stage. At 18°C, on the other hand, the most sensitive stage was the yolk-sac. Results obtained from experiments in which Lindane doses were applied at different intervals within the 14d-period supported these observations. Low temperatures had a marked effect on the sensitivity of the fathead minnow to Lindane. Embryos exposed to Lindane at 18°C showed different temporal distribution of mortality than those at 25°C. A delay in hatching and emergence of smaller larvae were also noted at 18°C. Lordoscoliosis, edemas and hemorrhages were the most common morphological changes induced by the pesticide during the larval stage. The frequency of these abnormalities was linearly related to doses of Lindane. Impaired swimming behavior was also noted, but it was not related to dosages. ; Master of Science",,,LD5655.V855 1990.T387;Fathead minnow;Effect of pesticides on;Hexachlorobenzene;Toxicology;Pesticides;Lindane,NA,NA,the toxic effects of the pesticide lindane on the early developmental stages of the fathead minnow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study aims to investigate the acute effects of MBA to juvenile red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. Firstly, a 96 h semi-static exposure was conducted to determine the Lethal Concentration 50 (LC50) values at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, as well as to assess the behavioral and morphological effects. A second 96 h exposure was conducted at an MBA concentration of 50% of the 96 h LC50 (72.62 mg/L) to assess the histological changes in the gill, perigastric organ, muscle, heart, stomach, and midgut. The results showed that MBA exhibited low acute toxicity with the 24, 48, 72 and 96 h LC50 values of 191.25 (179.37-215.75), 166.81 (159.49-176.55), 154.30 (148.36-160.59) and 145.24 (138.94-151.27) mg/L, respectively.

Linuron is a phenylurea herbicide used to control a wide variety of vegetative weeds in agriculture in addition to residential applications. However, there are few studies that quantify its toxicity to early developmental stages of fish. The objectives of this study were to assess the acute toxicity of linuron to zebrafish embryos/larvae by measuring mortality, morphological deformities, oxidative respiration, gene expression, and locomotor activity via the Visual Motor Response test. Zebrafish embryos at similar to 6-h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either embryo rearing medium (ERM), or one dose of 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mu M linuron for up to 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) depending on the assay. Zebrafish larvae exposed to linuron displayed pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, and spinal curvature. Oxidative respiration assessments in embryos using the Agilent XF(e)24 Flux Analyzer revealed that linuron decreased mean basal respiration and oligomycin-induced ATP-linked respiration in 30 hpf embryos at 20 mu M after a 24-hour exposure. In 7 dpf larvae, transcript abundance was determined for 6 transcripts that have a role in oxidative respiration (atp06, cox1, cox4-1, cox5a1, cytb, and nd1); the relative abundance of these transcripts was not altered with linuron treatment. A Visual Motor Response test was conducted on 7 dpf larvae to determine whether linuron (0.625 to 5 mu M) impaired locomotor activity. Larval activity in the dark period decreased in a dose dependent manner and there were indications of hypoactivity as low as 1.25 mu M. Transcript abundance was thus determined for tyrosine hydroxylase (th1) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (gad1b), two rate limiting enzymes that control the production of dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid respectively. The mRNA levels of gad1b = 0.019) were reduced with increasing concentrations of linuron while th1 (p = 0.056) showed a similar decreasing trend, suggesting that neurotransmitter biosynthesis may be altered with exposure to linuron. This study improves knowledge related to the toxicity mechanisms for linuron and is the first to demonstrate that this anti-androgenic chemical impairs oxidative respiration and exerts neurotoxic effects associated with neurotransmitter biosynthesis during early development.

Synthetic pyrethroids have been shown to enter the aquatic environment from agricultural runoff or drift from aerial and ground-based spraying applications posing threat to fishes which are less tolerant to pesticides through direct exposure. These insecticides interfere with the sodium channel of the nervous system resulting in prolonged sodium tail current. Widespread application of these chemicals has warranted the attention of the ecologist to understand the impact of these chemicals on the aquatic environment. In this perspective, an updated account of toxicological evaluation of three type II synthetic pyrethroids, viz. deltamethrin, cypermethrin and fenvalerate in terms of their physico-chemical, metabolic, hematological, histological, behavioral and reproductive aspects with respect to the fishes has been presented which may be useful for policy makers, academics, environmental scientists and agricultural professionals needing ready access to this information. The aim of the present synoptic literature appraisal was to summarize the main effect of current use, type II synthetic pyrethroids (deltamethrin, cypermethrin and fenvalerate) on aquatic environment due to their persistence and accumulation. This article will focus on non-target organisms in inland fresh water environment with special reference to fin fishes and will critically evaluate the toxicity of these pyrethroids in terms of growth inhibition, metabolic disorders, neurotoxicity, reproductive failure, enzymatic dysfunction, haematological alterations, and tissue damages. The rationalized information in this milieu may be useful in ecological risk evaluation and human health management as fish serves as an important bio-indicator for aquatic systems health. ; Not Available",,,Deltamethrin Cypermethrin Fenvalerate Fishes Pyrethroids Toxicological assessment,NA,NA,synthetic pyrethroids type ii and freshwater fish culture perils and mitigations not available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S-metolachlor is a selective herbicide that inhibits cell division and mitosis via enzyme interference. The herbicide is used globally in agriculture and studies report adverse effects in aquatic organisms; however, there are no studies investigating sub-lethal effects of S-metolachlor on swim bladder formation, mitochondrial ATP production, nor light-dark preference behaviors in fish. These endpoints are relevant for larval locomotor activity and metabolism. To address these knowledge gaps, we exposed zebrafish embryos/larvae to various concentrations of S-metolachlor (0.5-50 mu M) over early development. S-metolachlor affected survival, hatching percentage, and increased developmental deformities at concentrations of 50 mu M and above. Exposure levels as high as 200 mu M for 24 and 48 h did not alter oxygen consumption rates in zebrafish, and there were no changes detected in endpoints related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We observed impairment of swim bladder inflation at 50 mu M in 6 dpf larvae. To elucidate mechanisms related to this, we measured relative transcript abundance for genes associated with the swim bladder (smooth muscle alpha (alpha)-2 actin, annexin A5, pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a). Smooth muscle alpha (alpha)-2 actin mRNA levels were reduced in fish exposed to 50 mu M while annexin A5 mRNA levels were increased in abundance, corresponding to reduced swim bladder size in larvae. A visual motor response test revealed that larval zebrafish exhibited some hyperactivity in the light with exposure to the herbicide and only the highest dose tested (50 mu M) resulted in hypo activity in the dark cycle. Regression analysis indicated that there was a positive relationship between surface area of the swim bladder and distance traveled, and the size of the swim bladder explained similar to 10-14% in the variation for total distance moved. Lastly, we tested larvae in a light dark preference test, and we did not detect any altered behavioral response to any concentration tested. Here we present new data on sublethal endpoints associated with exposure to the herbicide S-metolachlor and demonstrate that this chemical may disrupt transcripts associated with swim bladder formation and morphology, which could ultimately affect larval zebrafish activity.

Environmental pollution has been hypothesized to be associated with declines. Because of their aquatic development and permeable eggs, skin and gills, amphibians, like fishes, may be particularly susceptible to poor water quality or waterborne pollutants. This dissertation addresses effects of global pollutants such as pesticides, acid rain and associated metal toxicity, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on the development, behavior, and physiology of amphibian early life stages. This report contains only chapter six and conclusions. Chapter 6 reports on a field experiment in which green frogs from two clutches were exposed from egg to 107 days of age to water and sediments in enclosures along a PCB and metal contamination gradient in the Fox River and wetlands near Green Bay, Wisconsin. Green frogs showed lower hatching success and survival at sites with higher contaminant levels compared to cleaner wetland sites along Green Bay. Hatching success in the green frog was most significantly negatively correlated with sediment PCB levels. It can be concluded that environmental pollution and toxicants in aquatic environments can cause problems for amphibian early development. Sometimes the effects are subtle, and sometimes they are dramatic.

In contrast, PAHs and s-PAHs exhibited greater dilution rates along the trophic levels in the pelagic food web. The lower species differences of pollutants accumulated in benthic organisms compared to pelagic organisms is attributable to extra uptake via ingested sediment in benthos.

Pesticides have been evaluated on the basis of the test results submitted with regard to their behaviour in soil and water, their effects on organisms present in the environment, such as birds, aquatic organisms (algae, crustaceans and fish), bees and earthworms, and their bioaccumulation potential. Behaviour in soil concerns the rate and route of conversion of a pesticide and its sorption to soil particles. The risks of leaching to the saturated soil layers and of accumulation in the plough layer one year after application of the chemical have been estimated using the Support Group M model developed for this purpose. Behaviour in water includes the rates of hydrolysis and photolysis, and especially the rate and route of conversion of a pesticide in water/sediment systems.

The report also makes proposals for developing several aspects of the evaluation, such as behaviour in air, risks to terrestrial organisms and risks of biomagnification. ; DGM/SR",,,12;91-1;pesticides;environmental characteristics;behaviour in soil;persistence;behaviour in water;toxicity;water organisms;birds;bees;earthworms;bioaccumulation;classification;Pesticides,NA,NA,catchup operation on old pesticides an integration inhaalmanoeuvre oude bestrijdingsmiddelen een integratie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rams) are popular freshwater animal models. However, their behavioral use in aquatic toxicology research is generally ham pered by oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are not well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented a comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e.,anxiety-like behavior, novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory). We found that only medaka (d-rR) presented a weak or no response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus. In addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the three species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01% v/v carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and DMSO). In contrast to zebrafish and Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes in spatial memory after subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5 mu g/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead, a hyperactivity response in the open field test and reduced social time were induced by cpf and imidacloprid, respectively. Our results suggest that: (1) behavioral effects are negligible when using <0.01% v/v carrier solvents for behavioral assessment: (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be insufficient for estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other environmental contaminants. In conclusion, these results could have major implications for aquatic toxicology research and water quality monitoring and ecoioxicological risk assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Pesticides are toxic to aquatic biota which form important components of the food chain such as fishes. Fishes are important sources of protein in nation-state’s diet. So a detailed understanding of the pollutant effect on fishes would be rewarding for fish conservation and fishery development. Cypermethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid pesticide and potential toxic pollutant contaminating aquatic ecosystems, was investigated in the present study for acute toxicity. Indian major carp (Cirrhinus mrigala) were selected for the bioassay experiments. Experimental fish were subjected to different concentrations of cypermethrin ranging from 0.40 to 6.40μg/l for 96 hrs in test containers. The static renewal test method of acute toxicity test was used. Water temperature was regulated at 26.8 ± 3° C. In addition, behavioral changes such as loss of schooling behaviour, swimming near the water surface, hyper activity, erratic movements, seizures, loss of buoyancy, darting movements and hitting against the walls of test tanks at each cypermethrin concentration were observed for the individual fish. Data acquired from the cypermethrin acute toxicity tests were evaluated using the arithmetic method of Karber. The 96 hr LC50 value for Cirrhinus mrigala was estimated as 4.57μg/l. The possible variation in the LC 50 values can be attributed to toxicant sensitivity, its concentration and duration of exposure. ; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)",,,Cirrhinus mrigala;LC50;Static renewal bioassay;Cypermethrin;Toxicity,NA,NA,investigation of acute toxicity and behavioral response of indian major carp cirrhinus mrigala hamilton 1822 in response to cypermethrin not available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, our understanding of sublethal effects and underlying toxicologic mechanisms of GBHs are still limited, especially in amphibians. Here, the sublethal effects of a commercial GBH (KISSUN (R)) on tadpoles of a farmland dwelling frog, Microhyla fissipes, were investigated. The 10-d LC50 of ""KISSUN (R)"" GBH was 77.5 mg/L. Tadpoles exposed to 60-120 mg/L showed increased preference to higher temperature. After 10 days exposure, obvious growth suppression was observed in survived GBH-stressed tadpoles, characterized by dosage depended decrement in body mass, body width, total length, etc. GBH-stressed tadpoles also showed decreased tail length/snout-vent length ratio and smaller tail muscle fiber diameter. Comparative transcriptomics (control, 60 mg/L and 90 mg/L groups) was conducted to analyze the underlying molecular processes. GBH-stressed tadpoles showed downregulated transcription of ribosomal proteins and cytoskeleton proteins, which could explain their suppressed whole body and tail muscle growth. Moreover, GBH-stressed tadpoles showed transcriptional downregulation of carbohydrate and lipid catabolism, but upregulation of amino acid catabolism. It suggested a metabolic switch from carbohydrate and lipid to amino acid in these tadpoles. Accordingly, there was a trade-off between protein synthesis and energy production in respect to amino acid allocation, and it provided a metabolic explanation for why protein synthesis was downregulated and growth was suppressed in GBH-stressed tadpoles. In combination with existing literatures, we speculated that GBH might directly target the enzymes in carbohydrate and lipid catabolism, and this metabolic effect of GBH might be common to fish and amphibians.

Various environmental pollutants of distinct physicochemical properties are able to impair the retinal development and function of teleost fishes, including dioxin-like pollutants, flame retardants, pesticides, perfluoroalkyl acids, retinoic acids and metals. Considering the availability of developmental and functional database, zebrafish has been the most frequently used as the teleost model to study aquatic visual toxicology. A diversity of visual deficits has been displayed for fishes across multiple levels of biological organizations (e.g., molecule, cell, histology, physiology and behavior). Covering sensitive developmental windows of eyes during early embryogenesis, acute or chronic exposure to xenobiotics can disturb the expressions of visual gene and protein markers, which affect the retinal neurogenesis and induce degeneration of neurons. Morphological structures and physiological responses of retina and optic rectum are then disorganized, eventually compromising the performance of visually-mediated behaviors and recruitment of individuals. Environmental pollutants can cross the blood-retina barrier and accumulate in eyes, which might impact visual system directly. In addition, pollutants are very likely to interrupt retinal development and function indirectly by disturbing the signaling of retinoids and thyroid. However, exact mechanisms of visual toxicity are largely unknown currently. In this review, the development and structure of retina and available tools for studying visual science are described briefly.

Toads of both species were collected at a site in East Texas in 1993, 1994, and 1995, and maintained in captivity for several months to observe feeding behavior and general health. Animals were exposed dermally by ventral absorption for 6 hr to carbofuran or trifluralin. Toads were checked prior to the exposure and at 2, 4, and 6 hr for loss of righting reflex and hind-leg retraction, hyperactivity, iris contraction, and mass increase. Animals were also tested pre-and post-dosing for feeding response. Toads were frozen at 1 hr and 1 d post-dosing for brain cholinesterase (ChE) analysis. Trifluralin showed differences from controls only within the post-feeding test; dosed animals did not eat. There were significant differences between controls and toads exposed to carbofuran in all behavioral categories. A carbofuran concentration of approximately 5.5% of the highest recommended field application rate (2.5 gal/acre) caused loss of righting reflex in 30% of B. valliceps and 60% B velatus at 6 hr.

Sixteen 560-liter microcosms including prey, predator, and competitor populations were employed over a wide range of energy and habitat resource availability and exploitation of the top predator. Chronic exposure to the pesticide dieldrin was used to perturb systems near steady states. Empirical generalizations from ecological theory, productivity theory, and fishery exploitation theory were incorporated to explain in part such performances as development, structure, and persistence of the laboratory ecosystems, their communities, populations, and individual organisms. Dynamic (developmental) and near steady-state community structure and organization were detailed for guppy, amphipod, snail, planaria, and algae populations and for a benthic detritus and microorganism component. Near steady-state population performances including density, production, yield, and size-specific growth and reproduction were determined for the guppy population in order to demonstrate the concordance of life history, population, and community level performances with changes in environmental conditions. A system of isoclines on a series of interrelated resource-utilizer and competition phase planes was employed to gain a better understanding of the structure and apparent organization of the laboratory systems.

Allowing traits to cluster into phenotypes may produce outcomes that are more clinically and biologically relevant. Additionally, environmental exposures often occur in a mixture. Accounting for such a possibility may reduce bias that results from assuming exposures are independent. We sought to estimate associations between organophosphorus pesticides and neurodevelopment after accounting for these possibilities. Methods: A prospective birth cohort of 404 mother/infant pairs were followed from pregnancy until the children were 6 and 7-9 years of age. Factor analysis was performed on parent-report measures of child executive functioning and behavior, and performance-based measures of IQ. We estimated associations between demographic characteristics, maternal characteristics and environmental exposures during pregnancy and early childhood, and the neurodevelopmental factor scores after accounting for correlations among the factors. Results: We determined the existence of a seven factor solution. Smoking during pregnancy, canned fish consumption, maternal education, and HOME environment were associated with various factors. Prenatal exposure to ∑DMPs was associated with worse Internalizing factor scores but better Executive Functioning factor scores, while ∑DEPs were associated with worse Working Memory Index scores. Estimates were generally stronger for factor scores than for individual instrument-specific items. Conclusions: Associations between prenatal exposure to OPs and worse internalizing behaviors and working memory scores are supported by prior findings in both human and animal studies. Associations with improved executive functioning are not supported by prior literature and may be a result of residual confounding by maternal executive functioning and dietary sources of OPs.

The influence of oxygen depletion on the toxicity of substances was included as an additional interacting factor. To analyse complex interactions, the predator-prey behaviour between zebrafish and chironomid larvae (Chironomus riparius) was investigated. Another aspect of this work were studies on complex mixtures of hydrocarbons such as the water accommodated fraction of crude oil, and their effects on the behaviour of marine amphipods (Corophium volutator), as well as semi-field experiments with freshwater amphipods (Gammarus pulex). My investigations showed that effects of various substances in environmentally relevant concentration ranges are exerted on different levels of biological organisation, both in amphipods and fish. It could be shown that abiotic parameters modify the effects of pollutants. When investigating mixtures of substances with similar or different modes of action, additivity occurred in the majority of cases which usually were consistent for all investigated parameters (enzyme activity, locomotor activity, developmental impairment, mortality). Effects of the neurotoxic insecticide chlorpyrifos on the interactions between fish and chironomids could be detected in environmentally relevant concentration ranges. The effects of the water accommodated fraction of crude oil which represents a great risk for aquatic organisms in costal habitats were displayed by alterations in the behaviour of the marine amphipod Corophium volutator. For a continuous monitoring of water quality in monitoring stations, the resident amphipod Gammarus pulex proved to be a suitable and relevant test organism, as it responds sensitive to complex mixtures of pollutants in surface waters. In summary, behavioural parameters proved to be integrative, relevant and sensitive parameters for the different research topics/questions in the present work, and can also be recommended to be used to analyse interspecific interactions. To judge on the effects of pollutants on aquatic organisms in the environment, abiotic parameters as well as mixtures of pollutants should be included. Additionally, biochemical measurements as well as behavioural tests are important, to adequately assess the toxicity of pollutants.

The results show: In experimental fields, the half-life of active substances ranged from 7.4 to 27.2 days, on the surface soil layer. The physicochemical properties of active ingredient, the tobacco and maize crops, the soil slope (%) effect on the half-life of active ingredient. The losses due to surface runoff for all active ingredients were less than 1% of the applied dose. The soil slope, the solubility of the active ingredient and the cultivation practices influenced the surface runoff of the pesticides. Detection of pesticide residues in deeper soil layers in an attempt to visualize the leaching of pesticides has shown that 4/5 active ingredient can move to greater soil depths, indicating that heavy irrigation and rainfall immediately after the application of pesticides can increase the risk of contamination of groundwater. In contrast, the active ingredient rimsulfuron appears to be rapidly degraded. Its half-life on maize soil columns is 5 days. At 45 days of application, no rimsulfuron was detected at all analyzed soil depths, indicating its inability to contaminate groundwater aquifers. In contrast, the rimsulfuron appears to be rapidly degraded. The half-life of the experimental results is 5 days.

They have the ability to impede groundwater contamination by retaining and subsequently degrading pesticides. The main component of a biobed, the activated biomixture, has been identified as the major factor controlling its efficacy. In its typical form a biomixture consists of straw, peat and topsoil in a 2:1:1 ratio. The aim of the study was to evaluate various agricultural products found locally as substitutes of peat and straw in the biomixture. For this reason 3 different laboratory studies (degradation, sorption and leaching studies) were conducted in our laboratory. The organic substrates included in the study were various lignocellulosic materials and composts or peat. Soils with different physicochemical characteristics were also included in the study. Analytical methods for pesticide residues determination in biomixtures and soil were developed and evaluated. The chromatographic analysis of the 9 pesticides included in the study (terbuthylazine, dimethoate, metalaxyl-M, metribuzin, buprofezin, chlorpyrifos, iprodione, indoxacarb, azoxystrobin) was performed by gas chromatography with NPD and ECD detectors, while the analysis of the metabolites of terbuthylazine, metribuzin and chlorpyrifos were performed by HPLC with UV detector. In degradation experiments pesticides were extracted with acetone while their metabolites were extracted using a water:methanol mixture. In sorption/desorption studies pesticides were extracted by passed through C18 cartridges while pesticide residues in the leachate were extracted utilizing liquidliquid extraction. The evaluation of the analytical methods included the calculation of accuracy, precision, linearity, the determination of LOD and LOQ and matrix effect. The first study examined the relative contribution of individual components in the degradation efficiency of compost biomixtures.

Both compounds are highly neurotoxic to fish, but each with distinct biological target sites and mechanisms of action. We used common biochemical and physiological indicators of toxicity, and correlated these effects with potentially significant behavioral alterations. For chlorpyrifos, the mechanism of toxic action is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) throughout the peripheral and central nervous system. Here, we conducted biochemical assays of AChE activity in brain and muscle tissues after exposing steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (0. kisutch) to chlorpyrifos for 96 hours. We then correlated the AChE inhibition with behavioral impairment in swimming and feeding activities. In juvenile steelhead and coho exposed to 0.6-2.5 μg/L chlorpyrifos, AChE activity was inhibited between ~10-65%. This biochemical indicator was significantly correlated with changes in behavioral patterns. Spontaneous swimming rates were reduced ~30-80% in the exposed fish, and strikes at food items (brine shrimp) were reduced ~10-70%. For copper and some other neurotoxicants, the olfactory nervous system is a sensitive target site in fish. The highly-developed olfactory system in salmonids is particularly susceptible to toxic insult by dissolved chemicals since receptor neurons are in direct contact with the aquatic environment. Here, we used electrophysiological techniques to record odor-evoked responses from the sensory epithelium and the olfactory bulb as direct measures of olfactory function in juvenile coho salmon. In fish exposed to copper, chlorpyrifos, or esfenvalerate for 7 days, field potentials recorded from the sensory epithelium and the olfactory bulb showed reduced or obscured olfactory responses to two classes of odorants, which activate non-overlapping populations ...",,,Salmonidae;Effect of pollution on;Copper;Environmental aspects;Effect of pesticides on;Chlorpyrifos,NA,NA,biochemical and physiological indicators of behavioral impairment in salmonids exposed to chlorpyrifos and copper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A review of several models proposed to explain attitudes and behaviour was undertaken and Fishbein and Ajzen’s model was chosen to investigate farmers attitudes and behaviour towards information sources and pesticide use. The first, preliminary, survey of farmers in West Sussex produced an unexpected result: that they did not apply pesticides as many times as they had indicated at the beginning of the growing season.

The aims of the present study were to assess the type and composition of fish populations currently using the estuary, investigate aspects of their biology and gather information on the occurrence of specific pollutants in their tissues with a view to evaluating the influence of man's activities. Quantitative sampling was carried out monthly between 1973 and 1975 from the intake screens of Kingsnorth Power Station. Trawl samples were also taken as a check for selectivity. During the study over 46,000 fish, divided between 59 species, were collected. All individuals were weighed and measured, and selected species were aged. The annual cycle of species-occurrence, their relative abundance, population structure and growth of the most common species were investigated. The diets of plaice, Pleuronectes platessa L., flounder, Platichthys flesus (L.), whiting, Merlangius merlangus (L.) and pouting, Trisopterus luscus (L.) were monitored. Seasonal and/or age variations in food intake and feeding behaviour were considered in conjunction with parasite and pollution studies. The integumental tissues and branchial cavities of fish were inspected for parasites. Adults of the blood-feeding ectoparasitic copepod Lernaeocera branchialis (L.) infested whiting. Fish so infected showed a statistically significant reduction in body weight. Also, a brief study of their liver lipids revealed an approximately 50 percent loss in weight and this primarily reflected lower levels of phospholipid. Selected fish, and some of their dietary constituents, were analysed for organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls and five heavy metals. Heavy metal levels were low in comparison with other A literature values. Chlorinated hydrocarbon values showed no marked seasonal variations connected with agricultural activities but their concentrations were correlated with the lipid content of most tissues.",,,590 Animals (Zoology),NA,NA,aspects of the biology of fish populations from the medway estuary based on power station intake sampling with special reference to parasitism and pollution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this regard, the use of pesticides in agricultural systems may have deleterious effects on aquatic ecosystems within the same catchment area. Here using a series of in–situ and ex–situ experiments, the study assessed (a) pesticide concentrations of acetamiprid and chlorpyrifos across MACADAMIA ORCHARD and communal area reservoirs using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), (b) the behavioural responses of Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, following exposure to three commonly used macadamia pesticides (i.e., Karate Zeon 10 CS, Mulan 20 SP, Pyrinex 250 CS at different concentrations, (c) macadamia Macadamia integrifolia leaf litter decomposition and mosquito colonisation following pesticide exposure, and (d) macroinvertebrate colonisation associated with introduced stone substrates in cages within the MACADAMIA ORCHARD and control reservoirs to explore whether macadamia pesticides affected on macroinvertebrate colonisation dynamics. Firstly, analysis of acetamiprid and chlorpyrifos associated with sediments in MACADAMIA ORCHARD reservoirs revealed mean pesticide concentrations of 14.48 μg L–1 and 5.67 μg L–1, respectively, whereas, in communal area reservoirs outside of agricultural catchments, both pesticides were not detected. Acetamiprid was not detected across reservoir water, whereas the mean pesticide concentration of chlorpyrifos of 6.51 μg L–1 (MACADAMIA ORCHARD) and 0.13 μg L–1 (communal area) were detected. Secondly, O. mossambicus demonstrated different onset behavioural responses, i.e., swimming erratically, surfacing, vertical positioning, loss of equilibrium, being motionless and mortality with high mortality at increased mortality. Thirdly, macadamia leaf litter tended to decompose faster when exposed to pesticide treatments, whereas chlorophyll–a were reduced. ...",,,Pesticides;Reservoirs;LC-MS/MS;Behaviour traits;Environmental stressor;Freshwater Fishes;Neonicotinoids;Organophosphate;Pyrethroid;Mosquito larvae;Allochthorious inputs;Macadamia Stone substrates;Macadamia orchards;Pesticides macroinvertebrate community;Macroinvertebrate diversity metrics;632.7;Agricultural pests;Orchards;Disease and pests;Environmental aspects;Macadamia nut;Aquatic pests;Pests,NA,NA,assessing the effects of macadamia orchard pesticide inputs on recipient aquatic ecosystems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Migration barriers and selective pesticides are used to control sea lamprey, but there is a desire to develop additional control tools such as traps with deterrents. Sound has been used as a deterrent for other invasive species but its potential for manipulating sea lamprey behavior in natural stream conditions remains untested. The behavioural threshold for sea lamprey nor a behavioural comparison of life stages has also not been established. Here, behavioral responses of upstream migrating adult sea lamprey in response to low frequency sounds of 70 or 90 Hz was tracked in a small stream using passive integrated transponder (PIT) telemetry. The low frequency sounds shifted sea lamprey distribution with up to 30% more sea lamprey detected on PIT antennas without sound compared to PIT antennas with sound playing. The same frequency tones were used for behavioral responses of adult and juvenile sea lamprey and were tracked in a lab setup. The low frequency sounds changed the sea lampreys behaviour with juvenile and adult sea lamprey showing similar swimming behavioural thresholds and twitch (startle) behavioural thresholds for both frequencies. Future studies could continue testing low frequency sounds in natural setting for use as a natural deterrent at sea lamprey barriers to push sea lamprey toward traps at different life stages and continued studies in a lab setting could be useful for knowledge of the behaviour of sea lamprey to apply to traps for population control.",,,Behavioural control;Behavioural threshold;Invasive species;Low frequency sound;Natural deterrent;Sound detection,NA,NA,behavioural response of sea lamprey petromyzon marinus to acoustic stimuli in a laboratory and field setting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies evaluating the effects of sublethal concentrations of pesticide mixtures are limited, especially in coastal systems [1]. The purpose of this dissertation research was to investigate both lethal and sublethal effects of realistic pesticide exposure scenarios on two life-stages (juvenile and adult) of an important invertebrate estuarine predator, prey, and fishery species, the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). Importantly, blue crab populations are declining throughout the U.S., but the potential role of pesticides in declines remains largely unexplored. In a series of laboratory experiments, I investigated: (1) lethal and sublethal effects of a single exposure to carbaryl (carbamate), malathion (organophosphate) and resmethrin (pyrethroid) + PBO (synergist), individually and in mixtures, on juvenile and adult blue crab survival and neuromuscular functioning by measuring changes in mortality, righting time (RT), and eyestalk reflexes. These responses serve as a proxy for the direct effects of exposure on survival and indirect effects on coordinated behaviors critical to blue crab survival (e.g., predator escape or foraging). Pesticides were selected because they are three of the mostly commonly used throughout the U.S. and have different modes of action. Effects observed at the organismal level were subsequently evaluated and linked with changes in (2) predator-prey interactions (mesocosms), and (3) physiological responses (enzyme assays). Lastly, (4) differences in susceptibility between juvenile (post-planktonic) and adult life-stages were also evaluated in behavioral and predator-prey ...",,,Carbaryl;Estuarine;Invertebrate;malathion;PBO;Resmethrin;Pesticides;Prednisolone,NA,NA,dazed and confused pesticides alter physiology behavior and predatorprey interactions of juvenile and adult blue crabs callinectes sapidus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies were conducted to determine how sexual maturity, insect age, mating status (unmated vs mated), host thermoregulatory behavior, and prior maternal pathogen exposure influence A. glabripennis susceptibility to M. brunneum and ability to suppress a fungal infection, even across a generation. Additionally, potential mechanisms of synergy between M. brunneum and the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid were investigated. Beetles did not exhibit thermoregulatory behavior although it would have been beneficial. Prior maternal pathogen exposure enhanced offspring survival but whether offspring survival was enhanced depended on the pathogen used to expose mothers and whether or not the pathogen was living or dead. Beetle susceptibility to A. glabripennis was iii also influenced by the age and mating status of beetles. We found that old beetles were not more susceptible than younger beetles and only found a cost of mating for mature but not old beetles. Finally we found that starvation may be a potential mechanism for the synergy between a pesticide (imidacloprid) and the fungal pathogen M. brunneum. These findings provide insight into insect-pathogen interactions and ecoimmunology in beetles. iv",,,Asian longhorned beetle;Metarhizium brunneum;Invertebrate Immunity,NA,NA,ecoimmunology of the asian longhorned beetle anoplophora glabripennis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diuron, a chlorinated phenylurea herbicide and its primary metabolite, 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) exert toxic effects on non-target organisms. Growth, survival, and reproduction are the primary factors determining an organism's population structure in its habitat. Javanese medaka (Oryzias javanicus) is an emerging euryhaline model fish distributed around the coastal and estuarine regions of Peninsular Malaysia and other parts of Southeast Asia. The fish is a sentinel species that bioindicates ecosystem health. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acute toxicity of diuron and 3,4-DCA on different life stages of Javanese medaka, to determine the effect of diuron and 3,4-DCA on the fecundity and reproductive biomarkers of Javanese medaka, and to evaluate the embryotoxicity of diuron and 3,4-DCA on Javanese medaka. Larvae, juveniles, and adults of Javanese medaka were exposed to diuron and 3,4-DCA for 96 hours to determine mortality (96 hour-LC50; 50% lethal concentration to exposed organisms) and behavioural toxicity symptoms. Fish embryo toxicity (FET) test; mortality (LC50) at 10-days and 96-hour for diuron and 3,4-DCA, and subchronic embryonic toxicity (20 days) for both diuron and 3,4-DCA were also evaluated. Reproductively active adults were used for a 21-day diuron and 3,4-DCA fish short-term reproductive assay (FSTRA). All the bioassays were conducted in a semi-static method.

We demonstrated that microinjection of rotenone into the forebrain ventricular zone of adult zebrafish decreases the number of dopaminergic neurons.

This study evaluates the rotational rice-fish farming systems and the use of new fish species for concurrent rice-fish culture. The overall objective is to present scientifically sound conclusions, able to further improve rice farmers’ income as well as a sustainable rice production through better performing rice-fish systems. Hereto the following specific objectives were selected: (1) evaluate economic returns of a rotational double rice crop - fish pen culture system (2R-FP) and compare them with the double and triple rice monoculture systems (2RM and 3RM) in the flood-prone area, (2) investigate the factors affecting fish yield and profit of the fish pen culture system, (3) investigate the predation potential of climbing perch (Anabas testudineus. B.) on insects and its production parameters in concurrent rice-fish systems, and (4) investigate the feeding habits of snakehead murrel (Channa striata B.), its production parameters and its effects on the production of major stocked fish species in the concurrent rice-fish systems. This study includes two parts. Part A (Chapter 2 & 3) makes use of household surveys carried out in 2006 to address the specific objectives 1 and 2. In Part B (Chapter 4 to 7) a series of on-station experiments, undertaken from 2003 to 2010, address the specific objectives 3 and 4. Chapter 2 analyzes the economic returns of three farming systems: 2R-FP, 2RM and 3RM in the flood-prone area of the MD. Adopting an additional crop during the flood season, fish pen culture in 2R-FP had a significantly higher return above variable costs (4.1 million VND per ha) than the third rice crop (2.1 million VND per ha) in 3RM, due to comparatively low production costs. Comparing 2R-FP with 3RM shows that less chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used in 2R-FP. The present study suggests that in the flood-prone region of the MD, 2R-FP could replace the commonly practiced 2RM or 3RM systems from an economical as well as ecological point of view.Chapter 3 investigates the factors affecting fish yield and profit of the fish pen culture from the 2R-FP. Fish net yield significantly increased with stocking density and specific polycultures. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio L.) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis R.) perform best, both in production and profit considerations. Low fish price at harvest and the difficulty to sell below market sized common carp at a period of oversupply, were the main problems indicated for fish pen culture. A larger harvest size of common carp resulted in a significantly higher return above variable costs. Harvest size of common carp was mainly limited by increasing common carp stocking density, while increasing stocking density of common carp was not significantly correlated with the return above variable costs for all stocked fish.Therefore, we recommend for commoncarp a stocking density of around 6,000 fish per ha in order to obtain the optimum combination of marketable sizes, a good price, biomass and profit at harvest. The stocking density of bighead carp fingerlings should be increased above the mean stocking density as applied in this study (1,000 fish per ha). Partial fish harvesting strategy is recommended in order to avoid temporary oversupplies. Chapter 4 investigates natural food use and growth performance of climbing perch, grown in concurrent rice-fish fields under different combinations of fish species and stocking densities. Insects were the major food item of climbing perch. The proportion of rice grains was significantly higher in the stomach of climbing perch when Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus niloticus L.) was included in the polyculture than with a combination of silver barb (Barbonymus gonionotus B.) or common carp. Meanwhile, the proportion of insects in the stomach of climbing perch was significantly higher in combination with silver barb than with Nile tilapia. The net yield of climbing perch was significantly higher in combination with Nile tilapia than with silver barb or common carp. The survival rate of climbing perch dropped significantly with increasing stocking density from 2,500 to 5,000 fish per ha, suggesting that food availability is probably the major constraint for climbing perch. Lower stocking densities of climbing perch and silver barb, stocking larger fingerlings of climbing perch, a longer culture period (8-10 months) and supplemental nutrient inputs are advisable to get a marketable size for climbing perch and to improve its net production.Chapter 5 investigates in rice-fish aquariums and concrete tanks, the feeding behavior of different fish species as well as their ability to control brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Homoptera: Delphacidae). In the aquarium studies we found that climbing perch spent more time attempting to graze BPH, especially on rice tillers above the water surface, compared to common carp and Nile tilapia. This resulted in a higher number of BPH eaten by climbing perch than by other fish species. In the tank studies all sizes of climbing perch from 10 to 80 g per fish reduced the number of BPH at both vegetative, reproductive and ripening phases of the rice crop, but the effects were dependent on the fish size. Small and medium climbing perch reduced better the number of BPH than the larger ones. The present study suggests that despite the limited biomass yield, climbing perch can be incorporated in rice-fish fields in order to enhance the biological control of rice pests, especially BPH. Chapter 6 investigates the natural food use of snakehead murrel in concurrent rice-fish fields, next to the major stocked white fish species, silver barb, common carp, Nile tilapia and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix V.). Two experiments were conducted with different stocking sizes (19, 38 and 89 g per fish) and densities (500, 1,500 and 3,000 fish per ha) of snakehead murrel. The prey selection and feeding strategy of the introduced snakehead murrel change with size. The non-stocked riceland prawn (Macrobrachium lanchesteri D.) and small indigenous fish species (Esomus longimanus L. and Trichogaster trichopterus P.) are important preys for snakehead murrel within the size class 64 to 99 g per fish. When the size of snakehead murrel increases further, they capture larger non-stocked indigenous fish (Trichogaster trichopterus P. and Anabas testudineus B.), followed by stocked fish species (common carp, Nile tilapia, silver barb and snakehead murrel). The snakehead murrel production parameters and their effect on other stocked fish production are analyzed in Chapter 7. The net production of snakehead murrel in concurrent rice-fish fields system was dependent on their stocking size and density, as this influenced their intraspecific competition for natural food items and cannibalism. Small stocking size snakehead murrel (about 20 g per fish) and low stocking densities (500 fish per ha) present the better results concerning survival rates, net production and return above fingerling cost of snakehead murrel. The stocked snakehead murrel, applied at different sizes, or densities, did not adversely affect the net production of stocked white fish. Nevertheless, after four months culture the estimated return above fingerling cost for stocked snakehead murrel was two times lower than the cost for fence construction preventing them from escaping. For this reason, it is not recommended to incorporate snakehead murrel in concurrent rice-fish fields. Further research is still needed to improve snakehead murrel production in concurrent rice-fish system in order to make it economically profitable.In brief, this study suggests that in the flood-prone region of the MD, next to the concurrent rice-fish systems, the 2R-FP could replace the commonly practiced 2RM and 3RM from an economical and ecological point of view. Applying (1) polyculture with common carp and bighead carp, (2) a lower common carp stocking density, and (3) a partial fish harvesting strategy, is advisable to improve the net yield and profit of fish pen culture in the 2R-FP. Further controlled experiments are needed in order to pinpoint critical fish stocking rates as well as to better quantify synergistic interactions between fish pen culture and rice production to further enhance the economic performance of these combined agricultural systems. In concurrent rice-fish systems, climbing perch can be incorporated in order to enhance the biological control of rice pests, especially BPH. On the other hand, under our experimental conditions it is not recommended to incorporate snakehead murrel in concurrent rice-fish fields.The estimated direct return above fingerling cost for stocked snakehead murrel is too low after four months of culture. Improvement of snakehead murrel production in concurrent rice-fish fields is needed to make the stocking of this species profitable. ; Table of contents Acknowledgments iii Abbreviations iv Table of contents vi Chapter 1 General introduction 1 Part A Rotational rice-fish farming systems 27 Chapter 2 Profit versus ecological considerations - rotational rice-fish farming systems as an alternative to rice monoculture systems 29 Chapter 3 Factors affecting fish yield and profit in fish pen culture in flooded ricefields 53 Part B Incorporation in concurrent rice-fish systems of indigenous black fish next to the major stocked white fish species 79 Chapter 4 Natural food use and production parameters of climbing perch (Anabas testudineus Bloch) in a concurrent rice-fish system 81 Chapter 5 Investigation of the predation potential of different fish species on brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens (Stål)) in experimental rice-fish aquariums and tanks 103 Chapter 6 Feeding habits of snakehead murrel (Channa striata Bloch) in concurrent rice-fish systems 125 Chapter 7 Production parameters of the snakehead murrel (Channa striata Bloch) and the impact on fish polyculture in concurrent rice-fish systems 153 Chapter 8 General discussion and perspectives 175 References 195 Summary (English) 213 Summary (Dutch) 217 Curriculum vitae 223 List of publications 224 ; nrpages: 226 ; status: published",,,Integrated farming systems;Oryza sativa,NA,NA,evaluation of rotational ricefish farming systems and new fish species for concurrent ricefish culture in the mekong delta vietnam evaluatie van alternerende rijstvis kweeksystemen en van nieuwe vissoorten voor simultane rijstvis kweek in de mekong delta vietnam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Penaeids are one of the most important fishery resources worldwide, and in Mozambique they are the basis of a profitable commercial fishery, landing hundreds of tons per year. Ecological knowledge concerning habitat use and factors driving the distribution and abundance of shrimp in nursery areas, and regarding the successful movement of juveniles from the nurseries to adult grounds, are critical to characterize productive nurseries for penaeid shrimp and provide important information for a sustainable management of their fishery. In this thesis I used a combination of stable isotope methods, ecotoxicology techniques and extensive field studies to assess feeding behaviour and factors affecting density and distribution of four shrimp species (Metapenaeus monoceros, M. stebbingi, Penaeus indicus and P. japonicus) in three estuaries (Espírito Santo, Maputo river and Incomati river) and two coastal marine areas (Bembe and Inhaca Island) in Maputo Bay, the second greatest shrimp fishing ground in Mozambique, to assess their values as nursery areas for the fishery. Stable isotope analyses showed that the assessed shrimp species were mainly using seagrass beds and shallow sand and mud flats as feeding grounds, whereas only P. indicus appeared to also feed within the mangrove habitat. The analysis of metals concentration in shrimp showed no indication of elevated levels, and although levels for pesticides in the water exceed environmental thresholds in some of the nursery areas, only a localized effect of insecticides was detected in P. indicus in Espírito Santo estuary.

Zequanox®, a biopesticide made from soil bacteria, has been advertised as dreissenid-selective and environmentally safe. Health Canada has approved the use of Zequanox® in hydroelectric facilities, which may indicate movement toward open-water use in Canada, as has occurred in the USA and Ireland. Data from singlespecies assays indicate that exposure to Zequanox® concentrations near or below those recommended for open-water applications can cause mortality (often ≥50%) in fish and invertebrates. However, little is known about the non-target impacts of applying Zequanox® in an open-water setting, given that toxicants can behave differently in natural versus laboratory environments and because single-species tests are unable to characterize indirect effects such as pesticide-mediated changes to inter-species interactions like competition and predation. Using a six-week-long replicated aquatic mesocosm experiment, I simulated open-water applications of Zequanox® (100 mg/L of the active ingredient) to determine the responses of primary producers, zooplankton, and macroinvertebrates to Zequanox® exposure in a complex aquatic environment.

However, in recent years, bumble bee populations have experienced global population declines. The primary causes of these declines have been attributed to the environmental impacts of pathogens, pesticide use and habitat fragmentation. While research has examined the impacts of pathogens, there is limited information on the effects of pesticides and habitat fragmentation on native bumble bees. Hence, the objectives of my dissertation research were to: 1) assess the toxicological impacts of pesticides used in two important bee-pollinated crops on queens and workers; 2) determine the impacts of forage resource availability on bumble bee colonies; 3) examine pollen foraging behavior of bumble bees in a late season mass-flowering agricultural landscape; and 4) document observations on trends towards bivoltinism in three western North American bumble bees. This research was conducted in the lab using wild and lab reared colonies, and in an agricultural landscape in the Willamette Valley of Western Oregon. In pesticide bioassays the impacts of residual toxicity of five classes of pesticides used in highbush blueberry and red clover cropping systems, were tested on queen and worker bumble bees, respectively. The results indicated variation in responses to the same insecticide by queens and workers, and to the same class of compounds by workers. Also, toxic effects were documented for both queens and workers to pesticides considered to be ""safe"" for bees. The impacts of forage resource availability were evaluated by exposing bumble bee colonies to four quantities of pollen, four quantities of nectar and three feeding frequencies of pollen. The study documented an inverse relationship between larvae and workers to resource type and availability. In addition, the type of larval mortality displayed by colonies, larval ejection or within clump mortality, was dependent on worker mortality.

The main driving force of the thesis is the knowledge of the numerous anthropogenic impacts. Today, only scarce information is available in the Espírito Santo Estuary (ESE) in southern Mozambique on the effects of pollutants. Links between behavioural disruption and neurological dysfunction, such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition has been shown to be the most responsive biochemical biomarker at sites influenced by agricultural, urban and industrial activities. In Paper I, the enzymatic inhibition of AChE and butyrylcholineesterase (BChE) was measured in tissues (brain, liver and hepatopancreas) from barred mudskipper fish (Periophthalmus argentilineatus), Jarbua fish (Terapon jarbua), Indian white prawn (Penaeus indicus) and the clam Meretrix meretrix. In general, all species showed a significant decrease in the enzymatic activities. For M. meretrix the inhibition of BChE was most evident. In water of the Infulene River, tributary of ESE, 12 pesticides were found. Besides the contaminants having a direct effect on burrowing behaviour, they also cause a sublethal physiological stress, reducing metabolic activity, growth rate and reproduction. In Paper II, integrated physiological assays were applied by using the scope for growth (SFG) method and condition index (CI) as tools for assessing the metabolic state in M. meretrix from the ESE and Incomati estuary (which is used as a comparison site). Low values of SFG (<5 J h−1 g−1), as well as the low CI (that ranged from 0.80 ± 0.02 to 1.62 ± 0.10) in both investigated areas show symptoms of stress and impact of pollution as reflected in the clam M. meretrix.

The goal of the research presented was not only to address this issue but also to develop new analytical methods that were more suitable for in vivo study using MD and SPME. A new calibration method called kinetic microdialysis was developed for in vivo sampling. Two MD probes with different flow rates were simultaneously inserted into the symmetric parts of sampling system. A simple empirical equation was proposed to calculate the analyte concentrations in the sample matrix using two different dialysate concentrations. Several factors that influenced the correction factor in this equation were discussed. An excellent correlation was observed between the calculated and theoretical value. This method was subsequently applied for in vivo sampling, for the measurement of pesticide allocation in the different leaves of a jade plant (Crassula ovata). Compared to the other reported MD calibration methods, this novel approach offers several advantages including simplicity, speed, robustness, and increased accuracy. The on-fiber standardization technique for solid-coated SPME was studied and a theoretical model is proposed for the isotropic behavior of adsorption and desorption, based on Fick’s law of diffusion and the Langmuir model. The isotropy of the adsorption and desorption of analytes onto and from the surface of porous solid SPME fiber was validated with the use of a commercially available fiber, a 50 um carbowax/templated resin (CW/TPR) for carbamate pesticide analysis in various in vitro sample matrices. Time constants were comparable for the adsorption and desorption processes. Equilibrium constants and fiber capacities were calculated with the Langmuir Isotherm Model. A kinetic method was developed to calibrate adsorption using desorption. This calibration corrected for the sample matrix effects and minimized displacement effects as a pre-equilibrium extraction. The technique was successfully applied to the analysis of pesticides in river water and white wine. This developed method could be potentially applied for in vivo study. A new kinetic calibration was developed using dominant pre-equilibrium desorption by SPME. The calibration was based on isotropism between absorption and desorption, which was proved theoretically and experimentally in an aqueous solution and semi-solid matrix. This approach allows for the calibration of absorption using desorption to compensate for matrix effects. Moreover, concentration profiles are initially proposed to verify isotropism between the absorption and desorption, while providing a linear approach to obtain time constants for the purpose of quantitative analysis. This linear approach is more convenient, robust and accurate than the non-linear version with the previously used time profiles. Furthermore, the target analytes are used as the internal standards, thus radioactive or deuterated internal standards are not necessary. In addition, dominant pre-equilibrium desorption utilizes the pre-equilibrium approach and offers a shorter sample preparation time, which is typically suitable for in vivo sampling. This kinetic calibration method was successfully applied to prepare samples of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a flow-through system and in vivo pesticide sampling in a jade plant (Crassula ovata). Previous field studies utilizing SPME predominantly focused on volatile compounds in air or water. Earlier in vivo sampling studies utilizing SPME were limited to liquid matrices, namely blood. In this study, SPME was developed for in vivo laboratory and field sampling of pharmaceuticals in fish muscle. Pre-equilibrium extraction was used to shorten in vivo sampling time. The use of pre-equilibrium desorption rates are proposed as a means to calibrate pre-equilibrium extractions. Excellent linearity was found between the free concentrations determined by SPME from the muscle of living fish and the waterborne concentrations of several pharmaceuticals. It is also firstly proposed a simple SPME method to determine free and total concentrations simultaneously in a living tissue using the known protein binding value. The utility of in vivo SPME sampling under field conditions was evaluated in wild fish collected from a number of different river locations under varying degrees of influence from municipal wastewater effluents. Diphenhydramine and diltiazem were detected in the muscle of fish downstream of a local wastewater treatment plant. Based on this study, SPME technique has demonstrated several important advantages for laboratory and field in vivo sampling. The development of a rapid, robust, easy to deploy technique which combines sampling, extraction and concentration into one step is a potentially important tool for use in vivo field-based sampling. MD and SPME methods have been developed and compared through in vitro and in vivo study. For in vitro study (juice, milk and orange jelly), both methods offered accurate and precise results (recovery: 88-105% with RSD < 15%) for complex sample matrices by standard addition method. The limits of quantification (LOQs) of the two methods developed were below the tolerance levels in milk set by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Compared to MD, the fully automated SPME procedure offered several advantages including high-throughput and more efficient sampling, less labor intensity, and capability for batch analysis. For in vivo study, kinetic calibrations were performed using retrodialysis and in-fiber standardization techniques for MD and SPME, respectively. Quantitative analysis was performed to measure pesticide concentrations in living tissue, i.e., the leaves of a living jade plant (Crassula ovata). Although both techniques provided sampling with minimal perturbation to the system under study, SPME was more sensitive, precise and accurate, suitable for field sampling and had a wider application than MD. It demonstrated that SPME has the potential to replace MD for in vivo study.",,,SOLID-PHASE MICROEXTRACTION;MICRODIALYSIS;IN VIVO STUDY;Chemistry;Microdialysis,NA,NA,comparison of microdialysis with solidphase microextraction for in vivo study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An improved understanding of the attitudes of farmers and conservationists would help ensure the most appropriate measures are adopted to resolve or avoid such conflict. This research therefore compared the attitudes of farmers and conservationists in Bedfordshire in two pairs of surveys. In the first, free-ranging interviews were used to establish the range of opinions on farming and conservation held by the two groups. In the second, Fishbein and Ajzen's theory of reasoned action was used as the framework for a more detailed comparison of the differences in attitudes between the two communities. The correlation of attitudes and social pressures with farmers' behaviour was also explored for three conservation-related activities about which there was conflict: hedge management, pesticide use and straw disposal. The first survey revealed a complex matrix of shared, complementary and conflicting beliefs and values between and within the two communities. Examples of conflicting values included those concerning land ownership and freedom of individual action versus stewardship, and pride in an efficient, productive and tidy farm versus a wilder countryside. The second survey showed that while farmers agreed with conservationists about the advantages of conservation expressed in general terms, once decisions about specific farm practices were involved, attitudes to conservation and wildlife were far outweighed by attitudes to farming and business considerations. Social pressures on farmers from conservationists were minimal; the strongest social pressures came from within the farming community itself and these generally served to perpetuate the dominant farming values.

Global climate change, urbanization, habitat fragmentation, and pollutants are all contributing to rapid and extensive environmental change and posing significant challenges to many species. An anthropogenic impact of growing concern is exposure to a class of contaminants known as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). EDCs are natural or synthetic compounds that interfere in some way with endogenous hormones responsible for maintaining and regulating myriad phenotypic traits. These contaminants enter aquatic environments through agricultural runoff, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and sewage overflow. They have been shown to alter morphology, physiology, and behavior in exposed organisms. Mangrove ecosystems are often retrofitted with WWTPs due to their natural ability to cycle nutrients; however, little is known of how EDC exposure impacts the organisms that inhabit mangroves. The mangrove rivulus fish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, is a mangrove specialist and a suitable organism in which to study the effects of EDC exposure. Here, I use environmentally relevant concentrations of two prevalent EDCs - ethinyl estradiol, the main synthetic estrogen in contraceptive, and nonylphenol, a widespread compound used in plastics and pesticides - to assess how exposure can alter morphology, physiology, and behavior in juvenile and adult mangrove rivulus, in compound-, dose-, and route-specific ways. I also measure the extent to which exposure alters phenotypic variance-covariance structure, which can inform us about how EDCs trigger coordinated changes in many phenotypic traits, and allows us to better assess how anthropogenic activities might induce opportunities for natural selection to act and drive evolutionary change.",,,Biology;Ecology;Toxicology;Phenotype,NA,NA,endocrine disruption in context dose compound and route of exposure interact to affect the multivariate phenotype in mangrove rivulus fish kryptolebias marmoratus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TM has been detected in surface waters at levels above aquatic life benchmarks and has raised concerns about its potential toxicity to fish. To address these concerns, the effects of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TM were determined in two fish species. Acute and chronic exposures to 0.02-163 μg TM/L were conducted in embryonic- and larval-stage fathead minnows and in embryonic-stage zebrafish. Endpoints to assess health and neurotoxicity were monitored throughout the duration of the exposure, including survival, hatching, foraging efficiency, embryonic motor activity, and predator escape behavior. TM-exposed fathead minnows experienced reductions in survival, changes to embryonic motor activity, and altered predator escape behavior while TM-exposed zebrafish embryos experienced reduced hatching rates and changes to the predator escape behavior. Lastly, molecular modeling was used to gain preliminary insight on the interactions of TM with the nAChR between organisms. While TM does not target fish, they still experience effects as a result of TM exposure. Taken together, this research indicates that further investigation of the effects of TM on fish is necessary to determine the impacts of this prevalent pesticide on the health of aquatic ecosystems.",,,Pesticides;Biology;Toxicity,NA,NA,evaluating the neurobehavioral toxicity of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam in two fish species,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Probability of encountering the net was proportional to the distance travelled by fish, and a corrected size distribution improved the use of the model. Harvest of a surplus of large fish could be achieved by: (1) increasing the number of commercial nets in the 65-105 mm mesh size and (2) using a broader range of mesh sizes.

Evidence exists that many non target animals in and around agricultural areas are at risk of being affected due to the mobile nature of pesticides and the intermittent nature of pesticide application. The extent to which non-target animals are affected by exposure to two organophosphates (azinphos-methyl and chlorpyrifos) was investigated through monitoring selected biomarker responses and life cycle effects under laboratory conditions in two selected test species. A representative species from both the aquatic and terrestrial environment was used as these two compartments of the environment are inevitably linked due to the mobility of pesticides from the area of application to surrounding areas. The earthworm Eisenia fetida was used as test organism in the terrestrial environment while the fish Oreochromis mossambicus served as representative of the aquatic environment. Juvenile life stages of both species were subjected to standard acute toxicity tests which showed that for both species, juvenile life stages were more sensitive to both pesticides than adults. It was also illustrated that azinphos-methyl is more toxic than chlorpyrifos to both species. Both test species were also subjected to an intermittent exposure regime in order to assess the effects of repeated pesticide application on biomarker, life-cycle and behaviour responses. The results indicated that for similar exposure regimes, azinphos-methyl was more toxic to E. fetida than chlorpyrifos and detrimentally affected all endpoints investigated. The present study suggests that exposure concentration may have a more pronounced effect in inducing a toxic response than exposure interval, irrespective of the pesticide used. In addition to this, E. fetida was unable ...",,,Intermittent exposure;Organophosphate pesticides;Environmental aspects;Biomarkers;Fishes;Effect of pesticides on;Aquatic organisms;Life cycle effect;Earthworms;Dissertations;Zoology;Theses;Biological Markers;Organophosphates,NA,NA,the effects of organophosphate exposure on non target terrestrial and aquatic organisms following different exposure regimes linking biomarker responses and lifecycle effects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scientists apply new environmental knowledge either by improving existing simulation models or developing new ones. Technological advances, and the increasing availability of both models and the data required to run them, are potentially putting better information in the hands of environmental policy analysts, decision makers and land managers to solve environmental problems. A review of the literature, however, shows that each of this trio of Data–Model--Problem is scale dependent, and that this scale dependence can be very significant, potentially leading to the generation of information that is misleading or simply invalid. The research objective is to contribute to the area of spatial modelling by investigating how a best practice of applying environmental data and models, which considers the effects of scale, might be achieved. It is proposed that a systematic framework (dubbed the 'Scale Matcher') can be developed to identify and match the scale requirements of a problem with the scale limitations of spatial data and models. A bottom-up approach is taken by breaking scale into its constituent parts (extent, accuracy and precision), each of which is then analysed in some depth to understand the various ways in which scale can impact on data and simulation models. Each component of scale is quantified by identifying suitable metrics from the literature. Two new indices that take into account attribute imprecision are introduced. Spatial confusion measures the degree of overlap of the attribute values between mapunits. Colour purity measures the proportion of a map that is incorrectly shaded due to within-mapunit imprecision. Both measures can be calculated for continuous and categorical, raster and vector data, providing there is a parametric or empirical estimate of the distribution of sub-mapunit variability. The Scale Matcher comprises a set of 11 comparisons, derived from a systematic match between each combination of the scale components of data, model, and problem. Each match is named and described. In some cases the matches are simple comparisons of the relevant metrics. Others require the combination of data variability and model sensitivity to be investigated. By randomly simulating data and model imprecision and inaccuracy, sensitivity analysis can then be used to identify scales over which scale effects are minor or stable. The Scale Matcher procedure is specified in a flowchart format that leads the user through the relevant sequence of matches. Listing the results as a set of scale assumptions helps to draw attention to them making users more aware of the limitations of spatial modelling. The Scale Matcher is evaluated by assessing scale compatibility in a case study of nitrate leaching vulnerability. Some hypothetical examples are used to verify other routes through the procedure. The case study requires the development of some new representations of soil imprecision and inaccuracy, and loosely coupling a sensitivity analysis tool with a geographic information system. It was concluded that the scale-matching framework successfully broke down the scale issue into a series of comparisons, which, if performed should give the user more confidence in the scale validity of model output for a given problem. ; Unpublished ; Aalders, H.

Five pesticides among different chemical groups were evaluated including acibenzolar-S-methyl (SAR activator), metribuzin and napropamide (herbicides), propamocarb hydrochloride (fungicide) and thiamethoxam (insecticide). The experiments were performed under controlled conditions in liquid cultures and field soils at two application levels. For the determination of pesticide residues a new extraction method was developed and instrumental analysis was carried out by liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and a liquid chromatographic system coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The bacterial populations (CFU) were determined using serial dilutions technique and plating. The results revealed that the introduction of PGPR inocula in sterile conditions (liquid cultures and sterilized soil) significantly enhanced the degradation of certain pesticides. Acibenzolar-S-methyl added in liquid cultures of rhizobacteria was degraded between 58 to 100% in 24 hours and the strain B. pumilus SE34 showed the highest degradation rate. For the remaining pesticides, the inoculation with the PGPR strains degraded metribuzin, napropamide, propamocarb hydrochloride and thiamethoxam by 8-18%, 9-11%, 15-36% and 11-22%, respectively, within 72-h incubation. In sterile soil, acibenzolar-S-methyl exhibited similar behavior with rapid degradation and DT50 values <16.4 days in the PGPR treatments compared with > 34.2 days determined in the control.

Out of many wild species found in this area, the marine shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei was selected for this study as it is highly sensitive to a wide range of pollutants and because it is the principal marine shrimp for aquaculture in this region. L. vannamei plays an important ecological role in estuarine environments along this coast where it supports one of the most important fishery resources in Mexico. In this study, a tropical marine bioassay was developed to assess the toxicity of pesticides in the shrimp L. vannamei. A flow-through system (FTS) was designed to provide the optimal conditions for shrimp juveniles, which were individually placed in cages to evaluate the moulting rate and behaviour during the experiments, as well as mortality. The FTS was a simple apparatus, consisting of a 16-channel peristaltic pump which delivered the test solution from reservoirs into exposure chambers under controlled conditions (flow rate, temperature and photoperiod). Time-independent exposures were carried out in flow-through conditions for the organophosphate pesticide methyl-parathion, and a triazole-derivative fungicide in two preparations: Tilt (commercial formulation, 25% propiconazole) and technical grade propiconazole. The threshold median lethal concentrations (threshold LC50) were determined for methyl-parathion (4.4 μgJ\ Tilt (1137 μgJ1), and propiconazole (1716 μgJ1). During these tests, the comparative toxicity of the pesticides was examined, and in particular, the toxic contribution of propiconazole in the commercial formulation, Tilt, was established. The toxicity data of each one of the toxicants was also used to assess the interactive toxicity for each form of the fungicide (technical grade and formulation) with methyl-parathion. When methyl-parathion was combined with Tilt, a less than additive effect was found.

The major focus of the studies presented here is on the impairment of the relatively exposed olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), since their functionality is critical to several indispensable behaviours. The responses of OSNs to various behaviourally-relevant odorants were impaired following exposure to several pesticide classes, including triazine (e.g. atrazine), carbamate (e.g. IPBC), organophosphorus (e.g. dimethoate), and phenylurea (e.g. linuron) pesticides, as well as a pesticide formulation (i.e. Roundup). In many cases, within minutes of exposure to environmentally realistic (part per billion) concentrations, impairments of greater than 50% in OSN responses were noted. Pesticides can selectively affect different OSN classes, since one pesticide (linuron) negatively affected amino acid but not bile salt responses. Lengthy (four-day) exposure to a mixture of pesticides modelled after that found in the Nicomekl River (British Columbia) also reduced OSN responses, confirming that pesticide mixtures found in salmon-producing waterways may be injurious. In fact, the ability to discern a change in odorant intensity was reduced by 25%. This may have partially been due to inadequate neuroprotection, as glutathione-S-transferase, an enzyme that protects against cellular damage, was not upregulated to any greater of an extent than it was in fish given a 10-fold lower exposure concentration. To relate changes in OSN responses to behavioural responses, experiments were conducted on two olfactory-mediated behaviours: an amino acid-evoked searching behaviour, and an anti-predator alarm response. In the first case, exposure to three different pesticides disproportionately impacted searching behaviour with respect to neurological impairment, as the searching response was completely eliminated at greater than 60% impairment of neurological response. In the second case, the freezing behaviour salmon perform after detecting harm in a conspecific was progressively reduced with exposure to increasing concentrations of a carbamate. The work here endeavoured to assess how pesticides affect salmon neurophysiology, then relate the effects to altered behaviours, and finally place the findings within a context of environmental realism, regulations, and the status of salmon within Canada and the world.",,,Pesticides,NA,NA,neurotoxicity of pesticides to salmon physiology to ethology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rayyan-1227190721,Socio-economic and Environmental Impacts of Technological Change in Bangladesh Agriculture,1998,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,THES,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/5433,en,,,"Widespread controversies exist on the delayed consequences of technological change or ‘Green Revolution’ technology in agriculture largely due to the approach utilized in the evaluation process and the extent of issues covered. Early evaluations, focussing on issues of production, employment, and income only, failed to account for the delayed consequences of technological change on regional variations, gender equity, poverty and the environment. The present study employed a holistic approach to evaluate the impacts of technological change in agriculture, specifically, on productivity, employment, gender equity, income distribution, poverty and the environment at the local level and on regional development, aggregate crop production and foodgrain sustainability at the national level. The overall hypothesis is that though modern agricultural technology increased production, employment and income, it has exacerbated income inequality, poverty, gender gap in employment, regional disparity and environmental degradation and is threatening food production sustainability. In this context, the research is designed with a blend of economic (crop input-output), biophysical (soil fertility) and behavioral (farmers’ perception) analyses to capture the diverse issues (employment, income, income distribution, poverty and environment). Database of the study consists of time-series data for 47 years (1948 – 1994) and farm-level cross-section data of cropyear 1996 collected from three agro-ecological regions including soil samples from representative locations and information on infrastructural facilities. Economic principles and concepts are used as the basic tools of analysis and hypotheses are empirically tested using quantitative as well as qualitative techniques. The results of the analyses validated the concerns raised at the outset of the study. At the national level, though technological change played a significant role in raising regional agricultural development level, it has also contributed significantly to regional disparity with most regions being stagnant and underdeveloped over the past 20 years. Technological change also significantly contributed to aggregate crop productivity over the past 30 years. Returns to scale estimation using conventional factors revealed that ‘constant return to scale’ prevails in Bangladesh agriculture. Incorporation of technological and infrastructural factors in the estimation revealed ‘increasing returns to scale’. But, declining productivity of modern rice, the major vehicle of technological change, is raising doubts on sustaining food production. The current increase in food production is largely due to switching from local to modern rice varieties and may not be sustainable in the long run. Trend analyses of 47 years of foodgrain (rice and wheat) production revealed that productivity is reaching a saturation value of 2,200 kg/ha, raising doubts on food production sustainability to meet the growing demand for food. Farm-level analysis of farmers’ response to price changes revealed that probability of adopting modern technology increases with output price rise and decreases with input price rise. Intensity of modern technology adoption is higher in underdeveloped regions. Farmers have moderately inelastic response to price changes for foodgrain crops and highly elastic response for non-cereal crops. Consideration of the possibility of switching between local and modern foodgrain varieties, that is, allowing movement along a ‘meta-production function’ improved the elasticity estimates for foodgrain crops. Highly elastic response is observed for soil fertility improvement in foodgrain production and inelastic response for non-cereal crops. The response to infrastructural development and education work in opposite direction for these crop groups. While infrastructure development and farmers’ education level increase input demand and output supply of non-cereal crops, these decreases input demand and output supply of foodgrain. At the local level, although modern agricultural technology significantly increased employment, input demand, prices and crop incomes, the gain from employment remained skewed in favor of men and income in favor of large/medium farmers. Also, significantly lower wage is paid to female labor, if hired, indicating further discrimination against women. Land and other resource owners are the highest beneficiaries of technological change. Production of modern varieties alone contributes 35% to total income inequality, thereby, indicating unexpected adversity of modern technology on income distribution. Poverty is estimated to be highest in ‘high adopter villages’ with 63% of population below poverty line, thus, reinforcing the unexpected adversity associated with technological change. ‘Declining soil fertility’, ‘effect on human health’, ‘reduction of fish catch’, and ‘increase in insect, pest and disease attacks’ are the major environmental impacts of technological change identified in the study regions as perceived by farmers. Soil fertility positively influences prices, modern technology adoption, crop and agricultural income and negatively influences demand for labor, animal power and pesticides, and non-agricultural income. Infrastructure development also positively influences prices and non-agricultural income and negatively influences technology adoption and input demand (except animal power and agricultural credit). The ‘medium adopter’ villages characterized by diversified cropping system, larger with land endowment (0.96 ha/farm), better soil fertility and developed rural infrastructure revealed least income inequality and incidence of poverty. The gini-ratio of per capita income is estimated at 0.34 for the ‘medium adopter’ villages as compared to 0.44 and 0.45 for the ‘high adopter’ and ‘low adopter’ villages, respectively. Findings of this study, therefore, establish the superiority of ‘medium adopter’ villages with respect to distributional implications and challenge the conventional notion that high level of modern technology diffusion is the key to agricultural development and economic growth. Rather, a diversified cropping system including medium level of modern variety adoption yields higher income and causes least inequality and poverty. Therefore, based on the study results, an integrated agricultural development planning model comprising of six components: (1) limited modern technology diffusion, (2) crop diversification, (3) soil fertility management, (4) rural infrastructure development, (5) price policy and (6) economic diversification to non-agricultural activities, is proposed. The first three components are interlinked and needs to be implemented simultaneously. The remaining three components will smoothen the process by: (a) enhancing effective input delivery and output marketing systems through developed infrastructure, (b) responding to price signals through appropriate pricing policies, and (c) engaging in other income generating activities through economic diversification. A policy of animal power and output price subsidy is suggested to curb price risk and promote crop diversification. Also, crop insurance policies, marketing, transportation and infrastructure development are suggested to reduce yield and marketing risks. Human resources development, intensification of bottom-up planning and collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are suggested as strategies to improve farmers’ technical skills. Integration and close coordination among facilitators: relevant government agencies, NGOs, financial institutes and the farmers are identified as the key to achieving the goal of sustainable agricultural development.",,,Bangladesh,NA,NA,socioeconomic and environmental impacts of technological change in bangladesh agriculture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only by gaining each activity in the environmental phase can we identify the principal exposure pathways. Current researchers estimate PCBs’ fugacity by making use of the conception of the empirical partition coefficient. However, the estimates remain doubtful. The thesis aims to accurately measure the PCBs’ activity in sediment and fish in Er-Jen River with solid phase microextraction （SPME）method. The research result reveals that the source of PCBs in Er-Jen River is the contaminated sediment. They were released to the water body. Through the equilibration between gills and water body, and food from lower trophic level than themselves, fish accumulate PCBs. The total activity of each fish species does not necessarily increase with the increase of trophic level.

However, the sub-lethal effects of pesticides on the behavior and ecology of fishes remain poorly understood. Therefore, the broad goal of this dissertation was to explore the behavioral and ecological consequences of sub-lethal pesticides on estuarine fishes, in addition to other environmental factors such as habitat structure and parasites. In Chapter 1, I investigated the separate and combined effects of an acute 4 h exposure of the pyrethroid pesticide esfenvalerate and structural habitat complexity on the behavior and predation risk of larval topsmelt, Atherinops affinis. Larvae were exposed to four nominal esfenvalerate concentrations (control, 0.12, 0.59, 1.18 ppb) before placement into 12 L mesocosms with a predator, the three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Artificial eelgrass was manipulated to create a uniform and patchy distribution of vegetative structure at a low (500 shoots per m2 ) and high density (1000 shoots per m2 ), in addition to the absence of eelgrass. The capture success of predators and aggregative behavior of prey was quantified during the first 10 min of each trial, and mortality of prey was recorded after 60 min. I observed an increase in the proportion of swimming abnormalities of larvae exposed to esfenvalerate. Surprisingly, prey mortality did not increase linearly with pesticide exposure but increased with habitat structure (density of eelgrass), which may have been a consequence of compensating predator behavior. The degree of prey aggregation decreased with both habitat structure and iv pesticide exposure, suggesting that anti-predator behaviors by prey may have been hampered by the interactive effects of both of these factors. In addition to behavioral consequences, sub-lethal pesticide exposure can predictably alter different physiological endpoints.

I sought to characterize the impacts of chemical disturbance events occurring at multiple levels of biological organization in anthropogenically impacted freshwater ecosystems.I first evaluated the lethality and sublethal effects of two pesticides: imidacloprid (IMI) and chlorantraniliprole (CHL), as single compounds and binary mixtures, on invertebrates (Daphnia magna) and fish (Pimephales promelas). To explore the effects of complex mixtures, I also conducted exposures as described above on contaminated surface water samples collected near agricultural fields associated with the Salinas River Watershed CA (USA). Analytical chemistry data from surface water samples showed chemicals of emerging concern as common analytes at levels expected to cause detrimental effects on aquatic life. I measured acute toxicity in invertebrates exposed to field-collected surface water, and fish exposed to these water samples had significant changes in expression of genes (RT-qPCR) involved with detoxification and neuromuscular function. Exposure of fish to single compounds or binary mixtures of IMI and CHL led to increased relative gene expression of ryanodine receptors (RyR) in fish. Furthermore, IMI targeted the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in aquatic invertebrates and CHL caused overactivation of RyR in invertebrates and fish. Overall, high levels of invertebrate toxicity and impacts to neuromuscular health in fish are occurring, and pesticides of emerging concern result in detrimental effects in both invertebrates and fish.Based on these findings, I examined behavioral endpoints in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) after the surface water exposures outlined above. I detected differences in both light-induced startle responses and average total distance moved (mm/s), as well as the duration and/or frequency of cruising, bursting and freezing endpoints. These behaviors directly relate to factors influencing survival, feeding and growth, as well as potential for predator avoidance, and thus changes induced by chemical exposure contribute to ecological risk. I detected sublethal and environmentally relevant effects from exposure to contaminated surface waters, which would likely be missed in standard toxicology assessments based on mortality, illustrating the importance of incorporating sublethal endpoints in risk assessments. I then examined behavioral effects of exposure to contaminated surface water before and after a disturbance event (a “first flush” rainstorm at the end of a dry period). I postulated that the swimming behavior of D. magna would be a sensitive bioindicator of exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides of concern (IMI and CHL) under laboratory conditions as well as within complex mixtures in contaminated surface waters. I determined that average total distance moved is a sensitive endpoint for pesticide exposure. Daphnia magna response to light stimulus was the most sensitive endpoint measured. In exposures conducted before the first flush event, I detected strong dose-response patterns, with exposed organisms showing a significantly reduced response compared to controls. After first flush, I measured hypoactivity for all sites. I detected different response patterns to light stimulus for each site tested: negative dose-response, non-monotonic, and positive dose-response patterns, with significantly different responses from controls at all concentrations tested.Having determined sublethal and toxic effects from organismal exposure to water samples collected from the Salinas River Watershed, I sought to evaluate how aquatic biodiversity may be distributed across a chemically impacted watershed, and how diversity estimates obtained from both eDNA metabarcoding and morphological identification would correlate with biotic index scores. I collected eDNA from sediment at sites throughout the Salinas River Watershed, across a range of habitat qualities, and compared the resulting taxonomy with morphological data from a subset of high-diversity sites. I detected sensitive invertebrate taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera; EPT) from morphology and eDNA, with significant overlap (> 76.67%) between methods, but some taxa were missing from the sequence database, highlighting the importance of taxonomic database development. Sequencing detected more benthic macroinvertebrate taxa than morphology when compared at the genus and species levels of taxonomic resolution. Metabarcoding of sampled eDNA detected rare species of concern and invasive species. Impacted sites contained greater numbers of species known to be tolerant to poor water quality, whereas I only detected several sensitive EPT taxa from least impacted reference sites. Hydrologic distance (waterbody) and biotic index score both accounted for > 27% of the dissimilarity in taxa measured between sites. These findings suggest that biotic indices obtained from eDNA metabarcoding data can be effectively incorporated into watershed-wide, multitrophic assessments of freshwater biodiversity.Freshwater ecosystems in urban and agriculturally developed watersheds are simultaneously exposed to chemical mixtures often include new and emerging contaminants of concern, for which toxicological data may be limited. As the complexity of mixtures increases, non-targeted, effect-based evaluations become necessary for determining potential detrimental outcomes. Through my dissertation work I demonstrate that subcellular, organismal and community level effects are induced by pesticides of concern present in surface water.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

One stressor is the salinization of fresh water from road deicing salt. Huge increases in road salt application over the decades have increased the salinity of typically low-salt ecosystems. Studies have investigated the effects of road salt at the organismal and community level, however many focus on single organism lethality or single stressors. Many questions remain including those about evolved tolerance and subsequent trade-offs, road salt alternatives, invasive species, and the interaction of multiple stressors. The goal of my dissertation was to investigate the evolutionary and ecological effects of road salt.First, I investigated whether organisms can adapt to road salt. Zooplankton species in the genus Daphnia can adapt to other chemicals including pesticides, heavy metals, and brackish water (from seawater intrusion). Therefore, I hypothesized that Daphnia pulex populations exposed to road salt evolve increased salt tolerance. To test this, D. pulex were exposed to a no-salt control (15 mg Cl-/L). and sodium chloride (NaCl) road salt (100 - 1000 mg Cl-/L) for 2.5 months in outdoor mesocosms. After this exposure and a period of indoor husbandry, I exposed D. pulex to a no-salt control (30 mg Cl-/L) and high salinities (1300 - 1900 mg Cl-/L) in a time-to-death assay. I found that D. pulex populations evolve increased salt tolerance. Since Daphnia consume phytoplankton and are a food resource for many fish species, evolved tolerance might be vital for road salt contaminated communities.Second, I investigated the consequences of evolved salt tolerance. Contaminant exposure, including salt, results in a variety of genetic and physiological consequences. Some contaminants can even disrupt the circadian rhythm. Therefore, I hypothesized that the evolution of road salt tolerance alters the circadian rhythm, as well as other important genes. Using salt-tolerant D. pulex produced in the previous experiment, I completed qRT-PCR on samples from a 24- and 48- hr time course. I found that the control population exhibited a ~20-hr rhythm in period, a core clock gene. D. pulex populations previously exposed to moderate concentrations of NaCl were similar to the control, while high salt populations exhibited an ablated rhythm. Additionally, moderate and high salt populations also exhibited increases in clock (a core clock gene), actin, and a subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump (involved in salt tolerance). Therefore, the evolution of salt tolerance comes with diverse genetic consequences. These trade-offs could affect a variety of bodily functions, as well as Daphnia’s ability to perform important daily activities.Third, I investigated the salt tolerance of an invasive mollusk, the Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea), which is found in a variety of habitats that vary in salinity. Since most freshwater organisms are more tolerant to NaCl than to other chloride-based alternatives, I hypothesized that Asian clams are more tolerant to NaCl road salt than to calcium chloride (CaCl2) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2). I also predicted Asian clams would be relatively tolerant to all salts given their tolerance to other stressors. I performed a 4-day and 8-day LC50 experiment using the three different road salts. I found that Asian clams were extremely tolerant to NaCl road salt with an estimated LC504-day > 22,581 mg Cl-/L. The estimated LC504-day for MgCl2 and CaCl2 were significantly lower, but still high at 2162 and 3554 mg Cl-/L, respectively. After 8 days, the estimated LC50’s for NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 were 10,069, 2235, and 1769 mg Cl-/L, respectively. The high salt tolerance of Asian clams allows them to be easily transported in ballast water and to invade a variety of saline habitats. Additionally, they will be more resistant to road salt contamination, which might allow them to outcompete native species.Lastly, I investigated the interactive effects of invasive bivalves and CaCl2 road salt on native freshwater communities. CaCl2 road salt can enter fresh water where it might serve as a source of calcium. The calcium concentrations of a water body can determine the success of invasive bivalves and their impacts on freshwater communities. I hypothesized that invasive bivalves, in the absence of increased CaCl2, remove phytoplankton via filtration and reduce zooplankton and native clams via competition; but they increase benthic algae via excretion. I also hypothesized low to moderate concentrations of CaCl2 benefit native mollusks and result in few negative consequences to the community. Lastly, I hypothesized that CaCl2 increases invasive bivalve biomass and density, which results in a greater negative impact on native communities from invasive bivalves. To investigate these hypotheses, I conducted an outdoor mesocosm study with invasive Asian clams and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), as well as native organisms, all exposed to CaCl2 (35 - 187 mg Ca2+/L). I found that invasive bivalves decreased phytoplankton, periphyton, zooplankton, and native clams, but increased filamentous algae and isopods. Zebra mussel survived poorly across all CaCl2 concentrations, but 91 and 187 mg Ca2+/L substantially reduced Asian clam survival. The reduction in survival, in turn, reduced impacts of Asian clams on other species in the community. The highest CaCl2 treatment also reduced zooplankton densities. Therefore, CaCl2 did not promote invasive species and more research is needed to understand the substantial differences in tolerance of Asian clams in lab versus mesocosm experiments.Overall, this thesis goes beyond the traditional single-organism, naïve-tolerance toxicity tests to enhance the road salt literature about what might be occurring in our freshwater ecosystems. The evolution of salt tolerance might mitigate some of the effects of salinization, however it may come with unfavorable consequences to important genes that influence a variety of daily functions and behaviors. It remains unknown whether organisms can evolve tolerance to NaCl alternatives and, if so, if there are any associated consequences. It is always the hope that alternatives to common chemicals will improve not only the lives of humans, but also the health of the environment. Thus far, however, chloride-based NaCl road salt alternatives have not shown to be safer for the environment. While some of these alternatives come with vital nutrients, their toxicities exceed the toxicity of NaCl. For invasive species, it is reassuring that road salt alternatives with vital ions might not facilitate their invasions. However, for native species, it means that chloride-based alternatives will not diminish the threat of freshwater salinization but rather, alternatives might increase the consequences. While much more research is needed on freshwater salinization from road salt, these studies open up new avenues of research that will ultimately help preserve fresh water.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

These contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) include personal care products and pharmaceuticals (PPCPs), perfluorinated compounds, natural and synthetic hormones, alkylphenol and alkylphenol ethoxylate surfactants, current-use pesticides, and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants. Currently, the types and concentrations of these emerging contaminants entering Puget Sound, and their effects on aquatic receptors, are poorly understood. Recent reports in numerous species of fish indicate exposure to CECs can cause sublethal, detrimental effects on growth, reproduction, and behavior, warranting development of biomarkers of exposure and effect of CECs in relevant biomonitoring species. There is evidence to suggest that numerous CECs negatively affect mitochondrial function in humans and laboratory animal models. Hence, the overarching hypothesis of my doctoral research was that mitochondrial dysfunction can serve as an indicator of sublethal effect, and exposure to, emerging contaminants.    Both human health- and aquatic health-related effects of CECs on mitochondrial function were addressed in my dissertation project. Aim 1 of my project was an oceans and human health study concerning the safety of salmon consumption by humans. The tested hypothesis was that the antioxidant effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in salmon chemoprotect against mitochondrial and oxidative injury from a common “emerged” contaminant detected in Pacific salmon, the PBDE flame retardant 2,2’,4,4’-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 47). HepG2 cells were treated for 12 h with a mixture of omega-3s relevant to salmon consumption (oxEPA/oxDHA), followed by exposure to BDE 47 (100 μM) for 24 h. Pretreatment with oxEPA/oxDHA prevented BDE 47-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of GSH, significantly increased expression of protective cellular antioxidant response genes, and protected against BDE 47-induced loss of viability and mitochondrial membrane potential. Analysis of mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) revealed extensive inhibition of state 3 respiration and maximum respiratory capacity by BDE 47 were partially reversed by treatment with oxEPA/oxDHA. These findings indicated that the antioxidant effects of salmon omega-3s protected against short exposures to BDE 47, including a protective role of these compounds on maintaining cellular and mitochondrial function.    The subsequent goal of my research was to examine the potential impacts of CECs in Puget Sound aquatic organisms. Thus, studies in Aim 2 involved an analytical field study to determine the specific types of CECs present in Puget Sound, and their potential to bioaccumulate in representative biomonitoring species. Samples of estuary water, WWTP effluent, and whole-bodies of Chinook salmon and staghorn sculpin were collected from three sites: two estuaries that receive effluent from WWTPs and a minimally-polluted estuarine reference site. Samples were analyzed for 150 chemical analytes by HPLC/MS/MS. In total, 81 analytes were detected in effluent samples in the ng/L to low µg/L range, 25 analytes were detected in estuary water samples at ng/L concentrations, and 42 analytes were detected in fish whole-bodies at ng/g concentrations. Noteworthy findings included high concentrations of CECs measured in WWTP effluent relative to other major U.S. WWTPs, greater-than-expected contamination of the reference site, and preferential bioaccumulation of CECs in Chinook salmon relative to sculpin. These results can inform environmental risk assessment or ecological studies at other sites in Puget Sound.    The analytical field study provided crucial data that was required to conduct subsequent experiments in Aim 3 that investigated the association between exposure to CECs and liver mitochondrial dysfunction in fish. Mitochondrial function was assessed in feral juvenile Chinook from the analytical field study, and in hatchery-reared juvenile Chinook exposed in the laboratory to a dietary mixture of CECs representative of the predominant contaminants detected in the field. Liver mitochondrial content was reduced in fish exposed to CECs in the laboratory, which occurred concomitantly with a reduction in expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ coactivator-1a (pgc-1α), a positive transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. The laboratory exposures also caused elevation of state 4 respiration per unit mitochondria, which drove a reduction of efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation relative to controls. The mixture-induced elevation of respiration was associated with increased oxidative injury as evidenced by increased mitochondrial protein carbonyls, elevated expression of glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 ( gpx4), a mitochondrial-associated GSH peroxidase that protects against lipid peroxidation, and reduction of mitochondrial GSH. Juvenile Chinook sampled in from a WWTP effluent-impacted estuary with demonstrated releases of CECs showed similar trends toward reduced liver mitochondrial content and elevated respiratory activity per mitochondria (including state 3 and uncoupled respiration).

Chemical similarities between OP pesticides and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), a class of compounds growing in use and environmental relevance, have produced concern regarding whether developmental exposures to OPFRs and OP pesticides may share behavioral outcomes, impacts on dopaminergic systems, or both. Methods: Using the zebrafish animal model, we exposed developing fish to two OPFRs, TDCIPP and TPHP, as well as the OP pesticide chlorpyrifos, during the first 5 days following fertilization. From there, the exposed fish were assayed for behavioral abnormalities and effects on monoamine neurochemistry as both larvae and adults. An experiment conducted in parallel examined how antagonism of the dopamine system during an identical window of development could alter later life behavior in the same assays. Finally, we investigated the interaction between developmental exposure to an OPFR and acute dopamine antagonism in larval behavior. Results: Developmental exposure to all three OP compounds altered zebrafish behavior, with effects persisting into adulthood. Additionally, exposure to an OPFR decreased the behavioral response to acute D2 receptor antagonism in larvae. However, the pattern of behavioral effects diverged substantially from those seen following developmental dopamine antagonism, and the investigations into dopamine neurochemistry were too variable to be conclusive. Thus, although the results support the hypothesis that OPFRs, as with OP pesticides such as chlorpyrifos, may present a risk to normal behavioral development, we were unable to directly link these effects to any dopaminergic dysfunction.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

To investigate the possible contribution of maternally transferred persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to this decline, this study measured temporal variations in the toxicity of complex organic mixtures extracted from LO eels captured in 1988, 1998 and 2008 to Fundulus heteroclitus embryos exposed by intravitelline (IVi) injection. To identify the most toxic compounds accumulated by eels and to characterize their embryotoxic effects, F. heteroclitus embryos were exposed by IVi injection to sublethal doses of various POPs historically measured in LO fish tissues, including dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) (TCDD, PCB126, PCB77 and 2,3 ,4,7,8-PnCDF), non-dioxin-like (NDL) PCBs (PCB52 and PCB 110) and also to a complex mixture of PCBs, Aroclor 1254.All DLCs as weil as Aroelor 1254 caused craniofacial deformities, a dose-responsive reduction of larval growth and prey capture ability without alteration of basal locomotor activity, and induction of ethoxyresorutin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in F. heteroclitus larvae. None of these responses was induced by the two NDL PCBs. The dose-response relationships for EROD activity for PCB 126, 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF and TCDD had similar slopes and the relative potencies (RePs) of PCB126 and 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF to TCDD for EROD activity were estimated at 0.71 and 2.40, respectively. They were approximately and respectively 140- and 5-fold higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) TCDD equivalency factors (TEFs) of PCB126 and 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF for fish , which are based on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) embryolethality data. These results suggest that relative potencies are species-specific and that the current ReP for PCB126 and 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF underestimates their toxicity for some fish species.The slopes of the dose-response relationships for prey capture ability for PCB126 and 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF were steeper than for TCDD, suggesting different pathways of effects. Expression levels of several genes were also studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) following exposure to single doses of TCDD or PCB 126 (1280 and 1250 pg g-1 wet weight, respectively) causing similar EROD induction. A different pattern of responses was observed between PCB 126 and TCDD : PCB 126 appeared to induce antioxidant responses by inducing sod2 expression, while TCDD did not. It suggests that these two compounds act through different mechanisms to produce behavioral alterations in F. heteroclitus larvae, and that oxidative stress may be a key factor in the case of PCB 126.The 1988 and 1998 eel ex tracts were the most toxic, causing a pattern of sublethal embryotoxic responses similar to those reported in F. heteroclitus embryos exposed to previously cited DLCs or to Aroelor 1254 : stunted growth, craniofacial deformities, induction of EROD activity, and reduced predatory capacities of larvae. The potency of these extracts declined over time : the only significant effect of 2008 eel ex tracts was EROD induction. Other POPs measured in eel extracts (NDL PCBs, PBDEs and organochlorinated pesticides) did not appear to be important agonistic contributors to the observed toxicity. Due to the combination of its concentrations and its high ReP compared to TCDD in F. heteroclitus early life stages (ELS), PCB 126 was probably the most important contributor to the overall embryotoxicity observed with Aroelor 1254 or eel extracts. However, as observed with Aroelor 1254, the chemically derived TCDD-TEQs of eel extracts, calculated using measured concentrations of some DLCs and their RePs for F. heteroclitus ELS, overestimated their potency to induce EROD activity possibly due to interactions among POPs.The toxicity of the complex mixtures of POPs accumulated by LO eels may have been underestimated as a result of several factors, including the loss of POPs during ex tracts preparation and the non-assessment of their potential long-term effects. In addition to the interspecific differences in terms of sensitivity to TCDD documented in the literature, our results demonstrates that interspecific differences also exist for TEFs. Thus, there is uncertainty in the prediction of the toxicity of complex mixtures of DLCs to A. rostrata from data obtained with other species. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that contamination of LO with DLCs may have represented a threat for the American eel population through ecologically relevant effects such as altered larval prey capture ability. These results prioritize the need to assess ELS toxicity of DLCs in Anguilla species, to investigate long-term or delayed effects of complex eel ex tracts to ELS of fish and to further develop biomarkers to assess potential effects in eel ELS col1ected in the field.Alternate abstract:Le recrutement des juvéniles de l'anguille d'Amérique (Anguilla rostrata) vers le lac Ontario (LO), Canada, a décliné drastiquement depuis les années 1980. Afin d'explorer la contribution possible à ce déclin du transfert maternel des polluants organiques persistants (POP), la présente étude mesure les variations temporelles de la toxicité de mélanges organiques complexes extraits d'anguilles capturées dans le LO en 1988, 1998 et 2008, chez les embryons de Fundulus heteroclitus exposés par injection intravitelline (IVi). Afin d'identifier les composés les plus toxiques accumulés par les anguilles et de caractériser leurs effets embryotoxiques, des embryons de F. heteroclitus ont été exposés par injection IVi à des doses sous-létales de plusieurs POP historiquement mesurés dans les tissus des poissons du LO, incluant certains composés apparentés aux dioxines (TCDD, BPCI26, BPC77 et 2,3,4,7,8- PnCDF), des BPC non-coplanaires (BPC52 et BPCI10) ainsi qu'à un mélange technique de BPC, ]' Aroclor 1254. Tous les composés apparentés aux dioxines ainsi que l'Aroclor 1254 ont causé des malformations crânio-faciales, une réduction dose-dépendante de la croissance larvaire et de la capacité de prédation sans altération de l'activité locomotrice de base, ainsi qu'une induction de l'activité de l'ethoxyrésorufine-O-dééthylase (EROD) chez les larves de F. heteroclitus. Aucune de ces réponses n'a été observée avec les BPC non-coplanaires. Les relations doseréponse pour l'activité EROD pour la TCDD, le BPCl26 et le 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF avaient des pentes similaires et les potentiels toxiques relatifs (PTR) du BPC126 et du 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF par rapport à la TCDD ont été estimés à 0.71 et 2.40, respectivement. Ils étaient respectivement environ 140 et 5 fois supérieurs aux facteurs d'équivalence toxique (FET) de référence de l'Organisation Mondiale de la Santé (OMS) pour ces deux composés chez les poissons, qui sont basés sur des données d' embryo-mortalité obtenues chez la truite arc-en-ciel (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Ces résultats suggèrent que les PTR sont spécifiques à chaque espèce et que les FET actuels du BPC126 et du 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF pourraient sous-estimer leurs potentiels toxiques chez certaines espèces de poissons.  Les pentes des relations dose-réponse pour la capacité de prédation étaient plus prononcées pour le BPC126 et le 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF par rapport à la TCDD, suggérant différentes voies d'effets. Le niveau d'expression de plusieurs gènes a également été mesuré par réaction en chaîne par polymérase quantitative (qPCR) à la suite d'expositions à des doses uniques de TCDD ou de BPC126 (1280 et 1250 pg g-1 de poids humide, respectivement) causant un même niveau d'induction EROD. Un patron de réponses différent a été observé entre le BPCl26 et la TCDD : le BPC126 a semblé induire des réponses anti-oxydantes par l'intermédiaire du gène sod2, mais pas la TCDD. Cela suggère que ces deux composés agissent selon des mécanismes différents pour induire les altérations comportementales observées chez les larves de F. heteroclitus, et que le stress oxydant est un facteur clef dans le cas du BPCI26. Les extraits d'anguille de 1988 et 1998 ont été les plus toxiques, provoquant un patron de réponses embryotoxiques sous-létales similaire à celui observé chez des embryons de F. heteroclitus exposés aux composés apparentés aux dioxines précédemment cités ou à l'Aroclor 1254 : retard de croissance, malformations crânio-faciales, induction de l'activité EROD et réduction de la capacité de prédation des larves. Le potentiel toxique des extraits a décliné avec le temps: le seul effet significatif observé avec les extraits de 2008 était l'induction de l' activité EROD. Les autres POP mesurés dans les extraits d' anguilles (BPC non-coplanaires, PBDE et pesticides organochlorés) n' ont pas semblé être d'importants contributeurs à l'embryotoxicité observée. En raison de la combinaison de ses concentrations élevées et de son PTR élevé par rapport à la TCDD chez les jeunes stades de vie de F. heteroclitus, le BPC 126 était probablement le plus important contributeur à l'embryotoxicité observée avec l'Aroclor 1254 et les extraits d' anguille. Néanmoins, comme cela a pu être observé avec l'Aroclor 1254, les EQT-TCDD dérivés des données chimiques, calculés à partir des concentrations de certains composés apparentés aux dioxines dans les extraits et de leurs PTR respectifs chez F. heteroclitus, ont surestimé la capacité des extraits à induire l'activité EROD, possiblement en raison d'interactions entre les différents POP. La toxicité des mélanges organiques complexes de POP accumulés par les anguilles du LO a pu être sous-estimée en raison de plusieurs facteurs, incluant les pertes chimiques durant la préparation des extraits, ainsi que l'absence d'évaluation de leurs effets à long terme. En plus de différences interspécifiques en termes de sensibilité à la TCDD déjà documentées dans la littérature, nos résultats démontrent qu ' il existe des différences interspécifiques de FEI. Il existe donc une incertitude quant à la prédiction de la toxicitié d' un mélange complexe de composés apparentés aux dioxines chez A. rostrata à partir de données obtenues chez d' autres espèces. Dans l' ensemble, nos résultats supportent l'hypothèse selon laquell e la contamination du LO par les composés apparentés aux dioxines aurait représenté une menace pour la population de l'anguille d'Amérique en altérant des paramètres pertinents d' un point de vue environnemental, telle que la capacité de prédation des larves. Ces résultats soulignent l'importance de tester l'embryotoxicité des composés apparentés aux dioxines chez les jeunes stades de vie des différentes espèces d' anguilles, d' explorer les effets à long terme d' extraits organiques d'anguilles sur les jeunes stades de vie des poissons et de développer des biomarqueurs pour évaluer les altérations potentielles chez les jeunes anguilles collectées sur le terrain. ","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

However, molecular mechanisms underlying this transition are largely unknown. Additionally, acclimation to hypersaline conditions enhances the acute toxicity of certain thioether organophosphate and carbamate pesticides in some species of euryhaline fish, yet sublethal impacts have been far less studied. The current study aimed to determine underlying molecular mechanisms of Pacific salmonid smoltification, as well as determine how hypersaline acclimation impacts acute and sublethal toxicity of a common organophosphate pesticide, chlorpyrifos (CPF). A transcriptomics approach was used to assess differential gene expression in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) liver, gills, and olfactory rosettes after salinity acclimation and found that the majority of the altered genes were tissue and salinity concentration dependent. From the few shared genes, a potential osmosenor was identified. Osmotic signal transduction cascades were also impacted in the three tissues. Salinity acclimation was then coupled with CPF to determine impacts on acute toxicity. Time to death of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by CPF was more rapid in freshwater than in hypersaline water (16 ppth). Salinity acclimation did not impact metabolism, precipitation, or acetylcholinesterase inhibition of CPF. In contrast, mRNA expression of certain neurological targets was upregulated in saltwater acclimated fish, consistent with diminished neuronal signaling which may protect fish from cholinergic overload associated with acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Sublethal experiments, which are more environmentally relevant, were conducted to determine impacts on olfaction. Combined acclimation and exposure to CPF impacted rainbow trout olfaction at the molecular, physiological, and behavioral levels. Concurrent exposure to hypersalinity and 0.5 µg/L CPF upregulated four genes that inhibit olfactory signal transduction. At the physiological level, hypersalinity and chlorpyrifos caused a decrease in sensory response to the amino acid L-serine and the bile salt taurocholic acid. Combined acclimation and exposure also negatively impacted behavior and reduced the avoidance of a predator cue (L-serine). Overall, these results will be very useful in risk assessment strategies evaluating compounds of this nature in estuarine environments and freshwater environments that may be altered by hypersaline stress or rising sea levels.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

rayyan-1227190746,Persistent locomotor and behavioral effects resulting from developmental exposure to pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin are mediated by dopaminergic and serotonergic system dysfunction,2014,NA,NA,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,978-1-321-54466-4,NA,3681582,167,"Kung, Tiffany Si-Chia and White, Lori A.",https://login.wwwproxy1.library.unsw.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/persistent-locomotor-behavioral-effects-resulting/docview/1654753057/se-2?accountid=12763,English,"Rutgers The State University of New Jersey, School of Graduate Studies     PP  - United States -- New Jersey",United States -- New Jersey,"Pyrethroid pesticides are generally considered to be a safer alternative to other classes of insecticides. However, there is increasing concern that children are more susceptible to the adverse effects of pesticides. The hypothesis tested in this thesis is that exposure to pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin, at concentrations below the LOAEL, during the critical developmental period would result in persistent behavioral deficits, which are due, in part, to changes in dopamine and serotonin system gene expression and neurochemistry. Zebrafish embryos were treated with deltamethrin (0.25 µg/L - 0.5 μg/L) during the embryonic period (3-72hpf), and then reared in treatment free water until the larval (2-week) and adult stages. Deltamethrin exposure during development resulted in increased locomotor activity, decreased drd1 and drd2a transcripts, and increased levels of dopamine (DA) metabolite, homovanillic acid, at the larval stage.  Manipulating the DA system by concomitant knockdown of the dopamine transporter (DAT) during exposure rescued deltamethrin induced locomotor activity. Acute methylphenidate (DAT inhibitor) exposure increased locomotor activity in control larvae but reduced locomotor activity in larvae previously exposed to deltamethrin. These studies indicate that dopaminergic dysfunction mediates the behavioral effects observed in larval zebrafish following deltamethrin exposure during development. Behavioral characterization of adult zebrafish revealed a sex specific response in fish that had been exposed to deltamethrin during development, including increased distance travelled, velocity, bouts of high mobility, and aggression in males, and increased swim velocity, thigmotaxis, and altered rates of habituation in females. In adult males, transcript levels of serta, sertb, and drd2a, positively correlated with the magnitude of aggression. However, this correlation was lost in the population of male fish that had been developmentally exposed to deltamethrin. Fluoxetine exposure attenuated aggression exhibited by dominant male zebrafish demonstrating the involvement of the serotonin system in mediating aggressive behavior. In conclusion, this research demonstrates that environmental influences during critical neurodevelopmental stages results in persistent neurobehavioral deficits. Also, we add to zebrafish ethology using the experimental behavioral paradigms adapted for our laboratory. Finally, we provide a mode of action for deltamethrin induced behavioral deficits which can assist in the cumulative risk assessment of this class of compounds.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Coinciding with this collapse, there was a significant decrease in zooplankton abundance in the SFE, including the critical prey items Eurytemora affinis and Pseudodiaptomus forbesi. Scientists have been unable to identify a single source of the collapse of the pelagic food web in the SFE.  Rather, they believe a combination of effects, including contaminant exposure and changes in water quality, are the cause of the pelagic organism decline. To determine a relationship between pesticide exposure and copepod survival, in chapter one I conducted a series of acute toxicity tests with E. affinis and  P. forbesi using five key pesticides (chlorpyrifos, fipronil, permethin, λ-cyhalothrin, and bifenthrin). The main conclusions of my first study were that  E. affinis and P. forbesi are sensitive to pesticides at environmental levels, E. affinis is more sensitive to pesticides than P. forbesi, and pyrethroids were the most toxic of the pesticides investigated.      In chapter one, I found baseline toxicities values of key pesticides to E. affinis and P. forbesi. However, these tests were conducted in clean water and may lack ecological significance.  In aquatic environments, organisms can be exposed to changes in water quality including variations in amount and type of organic and inorganic material, contaminants levels (e.g. toxic metals, pesticides), and physical characteristics (e.g. pH, salinity, temperature).  To    investigate the toxicity of surface ambient waters to E. affinis and P.forbesi, once per month for nine months, I sampled seven sites in the northern interior portion of the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta and exposed copepods for 96 hours. I found E. affinis and P. forbesi are sensitive to ambient waters collected from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and that conductivity, turbidity and metal concentrations were significant variables affecting copepod survival.      In chapter one bifenthrin was one of the most toxic of the pesticides investigated and in chapter two I found increasing copepod survival with decreasing turbidity. In chapter three I investigated the combination of these effects by exposing E. affinis and P. forbesi to bifenthrin in the presence of suspended solids from municipal wastewater effluent and surface water of the San Francisco Estuary.  Previous literature suggests the dissolved concentration of a pesticide in water is the best predictor of aquatic toxicity. In my study, the presence of suspended solids reduced the toxicity of bifenthrin to E. affinis and P. forbesi  by decreasing the bioavailable concentration of bifenthrin. However, the toxicity of bifenthrin to E. affinis and P. forbesi  was greater than expected from the dissolved concentration alone. An analysis of particle characteristics revealed high levels of fine particles (0.5-2 µm) resulted in greater than expected mortality. Direct ingestion of bifenthrin bound particles, changes in feeding behavior and direct of particles are all plausible explanation of increased toxicity to E. affinis  and P. forbesi.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

At the same time, partitioning controlled delivery (passive dosing; PD) techniques promise to overcome many of the challenges associated with toxicity testing of hydrophobic substances that may bias the interpretation of toxicity data. The present study investigated the feasibility of coupling silicone rubber passive sampling devices (SR-PSDs) with bioassay techniques for both chemical and ecotoxicological assessment of complex mixtures of organic contaminants in the aquatic environment. SR-PSDs were deployed in water at various locations within the Ythan catchment (north east, Scotland, UK), Forth estuary and the Firth of Forth (east coast of central Scotland, UK) for 7 to 9 weeks. Following retrieval, extracts from the SR-PSDs were analysed for dissolved concentrations of a variety of organic contaminants including PAHs and PCBs using GC-MS and GC-ECD respectively and were screened for a wide range of pesticides using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS. The extracts were further evaluated for acute cytotoxicity (i.e. neutral red uptake assay) and EROD induction potential using rainbow trout liver cell line (Oncorhynchus mykiss; RTL-W1) and for phytotoxicity and developmental toxicity potential using algal growth inhibition test (with a marine phytoplankton, Diacronema lutheri) and fish embryo toxicity test (with embryos from zebrafish Danio rerio) respectively. Overall, the individual and total dissolved concentrations of PAHs; parent and branched) and PCBs; measured in water from the Ythan, Forth estuary and Firth of Forth were relatively low compared with other studies using PSDs. A number and level of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides and fungicides of varying hydrophobicity (log KOWs 2.25 to 5.31) were detected in the silicone rubber (SR) extracts from the Ythan catchment, the Forth estuary and the Firth of Forth, suggesting input mainly from agricultural run-off and possibly from direct discharges. No statistically significant acute cytotoxicity was observed following 48 h exposure of RTL-W1 cells to SR extracts from the Ythan catchment. But, on a sublethal level, for every site, statistically significant EROD activity was observed to some degree following 72 h exposure. In addition, developmental and algal toxicities on embryos of D. rerio and D. lutheri respectively, were measured in all the deployed samples compared with the procedural controls (undeployed samples). Interestingly, extracts of SR-PSDs from the Forth estuary and the Firth of Forth exhibited growth inhibitions on D. lutheri that were similar to those of extracts from the Ythan, even though, fewer numbers of pesticides were detected in the Forth estuary and Firth of Forth than the Ythan. This suggests that pesticides were not solely responsible for the observed effects in the Ythan catchment. To further improve data from toxicity testing of hydrophobic substances, the study identified the use of SR O-rings as a suitable passive dosing format in in vitro toxicity tests and was partially validated through their use in dosing RTL-W1 cells with two individual PAHs and subsequently determining cytotoxicity and EROD-activity.","Copyright - “© Author.

The technique has been utilised effectively for many years for captive mammals in a variety of settings. However, until now it has never been considered as a way of improving the welfare of aquatic animals such as fish.Fish that are used in regulatory toxicology studies are at present maintained solely in barren tank environments. Little is known about how these types of environments affect the well-being of the animals residing there and whether they impact either physiological heath or behavioural repertoire. This thesis aims to address this gap in the knowledge regarding the potential for environmental enrichment to improve the welfare of fish used in regulatory toxicology. More specifically it looks at two types of enrichment and the effects of these on the commonly used model species, the zebrafish (Danio rerio).The first type of enrichment studied was glass rod structures of varying heights provided to increase tank complexity and provide refuge. The glass structures did not produce any quantifiable benefits in unstressed fish and appeared to delay the formation of stable social hierarchies. When fish were stressed by a period of chasing, the presence of the glass rods appeared to reduce the magnitude of the cortisol response. Whilst this could be viewed as a potential benefit, it was felt that it would not outweigh the costs of this type of enrichment.The second type of enrichment studied was provision of airstones. Again, no clear evidence was found that fish in tanks with airstones experienced an improvement in welfare. The main observation was the vast increase in mortality in tanks containing these airstones, in particular, those of a smaller size. Regardless of the physiological cause underlying this result, this can only be viewed as a negative consequence and one that appears to rule out airstones as an effective form of enrichment for this species and strain of fish.It was also observed that both stress and the presence of enrichment influenced the absolute deviation from the mean in several endpoints. Since changes in endpoint variation will have effects both on the number of animals required to statistically measure environmentally relevant effects this is a factor that should be considered when researching methods of environmental enrichment.Finally, results from these studies suggest the possibility that laboratory zebrafish do not require the addition of environmental enrichment to tanks in order to promote maximum welfare. Furthermore, as considerable costs would be involved in implementing many types of enrichment (relating to manufacture, cleaning, incompatibility of results with previous studies etc.) it is likely that observed benefits would have to be both substantial and well established in order for changes in regulatory guidelines to take place. For a species such as zebrafish that are extremely easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory with minimal amounts of disease, social problems or mortalities, it may be that current conditions are satisfactory.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

In fish, many of these effects appear to be of a feminising nature, including stimulation of vitellogenin production and induction of intersex. In piscivorous birds these so called endocrine disrupting contaminants have been shown to impair reproduction, influencing reproductive behaviour, sex ratio, eggshell thickness and reproductive success. The effects seen in fish have been associated with high levels of oestrogenic activity in the effluent from waste water treatments works (WwTWs), but few studies have focused on the effects of WwTWs effluents on birds.In this thesis, the effects of effluents from WwTWs on fish and birds were investigated in the Tamar catchment, SW England. The work spanned making detailed assessment on the oestrogenic and anti-androgenic activity of 3 WwTWs effluents, using a variety of water sampling techniques and applying both recombinant yeast oestrogen screen (YES) and recombinant yeast androgen screen (anti-YAS) bioassays to quantify the different hormonal activities. A survey was undertaken of the hormonal activities at 13 sites to determine concentrations of contaminants in the surface waters throughout the Tamar catchment, using both recombinant yeast screens and targeted analytical chemistry for specific pollutants (LC/MS-TOF and GCMS). An ELISA was developed to quantify vitellogenin (VTG) in the bullhead (our study fish sentinel) as a biomarker of oestrogen exposure, and evidence of endocrine disruption was investigated in wild populations of the bullhead, Cottus gobio and the dipper, Cinclus cinclus. Macroinvertebrates from upstream and downstream of three WwTW's effluent discharges and from three sampling sites were also sampled as an index of overall water quality in the Tamar catchment, and as an assessment of food availability for the bullheads and dippers.For the studies on the hormonal activities in three WwTWs in the Tamar catchment, samples were collected by both spot and passive sampling; passive samplers (in replicate) were placed in the effluent discharges for a three week period, and collected on days 7, 14 and 21, spot samples were taken simultaneously. Measurement of total oestrogenic and total anti-androgenic activity was conducted using the YES and antiYAS, respectively. Spot and passive samples were collected from 13 sites within the Tamar catchment (sampling sites were >2 km downstream of effluent discharges). Additionally, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry time-of-flight (LC/MS-TOF) was used to measure the concentration of oestrone (E1), 17β-oestrodiol (E2) and 17αethinylestradiol (EE2) in each sample. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) was used to measure the concentration of individual PBDE and PCB congeners in the spot samples only.Levels of oestrogenic and anti-androgenic activity observed in the WwTWs effluent were comparable with those measured in effluents in the UK and in other countries. Surface waters of the Tamar, away from the WwTWs effluent discharges, contained very little oestrogenic activity (<1.1 ng E2 EQs L -1), and anti-androgenic activity was undetectable. Quantification of oestrogenic activity using passive samplers showed an increasing amount of total oestrogenic activity between days 7 and 21 when measured by the both the YES and LC/MS-TOF.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

There is a substantial body of literature that has shown a detrimental impact on wildlife, particularly aquatic species, following exposure to these pollutants. In particular, exposure to EDCs can cause disruptions in sexual development and reproductive function. The majority of the effects observed are alterations in the physiology and behaviour of individuals and a key research question that has yet to be fully addressed is whether the effects seen in individuals exposed to EDCs manifest in measurable changes in population parameters.Whilst some work has been conducted previously investigating the population-level impacts of EDC exposure, this work has generally used mathematical models to examine whether measured short-term changes in individual fecundity and survival may lead to alterations in population viability and growth in the long-term. Such an approach ignores the potential impact of EDCs on more subtle factors (for example alterations in behaviour and genetics) that can potentially affect fish population dynamics.The work presented in this thesis used two model species, the zebrafish, Danio rerio and stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, to examine whether exposure to EDCs had an effect on previously ignored factors that determine group dynamics, including behaviour, parentage and reproductive success. In groups of zebrafish (two males and two females) exposure to the model oestrogenic compound ethinylestradiol (EE2) at 10 ng/L caused a reduction in the paternity success of the most successful male, reducing the skew in paternity, relative to controls. This disruption in the reproductive hierarchy was associated with a suppression of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) concentrations in exposed males. Such alterations in reproductive hierarchies have implications for population genetic diversity as well as usual patterns of sexual behaviour and selection.In a second study, males were exposed to EE2 (females were not exposed) and then placed into colonies of varying size with either 1, 2 or 4 males competing to breed with one female. The reproductive success of the most reproductively successful male in colonies containing two males and one female was unaffected by previous exposure to EE2, relative to controls, but was significantly affected for the most reproductively successful male in tanks containing four males competing to breed with one female. This finding suggests that the impact of EDC exposure on reproductive hierarchies and success is dependent on the group structure and is not a straightforward monotonic effect.It is well known that there exist so-called „windows of sensitivity‟ for the effects of EDCs on sexual development in fish. Exposure to EDCs during this period can cause dramatic alterations in development, including complete sex reversal if the magnitude and/or duration of exposure are sufficient. In the third study in this thesis, zebrafish were exposed during the key window of sexual development, from 20-60 days post fertilisation (dpf). The reproductive success of both mature males and females was then examined in competitive breeding scenarios. Whilst there were no obvious effects of the early life EE2 exposures on the gonadal phenotypes in either males or females at maturity, the reproductive success in males exposed to 2.76ng EE2/L was increased. In contrast, exposure of females to 9.86 ng EE2 /L during early life reduced their subsequent reproductive success. Given the importance of female reproductive capability in population demographics and dynamics, the effect of exposure to EE2on female reproductive success may therefore have significant implications for exposed fish populations.Whilst conducting the EE2exposure experiments, it became clear that the genetic diversity in the laboratory strains of zebrafish was much lower than that previously published for wild zebrafish. A study was therefore conducted in which several laboratory strains of zebrafish and a population of zebrafish obtained directly from the wild in Bangladesh were genotyped in order to elucidate the genetic diversity in the different strains. The results showed that the genetic diversity in commonly used laboratory strains (even those described as outbred or „wild type‟) was significantly lower than that of wild zebrafish. Given the impact of reductions in genetic diversity and variation on fitness at both the individual and population level, this has implications for studies that extrapolate results from laboratory studies to wild populations, as exposure to EDCs may have a different impact on laboratory strains than their more genetically diverse wild counterparts.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

I determined the separate and combined effects of nutritional condition and refuge availability on survival of the blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii), and how condition influenced burst swimming performance to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the observed patterns of survival. Recent recruits fed high or low rations were placed on standardized plots of rock in the field, and monitored daily to determine mortality. To examine the effects of condition and refuge availability, high- and low-ration fish were placed on plots of high, medium, or low amounts of rock. On standardized plots, low-ration fish experienced higher mortality than high-ration fish; however, swimming ability did not explain these patterns. As expected, survival increased with refuge availability, and low-ration fish experienced higher mortality than high-ration fish at medium and high levels of refuge. Surprisingly, higher mortality was observed for high-ration fish on low-refuge plots. These results indicate that both post-settlement processes and individual condition, mediated by environmental conditions, are important determinants of fish population demography. Pesticide exposure also plays an important role in determining condition, performance, and survival of fishes. Due to increasing use of pyrethroid insecticides, my second objective was to determine the effects of the pyrethroid esfenvalerate on food consumption, growth, behavior, and predation risk in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). For growth experiments, minnow larvae were exposed to five esfenvalerate treatments (control, solvent control, 0.1μg/L, 0.7μg/L, 1.5μg/L) for 4 h. After exposure, unconsumed food and abnormal swimming behavior were recorded daily for 7 d. For predation experiments, minnows from each treatment were transferred to aquaria containing one threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). After 45 min, the number of minnows remaining was recorded. Fish exposed to 1.5 and 0.7μg/L esfenvalerate exhibited impaired swimming and feeding ability and growth relative to fish exposed to 0.1μg/L and controls. Predation risk was significantly higher in minnows exposed to 1.5 and 0.7μg/L esfenvalerate than in control fish. These results demonstrate that larval fish can experience significant growth and swimming impairment, and increased predation pressure, even after short-term exposures to esfenvalerate.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Concerns about their adverse effects on the environment have been expressed for many years. Due to applications in the past, significant pesticide residues remain in the soil. These residues can result in significant pesticide emissions into the atmosphere, where pesticides can be transported over long distances and deposited far from where they were originally applied. To investigate issues related to pesticides in the environment, this project has developed a 3-D Eulerian multimedia regional fate and chemical transport modelling system based on the US EPA MM5/MCIP/SMOKE/CMAQ air quality modelling system, which this project has coupled to PEM, a dynamic pesticide emission model. This study has, to our knowledge for the first time, incorporated the Koa gas-particle partitioning model into Models-3/CMAQ for the semi-volatile behaviour of pollutants. The modelling package takes into account the important physical and chemical processes and factors, from sources to sinks, related to pesticides in both the atmosphere and the soil, including pesticide application modes, soil types, soil tilling, growing stages of crops, advection and diffusion in the soil, emission, partitioning, transport in the atmosphere, chemical transformation, dry deposition, and wet deposition. Moreover, this modelling system models pesticides along with other atmospheric compounds (e.g. O( 3), OH radicals, NO(3) radicals, and particulate materials) simultaneously and addresses chemical and physical interactions among all these pollutants, including pesticides. This project has used the modelling system to study the environmental behaviour of toxaphene, a persistent, bio-accumulative, and toxic pesticide. The study was carried out for a 11/2 year period from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001 and covers a domain that includes most of North America with a resolution of 36x36 km. Comparisons of the modeled results with measured or estimated values show good agreement. The comparisons include (i)comparison of modeled daily-average toxaphene air concentrations against measurements; (ii)comparison of toxaphene fraction on particle phase over that of all phases against estimate as well as measurements; (iii)comparison of modeled annual wet deposition against measurements; (iv)comparison of modeled annual dry deposition against estimate; (v)and comparisons of surface temperatures and soil moistures predicted by MM5 and PEM. The comparison of modeled daily-average air concentrations against measurements was conducted at five measuring sites for the year 2000. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish the relationship between modeled daily-average pesticide air concentrations and measurements at so many locations and for such a long period. The good agreement of these comparisons shows that the modelling system has the ability to simulate emissions, air concentrations in gas phase and particle phase, dry deposition, and wet deposition, which are determined by simulation of the important physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere and the soil, as well as agricultural practices and meteorology. This work has estimated a toxaphene residue inventory for Mexico, and has converted the U.S. residue inventory, obtained from Environment Canada, from Latitude-Longitude projection to Lambert projection. Although this study has found anomalous residues around the Texas site in the U.S. residue inventory, data analyses imply that the inventories are generally reasonable. This project has used the merged Mexican and U.S. residue inventory and coupled MM5-PEM to develop an hourly and gridded toxaphene emission inventory for a period from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001. To our knowledge, this is the first such gridded and hourly toxaphene emission inventory developed for North America. The spatial distribution of simulated emissions in the domain is consistent with that of toxaphene residues. Modeled emissions have a strong diurnal and seasonal signature in each grid and also in the entire domain. In the entire domain, the greatest emissions occur in April (35748 kg/month), May (51466 kg/month), and June (35273 kg/month). Although monthly toxaphene emission in 2001 is usually smaller than that in its counterpart month of 2000 because of decay and loss of residues in the soil, this study shows that exceptions exist because of different meteorology, which can lead to greater emission in a month compared to its corresponding month in the previous year. Toxaphene was not heavily used around the Great Lakes. Toxaphene was never licensed for use in Canada. Although toxaphene was used in the United States, primarily in cotton-growing areas of southeastern U.S it was banned in this nation more than two decades ago. However, toxaphene concentrations in water and fish in the Great Lakes are still very high, posing a threat to the life and health of one quarter of Canadian population and one tenth of U.S. population living in the Great Lakes region. One of greatest challenges that scientists face is to identify atmospheric sources to the region's waters and to determine the patterns of emission, transport, and deposition. This study shows that long-range atmospheric transport and deposition play a vital role for the contamination of the Great Lakes by toxaphene. This study provides detailed modeled deposition estimates for the five Great Lakes, using a modelling package that takes into account all important factors that may affect the fate of pesticides, including agricultural practices, meteorology, physical and chemical processes in the soil and the atmosphere. This study reveals that boundary conditions are very important for modelling both toxaphene air concentrations and depositions, and neglecting boundary conditions may result in the underestimates of both air concentrations at some locations and dry and wet depositions into the Great Lakes. The modeled results show that both North American residues and boundary conditions, which are partly contributed by toxaphene sources outside the domain, contribute to the contamination of the Great Lakes. During the warm months, the southerly winds prevail, and they carry toxaphene emitted primarily in the southeastern United States to the Great Lakes region, causing significant dry and wet depositions of toxaphene into the Great Lakes. Therefore, the major contributor to the contamination of the Great Lakes in warm months is the soil residues in the United States. During cold months, however, the prevalent north-westerly winds probably carry toxaphene through the northern boundary to the Great Lakes region, leading to toxaphene deposition into the Great Lakes. The upper lakes, especially Lake Superior, are significantly affected by the boundary conditions. This study shows that pollutants can be transported southward and deposited into the sensitive receptors such as the Great Lakes. Although the lower Great Lakes are also influenced by the boundary conditions, they are mainly affected by the U.S. residues throughout the year. This study found that Mexican residues in the domain do not have significant impact on the concentrations at the five measuring sites and depositions into the Great Lakes.","Date revised - 2009-04-01

This dissertation examines the sub-lethal effects of several commonly used pesticides when amphibian larvae are exposed to both the contaminant and another species simultaneously. Chapter one discusses the issue of amphibian declines and the evidence justifying a further investigation on the role of pesticides in altering amphibian traits. Chapter two examines the lethality of four commonly used pesticides (atrazine, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, and diazinon) on the Pacific tree frog, Hyla regilla, and on the threatened foothill yellow legged frog,  Rana boylii. R. boylii tadpoles are more susceptible to carbaryl and diazinon than H. regilla but more resistant to atrazine. Chlorpyrifos exhibits similar toxicity to both species. Species exhibit similar shifts in behavior (e.g., both increase activity with diazinon) while in other cases species exhibit opposite shifts in behavior (e.g., with carbaryl, refuge use increases with H. regilla and decreases with R. boylii). In chapter three, I examine H. regilla  with a fish predator, Gambusia affinis, in the presence of diazinon. Diazinon significantly impacts the fish predator, drastically reducing its ability to prey upon tadpoles. Chapter four examines the competitive interactions of H. regilla and R. boylii when exposed to carbaryl. The combined presence of carbaryl and a competitor ceases both development and growth in R. boylii. Contrary to this, H. regilla exhibit increased growth and development likely due to the reduced competitive ability of R. boylii . The final chapter combines these two competitors with a non-native predator, the signal crayfish, Pacifasticus leniusculus. In the combined context of predator and pesticide, R. boylii survival is reduced from nearly 100% to 50%. Carbaryl increases the susceptibility of R. boylii to predation from a resistant crayfish predator. In summary, pesticide presence can have significant impacts on community dynamics. Alteration of one species' behavior or development can lead to the benefit of another, be it prey or competitor. By studying these community interactions and which species are most heavily impacted by pesticides, we can better understand why specific species are declining while others are not.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Births occur predominantly in summer, after a one year gestation period. Calves are born at a length of approximately 103 cm and a mass of nearly 14 kg. Neonates are closely attended by the mother, she determines the calf's respiration rate and behaviour as it swims in a negative pressure vortex high on her flank. The initial weeks are marked by the calf's acquisition of swimming skills and its ability to regulate its own respiration rate. Although the calf takes solid food between six months and one year, suckling may continue for as much as three years. Initial growth is rapid but slows with the approach to puberty. Females reach sexual maturity at about ten years of age and may undergo a series of rapid ovulations before fertilisation occurs. Subsequently, the mean ovulation rate indicates a three year calving interval. Males show a mass growth spurt at the onset of puberty, between 10 and 12 years, and reach sexual maturity between 12 and 15 years of age. In both sexes, physical maturity and asymptotic size are reached at about 15 years and maximum life-span is in excess of 40 years. Although a wide variety of fish and cephalopods are taken, the fishes Pomadasys olivaceum, Scomber japonicus, Pagellus bellotti, Trachurus delagoae, and the cephalopods Sepia officinalis and Loligo sp. contribute some 60 % by mass of all prey taken. Different sex and maturity classes of dolphins consume differing sizes and species of prey, implying a partitioning of food resources within the group. Comparisons of stomach volumes with estimates of prey mass and nutritional requirements suggest that calves and lactating females may need to feed more often than other sex and maturity classes. Examination of shark stomachs indicates that shark predation may be an important component of dolphin natural mortality. Four species of shark, the Zambesi (Carcharhinus leucas), the tiger (Galeocerdo cuvien), the great white (Carcharodon carcharias) and the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) are implicated as dolphin predators. Estimates from the number of these four species caught annually and the frequency of occurrence of dolphin flukes and vertebrae in their stomachs suggest that a minimum of 20 bottle nosed dolphins or 2.2 % of the estimated population in southern Natal coastal waters are killed each year by sharks. Some 32 bottlenose dolphins, about 4 % of the estimated population, are captured in shark nets annually. Calves of two years or less constitute nearly 45 % of the catch, while lactating females make up a further 15 %. An analysis of biological, environmental and physiographic factors associated with each capture, suggest that feeding and probably prey movement and distribution are directly associated with capture. PCB, t-DDT and dieldrin concentrations in the blubber of male bottlenose dolphins increase with age and reach levels that may impair testosterone production. In females, there is an 80 % decline in residue concentrations after the first or second ovulation. Evidence presented suggests that first born calves receive possibly lethal doses of residues within two months of birth. Residue concentrations in dolphins from different geographical areas varied significantly, implying a degree of isolation of sections of the population. Investigation of reproductive parameters indicates that mortality of bottlenose dolphins off Natal probably equals or exceeds the replacement rate. The necessity for and requirements of further research on the natural history of bottlenose dolphins off the east coast of southern Africa are summarised.","Copyright - Copyright 1989

Invertebrates are sensitive to  herbicide exposure because their defense systems are incomplete. At the top of  the food chain in freshwater ecosystems, fish show high bioaccumulation of  herbicides. Herbicide exposure causes reproductive toxicity and population  declines in freshwater organisms and further contamination of fish used for  consumption poses a risk to human health.

All of these behaviors can be impaired or lost as a result of  exposure to toxic contaminants in surface waters. Historically, teleost olfaction  studies have focused on behavioral responses to anthropogenic contaminants (e.g.,  avoidance). More recently, there has been a shift towards understanding the  underlying mechanisms and functional significance of contaminant-mediated changes  in fish olfaction. This includes a consideration of how contaminants affect the  olfactory nervous system and, by extension, the downstream physiological and  behavioral processes that together comprise a normal response to naturally  occurring stimuli (e.g., reproductive priming or releasing pheromones). Numerous  studies spanning several species have shown that ecologically relevant exposures  to common pollutants such as metals and pesticides can interfere with fish  olfaction and disrupt life history processes that determine individual survival  and reproductive success. This represents one of the pathways by which toxic  chemicals in aquatic habitats may increasingly contribute to the decline and  at-risk status of many commercially and ecologically important fish stocks.  Despite our emerging understanding of the threats that pollution poses for  chemical communication in aquatic communities, many research challenges remain.  These include: (1) the determination of specific mechanisms of toxicity in the  fish olfactory sensory epithelium; (2) an understanding of the impacts of complex  chemical mixtures; (3) the capacity to assess olfactory toxicity in fish in situ;  (4) the impacts of toxins on olfactory-mediated behaviors that are still poorly  understood for many fish species; and (5) the connections between sublethal  effects on individual fish and the long-term viability of wild populations.

The intensive applications of glyphosate-based herbicides  and its half-life in water lead to its presence in many aquatic ecosystems.  Whereas recent studies have reported neurotoxic effects of glyphosate including  autism-related effects, most of them used extremely high (mg/L to g/L)  concentrations, so it is still unclear if chronic, low environmentally relevant  concentrations of this compound (ng/L to μg/L) can induce neurotoxicity. In this  study we analyzed the neurotoxicity of glyphosate in adult zebrafish after  waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.3 and 3 μg/L)  for two weeks. Our data showed that exposed fish presented a significant  impairment of exploratory and social behaviors consistent with increased anxiety.  The anterior brain of the exposed fish presented a significant increase in  dopamine and serotonin levels, as well as in the DOPAC/dopamine and homovanillic  acid/dopamine turnover ratios. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in the  dopaminergic system, as th1, th2, comtb, and scl6a3 was downregulated. Finally,  the brain of exposed fish presented a significant increase in the catalase and  superoxide dismutase activities, with a concomitant decrease of glutathione  stores. These changes in the antioxidant defense system are consistent with the  observed increase in oxidative stress, reflected by the increase in the levels of  lipid peroxidation in the brain. The presented results show that current  glyphosate concentrations commonly found in many aquatic ecosystems may have  detrimental consequences on fish survival by decreasing exploration of the  environment or altering social interactions. Furthermore, as zebrafish is also a  vertebrate model widely used in human neurobehavioral studies, these results are  relevant not only for environmental risk assessment, but also for understanding  the risk of chronic low-dose exposures on human health.",,10.1016/j.envint.2020.106253,"*Herbicides/toxicity;*Water Pollutants, Chemical/toxicity;Animals;Anxiety/chemically induced;Behavioral impairment;Dopaminergic system;Ecosystem;Glycine/analogs & derivatives;Glyphosate;Humans;Neurotoxicity;Oxidative stress;Oxidative Stress;Zebrafish;Anxiety",NA,NA,glyphosate targets fish monoaminergic systems leading to oxidative stress and anxiety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The indiscriminate application  poses numerous problems, both for the health of the applicators and consumers,  and for the environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death  of plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is quickly gaining popularity in  behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals, sensitivity  to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost, short spawning  intervals, external fertilization, transparency of embryos through larval stages,  and rapid development. The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of  glyphosate and Roundup(®) on behavioral and morphological parameters in zebrafish  larvae and adults.

Technological progress and  advanced insights into epigenetic processes have led to the description of  epigenetic features (mainly DNA methylation) in many ecologically relevant  species: algae, plants, several invertebrates and fish. Epigenetic changes in  plants, insects and cladocerans have been reported to be induced by various  environmental stress factors including nutrition or water deficiency, grazing,  light or temperature alterations, social environment, and dissolved organic  matter concentrations. As regards chemicals, studies in rats and mice exposed to  specific pesticides, hydrocarbons, dioxins, and endocrine disrupting chemicals  demonstrated the induction of epigenetic changes, suggesting the need for further  research with these substances in an ecotoxicological context. In fish and  plants, exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and soluble fractions of  solid waste affected the epigenetic status. A novel concept in ecotoxicological  epigenetics is the induction of transgenerational stress resistance upon chemical  exposure, as demonstrated in rice exposed to metals. Evaluating epigenetics in  ecotoxicological field studies is a second relatively new approach. A cryptic  lineage of earthworms had developed arsenic tolerance in the field, concurrent  with specific DNA methylation patterns. Flatfish caught in the framework of  environmental monitoring had developed tumours, exhibiting specific DNA  methylation patterns. Two main potential implications of epigenetics in an  ecotoxicological context are (1) the possibility of transgenerationally  inherited, chemical stress-induced epigenetic changes with associated phenotypes  and (2) epigenetically induced adaptation to stress upon long-term chemical  exposure. Key knowledge gaps are concerned with the causality of the relation  between epigenetic and phenotypic changes, the persistence of transgenerational  effects, the implications at population level and the costs of tolerance.

We also evaluated a behavioral repertoire in  larvae at 7 dpf, and there were no significant differences in distance traveled,  mean speed, time in movement, and thigmotaxis for atrazine and diuron when  animals were individually placed in a new environment. The cognitive ability of  the larvae was tested at 7 dpf for avoidance and optomotor responses, and neither  atrazine nor diuron had significant impacts when treated groups were compared to  their corresponding controls. Adults' behavior was evaluated 7 and 8 days after  the end of the acute herbicide exposure. Exploration of a new environment and  associated anxiety-like parameters, social interaction, and aggressiveness were  not altered.

Environmental exposures to mitochondrial toxicants occur widely and are  increasingly frequent. Exposures to these mitotoxicants may pose a serious threat  to organismal health and the onset of diseases by disrupting immunometabolic  pathways. In this study, we investigated whether the Complex I inhibitor rotenone  could alter C. elegans immunometabolism and disease susceptibility. C. elegans  embryos were exposed to rotenone (0.5 µM) or DMSO (0.125%) until they reached the  L4 larval stage. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by rotenone and  disruption of mitochondrial metabolism were evidenced by rotenone-induced  detrimental effects on mitochondrial efficiency and nematode growth and  development. Next, through transcriptomic analysis, we investigated if this  specific but mild mitochondrial stress that we detected would lead to the  modulation of immunometabolic pathways. We found 179 differentially expressed  genes (DEG), which were mostly involved in detoxification, energy metabolism, and  pathogen defense. Interestingly, among the down-regulated DEG, most of the known  genes were involved in immune defense, and most of these were identified as  commonly upregulated during P. aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, rotenone  increased susceptibility to the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14). However,  it increased resistance to Salmonella enterica (SL1344). To shed light on  potential mechanisms related to these divergent effects on pathogen resistance,  we assessed the activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response  (UPR(mt)), a well-known immunometabolic pathway in C. elegans which links  mitochondria and immunity and provides resistance to pathogen infection. The  UPR(mt) pathway was activated in rotenone-treated nematodes further exposed for  24 h to the pathogenic bacteria P. aeruginosa and S. enterica or the common  bacterial food source Escherichia coli (OP50). However, P. aeruginosa alone  suppressed UPR(mt) activation and rotenone treatment rescued its activation only  to the level of DMSO-exposed nematodes fed with E. coli. Module-weighted  annotation bioinformatics analysis was also consistent with UPR(mt) activation in  rotenone-exposed nematodes consistent with the UPR being involved in the  increased resistance to S. enterica. Together, our results demonstrate that the  mitotoxicant rotenone can disrupt C. elegans immunometabolism in ways likely  protective against some pathogen species but sensitizing against others.",,10.3389/fimmu.2022.840272,*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins;*Caenorhabditis elegans/metabolism;Animals;Dimethyl Sulfoxide/metabolism;Escherichia coli/metabolism;immunotoxicity;innate immunity;invertebrate;metabolism;mitochondrial toxicants;mitoimmunity;pesticides;Pseudomonas aeruginosa/physiology;Rotenone/toxicity;Rotenone,NA,NA,rotenone modulates caenorhabditis elegans immunometabolism and pathogen susceptibility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although ROS association with many pathological  states in animals is well established, the question of ROS responsibility for the  development of these states is still open. Fish represent the largest group of  vertebrates and they inhabit a broad range of ecosystems where they are subjected  to many different aquatic contaminants.

This  paper reports a study on developing a hyperspectral plant sensing approach to  explore the spectral features of glyphosate-resistant (GR) and  glyphosate-sensitive (GS) plants to evaluate this approach using machine learning  algorithms to differentiate between GR and GS plants. RESULTS: On average, GR  plants have higher spectral reflectance compared with GS plants. The sensitive  spectral bands were optimally selected using the successive projections algorithm  respectively wrapped with the machine learning algorithms of k-nearest neighbors  (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) with Fisher linear  discriminant analysis (FLDA) to classify between GS and GS plants. At 3 weeks  after transplanting (WAT) KNN and SVM could not acceptably classify the GR and GS  plants but they improved significantly with the stages to have their overall  accuracies reaching 73% and 77%, respectively, at 5 WAT. RF and FLDA had a better  ability to classify the plants at 3 WAT but RF was low in accuracy at 2 WAT while  FLDA dropped accuracy to 50% at 4 WAT from 57% at 3 WAT and raised it to 73% at 5  WAT. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies were conducted developing the hyperspectral  imaging approach to differentiate GR Palmer amaranth from GS Palmer amaranth and  GR Italian ryegrass from GS Italian ryegrass with classification accuracies of  90% and 80%, respectively. This study demonstrated that the hyperspectral plant  sensing approach could be developed to differentiate GR johnsongrass from  glyphosate-sensitive GS johnsongrass with the highest classification accuracy of  77%. The comparison with our previous studies indicated that the similar  hyperspectral approach could be used and transferred from classification across  different GR and GS weed biotypes, such as Palmer amaranth, Italian ryegrass and  johnsongrass, so it is highly possible for classification of more other GR and GS  weed biotypes as well. On the basis of classic pattern recognition approaches the  process of plant classification can be enhanced by modeling using machine  learning algorithms. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

The release of these  pollutants into the marine aquatic environment leads to significant ecological  degradation and a range of non-infectious disorders in fish. Marine pollutants  trigger numerous fish bacterial diseases by increasing microbial multiplication  in the aquatic environment and suppressing fish immune defense mechanisms. The  greater part of these microorganisms is naturally occurring in the aquatic  environment. Most disease outbreaks are caused by opportunistic bacterial agents  that attack stressed fish. Some infections are more serious and occur in the  absence of environmental stressors.

These  concerns need to be addressed to enable sustainable aquaculture development.  While the negative environmental impacts of aquaculture have been evaluated using  physical and chemical indicators, the social acceptance has not been fully  considered when evaluating aquaculture sustainability.

While  fenpropathrin was found to have neurotoxic effects in mammals, it remains unclear  whether it has similar effects on fish. Here, we used adult zebrafish to  investigate the impacts of fenpropathrin on fish social behaviors and neural  activity. Exposure of adult zebrafish to 500 ppb of fenpropathrin for 72 h  increased anxiety levels but decreased physical fitness, as measured by a novel  tank diving test and swimming tunnel test. Fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared  to spend more time in the conspecific zone of the tank, possibly seeking greater  comfort from their companions. Although learning, memory, and aggressive behavior  did not change, fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to have shorter fighting  durations. The immunocytochemical results showed the tyrosine hydroxylase  antibody-labeled dopaminergic neurons in the teleost posterior tuberculum  decreased in the zebrafish brain. According to a quantitative polymerase chain  reaction (qPCR) analysis of the brain, exposure to fenpropathrin resulted in a  decrease in the messenger (m)RNA expression of monoamine oxidase (mao), an enzyme  that facilitates the deamination of dopamine. In contrast, the mRNA expression of  the sncga gene, which may trigger Parkinson's disease, was found to have  increased.

Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a  Parkinson’s disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical  spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses  through the blood−brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochondria.  Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the  present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination  with different potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive  behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material  and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT—2.5 µg/L, valproic acid (VPA)—0.5  mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)—250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics  (PROBIO)—3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti-social profile and mirror tests  and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We  observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a)  CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views,  this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal  intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p < 0.05).

Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT +  PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the  above groups (p > 0.05).

The unique structural and functional  attributes provide a nonspecific and versatile means of combating a variety of  microbial pathogens, i.e., fungi, bacteria, protozoa, and enveloped viruses. Some  defensins in plants involved in other functions include the development of metal  tolerance and the role in sexual reproduction, while most of the defensins make  up the innate immune system of the plants.

Through a series of laboratory experiments, this study  investigated the impact of exposure to chemical contaminant such as DDT or copper  (Cu), in combination with cold or warm temperature extremes on the marine medaka  fish Oryzias melastigma. The results showed that extreme seawater temperatures  (i.e., 15 and 32 °C in sub-tropical Hong Kong) exacerbated adverse chemical  impacts on the growth performance of O. melastigma, in particular at the high  thermal extreme. This was likely associated with an interruption of oxygen  consumption and aerobic scope. Most importantly, the results of acclimation  experiments, as reflected by thermal tolerance polygons, showed that chemical  exposure substantially narrowed the thermal tolerance of the medaka, making them  more vulnerable to temperature changes and extreme thermal events. Under dual  stresses of thermal extremes and chemical exposure, the medaka switched their  metabolic pathway to anaerobic respiration that might deplete their energy  reserve for chemical detoxification. Although stress proteins such as heat shock  proteins (HSP90) were up-regulated for cellular protection in the fish, such a  defensive mechanism was repressed with intensifying dual stresses at high  temperature and high chemical concentration.

Early epidemiological experimenters, such as Jenner and the  smallpox vaccine and Snow and his famous Broad Street pump handle, already knew  the answer they were demonstrating; they used the experiments as knowledge  translation devices to convince others.More sophisticated modern experiments  include cluster randomised controlled trials (CRCTs) for experiments in the  public health setting. The knowledge translation value remains: RCTs and CRCTs  can potentially stimulate changes of practice among stakeholders. Capitalising on  the knowledge translation value of RCTs requires more than the standard reporting  of trials. Those who are convinced by a trial and want to act, need to know how  the trial relates to their own context, what contributed to success, and what  might make it even more effective. Implementation research unpacks the  back-story, examining how and why an intervention worked.The Camino Verde trial  of community mobilisation for control of dengue reported a significant impact on  entomological indices of the Aedes aegypti vector, and on serological dengue  virus infection and self-reported dengue cases. This important study should lead  to studies of similar interventions in other contexts, and ultimately to changes  in dengue control practices. This supplement is the back-story of the trial,  providing information to help researchers and planners to make use of the trial  findings.Background articles include the full protocol, a systematic review of  CRCTs of approaches for Aedes aegypti control, epidemiological and entomological  findings from the baseline survey, and how baseline findings were used to set up  the intervention. Secondary analyses of the entomological findings examine  associations with the use of the larvicide temephos, and the impact of the  intervention in different conditions of water supply and seasons.Other articles  describe implementation and other impacts: the underlying approach;  implementation in the trial's different social contexts; the different impact in  women and men; the effects of using fish for vector control; the impact on  household costs of personal protection and of cases of dengue illness; and  ethical issues.We hope this supplement will increase the knowledge translation  value of the Camino Verde trial.",,10.1186/s12889-017-4287-7,"*Aedes/growth & development;*Insect Vectors;*Public Health Practice;Animals;Dengue Virus;Dengue/*prevention & control/transmission/virology;Family Characteristics;Humans;Mosquito Control/*methods;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Seasons;Translational Research, Biomedical;Water;Water Supply",NA,NA,randomised controlled trials and changing public health practice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over this period, the widely-used organochlorines were eventually  replaced by organophosphates, with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and  chlorpyrifos (CPF) as the principal prototypes. Considerable research has  characterized the risks of DDT and CPF individually, but little is known about  the toxicology of transitioning from one class of insecticides to another, as has  been commonplace for agricultural and pest control workers. This study used adult  zebrafish to investigate neurobehavioral toxicity following 5-week chronic  exposure to either DDT or CPF, to or their sequential exposure (DDT for 5 weeks  followed by CPF for 5 weeks). At the end of the exposure period, a subset of fish  were analyzed for brain cholinesterase activity. Behavioral effects were  initially assessed one week following the end of the CPF exposure and again at  14 months of age using a behavioral test battery covering sensorimotor responses,  anxiety-like functions, predator avoidance and social attraction. Adult  insecticide exposures, individually or sequentially, were found to modulate  multiple behavioral features, including startle responsivity, social approach,  predator avoidance, locomotor activity and novel location recognition and  avoidance. Locomotor activity and startle responsivity were each impacted to a  greater degree by the sequential exposures than by individual compounds, with the  latter being pronounced at the early (1-week post exposure) time point, but not  3-4 months later in aging. Social approach responses were similarly impaired by  the sequential exposure as by CPF-alone at the aging time point. Fleeing  responses in the predator test showed flee-enhancing effects of both compounds  individually versus controls, and no additive impact of the two following  sequential exposure. Each compound was also associated with changes in  recognition or avoidance patterns in a novel place recognition task in late  adulthood, but sequential exposures did not enhance these phenotypes. The  potential for chemical x chemical interactions did not appear related to changes  in CPF metabolism to the active oxon, as prior DDT exposure did not affect the  cholinesterase inhibition resulting from CPF. This study shows that the effects  of chronic adult insecticide exposures may be relevant to behavioral health  initially and much later in life, and that the effects of sequential exposures  may be unpredictable based on their constituent exposures.",,10.1016/j.ntt.2021.106985,"Aging;Animals;Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Brain/drug effects;Chlorpyrifos/*toxicity;Cholinesterase Inhibitors/toxicity;DDT;DDT/metabolism/*toxicity;Insecticides/toxicity;Locomotion/*drug effects;Neurobehavioral toxicology, anxiety-related behavior;Zebrafish;Zebrafish/metabolism",NA,NA,neurobehavioral anomalies in zebrafish after sequential exposures to ddt and chlorpyrifos in adulthood do multiple exposures interact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The capacity of this herbicide to interfere with the  vertebrate endocrine system is broadly recognized, but the mechanisms and  responses usually differ among species. In this study, ATZ effects on  hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis key genes expression and early gonadal  development were evaluated in Odontesthes bonariensis larvae waterborne exposed  during the gonadal differentiation period. Fish were treated to 0, 0.7, 7.0, and  70 µg ATZ/L at 25 °C from the 2nd to 6th week after hatching (wah), and a group  was kept in clean water until the 12th wah. Parallelly, a group was submitted to  0.05 µg/L of ethinylestradiol (EE(2)) as a positive estrogenic control. From each  treatment, eight larvae were sampled at 6 wah for gene expression analysis and  twelve larvae at 12 wah for phenotypic sex histological determination. The  expression of gnrh1, lhb, fshb, and cyp19a1b was assessed in the head, and the  ones of amha, 11βhsd2, and cyp19a1a in the trunk. Fish growth was significantly  higher in fish exposed to 7 and 70 µg ATZ/L in the 6 wah, but the effect vanished  at the 12 wah. The expression of lhb was upregulated in both sex larvae exposed  from 7 µg ATZ/L. However, a dimorphic effect was induced on cyp19a1a expression  at 70 µg ATZ/L, up or downregulating mRNA transcription in males and females,  respectively. Delayed ovarian development and increased number of testicular germ  cells were histologically observed from 7 to 70 µg ATZ/L, respectively, and a sex  inversion (genotypic male to phenotypic female) was found in one larva at 70 µg  ATZ/L. The lhb expression was also upregulated by EE(2), but the cyp19a1a  expression was not affected, and a complete male-to-female reversal was induced.  Further, EE(2) upregulated gnrh1 in females and cyp19a1b in both sexes, but it  did not alter any assessed gene in the trunk. In conclusion, ATZ disrupted HPG  axis physiology and normal gonadal development in O. bonariensis larvae at  environmentally relevant concentrations.

L.",,eng,,,"Many natural and synthetic compounds present in the environment exert a number of adverse effects on the exposed organisms, leading to endocrine disruption, for  which they were termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). A decrease in  reproduction success is one of the most well-documented signs of endocrine  disruption in fish. Estrogens are steroid hormones involved in the control of  important reproduction-related processes, including sexual differentiation,  maturation and a variety of others. Careful spatial and temporal balance of  estrogens in the body is crucial for proper functioning. At the final step of  estrogen biosynthesis, cytochrome P450 aromatase, encoded by the cyp19 gene,  converts androgens into estrogens. Modulation of aromatase CYP19 expression and  function can dramatically alter the rate of estrogen production, disturbing the  local and systemic levels of estrogens. In the present review, the current  progress in CYP19 characterization in teleost fish is summarized and the  potential of several classes of EDCs to interfere with CYP19 expression and  activity is discussed. Two cyp19 genes are present in most teleosts, cyp19a and  cyp19b, primarily expressed in the ovary and brain, respectively. Both aromatase  CYP19 isoforms are involved in the sexual differentiation and regulation of the  reproductive cycle and male reproductive behavior in diverse teleost species.  Alteration of aromatase CYP19 expression and/or activity, be it upregulation or  downregulation, may lead to diverse disturbances of the above mentioned  processes. Prediction of multiple transcriptional regulatory elements in the  promoters of teleost cyp19 genes suggests the possibility for several EDC classes  to affect cyp19 expression on the transcriptional level. These sites include cAMP  responsive elements, a steroidogenic factor 1/adrenal 4 binding protein site, an  estrogen-responsive element (ERE), half-EREs, dioxin-responsive elements, and  elements related to diverse other nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator  activated receptor, retinoid X receptor, retinoic acid receptor). Certain  compounds including phytoestrogens, xenoestrogens, fungicides and organotins may  modulate aromatase CYP19 activity on the post-transcriptional level. As is shown  in this review, diverse EDCs may affect the expression and/or activity of  aromatase cyp19 genes through a variety of mechanisms, many of which need further  characterization in order to improve the prediction of risks posed by a  contaminated environment to teleost fish population.",,10.1016/j.ygcen.2007.03.005,"*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental;Animals;Antifungal Agents/pharmacology;Aromatase/*genetics/physiology;Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/physiology;Endocrine Disruptors/*toxicity;Enzyme Activation/drug effects;Estradiol Congeners/pharmacology;Fishes/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology;Organotin Compounds/pharmacology;Phytoestrogens/pharmacology;Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/physiology;Reproduction/*drug effects/genetics;Sexual Behavior, Animal/drug effects;Aromatase",NA,NA,interference of endocrine disrupting chemicals with aromatase cyp19 expression or activity and consequences for reproduction of teleost fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The qRT-PCR confirmed the upregulation of the factors for promoting  the glutamate release. The measurement of neurotransmitters showed significantly  increased content of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain.

D.",,eng,,,"DIRS-1 is a retroelement from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Until recently only two related retrotransposons had been described: PAT from the  nematode Panagrellus redivivus and Prt1 from the zygomycete fungus Phycomyces  blakesleeanus. Analyses of the reverse transcriptase sequences encoded by these  three elements suggested that they were closely related to each other and more  distantly related to the Ty3/gypsy Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retroelements. They  have several unusual structural features that distinguish them from typical LTR  elements. For instance, they each encode a tyrosine recombinase (YR), but not a  DDE-type integrase or an aspartic protease. Although the DIRS-1-related elements  are bordered by terminal repeats these differ from typical LTRs in a number of  ways. In DIRS-1, for example, the terminal repeats are inverted (complementary),  non-identical in sequence, and the outer edges of the terminal sequences are  repeated (adjacent to each other) in the internal region. PAT has so-called  ""split"" direct repeats in which the unrelated terminal sequences appear as direct  repeats adjacent to each other in the internal region. The only repetition  displayed by Prt1 is the presence of short inverted terminal repeats, but the  sequenced copy of this element is believed to be a truncated version of an  element with a structure resembling DIRS-1. The unusual structure of the terminal  repeats of the DIRS1-like elements appears to be related to their replication via  free circular intermediates. Site-specific recombination is believed to integrate  the circle without creating duplications of the target sites. In recognition of  these important distinctions it is proposed that the retrotransposons that encode  tyrosine recombinases be called the tyrosine recombinase (or YR)  retrotransposons. Recently a large number of additional YR retrotransposons have  been described, including elements from fungi (zygomycetes and basidiomycetes),  plants (green algae) and a wide range of animals including nematodes, insects,  sea urchins, fish and amphibia, while remnants of elements related to DIRS-1  occur in the human genome. The complete set of YR retrotransposons can be divided  into two major groups, the DIRS elements and the Ngaro elements, the two groups  forming distinct clades on phylogenetic trees based on alignments of RT/RH and  recombinase sequences, and also having some structural distinctions. A third  group of transposable elements, which we call Cryptons, also carry tyrosine  recombinases. These elements do not encode a reverse transcriptase and so are  believed to be DNA transposons not retrotransposons. They have been detected in  several pathogenic fungi, including the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans,  and the ascomycetes Coccidioides posadasii and Histoplasma capsulatum. Sequence  comparisons suggest that the Crypton YRs are related to those of the YR  retrotransposons. We suggest that the YR retrotransposons arose from the  combination of a Crypton-like YR DNA transposon and the RT/RH encoding sequence  of a retrotransposon.",,10.1159/000084991,"*Retroelements;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Invertebrates/genetics;Molecular Sequence Data;Phylogeny;Recombinases/*genetics;RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Vertebrates/genetics;Tyrosine",NA,NA,dirs1 and the other tyrosine recombinase retrotransposons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We  meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and  variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect  of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker  respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult)  influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex  (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different  classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of  exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and  the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity  increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased  and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD  and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus  (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole  fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of  concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles  and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100%. Additionally, we  identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant  pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of  studies evaluating GSH on female fish.

Through a series of behavioral experiments we evaluated the effect of glyphosate  based herbicide (Roundup®) on the antipredator behavior of common spiny loach,  Lepidocephalichthys thermalis to understand the effects of pesticide-exposure on  recognition of conspecific alarm cues, and associative learning to avoid  predation. We exposed common spiny loach (for 3 h or 15 days) to sub-lethal  concentration (0.5 mg a.e./L) of Roundup® and subsequently with conspecific alarm  cues, signaling the proximity of a predator. Unexposed prey fish showed a  significant reduction in activity level in response to conspecific alarm cues.  Whereas such alarm response was not observed in prey fish that were exposed to  Roundup® either for 3 h or 15 days. Such lack of response could be associated  with alteration of olfactory function in prey individuals. However, this  inability to detect the conspecific alarm cues was found to be transient and  exposed fish recovered within 2 days. In subsequent experiments, we showed that  Roundup® deactivates the conspecific alarm cues thus making them unavailable for  prey to evoke the response. Furthermore, Roundup® mediated degradation of  conspecific alarm cues and diminished the associative learning necessary for  detection of the invasive/unknown/novel predators. Overall, due to the worldwide  occurrence of glyphosate in water bodies, glyphosate mediated behavioral  suppression exposes the prey animals to a considerable risk of predation, both by  native and non-native predators.",,10.1007/s10646-018-02011-z,"Animals;Association Learning/*drug effects;Chemical cues;Cues;Cypriniformes/*physiology;Food Chain;Glycine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives;Glyphosate;Herbicides/*adverse effects;Learning;Olfactory Perception/*drug effects;Pesticides;Recognition, Psychology/*drug effects;Sub-lethal;Tilapia;Time Factors;Prednisolone",NA,NA,impact recovery and carryover effect of roundup® on predator recognition in common spiny loach lepidocephalichthys thermalis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The long-range goal is to  gain sufficient understanding of fish metabolic transformation reactions to be  able to accurately predict fish xenobiotic metabolism. While some metabolism data  exist, there are few fish in vivo exposure studies where metabolites have been  identified and the metabolic pathways proposed. Previous biotransformation work  has focused on in vitro studies which have the advantage of high throughput but  may have limited metabolic capabilities, and in vivo studies which have full  metabolic capacity but are low throughput. An aquatic model system with full  metabolic capacity in which a large number of chemicals could be tested would be  a valuable tool. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study evaluated the ex vivo  rainbow trout liver slice model, which has the advantages of high throughput as  found in vitro models and non-dedifferentiated cells and cell to cell  communication found in in vivo systems. The pesticide diazinon, which has been  previously tested both in vitro and in vivo in a number of mammalian and aquatic  species including rainbow trout, was used to evaluate the ex vivo slice model as  a tool to study biotransformation pathways. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: While somewhat  limited by the analytical chemistry method employed, results of the liver slice  model, mainly that hydroxypyrimidine was the major diazinon metabolite, are in  line with the results of previous rainbow trout in vivo studies. CONCLUSION:  Therefore, the rainbow trout liver slice model is a useful tool for the study of  metabolism in aquatic species.",,10.1089/aivt.2017.0025,biotransformation;diazinon;liver slices;metabolism;trout;Liver,NA,NA,metabolism of diazinon in rainbow trout liver slices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose  of this study was to explore the association between hypospadias and  cryptorchidism, and the dietary habits of an agricultural population in Italy. A  population-based case-control study was conducted in the Sicilian Province of  Ragusa. Cases (n = 90) and controls (n = 202) included births for the period  1998-2002. Data on dietary habits of the mothers, as well as health-related  social, occupational and environmental exposures prior to and during the index  birth, were collected through interviews. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were  calculated by logistic regression after adjustment for confounding variables.  Increased ORs were observed for mothers of children with hypospadias who, during  pregnancy, frequently consumed fish (OR = 2.33 [95% confidence interval (CI)  1.03, 5.31]) and market-purchased fruit (OR = 5.10 [95% CI 1.31, 19.82]). For  cryptorchidism, increased risk was observed in mothers consuming liver (OR = 5.21  [95% CI 1.26, 21.50]), and smoked products (OR = 2.46 [95% CI 1.15, 5.29]). For  the two malformations pooled together, increased risk was associated with  maternal consumption of liver (OR = 4.38 [95% CI 1.34, 14.26]) and with frequent  consumption of wine (OR = 1.98 [95% CI 1.01, 3.86]). This study suggests that  some maternal dietary factors may play a role in the development of congenital  defects of the male reproductive tract.

Herein, the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was  continuously exposed to environmentally realistic levels of diuron from the  fertilised egg stage to the adult stage. Behavioural evaluation of adult marine  medaka indicated that exposure to diuron increased anxiety in the light-dark test  and increased predator avoidance. In addition, diuron exposure significantly  reduced aggression, social interaction, shoaling, and learning and memory  ability. However, only negligible variations in foraging behaviour and in  behaviour in the novel tank test were observed. Marine medaka chronically exposed  to diuron also showed decreased levels of dopamine in the brain, and changes were  observed in the transcription of genes related to dopamine synthesis, degradation  and receptors. Exposure to 5000 ng/L diuron caused significant downregulation of  the expression of the genes of tyrosine hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase and  significantly upregulated the expression of the genes of the D(5) dopaminergic  receptor. The relative expression of the D(4) dopaminergic receptor was  significantly upregulated in the 50, 500 and 5000 ng/L diuron-treated groups.

In recent years, an increasing number  of insect species has been suggested as model organisms in life sciences research  due to their worldwide distribution and environmental significance, the  possibility of extrapolating research studies to vertebrates and the relatively  low cost of rearing. Beetles are the largest insect order, with their  representative - Tribolium castaneum - being the first species with a completely  sequenced genome, and seem to be emerging as new potential candidates for model  organisms in various studies.

They are increasingly often included in  two major research aspects: biomedical and environmental studies.

In our study, a mouse PD model was  established induced by the intraperitoneal injection of paraquat (5 mg/kg and  10 mg/kg) every three days (10 times). We determined differential expression of  lncRNA AK039862 and its potential targeted genes Pafah1b1/Foxa1 in PD mouse  model, then we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to visualize the  cellular distribution of AK039862. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and  overexpression plasmids were designed for knockdown or overexpression of  AK039862. To simulate the coexisting dopaminergic cells and microglia cells in  vitro, we applied several non-contact co-culture models, including conditioned  medium and Transwell co-culture systems. Cytotoxicity of PQ was evaluated using  bv2 cells with the concentrations: 30, 60 μM, and mn9d cells with the  concentrations: 50, 100 μM. As a result, we depicted multiple interesting  individual and interactive features of inflammatory lncRNA AK039862 involved in  PQ-induced cellular functional effects. First, we detected that AK039862  contributed to the neuronal injury process in PQ-treated mice and co-localization  of AK039862 with dopaminergic cells in vivo. And interestingly, we demonstrated  that PQ significantly inhibited microglia and dopaminergic cells proliferation  and microglia migration in vitro. Further research indicated that the PQ-induced  low expression of AK039862 rescued microglia proliferation and migration  inhibition via the AK039862/Pafah1b1/Foxa1 pathway.

One  component frequently found in current products against harmful species to crops  is rotenone whose effect under prolonged exposure has been demonstrated to cause  neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The latest reports have  indeed revealed that rotenone promotes Parkinson's in humans, but studies aiming  to show congruent effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio) are lacking. Material and  Methods. In this context, the aim of the present study was to demonstrate how  chronic administration of rotenone for 3 weeks impairs the locomotor activity and  sociability and induces oxidative stress in zebrafish. RESULTS: There were no  statistically significant differences following the analysis of their social  interaction and locomotor tests (p > 0.05). However, several exceptions have been  noted in the control, rotenone, and probiotics groups when we compared their  locomotor activity during the pretreatment and treatment interval (p < 0.05). We  further assessed the role of rotenone in disturbing the detoxifying system as  represented by three enzymes known as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione  peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Despite the fact that there were no  statistically significant changes within SOD and GPx levels between the control  group and rotenone, probiotics, and rotenone + probiotics (p > 0.05), relevant  changes have been observed between the analyzed groups (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005,  respectively). On the other hand, significant differences (p < 0.05) have been  observed for MDA when we analyzed the data between the control group and the  other three groups.

Each  sample was analyzed for mercury (Hg) and 92 organic chemicals including  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs),  polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and Dechlorane Plus and related compounds  (DPs). The rank order of pollutant concentration in all samples was  Hg ≫ Σ(66)PCBs > Σ(17)OCPs > Σ(8)PBDEs > Σ(8)DPs. Positive correlations were  noted among most contaminant groups. Bluefish, pike and tuna steak had the  highest mean Hg (>1 mg/kg). The mean Σ(66)PCBs was highest in pike and bluefish  (>100 ng/g) followed by pollock and mackerel (>40 ng/g). Overall, octopus, shrimp  and tilapia were the least contaminated; while pike, bluefish, and pollock were  the most contaminated. Omega-3 fatty acids were more strongly affiliated with the  organic contaminants than mercury. A risk assessment identified seven types of  fish that should have consumption limitations and six that should not be  consumed. For these seafoods, consumption advice based on Hg levels would  adequately protect health. In the survey participants, 17% of seafood mass  consumed is from types of fish that should be limited to 1 or 2 meals/week, while  7% of the seafood mass consumed comes from types that should not be consumed at  all. This work adds additional contaminants to the profile of health risks  resulting from fish consumption among Asian Americans, which can be used in  interventions aimed at conserving consumption of healthy fish while avoiding  contaminants.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152214,"*Environmental Pollutants;*Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis;*Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis;Animals;Asian;Asian People;Chicago;Fish consumption;Fishes;Flame retardants;Food Contamination/analysis;Humans;Mercury;Organochlorine pesticides;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Risk/benefit analysis;Seafood/analysis;United States",NA,NA,persistent and toxic chemical pollutants in fish consumed by asians in chicago united states,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental animal studies complement epidemiological studies to  help determine the cause-and-effect relationship between chronic adult  insecticide exposure and behavioral dysfunction. With the zebrafish model, we  examined short and long-term neurobehavioral effects of exposure to either an  organochlorine insecticide, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or an  organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). Adult fish were exposed  continuously for either two or 5 weeks (10-30 nM DDT, 0.3-3 μM CPF), with short-  and long-term effects assessed at 1-week post-exposure and at 14 months of age  respectively. The behavioral test battery included tests of locomotor activity,  tap startle, social behavior, anxiety, predator avoidance and learning. Long-term  effects on neurochemical indices of cholinergic function were also assessed. Two  weeks of DDT exposure had only slight effects on locomotor activity, while a  longer five-week exposure led to hypoactivity and increased anxiety-like diving  responses and predator avoidance at 1-week post-exposure. When tested at  14 months of age, these fish showed hypoactivity and increased startle responses.  Cholinergic function was not found to be significantly altered by DDT. The  two-week CPF exposure led to reductions in anxiety-like diving and increases in  shoaling responses at the 1-week time point, but these effects did not persist  through 14 months of age. Nevertheless, there were persistent decrements in  cholinergic presynaptic activity. A five-week CPF exposure led to long-term  effects including locomotor hyperactivity and impaired predator avoidance at  14 months of age, although no effects were apparent at the 1-week time point.  These studies documented neurobehavioral effects of adult exposure to chronic  doses of either organochlorine or organophosphate pesticides that can be  characterized in zebrafish. Zebrafish provide a low-cost model that has a variety  of advantages for mechanistic studies and may be used to expand our understanding  of neurobehavioral toxicity in adulthood, including the potential for such  toxicity to influence behavior and development during aging.",,10.1016/j.ntt.2019.106853,"Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism;Aging;Animals;Anxiety-related behavior;Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Brain Chemistry/*drug effects;Brain/*drug effects/metabolism;Chlorpyrifos/*toxicity;DDT;DDT/*toxicity;Female;Insecticides/*toxicity;Male;Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism;Neurobehavioral toxicology;Zebrafish;Adult",NA,NA,adult exposure to insecticides causes persistent behavioral and neurochemical alterations in zebrafish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In adults, exposure  to the pesticide did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a  marked decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental  treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion, since  baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at all  conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish adults did not show their natural preference  for the dark environment.

The role of Petroselinum crispum essential oil  (PEO) supplementation in mitigating the resulted neurotoxic insult was also  investigated. The acute toxicity study revealed that the 96-h LC(50) of BF is  6.81 μg/L, and varying degrees of behavioral changes were recorded in a  dose-dependent manner. The subchronic study revealed reduction of dissolved  oxygen and increased ammonia in aquaria of BF-exposed fish. Clinical signs  revealed high degree of discomfort and aggressiveness together with reductions in  survival rate and body weight gain. The levels of monoamines in brain, and GABA  and amino acids in serum were reduced, together with decreased activities of  Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and acetylcholine esterases (AchE). The activities of  antioxidant enzymes were also diminshed in the brain while oxdative damage and  DNA breaks were elevated.

Immunological  responses were examined at different organizational levels, from individuals to  gene expression. No negative effects of PD were noted on the Fulton index nor on  the liver or spleen somatic indices (LSI; SSI) before viral infection, but the  infectious stress seems to generate a weak but significant decrease in Fulton and  LSI values, which could be associated with consumption of energy reserves. During  the viral challenges, the distribution of cumulative mortality was slightly  different between infected groups. The impact of the virus on fish previously  contaminated by PD started earlier and lasted longer than controls. The  proportion of seropositive fish was lower in the fish group exposed to PD than in  the control group, with similar quantities of anti-IHNV antibodies secreted in  positive fish, regardless of the treatment.

DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective  study, we included 25 patients (31 eyes) with paraquat-induced ocular surface  injury, who attended the Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University  between October 2008 and October 2013. The patients were split into two groups  according to whether or not received heparin eye drops. The clinical data were  compared between the two groups, i.e. clinical histories, results of  examinations, treatments and outcomes. RESULTS: Eleven patients (group A, 15  eyes) received prompt irrigation with 0.9% saline every two hours, 0.1%  pranoprofen eye drops four times a day, 20% autologous serum every two hours,  recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor eye-gel two times a day, oral  vitamin C 2.0 g and prednisone 30 mg daily. Fourteen patients (group B, 16 eyes)  received additional treatment with heparin eye drops. Ten eyes in group A and  seven eyes in group B developed a pseudomembrane on the ocular surface at  significantly different rate (mean ± SD) of 1.20 ± 1.01 and 0.43 ± 0.51,  respectively (t = 2.66, p = 0.01). Seven eyes among 10 had a pseudomembrane  reoccurred in group A while none had a pseudomembrane reoccurred in group B  (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.01). No significant differences were seen in the  duration of epithelial recovery between the two groups: 15.13 ± 5.13 days in  group A and 16.81 ± 5.56 days in group B (t = 0.87, p = 0.39). After the  treatment, mild corneal opacity and pannus were observed in five patients of  group A and four patients of group B, without any significant difference between  the two groups (p = 0.70).

In this article, we provided an overview of recent studies addressing  human health effects of methylmercury, which we searched using the PubMed of the  US National Library of Medicine. The following suggestions were obtained for  low-level methylmercury exposure: (1) In recent years, the proportion of human  studies addressing methylmercury has tended to decrease. (2) Prenatal exposure to  methylmercury through fish intake, even at low levels, adversely affects child  development after adjusting for polychlorinated biphenyls and maternal fish  intake during pregnancy, whereas maternal seafood intake has some benefits. (3)  Long-term methylmercury exposure through consumption of fish such as bigeye tuna  and swordfish may pose a potential risk of cardiac events involving sympathovagal  imbalance. (4) In measuring methylmercury levels in preserved umbilical cord  collected from inhabitants born in Minamata areas between 1945 and 1989, the  elevated concentrations (≥1 mg/g) were observed mainly in inhabitants born  between 1947 and 1968, and the peak coincided with the peak of acetaldehyde  production in Minamata.

These effects at the encephalic level appear to derive from the  interference of major signaling factors such as histamine (HA) neuroreceptor  subtypes (H(1-4)R). HA is one of the main biogenic amine neuronal system  responsible for regulatory homeostatic functions, including sleep-wake rhythms  and motor activities. Recently, interests have begun to focus attention on toxic  effects of some heavy metals, i.e., cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and how they are  capable of eliciting motor dysfunctions via HAergic receptor subtypes.  Interestingly, subtype 2 (H(2)R) proved to be a preferential target of heavy  metal-dependent altered locomotor maneuvers, as displayed by its specific  antagonist (cimetidine)-inducing non-synchronous swimming activities (Santos et  al., 2003, Pharmacol Biochem Behav 75:25-33). Conversely, although the  preferential H(3)R antagonist (thioperamide) did not interfere with normal  swimming behaviors, it surprisingly did ameliorate heavy metal-dependent  hyperactive states (Giusi et al., 2008, Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 227:248-256). In  the case of the xenoestrogens atrazine and endosulfan, their actions tend to  mostly account for feeding alterations through hypothalamic H(3)R-dependent  mechanisms.

A cluster randomized trial assessed  the impact of using biological control tools (guppy fish, pyriproxyfen (PPF), and  Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities in combination), which  would be used in a value comparison to traditional chemical control tools. Given  these new intervention methods, a qualitative assessment was designed in order to  represent the quality of understanding, acceptance, and implementation by  participants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 103 participants in 12  Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and nine In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) were included  in the study. The majority of participants in intervention villages (50 out of  80) preferred guppy fish over other vector control methods due to ease of use and  rearing, quick reproduction and propensity to eat larvae. A substantial number of  participants (11 out of 40) in intervention villages with PPF favored it due to  long-lasting effectiveness, lack of smell and easy maintenance. Participants  showed high demand for both interventions and were willing to pay between 100-500  riel (0.03-0.13 USD). Nearly all participants perceived that the interventions  resulted in a reduction in Aedes mosquitos (both adults and immatures) and dengue  cases. The presence of larvae in the water despite the use of PPF was a source of  concern for some participants, although this was overcome in some cases with  proper health education through health volunteers. Interpersonal communication  through health volunteers was the most favorite method of transmitting prevention  messages. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The community led COMBI strategy resulted in  high acceptance and perceived effectiveness of the interventions in target  villages. Health volunteers are an effective and accepted channel of  communication to engage communities, disseminate information and promote  behavioral change at the household and community level.

We demonstrated that even short-term exposure (96 h) to dimoxystrobin  alters fish gills reducing the surface available for gas exchange and inducing  severe alterations encompassing three reaction patterns: circulatory disturbance  and both regressive and progressive changes. Furthermore, we revealed that this  fungicide impairs the expression of key enzymes involved in osmotic and acid-base  regulation (Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and AQP3) and the defensive response against  oxidative stress (SOD and CAT).

After 6h exposure fish  showed a transient reduction in superoxide dismutase and catalase activity. RDT  also inhibited glutathione-S-transferase, after 6 and 24h of exposure.

Up-regulation of several genes was  more evident in ARG1-and CIT-fed fish, though pro-inflammatory cytokines were  down-regulated by CIT dietary treatment. Following immune stimulation, seabass  fed ARG1 showed a decrease in neutrophils and monocytes circulating numbers. On  the other hand, expression of 17 selected immune and inflammatory responses genes  was barely affected by dietary treatments. Based on the analyzed parameters,  results suggest an active role of dietary arginine/citrulline supplementation in  modulating immune defences that seem to translate into a suppressed immune  repertoire, mostly at the cell response level.

Some studies,  mostly in fish, demonstrated that GBH caused oxidative stress in non-target  animals. However, only few information is available on the GBH effects in the  antioxidant and stress proteins of many other organisms, such as freshwater  crustaceans. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of environmentally  relevant GBH concentrations on the relative transcript expression (RTE) of the  superoxide dismutase (sod1), catalase (cat), selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase (gpx), glutathione-S-transferase (gst), thioredoxin (txn), heat shock  protein (hsp70 and hsp90) in the hepatopancreas of the ecologically important  freshwater prawn Macrobrachium potiuna.

Male and female prawns were exposed  to three Roundup WG® concentrations (0.0065, 0.065 and 0.28 mg of glyphosate/L)  and a control group (0.0 mg/L) for 7 and 14 days. In general, males had an  under-expression of the studied genes, indicating an oxidative stress and  possible accumulation of ROS in the hepatopancreas. In the opposite, females had  an overexpression of the same genes, indicating a more robust antioxidant system,  in order to cope with the possible ROS increase after Roundup WG® exposure.  Therefore, results confirmed that gender could be a confounding factor in  ecotoxicological assessment of GBH effects.

Paper forms are still often used to register such data.  Manual double data entry (DDE) has been defined as the gold standard for  transferring data to an electronic format but is laborious and costly. Automated  form processing (AFP) is an alternative, but validation in a clinical context is  warranted. The study objective was to examine and validate a local hospital AFP  setup. METHODS: Patients over 18 years of age who were scheduled for knee or hip  replacement at Stavanger University Hospital from 2014 to 2017 who answered PROMs  were included in the study and contributed PROM data. All paper PROMs were  scanned using the AFP techniques of optical mark recognition (OMR) and  intelligent character recognition (ICR) and were processed by DDE by health  secretaries using a data entry program. OMR and ICR were used to capture  different types of data. The main outcome was the proportion of correctly entered  numbers, defined as the same response recorded in AFP and DDE or by consulting  the original paper questionnaire at the data field, item, and PROM level.  RESULTS: A total of 448 questionnaires from 255 patients were analyzed. There was  no statistically significant difference in error proportions per 10 000 data  fields between OMR and DDE for data from check boxes (3.52 95% confidence  interval (CI) 2.17 to 5.72 and 4.18 (95% CI 2.68-6.53), respectively P = .61).  The error proportion for ICR (nine errors) was statistically significantly higher  than that for DDE (two errors), that is, 3.53 (95% CI 1.87-6.57) vs 0.78 (95% CI  0.22-2.81) per 100 data fields/items/questionnaires; P = .033. OMR (0.04% errors)  outperformed ICR (3.51% errors; P < .001), Fisher's exact test. CONCLUSIONS: OMR  can produce an error rate that is comparable to that of DDE. In our setup, ICR is  still problematic and is highly dependent on manual validation.

Tannic acid (TAN), a  glucosyl compound found in gallnuts, has previously been shown to antagonize  heavy metal toxicity, antioxidant activity, and inflammation. However, it is  unclear whether TAN can antagonize ATR-induced Grass carp hepatocytes  (L8824 cells) cytotoxicity. Therefore, we treated L8824 cells with  3 μg mL(-1) ATR for 24 h to establish a toxic group model. The experimental data  of flow cytometry and AO/EB staining together showed that the ratio of apoptosis  and necrosis in L8824 cells after ATR exposure was significantly higher than that  in the control group. Furthermore, RT-qPCR showed that inflammatory factors  (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, INF-γ) were up-regulated and antimicrobial peptides  (hepcidin, β-defensin and LEAP2) were induced down-regulated in L8824 cells,  leading to immune dysfunction. The measurement results of oxidative  stress-related indicators showed that the levels of ROS and MDA increased after  ATR exposure, the overall anti-oxidative system was down-regulated. Western  blotting confirmed that TNF-α/TNFR 1-related genes were also up-regulated. This  indicates that ATR stimulates oxidative stress in L8824 cells, which in turn  promotes the binding of TNF-α to TNFR 1. In addition, TRADD, FADD, Caspase-3,  P53, RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL were found to be significantly up-regulated by Western  blotting and RT-qPCR. Conditioned after ATR exposure compared to controls.

rayyan-1227190855,"Biologic, Chemical, and Radiation Terrorism Review.",2024,1,1,StatPearls,,NA,NA,,"Williams, Mollie and Armstrong, Lisa and Sizemore, Daniel C.",,eng,StatPearls Publishing,Treasure Island (FL),"Terrorism is the intentional use of indiscriminate violence to create fear and terror as a means to achieve an ideological, financial, religious, or political  aim. It is often used against non-combatant targets. Terror tactics may include  biologic, chemical, nuclear, or explosive events. Biologic Bioterrorism is the  intentional release of biological agents to cause illness or death in humans,  animals, or plants. These agents may be bacteria, fungi, toxins, or viruses. They  may be naturally occurring or human-modified. The agents are typically found in  nature, but they may be altered in a laboratory to increase their resistance to  antibiotics, and ability to spread in the environment. Biological and chemical  agents may be spread through the air, food, or water. Terrorists use biological  agents because they are often difficult to detect and illness onset may be  delayed for hours to days increasing dispersal. The challenge with bioweapons is  that they may affect both enemy and friendly forces, and do not discriminate  between combatants and civilians.  In the last 100 years, the United States and  the international community have experienced multiple acts of bioterrorism which  have targeted civilians. World War I: Germany launched a biological sabotage  campaign in France, Romania, Russia, and the United States by infecting horses  and mules with glanders. World War II: Japanese biological weapons attacks in  China, testing botulism, anthrax, and plague. 1972: Two college students, Allen  Schwander and Stephen Pera, were arrested for planning to poison the Chicago  water supply with typhoid bacteria. 1979: Anthrax leak from chemical weapons  research facility, Sverdlosk, Soviet Union. 1984: The Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh  followers in Oregon attempted to affect a local election by infecting doorknobs  and salad bars in restaurants with Salmonella typhimurium bacteria. 1993: Aum  Shinrikyo religious group released anthrax in Tokyo. 2001: Anthrax-laced of  infectious anthrax were delivered to news media offices and the US Congress.  Chemical During World War I there was widespread use of chemical weapons  resulting in many deaths, both military and civilian. The atrocities experienced  on all sides of this conflict led to the 1925 Geneva Protocol, prohibiting the  use of chemical and biological weapons in war. While most modern states are  either signatories to, or voluntarily abide by, this treaty and subsequent United  Nations resolutions, there have been a few instances of chemical weapos use more  recently. Iraqi forces utilized organophosphate neurotoxins against several  targets in 1987-1988 in the war with the Islamic Republic of Iran on both  military and civilan targets. In 2017, the Syrian government was accused of using  nerve agents and chlorine munitions against the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the  ongoing civil war. Nuclear To date, other than the dropping of nuclear bombs by  the United States to end World War II, there have been no acts of nuclear attack  or nuclear terrorism. Nuclear terrorism is an act of terrorism in which a  terrorist organization detonates a nuclear device. The possibility of terrorist  organizations using nuclear is considered plausible as terrorists could acquire a  nuclear weapon. However, despite thefts of small amounts of fissile material,  there is no credible evidence any terrorist group has succeeded in obtaining the  necessary multi-kilogram critical mass amounts of weapons-grade plutonium  required to make a nuclear weapon. Explosive Traditional small-arms munitioins  and improvised explosive devices are among the most common agents used in  terrorist actions. Explosive devices and arms can be stolen or purchased, as was  seen in the 2015 attacks on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. More commonly  they are manufactured as improvised explosive devices and hidden, such as the  1988 Pan Am flight from Lockerbie, Scotland, the 2004 bombings of the Madrid  subway, or the 2013 bombings of the Boston marathon race in the United States.  Terrorism Definitions What is terrorism? What is a mass casualty incident? The  United Nations definition of terrorism describes it as “an anxiety-inspiring  method of repeated violent action, employed by (semi-) clandestine individual,  group, or state actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal, or political reasons,  whereby—in contrast to assassination—the direct targets of violence are not the  main targets.”. The Department of Defense defines terrorism as “the unlawful use  of violence or threat of violence, often motivated by religious, political, or  other ideological beliefs, to instill fear and coerce governments or societies in  pursuit of goals that are usually political.” . The Federal Emergency Management  Agency defines terrorism as “the use of force or violence against persons or  property in violation of the criminal laws of the United States for purposes of  intimidation, coercion, or ransom. Terrorists often use threats to create fear  among the public, to try to convince citizens that their government is powerless  to prevent terrorism, and to get immediate publicity for their cause”. . The US  Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force and  violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the  civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or  social objectives.”. A mass casualty incident is defined terrorist act that  generates more patients than available resources can manage using routine  procedures. Terrorism is generally considered to be the use of force or violence  outside the law to create fear among citizens with the intent to coerce some sort  of action. Health professionals should be aware bioterrorism is a perfect vehicle  for terrorists to strike fear into the hearts and minds of citizens in the hopes  they will bend the will of the people to support their agendas. All health  professionals need to be prepared for this potentially catastrophic event.",,,Terrorism,NA,NA,biologic chemical and radiation terrorism review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sea lamprey populations  were subsequently controlled using an aggressive integrated pest-management  program which employed barriers and traps to prevent sea lamprey from migrating  to their spawning grounds and the use of the piscicides (lampricides)  3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) and niclosamide to eliminate larval sea  lampreys from their nursery streams. Although sea lampreys have not been  eradicated from the Great Lakes, populations have been suppressed to less than  10% of their peak numbers in the mid-1900s. The ongoing use of lampricides  provides the foundation for sea lamprey control in the Great Lakes, one of the  most successful invasive species control programs in the world. Yet, significant  gaps remain in our understanding of how lampricides are taken-up and handled by  sea lampreys, how lampricides exert their toxic effects, and how they adversely  affect non-target invertebrate and vertebrates species. In this review we examine  what has been learned about the uptake, handling and elimination, and the mode of  TFM and niclosamide toxicity in lampreys and in non-target animals, particularly  in the last 10 years. It is now clear that the mode of TFM toxicity is the same  in non-target fishes and lampreys, in which TFM interferes with oxidative  phosphorylation by the mitochondria leading to decreased ATP production.  Vulnerability to TFM is related to abiotic factors such as water pH and  alkalinity, which we propose changes the relative amounts of the bioavailable  un-ionized form of TFM in the gill microenvironment. Niclosamide, which is also a  molluscicide used to control snails in areas prone to schistosomiasis infections  of humans, also likely works by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, but less is  known about other aspects of its toxicology. The effects of TFM include  reductions in energy stores, particularly glycogen and high energy phosphagens.  However, non-target fishes readily recover from sub-lethal TFM exposure as  demonstrated by the rapid restoration of energy stores and clearance of TFM.  Although both TFM and niclosamide are non-persistent in the environment and  critical for sea lamprey control, increasing public and institutional concerns  about pesticides in the environment makes it imperative to explore other means of  sea lamprey control. Accordingly, we also address possible ""next-generation""  strategies of sea lamprey control including genetic tools such as RNA  interference and CRISPR-Cas9 to impair critical physiological processes (e.g.  reproduction, digestion, metamorphosis) in lamprey, and the use of green  chemistry to develop more environmentally benign chemical methods of sea lamprey  control.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.12.012,"*Introduced Species;3-Trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM);Animals;ATP;Bayluscide®;Biotransformation;Gills;Glycogen;Humans;Integrated pest management;Invasive species;Lakes/chemistry;Lampricides;Larva/drug effects;Laurentian Great Lakes;Mitochondria;Niclosamide;Niclosamide/*toxicity;Nitrophenols/*toxicity;Non-target effects;North America;Oxidative phosphorylation;Oxidative Phosphorylation;Pesticides;Pesticides/*toxicity;Petromyzon/*growth & development;Phosphocreatine;Sea lamprey control;Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity",NA,NA,control of invasive sea lampreys using the piscicides tfm and niclosamide toxicology successes future prospects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D. and Rother, Joachim A. and Dewhurst, Charles F. and Lauer, Sasha and King, William J.",,eng,,,"Fipronil is a highly effective, broad-spectrum insecticide with potential value for the control of a wide range of crop, public hygiene, amenity, and veterinary  pests. It can generally be applied at low to very low dose rates to achieve  effective pest control. Application rates vary between 0.6 and 200 g a.i./ha,  depending on the target pest and formulation. It belongs to the phenyl pyrazole  or fiprole group of chemicals and is a potent disrupter of the insect central  nervous system via interference with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA-)  regulated chloride channel. Fipronil degrades slowly on vegetation and relatively  slowly in soil and in water, with a half-life ranging between 36 hr and 7.3 mon  depending on substrate and conditions. It is relatively immobile in soil and has  low potential to leach into groundwater. One of its main degradation products,  fipronil desulfinyl, is generally more toxic than the parent compound and is very  persistent. There is evidence that fipronil and some of its degradates may  bioaccumulate, particularly in fish. Further investigation on bioaccumulation is  warranted, especially for the desulfinyl degradate. The suitability of fipronil  for use in IPM must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In certain situations,  fipronil may disrupt natural enemy populations, depending on the groups and  species involved and the timing of application. The indications are that fipronil  may be incompatible with locust IPM; hence, this possibility requires further  urgent investigation. It is very highly toxic to termites and has severe and  long-lasting negative impacts on termite populations. It thus presents a  long-term risk to nutrient cycling and soil fertility where termites are  ""beneficial"" key species in these ecological processes. Its toxicity to termites  also increases the risk to the ecology of habitats in which termites are a  dominant group, due to their importance as a food source to many higher animals.  This risk has been demonstrated in Madagascar, where two endemic species of  lizard and an endemic mammal decline in abundance because of their food chain  link to termites. Fipronil is highly toxic to bees (LD50 = 0.004 microgram/bee),  lizards [LD50 for Acanthodactylus dumerili (Lacertidae) is 30 micrograms a.i./g  bw], and gallinaceous birds (LD50 = 11.3 mg/kg for Northern bobwhite quail), but  shows low toxicity to waterfowl (LD50 > 2150 mg/kg for mallard duck). It is  moderately toxic to laboratory mammals by oral exposure (LD50 = 97 mg/kg for  rats; LD50 = 91 mg/kg for mice). Technical fipronil is in toxicity categories II  and III, depending on route of administration, and is classed as a nonsensitizer.  There are indications of carcinogenic action in rats at 300 ppm, but it is not  carcinogenic to female mice at doses of 30 ppm. The acute toxicity of fipronil  varies widely even in animals within the same taxonomic groups. Thus,  toxicological findings from results on standard test animals are not necessarily  applicable to animals in the wild. Testing on local species seems particularly  important in determining the suitability of fipronil-based products for  registration in different countries or habitats and the potential associated risk  to nontarget wildlife. Risk assessment predictions have shown that some fipronil  formulations present a risk to endangered bird, fish, and aquatic and marine  invertebrates. Great care should thus be taken in using these formulations where  they may impact any of these endangered wildlife groups. Work in Madagascar has  highlighted field evidence of this risk. The dose levels at which fipronil  produces thyroid cancer in rats are very high and are unlikely to occur under  normal conditions of use. There is also dispute as to whether this is relevant to  human health risk. However, as fipronil is a relatively new insecticide that has  not been in use for long enough to evaluate the risk it may pose to human health,  from data on human exposure to the product, a precautionary approach may be  warranted. The use of some fipronil-based products on domestic animals is not  recommended where handlers spend significant amounts of time grooming or handling  treated animals. In general, it would appear unwise to use fipronil-based  insecticides without accompanying environmental and human health monitoring, in  situations, regions, or countries where it has not been used before, and where  its use may lead to its introduction into the wider environment or bring it into  contact with people. Further work is needed on the impacts of fipronil on  nontarget vertebrate fauna (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) in the  field before the risk to wildlife from this insecticide can be adequately  validated. Further field study of the effects of fipronil on the nutrient cycling  and soil water-infiltration activities of beneficial termites is required to  assess the ecological impacts of the known toxicity of fipronil to these insects.",,10.1007/978-1-4899-7283-5_1,"*Insecticides/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity;*Pyrazoles/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity;Animals;Animals, Wild;Biodegradation, Environmental;Environmental Monitoring/*methods;Humans;Plants/drug effects;Soil Pollutants/analysis;Humanities;Humanism",NA,NA,fipronil environmental fate ecotoxicology and human health concerns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data suggest that a high consumption of fish may  help prevent T2D. On the other hand, fish might also be a potential source of  environmental contaminants which could potentially be a risk factor for T2D.  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential associations between self-reported T2D  and consumption of locally-harvested fish, dietary long-chain omega-3 fatty acids  (n-3FAs) and persistent organic pollutants intake among adult FNs living on  reserve in Ontario. DESIGN: Data from the First Nations Food Nutrition and  Environment Study, which included a cross-sectional study of 1429 Ontario FNs  adults living in 18 communities across 4 ecozones in 2012 were analyzed. Social  and lifestyle data were collected using household interviews. The consumption of  locally-harvested fish was estimated using a traditional food frequency  questionnaire along with portion size information obtained from 24hr recalls.  Fish samples were analyzed for the presence of contaminants including  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  Dietary intakes of DDE and PCBs were estimated using community-specific levels of  DDE/PCBs in fish species. Multiple logistic regression models adjusted for  potential covariates including age, gender, body mass index, physical activity,  total energy intake, smoking, and education were developed. RESULTS: The  prevalence of T2D in Ontario FNs was 24.4%. A significant positive association  between fish consumption of one portion per week and more and T2D compared to no  fish consumption was found (OR=2.5 (95% CI: 1.38-4.58). Dietary DDE and PCBs  intake was positively associated with T2D (OR=1.09 (95%CI: 1.05-1.75) for DDE and  OR=1.07 (95%CI: 1.004-1.27) for PCBs) per unit increase in DDE/PCBs while n-3-FAs  intake, adjusted for DDE/PCBs intake, showed an inverse effect against T2D among  older individuals (OR=0.86 (95% CI: 0.46-0.99). CONCLUSION: Our results support  previous findings that exposure to DDE and PCBs may increase the risk of T2D.

Observations were also made  to assess the influence of such exposure on the behavioral responses of fish to  the flow of a crude skin extract solution from conspecifics, active in social  chemocommunication and producing alarm behaviors. Additive tests were run to  check the behavioral responses of previously unexposed goldfish to the flow of a  solution of atrazine- or diuron-contaminated water, at three concentrations (0.1,  1, 10 mg/L). Significant burst swimming reactions appeared in response to a 24-h  exposure to atrazine, at the lowest concentration tested (0.5 microgram/L). A  24-h exposure to 5 microgram/L atrazine or diuron was found to induce various  significant behavioral alterations in fish. At this concentration, both  herbicides decreased grouping behavior and atrazine also increased surfacing  activity. Herbicide-exposed fish showed a decreased grouping behavior during the  flow of the skin extract solution. Sheltering was also decreased during the flow  of the biological solution in fish exposed to atrazine. Moreover, fish exposed to  diuron clearly displayed attraction responses to the flow of the skin solution.  Previously unexposed fish showed a significant increase in burst swimming  reactions in response to the flow of a solution of atrazine- or  diuron-contaminated water, at all concentrations tested (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L).  Furthermore, the diuron-contaminated flow was found to be significantly  attractive at the highest concentration. These results indicate that a short-term  exposure to a relatively low concentration (5 microgram/L) of atrazine or diuron  can affect various behaviors of fish not only directly but also indirectly by  altering the chemical perception of natural substances of eco-ethological  importance.

As an important factor in  regulating populations, DD is also crucial for understanding risks to populations  from stressors, including its incorporation into population models applied for  this purpose. However, study of density-dependent regulation is challenging  because it can occur through various mechanisms, and their identification in the  field, as well as the quantification of the consequences on individuals and  populations, can be difficult. We conducted a targeted literature review  specifically focusing on empirical laboratory or field studies addressing  negative DD in freshwater fish and small rodent populations, two vertebrate  groups considered in pesticide Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA). We found that  the most commonly recognized causes of negative DD were food (63% of 19 reviewed  fish studies, 40% of 25 mammal studies) or space limitations (32% of mammal  studies). In addition, trophic interactions were reported as causes of population  regulation, with predation shaping mostly small mammal populations (36% of the  mammal studies) and cannibalism impacting freshwater fish (26%). In the case of  freshwater fish, 63% of the studies were experimental (i.e., with a length of  weeks or months). They generally focused on the individual-level causes and  effects of DD, and had a short duration. Moreover, DD affected mostly juvenile  growth and survival of fish (68%). On the other hand, studies on small mammals  were mainly based on time series analyzing field population properties over  longer timespans (68%). Density dependence primarily affected survival in  subadult and adult mammal stages and, to a lesser extent, reproduction (60% vs.  36%). Furthermore, delayed DD was often observed (56%). We conclude by making  suggestions on future research paths, providing recommendations for including DD  in population models developed for ERA, and making the best use of the available  data.

Part 1: Dissolved humic substances (HS) in aquaculture and ornamental fish breeding.,2008,1,1,Environmental science and pollution research international,0944-1344,15,1,17-22,"Meinelt, Thomas and Schreckenbach, Kurt and Pietrock, Michael and Heidrich, Stefan and Steinberg, Christian E. W.",,eng,,,"GOALS, SCOPE AND BACKGROUND: Changing environmental conditions and handling stress are well known to cause chronic or acute stress situations in fish with  subsequent infections. These requires a therapy by means of antibiotics and  chemicals. In contrast to the huge number of pathogens, only a few substances are  permitted for application as therapeutics in German aquaculture. Hence, there  emerges an urgent need for highly effective and residueless alternatives. MAIN  FEATURES: The prophylactic stimulation and training of the defense system of fish  by alternative approaches becomes increasingly necessary. One approach is the  application of dissolved humic substances (HS) of natural or artificial origin.  For example, there exist several reports on the positive effect of HS to fishes.  These effects shall be considered in detail. Furthermore, the impact of HS on the  constitution of parasites and pathogens will be displayed. The reports on this  issue are diverse, if not inconsistent. We try to shed some light on these  discrepancies. The last aspect covered by this review is the outdated paradigm  that calcium ions act as antidotes. In the presence of HS, even the opposite  effect may occur. APPROACH: To overcome old paradigms on HS and their potential  interactions with fish and fish parasites, we reviewed recent international  literature, as well as 'grey' literature. We also include results from own former  and ongoing studies. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: HS are able to increase the  physiological condition of the individuals and to reduce adverse physiological  and histological consequences caused by stress; the mechanism behind remains  obscure. HS detoxify heavy metals and organic pollutants. Damages caused by  several fish pathogens, such as bacteria and parasites, can be repaired more  quickly in the presence of HS. Some parasites--mainly fungi--appear to be  directly affected by HS. Comparing the fungicidal effects of HS from various  sources, evidence is increasing that the aliphatic moiety may be the effective  structures. However, further research is necessary to relate more physiological  and anti-pathogenic effects to the chemical characteristics of HS. CONCLUSIONS:  HS are not real alternatives to strong traditional therapeutics. However, they  show different advantages in repairing secondary, stress induced damages in fish.  The ecophysiological relevance of HS in either aquatic systems or aquaculture is  getting conspicuously. PERSPECTIVES: The lack of therapeutic and antiparasitic  substances in aquaculture requires new strategies and ways of thinking. The  search for alternatives to the 'traditional' chemical therapeutics calls for the  intensive research. Inevitably, this search will lead to an intensive  contemplation on HS as 'health promoting substances' and/or even therapeutics.  Basic research is needed to detect the functional groups of the HS responsible  for the effects observed. Health promoting effects of first investigations made  in vitro to affect pathogens via application of HS and several field studies with  HS raises hopes for a broader utilisation of HS to reduce stress consequences in  fish and fish pathogens residuelessly.",,10.1065/espr2007.08.448,*Humic Substances;Animals;Aquaculture/*methods;Fish Diseases/microbiology/parasitology/*therapy;Fishes/growth & development/*physiology;Breeding,NA,NA,humic substances part 1 dissolved humic substances hs in aquaculture and ornamental fish breeding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of their  relative specificity to insect nicotinic receptors, they are thought to have  reduced risk of neurotoxicity in vertebrates. However, there is scant published  literature concerning the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure of  vertebrates to neonicotinoids. METHODS: Using zebrafish, we investigated the  neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure to imidacloprid, a prototypic  neonicotinoid pesticide. Nicotine was also administered for comparison. Zebrafish  were exposed via immersion in aqueous solutions containing 45 μM or 60 μM of  imidacloprid or nicotine (or vehicle control) from 4h to 5d post fertilization.  The functional effects of developmental exposure to both imidacloprid and  nicotine were assessed in larvae using an activity assay and during adolescence  and adulthood using a battery of neurobehavioral assays, including assessment of  sensorimotor response and habituation in a tactile startle test, novel tank  swimming, and shoaling behavior. RESULTS: In larvae, developmental imidacloprid  exposure at both doses significantly decreased swimming activity. The 5D strains  of zebrafish were more sensitive to both nicotine and imidacloprid than the AB*  strain. In adolescent and adult fish, developmental exposure to imidacloprid  significantly decreased novel tank exploration and increased sensorimotor  response to startle stimuli. While nicotine did not affect novel tank swimming,  it increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli at the low dose. No effects  of either compound were found on shoaling behavior or habituation to a startling  stimulus. DISCUSSION: Early developmental exposure to imidacloprid has both  early-life and persisting effects on neurobehavioral function in zebrafish.

Fish exposed to the mixture of herbicides were hypoactive and  spent more time in the lower parts of the aquaria in comparison to non-exposed  controls, reflecting inhibited swimming activity. Average swimming height of  exposed fish decreased significantly with the number of agoniztic acts, whilst in  control groups there was no significant relationship between the two behaviors.

In  recent decades, the aquaculture sector has experienced a steady growth  postulating as a good alternative for seafood production. However, a social  debate exits about the differential level of pollutants in wild and farmed  species. This study was designed to evaluate the level of pollutants in a  sentinel species: Bogue (Boops boops) associated and non-associated to fish-farm  cages. A total of 82 chemical substances were determined by gas  chromatography-mass spectrometry, including persistent (polychlorobiphenyls  (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)), semi-persistent (bromodiphenyl  ethers (BDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), and emerging  pollutants (such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and UV-filters). In  general, aquaculture-associated bogues showed lower levels of semi-persistent and  emerging pollutants than wild-caught fish, especially when sums were considered.  Thus, sum of BDEs was significantly lower in the aquaculture group (p=0.01). A  similar trend was also observed for benzo(a)anthracene, the UV-filter  2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate and some OPFRs. In the case of persistent  pollutants, the sum of dioxin-like PCBs and sum of DDTs were lower in the group  of wild-caught bogues (p=0.034 and p=0.003, respectively) than in  aquaculture-associated bogues, as previously described for some aquaculture  species. Fish feed appear as an important factor in the uptake of such substances  suggesting a diet intervention to reduce their levels in the aquaculture  products. Another interesting result is that for almost all chemical substances  analyzed, bogues captured near sewage outfalls showed the highest levels of  pollutants, pointing out the need of stringent measures for wastewater treatment  units discharging in coastal areas.

The  hypoactivity, behavioral alterations (decreased avoidance and edge preference  behaviors) and neurotoxicity were found throughout the exposure-recovery  experiments. THCP exposure altered the expression of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-  and serotonin (5-HT)-related genes accompanied by the decrease in GABA and 5-HT  contents. However, after recovery, GABA content returned to the control level,  but 5-HT did not, indicating that only the serotonergic system was persistently  disrupted. Overall, our results suggest that the disruption of the serotonergic  system and oxidative stress may aggravate neurotoxicity and that the former was  the main reason for the depressive-like behavior.

Zebrafish were fed  pellets spiked with 0.03, 0.15, or 1.8μg/g dieldrin for 21days. Behavioral  analysis revealed no difference in exploratory behaviors or those related to  anxiety. Transcriptional networks for T-cell aggregation and selection were  decreased in expression suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of dieldrin,  consistent with other studies investigating organochlorine pesticides. Processes  related to oxidative phosphorylation were also differentially affected by  dieldrin. Quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) using a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap  identified 226 proteins that were different following one or more doses. These  proteins included ATP synthase subunits (mitochondrial) and hypoxia up-regulated  protein 1 which were decreased and NADH dehydrogenases (mitochondrial) and signal  recognition particle 9 which were up-regulated. Thus, proteins affected were  functionally associated with the mitochondria and a protein network analysis  implicated Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease as diseases  associated with altered proteins. Molecular networks related to mitochondrial  dysfunction and T-cell regulation are hypothesized to underlie the association  between dieldrin and PD. These data contribute to a comprehensive transcriptomic  and proteomic biomarker framework for pesticide exposures and neurodegenerative  diseases. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine  pesticide that has been associated with human neurodegenerative disease such as  Parkinson's disease. Dieldrin is ranked 18th on the 2015 U.S. Agency for Toxic  Substances and Disease Registry and continues to be a pesticide of concern for  human health. Transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics (ITRAQ) were employed  to characterize the molecular networks in the central nervous system that are  altered with dietary exposure to dieldrin. We found that transcriptional and  protein networks related to the immune system, mitochondria, and Parkinson's  disease were preferentially affected by dieldrin. The study provides new insight  into the mechanisms of dieldrin neurotoxicity that may explain, in part, the  association between this pesticide and increased risks to neurodegeneration.

It is highly toxic during  all stages of mosquito development, suppresses metamorphosis, and interferes in  insect reproduction and proliferation. Pyriproxyfen and its main metabolite have  been shown to affect brain development in rodents. This compound is employed  mainly to eliminate outbreaks of the genus Aedes, even in potable water. Despite  the increasing number of toxicological studies about larvicides and  insecticides-with an indication of continuous use-there have been few studies  about the effects of pyriproxyfen in non-target species such as fish. This study  evaluated the effects of pyriproxyfen on behavioral, cognitive, and endocrine  parameters in zebrafish. We exposed adult zebrafish to different pyriproxyfen  (Pestanal(®)) concentrations (0.125, 0.675, and 1.75 mg/l) for 96 h. We analyzed  behavioral parameters, memory, cortisol levels, and gene expression of  glucocorticoid receptor (gr) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (crf) after  pyriproxyfen exposure. This exposure did not alter locomotion (distance or mean  speed), anxiety-like behavior (latency to enter to the top zone of the tank or  time in the top zone of the tank), and social or aggressive behavior. However,  there was impaired inhibitory avoidance memory at all tested pyriproxyfen  concentrations. Cortisol levels were reduced in exposed groups when compared to  control or vehicle. However, gr and crf gene expression in pyriproxyfen-treated  animals were unaltered when compared to control or vehicle groups.

This was paralleled by recent reports that multiple other metabolites could  emerge from the degradation of parent DDT by naturally occurring organisms or by  interaction with some heavy metals. Nevertheless, only very few data on the  biological activities of these metabolites are available to date. The objective  of this communication is to evaluate, for the first time, the cytotoxicity,  dioxin-like activity, and estrogenicity of the least-studied DDT metabolites.  METHODS: Four DDT metabolites, p,p'-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1-chloroethylene  (DDMU), p,p'-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1-chloroethane (DDMS),  p,p'-2,2-bis(4-ch1oropheny1)acetonitrile (DDCN), and  p,p'-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)acetic acid (DDA), were selected based on their  presence in environmental samples in Germany such as in sediments from the Mulde  River and Teltow Canal. O,p'-DDT was used as reference in all assays.  Cytotoxicity was measured by neutral red retention with the permanent cell line  RTG-2 of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Dioxin-like activity was determined  using the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deetylase assay. The estrogenic potential was  tested in a dot blot/RNAse protection-assay with primary hepatocytes from male  rainbow trout (O. mykiss) and in a yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay. RESULTS:  All DDT metabolites tested revealed a clear dose-response relationship for  cytotoxicity in RTG-2 cells, but no dioxin-like activities with RTL-W1 cells. The  dot blot/RNAse protection-assay demonstrated that the highest non-toxic  concentrations of these DDT metabolites (50 μM) had vitellogenin-induction  potentials comparable to the positive control (1 nM 17β-estradiol). The  estrogenic activities could be ranked as o,p'-DDT > p,p'-DDMS > p,p'-DDMU >  p,p'-DDCN. In contrast, p,p'-DDA showed a moderate anti-estrogenic effect. In the  YES assay, besides the reference o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDMS and p,p'-DDMU displayed  dose-dependent estrogenic potentials, whereas p,p'-DDCN and p,p'-DDA did not show  any estrogenic potential. DISCUSSION: The reference toxicant o,p'-DDT displayed a  similar spectrum of estrogenic activities similar to 17β-estradiol, however, with  a lower potency. Both p,p'-DDMS and p,p'-DDMU were also shown to have  dose-dependent estrogenic potentials, which were much lower than the reference  o,p'-DDT, in both the vitellogenin and YES bioassays. Interestingly, p,p'-DDA did  not show estrogenic activity but rather displayed a tendency towards  anti-estrogenic activity by inhibiting the estrogenic effect of 17β-estradiol.  The results also showed that the p,p'-metabolites DDMU, DDMS, DDCN, and DDA do  not show any dioxin-like activities in RTL-W1 cells, thus resembling the major  DDT metabolites DDD and DDE. CONCLUSIONS: All the DDT metabolites tested did not  exhibit dioxin-like activities in RTL-W1 cells, but show cytotoxic and estrogenic  activities. Based on the results of the in vitro assays used in our study and on  the reported concentrations of DDT metabolites in contaminated sediments, such  substances could, in the future, pose interference with the normal reproductive  and endocrine functions in various organisms exposed to these chemicals.  Consequently, there is an urgent need to examine more comprehensively the risk of  environmental concentrations of the investigated DDT metabolites using in vivo  studies. However, this should be paralleled also by periodic evaluation and  monitoring of the current levels of the DDT metabolites in environmental  matrices. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: Our results clearly point out the  need to integrate the potential ecotoxicological risks associated with the  ""neglected"" p,p'-DDT metabolites. For instance, these DDT metabolites should be  integrated into sediment risk assessment initiatives in contaminated areas. One  major challenge would be the identification of baseline data for such risk  assessment. Further studies are also warranted to determine possible additive,  synergistic, or antagonistic effects that may interfere with the fundamental  cytotoxicity and endocrine activities of these metabolites. For a more conclusive  assessment of the spectrum of DDT metabolites, additional bioassays are needed to  identify potential anti-estrogenic, androgenic, and/or anti-androgenic effects.",,10.1007/s11356-011-0570-9,"Acetonitriles/chemistry/toxicity;Amides/chemistry/toxicity;Animals;Berlin;DDT/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/toxicity;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/toxicity;Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane/chemistry/toxicity;Endocrine Disruptors/chemistry/*toxicity;Environmental Monitoring/*methods;Estrogens/metabolism;Geologic Sediments/chemistry;Male;Metals, Heavy/analysis;Oncorhynchus mykiss/growth & development/*physiology;Rivers;Sulfones/chemistry/toxicity;Toxicity Tests, Acute/methods;Vitellogenins/analysis/metabolism;Water Pollutants, Chemical/chemistry/*toxicity;Dioxins",NA,NA,toxicity dioxinlike activities and endocrine effects of ddt metabolitesdda ddmu ddms and ddcn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work was conducted to map the One Health landscape in  Africa. METHODS: An assessment of existing One Health initiatives in Sub-Saharan  African (SSA) countries was conducted among selected stakeholders using a  multi-method approach. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to One  Health initiatives were identified, and their influence, interest and impacts  were semi-quantitatively evaluated using literature reviews, questionnaire survey  and statistical analysis. RESULTS: One Health Networks and identified initiatives  were spatiotemporally spread across SSA and identified stakeholders were  classified into four quadrants. It was observed that imbalance in stakeholders'  representations led to hesitation in buying-in into One Health approach by  stakeholders who are outside the main networks like stakeholders from the policy,  budgeting, geography and sometimes, the environment sectors. CONCLUSION:  Inclusion of theory of change, monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and tools  for standardized evaluation of One Health policies are needed for a sustained  future of One Health and future engagements should be outputs- and  outcomes-driven and not activity-driven. National roadmaps for One Health  implementation and institutionalization are necessary, and proofs of concepts in  One Health should be validated and scaled-up. Dependence on external funding is  unsustainable and must be addressed in the medium to long-term. Necessary policy  and legal instruments to support One Health nationally and sub-nationally should  be implemented taking cognizance of contemporary issues like urbanization,  endemic poverty and other emerging issues. The utilization of current  technologies and One Health approach in addressing the ongoing pandemic of  COVID-19 and other emerging diseases are desirable. Finally, One Health  implementation should be anticipatory and preemptive, and not reactive in  containing disease outbreaks, especially those from the animal sources or the  environment before the risk of spillover to human.",,10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100325,"ACDC, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention;Africa;AFROHUN, Africa One Health University Network;AMR, Antimicrobial resistance;AMU, Arab Maghreb Union;Animal health;Antimicrobial resistance;AU-IBAR, African Union Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources;AU, African Union;BMGF, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation;BSL-3, Biosafety level 3 laboratory;CEMAC, Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa;CILSS, Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel;COCTU, Control of Trypanosomiasis in Uganda;COMESA, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa;COVID-19, Coronavirus (SARS CoV 2) disease 2019;EAC, East African Community;ECCAS, Economic Community of Central African States;ECOWAS, Economic Community of West African States;Emerging and re-emerging diseases;Environment health;FAO, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations;FELTP, Field Epidemiology & Laboratory Training Program;Food safety;GARC, Global Alliance for Rabies Control;GHSA-ZDAH, Global Health Security Agenda's Zoonotic Diseases and Animal Health in Africa;GIS, Geographic information system;HPAI H5N1, Highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N1;IGAD, Intergovernmental Authority on Development;ILRI, International Livestock Research Institute;IRA, Institute for Resource Assessment;ISAVET, Frontline In-Service Applied Veterinary Epidemiology Training;KEMRI, Kenya Medical Research Institute;M & E, monitoring and evaluation;MALF, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries;MoH, Ministry of Health;MRU, Mano River Union;NISCAI, National Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee on Avian Influenza;NTCAI, National Technical Committee on Avian Influenza;OH, One Health;OIE, World Organization for Animal Health;One health (OH);PMP, Progressive Management Pathway;Public health;RECs, regional economic commissions;RVF, Rift Valley fever;SACIDS, Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance;SACU, South African Customs Union;SADC, South African Development Community;SSA, Sub-Saharan Africa;SWOT, Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats;Toxicosis;UNICEF, United Nations Children's Fund;UNSIC, United Nations System Influenza Coordination;USAID, United States Agency for International Development;WAEMU, West African Economic and Monetary Union;WHO, World Health Organization;ZDU, Zoonotic Disease Unit.;Zoonosis",NA,NA,the one health landscape in subsaharan african countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study  reports the acute toxicity, bioconcentration, elimination and antioxidant  response of fluralaner in zebrafish. All LC(50) values of fluralaner to zebrafish  were higher than 10 mg L(-1) at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. To study the  bioconcentration and elimination, the zebrafish were exposed to sub-lethal  concentrations of fluralaner (2.00 and 0.20 mg L(-1)) for 15 d and then held 6 d  in clean water. The results showed medium BCF of fluralaner with values of 12.06  (48 h) and 21.34 (144 h) after exposure to 2.00 and 0.20 mg L(-1) fluralaner,  respectively.

After  exposure in 2.00 mg L(-1) fluralaner, the enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GST,  GSH-PX, CarE and content of MDA were measured. Only CAT and CarE activities were  significantly regulated and the others stayed at a stable level compared to the  control group. Meanwhile, transcriptional expression of CYP1C2, CYP1D1, CYP11A  were significantly down-regulated at 12 h exposed to 2.00 mg L(-1) of fluralaner.

This study was aimed to investigate the impact of commonly used  pesticides (deltamethrin) on the blood and tissue oxidative stress level in  catfish (Clarias gariepinus); in addition to the protective effect of  α-tocopherol on deltamethrin induced oxidative stress. Catfish were divided into  three groups, 1st control group include 20 fish divided into two tanks each one  contain 10 fish, 2nd deltamethrin group, where Fish exposed to deltamethrin in a  concentration (0.75 μg/l) and 3rd Vitamin E group, Fish exposed to deltamethrin  and vitamin E at a dose of 12 μg/l for successive 4 days.Serum, liver, kidney and  Gills were collected for biochemical assays. Tissue oxidative stress biomarkers  malondialdhyde (MDA) and catalase activity in liver, kidney and gills tissues,  serum liver enzymes (ALT and AST), serum albumin, total protein, urea and  creatinine were analysed. RESULTS: Our results showed that 48 h. exposure to 0.75  μg/l deltamethrin significantly (p < 0.05) increased lipid peroxidation (MDA) in  the liver, kidney and gills while catalase activity was significantly decreased  in the same tissues. This accompanied by significant increase in serum ALT, AST  activity, urea and creatinine and a marked decrease in serum albumin and total  proteins. CONCLUSIONS: It could be concluded that deltamethrin is highly toxic to  catfish even in very low concentration (0.75 μg/l). Moreover the effect of  deltamethrin was pronounced in the liver of catfish in comparison with kidneys  and gills. Moreover fish antioxidants and oxidative stress could be used as  biomarkers for aquatic pollution, thus helping in the diagnosis of pollution.

This class of compounds, if present in  the environment, can cause toxicity to different species such as bees and  gammarids, although little is known about vertebrates such as fish. In addition,  several substances have been reported in the environment that can cause damage to  aquatic species, such as potassium perchlorate (KClO(4)), if exposed to high  concentrations or for long periods. Often, the co-presence of different  contaminants can cause a synergistic action in terms of toxicity to fish. In the  present study, we first analyzed different concentrations of IMI (75, 100 and 150  mg/L) and KClO(4) (1, 1.5 and 5 mM) to highlight the morphological effects at 96  hpf and, subsequently, chose two nontoxic concentrations to evaluate their  co-exposure and the pathway involved in their co-toxicity. Morphological  alteration, mucus production, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression related to  intestinal function and oxidative stress were measured.

We hypothesized that chemical  exposure impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics of RGCs, which then may lead to  downstream consequences for neuroestrogen production. Here we provide proof of  concept that mitochondria of RGCs can be perturbed by fungicides. We isolated  RGCs from a mixed sex population of goldfish (Carassius auratus) and measured  metabolic capacity of primary cells to a model mitotoxin fluazinam, a  broad-spectrum fungicide that inhibits mitochondria electron transport chain (or  ETC) Complex I. Using immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR, we demonstrate that  the goldfish primary cell cultures are highly enriched for glia after multiple  passages. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that glia treated with >25 μM fluazinam  for 24 and 48-h showed reduced viability. As such, metabolic assays were  conducted with non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.25-12.5 μM). Fluazinam did not  affect oxygen consumption rates of RGCs at 24 h, but after 48 h, oligomycin  induced ATP-linked respiration was decreased by both 6.25 and 12.5 μM fluazinam.  Moreover, concentrations as low as 0.25 μM disrupted the mitochondrial membrane  potential of RGCs, reflecting strong uncoupling effects of the fungicide on  mitochondria. Here we provide proof of concept that mitochondrial bioenergetics  of teleostean RGCs can be responsive to agrochemicals. Additional studies are  required to address low-dose exposures in vivo and to determine if metabolic  disruption impairs neuroendocrine functions of RGCs.

The risk assessment showed that the  consumption of tilapia muscle from the Ayuquila-Armería basin does not represent  a risk for the population. Diazinon concentrations were relatively low compared  to the other pesticides concentrations, but its toxic characteristics were the  ones that most negatively influenced the risk assessment.

A. and Pacheco, M.",,eng,,,"The glyphosate-based herbicide, Roundup, is among the most used pesticides worldwide. Due to its extensive use, it has been widely detected in aquatic  ecosystems representing a potential threat to non-target organisms, including  fish. Despite the negative impact of this commercial formulation in fish, as  described in literature, the scarcity of studies assessing its genotoxicity and  underlying mechanisms is evident. Therefore, as a novel approach, this study  evaluated the genotoxic potential of Roundup to blood cells of the European eel  (Anguilla anguilla) following short-term (1 and 3 days) exposure to  environmentally realistic concentrations (58 and 116 microg/l), addressing also  the possible association with oxidative stress. Thus, comet and erythrocytic  nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) assays were adopted, as genotoxic end points,  reflecting different types of genetic damage. The pro-oxidant state was assessed  through enzymatic (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase  and glutathione reductase) and non-enzymatic (total glutathione content)  antioxidants, as well as by lipid peroxidation (LPO) measurements. The Roundup  potential to induce DNA strand breaks for both concentrations was demonstrated by  the comet assay. The induction of chromosome breakage and/or segregational  abnormalities was also demonstrated through the ENA assay, though only after  3-day exposure to both tested concentrations. In addition, the two genotoxic  indicators were positively correlated. Antioxidant defences were unresponsive to  Roundup. LPO levels increased only for the high concentration after the first day  of exposure, indicating that oxidative stress caused by this agrochemical in  blood was not severe. Overall results suggested that both DNA damaging effects  induced by Roundup are not directly related with an increased pro-oxidant state.  Moreover, it was demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations of  Roundup can pose a health risk for fish populations.",,10.1093/mutage/geq038,Anguilla/blood/*metabolism;Animals;Antioxidants/metabolism;Cell Nucleus/drug effects/pathology;Comet Assay;DNA Damage;Environmental Exposure/*analysis;Erythrocytes/drug effects/pathology;Glycine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity;Glyphosate;Herbicides/*toxicity;Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects;Mutagens/*toxicity;Reactive Oxygen Species/*toxicity;Time Factors;Reactive Oxygen Species,NA,NA,european eel anguilla anguilla genotoxic and prooxidant responses following shortterm exposure to roundupa glyphosatebased herbicide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Usually,  one miRNA may regulate many genes as its targets, while one gene may also be  targeted by many miRNAs. We previously demonstrated that cyb561d2, whose protein  product is involved in cell defense, and chemical stress, is targeted by miR-155  in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) when exposed to fipronil  (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl)  sulphinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile). Microcosm Targets prediction showed that  the cyb561d2 gene is also highly possibly targeted by miR-194a, miR-216b,  miR-429, and miR-499. These interactions need to be further validated  experimentally. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR-194a,  miR-216b, miR-429, miR-499 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish and investigated whether  these four miRNAs could regulate the expression of cyb561d2 in both mRNA and  protein levels. The expression of cyb561d2 was upregulated in both mRNA and  protein level in a dose-dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil, and  miR-216b and miR-499 were downregulated concurrently, whereas there was no  significant changes were observed in the expression level of miR-194a and  miR-429. The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR-216b and miR-499  interacted with cyb561d2 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR), miR-194a and miR-429  did not stimulate degradation of cyb561d2 mRNA. The expression of cyb561d2 was  reduced in both mRNA and protein level when ZF4 cells were transfected with  miR-499 mimic, whereas expression level of both mRNA and protein was increased  when endogenous miR-499 was inhibited by transfection with miR-499 inhibitor.  Likewise, the mRNA and protein level of cyb561d2 was affected by treatment with  the mimics and the inhibitor of miR-216b. In contrast, when ZF4 cells were  transfected with a mimic of miR-194a or miR-429, the expression of cyb561d2 mRNA  was not significantly changed. As a result, cyb561d2 is targeted by miR-155,  miR-216b and miR-499 upon fipronil exposure, and miR-194a and miR-429 can not  target cyb561d2.

Atrazine  is known to be an endocrine disruptor and its effects on gonads have been  extensively reported, but the toxic action on other organs is poorly documented.  In this paper, we investigated the toxicity of atrazine on the gills and spleens  of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The median lethal concentration  (LC(50)), capable of killing one-half of the test animals was calculated, and  sublethal concentrations of atrazine were used in a semistatic and subchronic  assay. The following four experimental groups were formed: control not exposed to  atrazine, a group exposed to 1 ppm atrazine for 15 days, a group exposed to 2 ppm  for 7 days, and a group exposed to 2 ppm for 15 days. The concentrations were  verified during the study by high performance liquid chromatography. The gills  and spleens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and histopathological  findings were made. The Perls technique was used on the spleens to identify  hemosiderin, lipofuscin, and melanin pigments in the cells from melanomacrophage  centres (MMCs). The spleens were submitted to proliferating cell nuclear antigen  (PCNA) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunohistochemistry, and  morphometry was used to assess splenocyte proliferation and melanomacrophage iNOS  expression. Finally, a colorimetric assay for caspase-3 was performed on the  spleens to identify apoptosis. Vascular and structural alterations, such as  venous sinus congestion, aneurysm, hemorrhage, pillar cell hypertrophy,  disarrangement of secondary lamellae, and epithelial lifting were observed in the  gills. The frequency of individuals with aneurysms was higher in the groups  treated with 2 ppm than in other groups. Atrazine had an immunomodulatory effect  on the spleen, observed by the alteration in the percentage of red and white  pulp, alteration of the MMC area, changes in the melanomacrophage pigment  content, slight iNOS suppression, decrease in splenocyte proliferation under  1 ppm atrazine, and increased caspase 3 activity under 2 ppm atrazine after 7 and  15 d.

This  study established in Nile tilapia models suggests that T cells play a critical  role in resisting Edwardsiella piscicida infection via cytotoxicity and are  essential for IgM(+) B cell response. CD3 and CD28 monoclonal antibody  crosslinking reveals that full activation of tilapia T cells requires the first  and secondary signals, while Ca(2+) -NFAT, MAPK/ERK, NF-κB, and mTORC1 pathways  and IgM(+) B cells collectively regulate T cell activation. Thus, despite the  large evolutionary distance, tilapia and mammals such as mice and humans exhibit  similar T cell functions. Furthermore, it is speculated that transcriptional  networks and metabolic reprogramming, especially c-Myc-mediated glutamine  metabolism triggered by mTORC1 and MAPK/ERK pathways, underlie the functional  similarity of T cells between tilapia and mammals. Notably, tilapia, frogs,  chickens, and mice utilize the same mechanisms to facilitate  glutaminolysis-regulated T cell responses, and restoration of the glutaminolysis  pathway using tilapia components rescues the immunodeficiency of human Jurkat T  cells.

However, in the  last 50 years, the effects of chemicals on the behavior of model species have  been actively investigated. Progressively, behavioral endpoints were incorporated  into neurotoxicological screening protocols, and these functional outcomes are  now routinely used to identify and determine the potential neurotoxicity of  chemicals. Behavioral assays in adult zebrafish provide a standardized and  reliable means to study a wide range of behaviors, including anxiety, social  interaction, learning, memory, and addiction. Behavioral assays in adult  zebrafish typically involve placing the fish in an experimental arena and  recording and analyzing their behavior using video tracking software. Fish can be  exposed to various stimuli, and their behavior can be quantified using a variety  of metrics. The novel tank test is one of the most accepted and widely used tests  to study anxiety-like behavior in fish. The shoaling and social preference tests  are useful in studying the social behavior of zebrafish. This assay is  particularly interesting since the behavior of the entire shoal is studied. These  assays have proven to be highly reproducible and sensitive to pharmacological and  genetic manipulations, making them valuable tools for studying the neural  circuits and molecular mechanisms underlying behavior. Additionally, these assays  can be used in drug screening to identify compounds that may be potential  modulators of behavior. We will show in this work how to apply behavioral tools  in fish neurotoxicology, analyzing the effect of methamphetamine, a recreational  drug, and glyphosate, an environmental pollutant. The results demonstrate the  significant contribution of behavioral assays in adult zebrafish to the  understanding of the neurotoxicological effects of environmental pollutants and  drugs, in addition to providing insights into the molecular mechanisms that may  alter neuronal function.",,,"*Behavior, Animal/physiology;*Zebrafish/physiology;Animals;Anxiety/chemically induced;Behavior Rating Scale;Social Behavior",NA,NA,neurotoxicity assessment in adult danio rerio using a battery of behavioral tests in a single tank,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is well known as a pivotal  regulator of innate immunity. In this study, we have rescued and characterized  two members of the MIF family, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (OfMIF) and  D-Dopachrome tautomerase (OfDDT) from rock bream, Oplegnathus fasciatus. The  deduced OfMIF and OfDDT protein sequences revealed the presence of the catalytic  oxidoreductase (CXXC), motif. They also possessed highly conserved proline (P(2))  and lysine residues (K(33)), responsible for their isomerase and tautomerase  functions. Rock bream MIF and DDT homologues shared higher identity with fish  homologues and also with mammals and occupied a distinct position in the  phylogenetic tree, depicting their evolutionary conservation. The spatial  expression analysis revealed the highest expression of both OfMIF and OfDDT in  liver, while portraying constitutive expression in other tissues. The recombinant  proteins purified using the Escherichia coli system revealed potent  oxidoreductase activity against insulin with both dithiothreitol and glutathione  as reducing agents. Stimulation of rock bream head kidney cells with recombinant  OfMIF and OfDDT proteins induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines like  tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-1β  (IL-1β). These results together suggest their involvement in rock bream immune  defense and this study on the novel MIF family member DDT from rock bream will  pave the way for further studies of this homologue in other teleosts and  delineate its multiple functions.",,10.1016/j.fsi.2013.05.003,"Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Aquaculture;Base Sequence;Cloning, Molecular;Cytokines;D-Dopachrome tautomerase;DNA, Complementary/genetics/metabolism;Escherichia coli/genetics;Expressional analysis;Gene Expression Regulation;Head Kidney/immunology;Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism;Macrophage migration inhibitory factor;Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Oxidoreductase assay;Perciformes/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism;Phylogeny;Proinflammatory cytokines;Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary;Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism;RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism;Sequence Alignment/veterinary;MSH Release-Inhibiting Hormone",NA,NA,characterization of mif family proteins mif and ddt from rock bream oplegnathus fasciatus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fish were  exposed to a concentration of 2 ppm atrazine for 15 days, which was verified by  high-performance liquid chromatography. The livers were stained with hematoxylin  and eosin and histopathological data were collected. In addition, they were  submitted to immunohistochemistry for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). A  maximum variation of 45% (static) and 12.5% (semi-static) was observed between  the observed and nominal atrazine concentration. Nuclear and cytoplasmic changes  were observed in both experimental models. Hepatocytes from the livers of the  static system showed a degenerative appearance, while in the semi-static system,  intense cytoplasmic vacuolization and necrosis were observed. iNOS positive cells  were identified only in macrophages in the hepatocytes of fish in the semi-static  system.

Obtaining  more information is important since the aquatic environment is widely exposed to  pollution involving neurotoxic compounds likely to cause phenotypic changes that  can affect animal fitness. We explored how early exposure to the pyrethroid  insecticide permethrin (PM), a compound known for its neurotoxicity, influences  the phenotypic traits in both larvae and adults of the self-fertilizing fish  mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus. First, we investigated immediate  effects of PM on larvae after one-week exposure (0-7 days post-hatching): larvae  exposed to high concentration (200 µg.L(-1)) grew less, were less active, had  negative thigmotaxis and were less likely to capture prey than control  individuals and those exposed to low concentration (5 µg.L(-1)). No difference  was found between treatments when considering oxygen consumption rate and  cortisol levels. Persistent effects of early exposure to PM on adults (147-149  days post-hatching) showed that fish previously exposed to high concentration of  PM overcompensated growth, leading them to finally be longer and heavier than  fish from other treatments. Moreover, we evidenced that levels of cortisol  interacted with early PM exposure to affect behaviours during dyadic contests.  Fish were more likely to initiate fighting behaviours and were more likely to be  aggressive when they have low pre-contest levels of cortisol, but these effects  were less pronounced when individuals were exposed to PM. This study shows that  PM can have both immediate and persistent effects on phenotypic traits in a  self-fertilizing vertebrate and suggests that a pyrethroid can interact with  hormones action to affect animal behaviour.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106543,"*Cyprinodontiformes;*Killifishes;*Water Pollutants, Chemical/toxicity;Animals;Behaviour;Cortisol;Fish;Hydrocortisone;Larva;Life-history traits;Neurotoxic compound;Permethrin/toxicity;Phenotype",NA,NA,earlylife exposure to permethrin affects phenotypic traits in both larval and adult mangrove rivulus kryptolebias marmoratus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of the first prokaryotic member of the so-called MMBLs (monocot  mannose-binding lectins) or GNA (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin) lectin family and  discovery of its genus-specific killer activity in the Gram-negative bacteria  Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas has added yet another kind of toxin to this group of  allelopathic molecules. This novel feature is reminiscent of the protective  function, on the basis of antifungal, insecticidal, nematicidal or antiviral  activity, assigned to or proposed for several of the eukaryotic MMBL proteins  that are ubiquitously distributed among monocot plants, but also occur in some  other plants, fish, sponges, amoebae and fungi. Direct bactericidal activity can  also be effected by a C-type lectin, but this is a mammalian protein that limits  mucosal colonization by Gram-positive bacteria. The presence of two divergent  MMBL domains in the novel bacteriocins raises questions about task distribution  between modules and the possible role of carbohydrate binding in the specificity  of target strain recognition and killing. Notably, bacteriocin activity was also  demonstrated for a hybrid MMBL protein with an accessory protease-like domain.  This association with one or more additional modules, often with predicted  peptide-hydrolysing or -binding activity, suggests that additional bacteriotoxic  proteins may be found among the diverse chimaeric MMBL proteins encoded in  prokaryotic genomes.

For this purpose,  fish were randomly distributed in three independent groups (three replicates per  group) and each was fed the corresponding diet: a control diet (CTRL) formulated  to meet the established amino acid requirements for the species; a diet  supplemented with methionine at 0.5% of feed weight relative to the CTRL diet  (8.2% of methionine concentration above CTRL); and one supplemented with  methionine at 1% of feed weight to the CTRL diet (11.8% of methionine  concentration above CTRL). To evaluate the immune status of fish fed with each of  the diets before being submitted to bacterial infection fish were sampled from  each group at 2 and 4 weeks after the beginning of feeding.

Results show that methionine dietary supplementation  improves seabass cellular immune status without evidence of activation of  pro-inflammatory mechanisms.

Accordingly, a great deal of previous  research has characterized physiological mechanisms of toxicity in animals  exposed to contaminants. In contrast, effects of contaminants on fish behaviour  are less frequently studied. Because behaviour links physiological function with  ecological processes, behavioural indicators of toxicity appear ideal for  assessing the effects of aquatic pollutants on fish populations. Here we consider  the many toxicants that disrupt complex fish behaviours, such as predator  avoidance, reproductive, and social behaviours. Toxicant exposure often  completely eliminates the performance of behaviours that are essential to fitness  and survival in natural ecosystems, frequently after exposures of lesser  magnitude than those causing significant mortality. Unfortunately, the  behavioural toxicity of many xenobiotics is still unknown, warranting their  future study. Physiological effects of toxicants in the literature include  disruption of sensory, hormonal, neurological, and metabolic systems, which are  likely to have profound implications for many fish behaviours. However, little  toxicological research has sought to integrate the behavioural effects of  toxicants with physiological processes. Those studies that take this  multidisciplinary approach add important insight into possible mechanisms of  behavioural alteration. The most commonly observed links with behavioural  disruption include cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition, altered brain  neurotransmitter levels, sensory deprivation, and impaired gonadal or thyroid  hormone levels. Even less frequently studied are the implications of interrelated  changes in behaviour and physiology caused by aquatic pollutants for fish  populations.

For this purpose, the amplified product corresponding to  the protein inosine-5'-monophophate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) from Phdp, was cloned  into the expression vector pcDNA™6.2/C-EmGFP-GW obtaining the DNA vaccine named  as pPDPimpdh. The correct transcription and protein expression was verified at  48 h post tansfection in HEK293 cells. Chitosan nanoparticles (CS-TPP NPs) were  prepared by ionotropic gelation and their features were appropriate for use as  oral delivery system. Therefore, pPDPimpdh was protected with chitosan CS-TPP NPs  throughout complex coacervation method giving as a result a DNA nanovaccine  referred as CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs.

The relative percentage survival (RPS) for  pPDPimpdh vaccinated groups was 6.25%, probably due to its degradation in the  digestive tract. RPS value obtained for CS-TPP NPs and CS-TPP+pPDPimpdh NPs was  40% and antibodies were observed in both cases.

To better elucidate the mode of action of dieldrin in the  hypothalamus, this study measured neurotransmitter levels and examined the  transcriptomic response in female largemouth bass (LMB) to an acute treatment of  dieldrin. Male and female LMB were injected with either vehicle or 10 mg  dieldrin/kg and sacrificed after 7 days. There were no significant changes in  dopamine or DOPAC concentrations in the neuroendocrine brain of males and females  after treatment but GABA levels in females were moderately increased 20-30% in  the hypothalamus and cerebellum.

Since  the target molecule of diazinon is typically the acetylcholinesterase enzyme  (AChE), the existence of a non-neuronal cholinergic system in leukocytes makes  them susceptible to alterations by diazinon. Therefore, the aim of this work was  to evaluate the activity of AChE, acetylcholine (ACh) concentration, and the  expression of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChR) and muscarinic ACh receptors  (mAChR) in spleen mononuclear cells (SMNC) of Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) exposed  in vitro to diazoxon, a diazinon metabolite. SMNC were exposed in-vitro to 1 nM,  1 μM, and 10 μM diazoxon for 24 h. The enzyme activity of AChE was then evaluated  by spectrophotometry, followed by ACh quantification by ultra-performance liquid  chromatography. Finally, mAChR and nAChR expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR. The  results indicate that AChE levels are significantly inhibited at 1 and 10 μM  diazoxon, while the relative expression of (M3, M4, and M5) mAChR and (β2) nAChR  is reduced significantly as compared against SMNC not exposed to diazoxon.  However, ACh levels show no significant difference with respect to the control  group.

However, there is a paucity of information regarding its acute/chronic effects on  obesity, lipid homeostasis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, especially regarding  the underlying molecular mechanisms in humans. Herein, we investigated the  effects of TCPP exposure (5-25 mg/L) on lipid homeostasis in larval and adult  zebrafish (Danio rerio). TCPP exposure caused remarkable lipid-metabolism  dysfunction, which was reflected in obesity and excessive lipid accumulation in  zebrafish liver. Mechanistically, TCPP induced the over-expression of  adipogenesis genes and suppressed the expression of fatty-acid β-oxidation genes.  Consequently, excess lipid synthesis and deficient expenditure triggered  oxidative damage and an inflammation response by disrupting the antioxidant  system and over-expressing proinflammatory cytokine. Based on high-throughput  transcriptome sequencing, we found that TCPP exposure led to enrichment of  several pathways involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation, as well as  several genes related to pathways of cancer. Notably, increasing expressions of  Ki-67 and 53BP1 proteins, which are reliable biomarkers for recognition and risk  prediction of cellular proliferation in cancer cells, were observed in liver  tissues of adult zebrafish. These results imply that chronic TCPP exposure  triggers a potential risk of hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC) progression.

Therefore, the purpose  of this trial is to estimate the impact of guppy fish (guppies), in combination  with the use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen (Sumilarv® 2MR), and Communication for  Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities to reduce entomological indices in Cambodia.  METHODS/DESIGN: In this cluster randomized controlled, superiority trial, 30  clusters comprising one or more villages each (with approximately 170 households)  will be allocated, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive either (1) three interventions  (guppies, Sumilarv® 2MR, and COMBI activities), (2) two interventions (guppies  and COMBI activities), or (3) control (standard vector control). Households will  be invited to participate, and entomology surveys among 40 randomly selected  households per cluster will be carried out quarterly. The primary outcome will be  the population density of adult female Aedes mosquitoes (i.e., number per house)  trapped using adult resting collections. Secondary outcome measures will include  the House Index, Container Index, Breteau Index, Pupae Per House, Pupae Per  Person, mosquito infection rate, guppy fish coverage, Sumilarv® 2MR coverage, and  percentage of respondents with knowledge about Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue.  In the primary analysis, adult female Aedes density and mosquito infection rates  will be aggregated over follow-up time points to give a single rate per cluster.  This will be analyzed by negative binomial regression, yielding density ratios.  DISCUSSION: This trial is expected to provide robust estimates of the  intervention effect. A rigorous evaluation of these vector-control interventions  is vital to developing an evidence-based dengue control strategy and to help  direct government resources.

Each  sample was analyzed for mercury (Hg) and 92 organic chemicals including  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs),  polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and Dechlorane Plus and related compounds  (DPs). The rank order of pollutant concentration in all samples was Hg »  Σ(66)PCBs > Σ(17)OCPs > Σ(8)PBDEs > Σ(8)DPs. Positive correlations were noted  among most contaminant groups. Bluefish, pike, tuna steak, and albacore tuna had  the highest mean Hg (>300 ng/g). The mean Σ(66)PCBs was highest in pike and  bluefish (>100 ng/g) followed by pollock and mackerel (>40 ng/g). Overall,  octopus, shrimp and tilapia were the least contaminated; while pike, bluefish,  and pollock were the most contaminated. Omega-3 fatty acids were more strongly  affiliated with the organic contaminants than mercury. A risk assessment  identified seven types of fish that should have consumption limitations and six  that should not be consumed. For these seafoods, consumption advice based on Hg  levels would adequately protect health, except for mackerel.

GPx activity was found to be significantly induced 12 h  after the exposure to 2.5 mg/L of glyphosate as compared with the control group.  A similar degree of induction was also observed for CAT activity but not for SOD.  For long term exposure, except for the GPx activity after exposure to 5 mg/L of  glyphosate, the activities of all other enzymes remained on a par with the  control group. It was also observed that the levels of gene expression of these  enzymes were not comparable with each other. It is assumed that these differences  might result from the effect of glyphosate before translation and the possible  reasons for this scenario are also discussed. The results of swimming performance  are found to be consistent with responses of the antioxidant system, and they are  attributed to the energy metabolism. The data are also supported with liver  histopathology analysis.",,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.09.027,"*Swimming;Animals;Antioxidant enzymes;Behaviour;Catalase/metabolism;Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/enzymology/pathology/*veterinary;Energy Metabolism/drug effects;Fish Diseases/*chemically induced/enzymology/pathology;Gene expression;Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism;Glutathione Reductase/metabolism;Glycine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity;Glyphosate;Histopathology;Liver/drug effects/enzymology/*pathology;Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects;Oncorhynchus mykiss/*physiology;Pesticides/*toxicity;Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism;Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity;Liver;Antioxidants",NA,NA,effects of glyphosate on juvenile rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss transcriptional and enzymatic analyses of antioxidant defence system histopathological liver damage and swimming performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The acute toxicity of  Roundup (particularly of glyphosate) to animals is considered to be low according  to the World Health Organization, but the extensive use of Roundup may still  cause environmental problems with negative impact on wildlife, particularly in an  aquatic environment where chemicals may persist for a long time. Therefore, we  studied the effects of Roundup on markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant  defense in goldfish, Carassius auratus. The fish were given 96 h exposure to  Roundup at concentrations of 2.5-20 mg L(-1). Exposure to Roundup did not affect  levels of lipid peroxides (LOOH) in goldfish brain or liver, and in kidney only  the 10 mg L(-1) treatment elevated LOOH by 3.2-fold. Herbicide exposure also had  no effect on the concentrations of protein thiols or low molecular mass thiols in  kidney, but selective suppression of low molecular mass thiols by 26-29% occurred  at some treatment levels in brain and liver. Roundup exposure generally  suppressed the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione  S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  in fish tissues. For example, SOD activities were reduced by 51-68% in brain,  58-67% in liver and 33-53% in kidney of Roundup treated fish. GST activity  decreased by 29-34% in liver.

The objective of this study was to compare the impact of initial  feedstock properties (moisture content and/or C/N ratio) on stabilization rate by  AED and AD and soil amendment characteristics of the final products. Green and  food wastes were considered as they are two of the main contributors to municipal  organic waste. Stabilization rate was assessed by measurement of CH(4) and CO(2)  evolution for AD and AED, respectively. For AD, CH(4) yield showed a second-order  relationship with the C/N content (P < 0.05); the optimal C/N ratio indicated by  the relationship was 25.5. For AED, cumulative CO(2) evolution values were  significantly affected by the C/N ratio and moisture content of the initial  feedstock (P < 0.05). A response surface model showed optimal AED stabilization  for a C/N of 25.6 and moisture of 64.9% (wet basis). AD final products presented  lower soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) but lower humification degree and  aromaticity than the products from AED. This lower stability may lead to further  degradation when amended to soil. The results suggest that composting feedstocks  with higher C/N produces an end-product with higher suitability for soil  amendment.

The susceptible species were:  striped snakehead (Channa striata), giant gourami (Osphronemus gouramy) and  silver barb [Barbodes (= Puntius) gonionotus], and the resistant species was Nile  tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish of all species were acclimatised to either  low temperature (20 degrees C +/- 1.6) at which EUS is known to occur, or to high  temperature (32 degrees C +/- 5.0) at which EUS does not occur, except for giant  gouramis which were only studied at low temperature. The respiratory burst of the  macrophages was assessed in the presence of A. invadans or the stimulant phorbol  myristate acetate (PMA), and compared to that of controls. Anti-A. invadans  antibody concentrations were assessed in all species except silver barbs. All  assays were carried out at the same temperature, regardless of the temperature  that the fish were kept at. Macrophages of all species other than snakeheads  inhibited fungal germination at both temperatures, though only silver barb and  gourami macrophages could inhibit germling growth. PMA increased the respiratory  burst in nearly all cases. The respiratory burst in the presence of A. invadans  was consistently lower than that of controls, though the difference was only  significant in the case of snakeheads. The respiratory burst of all macrophage  treatments was higher at a low temperature. Except in the case of PMA-stimulated  macrophages, regressions between respiratory burst and inhibitory action were  only found in susceptible species, suggesting that the respiratory burst is  important in those species, but is unable to prevent the proliferation of A.  invadans. Serum inhibited fungal germination in all cases other than low  temperature tilapia, indicating that the EUS resistance of tilapia is not due to  the serum. Inhibition of germling growth by serum only occurred in silver barbs  and gourami. Heated serum did not inhibit germination in any case except that of  high temperature snakehead, and in fact stimulated germination in the case of  tilapia. Heating serum did not affect the growth inhibiting activity of silver  barbs and gouramis, but it stimulated growth in some groups. At high temperatures  snakeheads had high anti-A. invadans antibody concentrations, which may explain  the inhibitory activity of their heated serum.

Our results showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) of CAT at pesticide  concentrations of 0.150 and 0.300 μg/L, but no significant difference was  observed in TBARS or GSH in any exposed group (p > 0.05) in comparison to the  control. A significant increase was observed in the MNF in the group exposed to  0.3 μg/L of cypermethrin compared to negative control (p < 0.05). Finally, P.  lineatus proved to be a sensitive species to the commercial formulations of  cypermethrin and that CAT and MNF are effective indicators of these toxic  effects.",,10.1080/01480545.2018.1497643,"Animals;Antioxidants/metabolism;biomarkers;catalase;Catalase/metabolism;Characiformes;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Erythrocytes/drug effects/metabolism;Fish;Glutathione/metabolism;Insecticides/administration & dosage/*toxicity;Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects;liver tissue;micronucleus frequency;Micronucleus Tests;Oxidative Stress/*drug effects;Pyrethrins/administration & dosage/*toxicity;Oxidative Stress;Insecticides",NA,NA,stress oxidative and genotoxicity in prochilodus lineatus valenciennes 1836 exposed to commercial formulation of insecticide cypermethrin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variations in  environmental conditions, as those caused by contaminants, may lead to  neurochemical impairments altering the pattern of the behavioural repertoire of  the species. Atrazine (ATZ) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture that is  frequently detected in surface water, affecting non-target species. The zebrafish  is a valuable model organism to assess behavioural and neurochemical effects of  different contaminants since it presents a robust behavioural repertoire and also  all major neurotransmitter systems described for mammalian species. The goal of  this study was to evaluate the effects of subchronic ATZ exposure in defensive  behaviours of zebrafish (shoaling, thigmotaxis, and depth preference) using the  split depth tank. Furthermore, to investigate a putative role of cholinergic  signalling on ATZ-mediated effects, we tested whether this herbicide alters  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain and muscle preparations. Fish were  exposed to ATZ for 14days and the following groups were tested: control (0.2%  acetone) and ATZ (10 and 1000μg/L). The behaviour of four animals in the same  tank was recorded for 6min and biological samples were prepared. Our results  showed that 1000μg/L ATZ significantly increased the inter-fish distance, as well  as the nearest and farthest neighbour distances. This group also presented an  increase in the shoal area with decreased social interaction. No significant  differences were detected for the number of animals in the shallow area, latency  to enter the shallow and time spent in shallow and deep areas of the apparatus,  but the ATZ 1000 group spent significantly more time near the walls. Although ATZ  did not affect muscular AChE, it significantly reduced AChE activity in brain.  Exposure to 10μg/L ATZ did not affect behaviour or AChE activity. These data  suggest that ATZ impairs defensive behaviours of zebrafish, which could be  related to its action on brain cholinergic neurotransmission. Moreover, the use  of the split depth tank could be an alternative strategy to assess group  behaviour and depth preference after exposure to chemical compounds.",,10.1016/j.ntt.2014.05.006,"Acetylcholinesterase;Acetylcholinesterase/*metabolism;Animals;Atrazine;Atrazine/administration & dosage/*toxicity;Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Brain/*drug effects/enzymology;Exploratory activity;Herbicides/administration & dosage/*toxicity;Shoaling behaviour;Zebrafish;Brain",NA,NA,subchronic atrazine exposure changes defensive behaviour profile and disrupts brain acetylcholinesterase activity of zebrafish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 'golden humped tench' or tinca  gobba dorata, a variety of tench-Tinca tinca (L., 1758)-traditionally bred in  artificial ponds called peschiere in Poirino highlands, northwest Italy, is one  of such species. The aim of the study is to investigate the traditional farming  of the golden humped tench, the associated knowledge, practices, and gastronomy,  and to discuss the changes that the tench, the ponds, and their role in the local  social-ecological system are going through. METHODS: The data analyzed were  collected in different locations of Poirino highlands during May-September 2021.  Fieldwork included semi-structured interviews (n = 23) with current and former  tench farmers about the breeding and gastronomy of the tench and the management  of the peschiere. The interviewees' selection occurred through an exponential  non-discriminative snowball sampling, and interview transcripts were  qualitatively analyzed through inductive thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The  golden humped tench has been farmed for centuries in ponds used also to water  livestock and to irrigate cultivated fields, and managed by every peasant  household in the area. This integrated aquaculture system is underpinned by  detailed knowledge on the peschiera ecosystem and on the tench life cycle and  supports a gastronomic knowledge that is part of the local heritage. The ongoing  process of gastronomic valorization of the tench is sustaining the role of the  fish in locals' livelihoods and as a marker of regional identity, but it is also  transforming tench farming, already threatened by livelihood change, pesticides,  and invasive species, in controversial ways. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that ponds and  tenches are core elements of the local social-ecological system, defining the  cultural landscape and engendering a form of regional identity around them.  Studying integrated aquaculture systems and associated knowledge and practices is  relevant to design sustainable systems of food production and to address  possibilities of conservation of biodiversity and livelihoods in aquatic  environments.",,10.1186/s13002-022-00529-5,*Cyprinidae;*Ponds;Animals;Aquaculture;Biodiversity;Ecosystem;Ethnoecological knowledge;Ethnoichthyology;Gastronomic heritage;Peschiera;Sustainable fish production;Tinca Gobba Dorata;Northwestern United States;Italy,NA,NA,integrated pond aquaculture and regional identity ethnobiology of the golden humped tench of poirino highlands northwest italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Head kidney of fish is an important defense organ, playing  a vital part in antagonizing exogenous hazardous matter. The objective of this  study was to characterize toxic mechanisms of GLY in head kidney of common carp  based on transcriptome profiling. After 45-days exposure of GLY at  environmentally relevant concentrations, juvenile common carp were used as  experimental subjects to analyze how the head kidney responded to GLY. The  transcriptome profiling identified 1381 different expressed genes (DEGs) between  the control and exposure groups (5 and 50 mg/L). Functional analysis of DEGs  substantiated over-representative pathways mainly involving cellular stress  responses, cell proliferation and turnover, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and  innate immune processes in both treated groups compared with the control group.  Predicted network of gene regulation indicated that GLY-induced tp53 played a  vital role in linking a battery of signals. Furthermore, the expression of 10  candidate genes by qRT-PCR aligned with transcriptional profiling. In addition,  western blotting analysis confirmed that GLY-induced apoptosis and cellular  proliferation were closely involved in activating MAKP signaling pathway and  lipid metabolism pathway in both treated groups. Collectively, these data  demonstrate that head kidney of juvenile common carp mainly leverages  upregulation of genes related to cell proliferation and turnover, apoptosis, and  lipid metabolism to combat sub-chronic exposure of GLY.

The functions of Ly-6 proteins  are diverse since their low sequence homology. Currently, the function of Ly-6D,  a member of Ly-6 family proteins, is completely unknown in teleost. In the  present study, we identified and characterized a Ly-6D homologue (named PoLy-6D)  from the teleost fish Paralichthys olivaceus and examined its immune function.  PoLy-6D possesses a hydrophobic signal peptide, a LU domain including a conserved  ""LXCXXC"" motif in N-terminus and a ""CCXXXXCN"" motif in C-terminus. Under normal  physiological condition, PoLy-6D expression distributes in all the examined  tissues, the highest three tissues are successively spleen, head kidney, and  blood. When infected by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and  viral pathogen, PoLy-6D expression was induced and the patterns vary with  different types of microbial pathogens infection and different immune tissues. In  vitro experiment showed recombinant PoLy-6D (rPoLy-6D) inhibited the lysis of  rabbit red blood cells by serum and selectively improved bacterial survival in  serum. After serum were treated by antibody of rPoLy-6D, bacteriostatic effect of  serum was obviously enhanced. These results indicate the importance of PoLy-6D as  a complement regulator. rPoLy-6D possessed the binding activity to multiple  bacteria but did not exhibit antimicrobial activities. The interaction between  rPoLy-6D and bacteria suggests that PoLy-6D is involved in host clearance of  pathogens probably by serving as a receptor for pathogens. Overexpression of  PoLy-6D in vivo promoted the host defense against invading E. piscicida.

The estuarine environment imposes stressful conditions to  the organisms that inhabit it, and this situation can alter their sensitivity to  many pollutants. The specificity of some biomarkers like metallothionein tissue  concentration is discussed in virtue of its dependence on salinity, which is  highly variable in estuaries. Examples of cholinesterase activity measurements  are also provided and criteria to select sensitive enzymes to detect pesticides  and toxins are discussed. Regarding non-specific biomarkers, toxic responses in  terms of antioxidant defenses and/or oxidative damage are also considered in this  review, focusing on invertebrate species. In addition, the presence of an  antioxidant gradient along the body of the estuarine polychaete Laeonereis acuta  (Nereididae) and its relationship to different strategies, which deal with the  generation of oxidative stress, is reviewed. Also, unusual antioxidant defenses  against environmental pro-oxidants are discussed, including the mucus secreted by  L. acuta. Disruption of osmoregulation by pollutants is of paramount importance  in several estuarine species. In some cases such as in the estuarine crab  Chasmagnathus granulatus, there is a trade off between bioavailability of  toxicants (e.g. metals) and their interaction with key enzymes such as  Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase. Thus, the metal effect on  osmoregulation is also discussed in the present review.

Brain tissues of the adult fish were dissected and subjected to  biochemical analyses of the antioxidant response, oxidative stress, superoxide  dismutase (SOD), and neurotransmitter levels. Zebrafish larvae exposed to PBZ  exhibited locomotion hyperactivity with a high burst movement and swimming  pattern. In adult zebrafish, PBZ resulted in anxiolytic exploratory behavior,  while no significant results were found in social interaction, shoal making, and  predator avoidance behaviors. Interestingly, high dose PBZ exposure significantly  compromised the innate aggressive behavior of the adult fish. Biochemical assays  for oxidative stress, antioxidant response, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed  significant reductions in their relative contents. In conclusion, for the first  time, our behavior assays revealed that chronic PBZ exposure induced behavioral  alterations in both larvae and the adult zebrafish. Because PBZ is a widely-used  plant growth regulator, we suggest that it is necessary to conduct more thorough  tests for its biosafety and bioaccumulation.",,10.3390/ijerph17134632,"*Anti-Anxiety Agents/toxicity;*Zebrafish;Animals;antioxidant response;anxiolytic behavior;Behavior, Animal;biosafety;Ecosystem;Exploratory Behavior/*drug effects;Larva/drug effects;Locomotion;Motor Activity;Paclobutrazol;Triazoles;Anti-Anxiety Agents",NA,NA,waterborne exposure of paclobutrazol at environmental relevant concentration induce locomotion hyperactivity in larvae and anxiolytic exploratory behavior in adult zebrafish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fish full life cycle (FLC) tests are  generally required only when toxicity, bioaccumulation, and persistence triggers  are met or when there is a suspicion of potential endocrine-disrupting  properties. This regulatory approach is based on a relationship between the  results of fish ELS and FLC studies first established more than 35 yrs ago.  Recently, this relationship has been challenged by some regulatory authorities,  and it has been recommended that more substances should undergo FLC testing. In  addition, a project proposal has been submitted to the Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) to develop a fish partial life cycle (PLC)  test including a reproductive assessment. Both FLC and PLC tests are animal- and  resource-intensive and technically challenging and should therefore be undertaken  only if there is clear evidence that they are necessary for coming to a  regulatory decision. The present study reports on an analysis of a database of  paired fish ELS and FLC endpoints for plant protection product active substances  from European Union draft assessment reports and the US Environmental Protection  Agency Office of Pesticide Programs Pesticide Ecotoxicity Database. Analysis of  this database shows a clear relationship between ELS and FLC responses, with  similar median sensitivity across substances when no-observed-effect  concentrations (NOECs) are compared. There was also no indication that  classification of a substance as a mammalian reproductive toxicant leads to more  sensitive effects in fish FLC tests than in ELS tests. Indeed, the response of  the ELS tests was generally more sensitive than the most sensitive reproduction  NOEC from a FLC test. This analysis indicates that current testing strategies and  guidelines are fit for purpose and that there is no need for fish full or partial  life cycle tests for most plant protection product active substances.",,10.1002/etc.2630,"Agrochemicals/pharmacology/*toxicity;Animals;Chronic;Early life stage;Ecotoxicology/*methods;Endocrine Disruptors/*toxicity;Endpoint Determination;European Union;Fish;Fishes/growth & development/*physiology;Freshwater;Full life cycle;Life Cycle Stages/*drug effects;Mammals/physiology;Pesticide;Plants/*drug effects;Reproduction/*drug effects;Saltwater;Time Factors;United States;United States Environmental Protection Agency;Plants, Toxic",NA,NA,an evaluation of fish early life stage tests for predicting reproductive and longerterm toxicity from plant protection product active substances,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The co-existence of inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450-dependent  monooxygenases (CYP1A) is typical of complex environmental mixtures and requires  modifications of the in vivo EROD assay: For this end, zebrafish embryos were  used to evaluate the EROD-modifying potentials of common single-compound  exposures as well as binary mixtures with the PAH-type Ah-receptor agonist  β-naphthoflavone. For chemical testing, chlorpyrifos and Aroclor 1254 were  selected; β-naphthoflavone served as maximum EROD induction control. Chlorpyrifos  (≤EC(10)) could be documented to be a strong CYP1A inhibitor causing  characteristic edema-related toxicity. Aroclor 1254 resulted in inhibition of  CYP1A catalytic activity in a concentration- and specific time-dependent manner.  Next to a fast CYP1A induction, CYP1A inhibition could also be detected after 3h  short-term exposure of zebrafish embryos to chlorpyrifos. This communication also  describes techniques for the quantification of fluorescence signals via  densitometry as a basis for subsequent statistical assessment. The co-exposure  approach with zebrafish embryos accounts for the nature of potential interaction  between CYP1A inducers and inhibitors and thus pays tribute to the complexity of  environmental mixtures.

The present study assessed the  biological responses of Colossoma macropomum after exposure to Malathion. We  started determining the lethal concentration, which is the concentration capable  of killing 50% of the subjects in an acute toxicity test (LC(50)-96 h), which was  15.77 ± 3.30 mgL(-1). The fish were, then, exposed to Malathion during 96 h at a  sublethal concentration, 7.30 mgL(-1).

Full-grown  post-vitellogenic ovarian follicles were incubated in vitro with prochloraz,  Luteinizing Hormone (LH), or a combination of prochloraz and LH. The occurrence  of oocyte maturation was assessed by monitoring germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD)  after 62-h in vitro incubation. Experiments were repeated in presence of  actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or trilostane. The effect of prochloraz on the  production of 17,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20βP), the natural  maturation-inducing steroid, was quantified by radioimmunoassay. In addition, the  effect of prochloraz on ovarian expression of 12 genes was monitored by real-time  PCR. Prochloraz (10(-5)M) administered alone was able to induce 100% GVBD in the  most responsive females. The occurrence of GVBD observed after prochloraz  stimulation of follicles originating from various females was similar and highly  correlated with the occurrence of GVBD observed after stimulation with low LH  concentration. In addition, oocyte maturation induced by LH or prochloraz was  totally inhibited by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and trilostane. Similarly to  LH, prochloraz was able to trigger 17,20βP production by the ovarian follicle.  Finally, prochloraz induced the overexpression of genes participating in 17,20βP  production, intercellular communication, and paracrine control of preovulatory  follicular differentiation such as igf, igf2, connexin 43, and 20β hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase (hsbd20). Together, our results demonstrate that prochloraz  administered alone is able to trigger oocyte maturation through the induction of  specific genes, some of them being also triggered by LH.

Edwardsiella  piscicida, a severe fish pathogen, has been shown to encode several thioredoxins  including TrxA, TrxC, and TrxH, but their biological roles remain unknown. In  this study, we characterized TrxH of E. piscicida (named TrxH(Ep)) and examined  its expression and function. TrxH(Ep) is composed of 125 residues and possesses  typical thioredoxin H motifs. Expression of trxH(Ep) was upregulated under  conditions of oxidative stress, iron starvation, low pH, and during infection of  host cells. trxH(Ep) expression was also regulated by ferric uptake regulator  (Fur), an important global regulatory of E. piscicida. Compared to the wild type  TX01, a markerless trxH(Ep) in-frame mutant strain TX01∆trxH exhibited markedly  compromised tolerance of the pathogen to hydrogen peroxide, acid stress, and iron  deficiency. Deletion of trxH(Ep) significantly retarded bacterial biofilm growth  and decreased resistance against serum killing. Pathogenicity analysis shows that  the inactivation of trxH(Ep) significantly impaired the ability of E. piscicida  to invade host cells, reproduce in macrophages, and infect host tissues.  Introduction of a trans-expressed trxH gene restored the lost virulence of  TX01∆trxH. There is likely to be a complex relationship of functional  complementation or expression regulation between TrxH and another two  thioredoxins, TrxA and TrxC, of E. piscicida. This is the first functional report  of TrxH in fish pathogens, and the findings suggest that TrxH(Ep) is essential  for coping with adverse circumstances and contributes to host infection of E.  piscicida.",,10.1186/s13567-019-0645-z,"*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial;*Transcriptome;Adaptation, Physiological/genetics;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism;Edwardsiella/genetics/*pathogenicity/*physiology;Sequence Alignment;Thioredoxin h/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism;Virulence;Chloroplast Thioredoxins;Thioredoxin h;Thioredoxins",NA,NA,thioredoxin h trxh contributes to adversity adaptation and pathogenicity of edwardsiella piscicida,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequences of MCSF have been identified in multiple teleost  species, however, the functional investigations of MCSF were documented in only a  few species. In this study, we examined the biological activity and the  immunomodulatory property of a MCSF homologue, PoMCSF, from Japanese flounder  (Paralichthys olivaceus). Structural analysis showed that PoMCSF possesses  conserved structural characteristics of MCSF proteins, including a signal  peptide, a CSF-1 domain, and a transmembrane region closed to the C-terminal.  Under normal physiological condition, PoMCSF expression distributes in all the  examined tissues, the highest three tissues are blood, muscle, and head kidney.  When infected by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and viral  pathogen, the PoMCSF expression patterns vary with different types of microbial  pathogens infection and different immune tissues. In vitro experiment showed  recombinant PoMCSF promoted the activity of macrophage. In vivo experiment  indicated that PoMCSF overexpression boosted the defensive ability of flounder  against Edwardsiella piscicida, a severe fish pathogen that infects multiple  species of economically important fish, and regulated the expression of multiple  immune-related genes. To explore the relationship between PoMCSF and its receptor  PoMCSFR, anti-PoMCSFR antibody was prepared and PoMCSFR knockdown was conducted.  The neutralization assay showed that when PoMCSFR was neutralized by its  antibody, the role of PoMCSF on host defense against E. piscicida was weakened.  Knockdown of PoMCSFR impaired the phagocytic capacity of macrophages.  Collectively, these findings suggest that PoMCSF plays a crucial role in the  immune defense system of Japanese flounder and the effect of PoMCSF is dependent  on PoMCSFR. This study provides new insights into the biological activity of MCSF  and the relationship between MCSF and MCSFR in teleost.",,10.1016/j.dci.2020.103920,"Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Anti-infectious immunity;Cytokines/genetics;Disease Resistance/*immunology;Edwardsiella tarda/pathogenicity;Enterobacteriaceae Infections/immunology/microbiology/veterinary;Fish Diseases/immunology/microbiology;Fish Proteins/genetics/*immunology;Flatfishes/*immunology;Gene Expression Regulation;Head Kidney/immunology;Immunoregulatory;Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*immunology;Macrophages/immunology;MCSF;MCSFR;Paralichthys olivaceus;Phagocytosis;Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*immunology;Macrophages",NA,NA,macrophage colony stimulating factor mcsf of japanese flounder paralichthys olivaceus immunoregulatory property antiinfectious function and interaction with mcsf receptor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Barry and Taylor, Palmer",,eng,,,"Freeze-frame click chemistry is a proven approach for design in situ of high affinity ligands from bioorthogonal, reactive building blocks and macromolecular  template targets. We recently described in situ design of femtomolar reversible  inhibitors of fish and mammalian acetylcholinesterases (EC 3.1.1.7; AChEs) using  several different libraries of acetylene and azide building blocks. Active center  gorge geometries of those AChEs are rather similar and identical triazole  inhibitors were detected in situ when incubating the same building block  libraries in different AChEs. Drosophila melanogaster AChE crystal structure and  other insect AChE homology models differ more in their overall 3D structure than  other members of the cholinesterase family. The portion of the gorge proximal to  the catalytic triad and choline binding site has a approximately 50% reduction in  volume, and the gorge entrance at the peripheral anionic site (PAS) is more  constricted than in the fish and mammalian AChEs. In this communication we  describe rationale for using purified recombinant Drosophila AChE as a template  for in situ reaction of tacrine and propidium based libraries of acetylene and  azide building blocks. The structures of resulting triazole inhibitors  synthesized in situ are expected to differ appreciably from the fish and  mammalian AChEs. While the latter AChEs exclusively promote synthesis of  syn-substituted triazoles, the best Drosophila AChE triazole inhibitors were  always anti-substituted. The anti-regioisomer triazoles were by about one order  of magnitude better inhibitors of Drosophila than mammalian and fish AChEs.  Moreover, the preferred site of acetylene+azide reaction in insect AChE and the  resulting triazole ring formation shifts from near the base of the gorge to  closer to its rim due to substantial differences of the gorge geometry in  Drosophila AChE. Thus, in addition to synthesizing high affinity, lead inhibitors  in situ, freeze-frame, click chemistry has capacity to generate species-specific  AChE ligands that conform to the determinants in the gorge.",,10.1016/j.cbi.2008.04.048,"Acetylcholinesterase/*chemistry;Animals;Catalytic Domain;Humans;Models, Molecular;Freezing",NA,NA,probing gorge dimensions of cholinesterases by freezeframe click chemistry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: Our study had two  primary objectives: (i) Characterize the sources and predictors of a suite of  eight PCBs, four organochlorine (OC) pesticides, five essential and five toxic  elements in serum and/or whole blood of pregnant women recruited as part of the  Mother-and-Child Contaminant Cohort Study conducted in Northern Norway (The MISA  study); and (ii) determine the influence of personal and social characteristics  on both dietary and contaminant factors. METHODS: Recruitment and sampling  started in May 2007 and continued for the next 31 months until December 2009.  Blood/serum samples were collected during the 2nd trimester (mean: 18.2 weeks,  range 9.0-36.0). A validated questionnaire was administered to obtain personal  information. The samples were analysed by established laboratories employing  verified methods and reference standards. PCA involved Varimax rotation, and  significant predictors (p≤0.05) in linear regression models were included in the  multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: When considering all the  contaminants, three prominent PCA axes stood out with prominent loadings of: all  POPs; arsenic, selenium and mercury; and cadmium and lead. Respectively, in the  multivariate models the following were predictors: maternal age, parity and  consumption of freshwater fish and land-based wild animals; marine fish;  cigarette smoking, dietary PCA axes reflecting consumption of grains and cereals,  and food items involving hunting. PCA of only the POPs separated them into two  axes that, in terms of recently published findings, could be understood to  reflect longitudinal trends and their relative contributions to summed POPs.  CONCLUSIONS: The linear combinations of variables generated by PCA identified  prominent dietary sources of OC groups and of prominent toxic elements and  highlighted the importance of maternal characteristics.",,10.1016/j.ijheh.2014.12.001,"*Eating;*Principal Component Analysis;Adolescent;Adult;Arsenic/blood;Cadmium;Cohort Studies;Educational Status;Environmental Pollutants/*blood;Female;Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ);Humans;Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated/blood;Lead/blood;Maternal Age;Maternal Exposure/*statistics & numerical data;Mercury/blood;Multivariate Analysis;Norway;Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs);Pesticides/blood;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/blood;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Trimester, Second/*blood;Pregnant women;Principal Component Analysis (PCA);Seafood;Selenium/blood;Smoking;Socioeconomic Factors;Surveys and Questionnaires;The Northern Norway Mother-and-Child Contaminant Cohort Study (MISA);Toxic and essential elements;Young Adult;Only Child;Child",NA,NA,the northern norway motherandchild contaminant cohort misa study pca analyses of environmental contaminants in maternal sera and dietary intake in early pregnancy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study  was to evaluate the effects of diazinon exposure on fish and to investigate the  potential of the HSP inducer (HSPi) in developing a defense mechanism. To achieve  this, several factors were analyzed, including the HSP70 gene expression, levels  of immunity markers (lysozyme, IgM, and C3), antioxidant status, and the activity  of acetylcholine esterase (AChE). Stellate sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus) fry,  was exposed to diazinon (25, 50, and 75% of 96h-LC50) for 6 days after  pre-treatment with an HSP inducer (HSPi), TEX-OE® (a prickly pear cactus  extract), for 4 hours. Two HSPi concentrations, 100 and 200 mg.L-1, were used.  Pre-treatment with HSPi significantly enhanced HSP70 gene expression in the gill  and liver, as well as immune markers in the blood of Acipenser stellatus.  Diazinon-treated groups exhibited higher antioxidant activities of SOD, CAT, and  T-AOC. Increased activity also observed in control fish pre-treated with HSPi.  However, stellate sturgeon receiving both diazinon and HSPi+diazinon experienced  a significant decrease in AChE activity in comparison with control group.  Cortisol levels were elevated in the fish that were subjected to diazinon. Those  subjected to diazinon after receiving HSPi showed a significant decrease in  cortisol levels.

We also demonstrate that Phdp OMVs protect Phdp cells from the bactericidal  activity of fish antimicrobial peptides, suggesting that secretion of OMVs is  part of the strategy used by Phdp to evade host defense mechanisms. Importantly,  the vaccination of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) with adjuvant-free crude OMVs  induced the production of anti-Phdp antibodies and resulted in partial protection  against Phdp infection.

Our work has  been focused on the molecular characterization, expression analysis by real-time  PCR, both at basal condition and after in vivo challenges, and 3D structural  studies on the g-type lysozyme from sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.). Moreover,  a recombinant sea bass lysozyme has been produced in Escherichia coli and used to  investigate the activity of the enzyme at different pH and temperatures and to  perform antibacterial assays against typical fish pathogens. The cloned sea bass  cDNA for g-type lysozyme (accession number FN667957) consists of 742 bp and  translates for a putative protein of 188 amino acids. The molecular weight is  20.251, 41Da with a theoretical pI of 8.53, two cysteine residues along the  sequence and no putative signal peptide. These features of the enzyme are in  agreement with the expected characteristics of a proper g-type lysozyme, except  for the cysteine residues that in fish are quite variable in number. An alignment  between known g-type lysozyme sequences evidences that the amino acid residues  thought to be involved in the enzyme catalysis (Glu(71), Asp(84) and Asp(95) in  sea bass) are quite well conserved between mammalian, avian and fish sequences.  The sea bass g-type lysozyme gene is composed of four exons and three introns and  this gene structure is more compact compared to other known fish lysozyme  homologues. Modeling of 3D structure has been performed on the template structure  of g-type lysozyme from Atlantic cod. The catalytic site appears well conserved  when compared with known structures of fish g-type lysozymes (cod and salmon).  The basal expression of lysozyme transcripts is highest in gills, followed by  head kidney and peripheral blood leukocytes. The lysozyme expression is up  regulated in head kidney leukocytes both after challenge with the fish bacterial  pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. The lytic activity, determined  using as substrate Micrococcus lysodeikticus, was optimal at pH 5.5 and at a  temperature of 30°C. In conclusion, these results suggest that the identified  g-type lysozyme should be involved in the innate immune responses of sea bass.",,10.1016/j.molimm.2014.05.009,"3D structure;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology;Antibacterial activity;Bass/genetics/*immunology/*microbiology;Cloning, Molecular;Expression analysis;Fish Proteins/chemistry/classification/*genetics/*immunology;Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic;Lysozyme;Models, Molecular;Molecular Sequence Data;Muramidase/chemistry/classification/*genetics/*immunology;Phylogeny;Protein Conformation;Protein Structure, Tertiary;Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology;Sea bass;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid",NA,NA,molecular characterization gene structure and antibacterial activity of a gtype lysozyme from the european sea bass dicentrarchus labrax l,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, Pseudoalteromonas piscicida WCPW15003 as a probiotic effectively  antagonized dominant pathogenic V. harveyi in a mariculture, with a  growth-of-inhibition ratio of 6.3 h(-1). The antagonistic activities of cells and  intracellular components of WCPW15003 made a greater contribution to the  antagonistic process than did extracellular metabolites and caused the dominance  of WCPW15003 during the antagonistic process in vitro. WCPW15003 was safe for the  pearl gentian grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ Epinephelus lanceolatus)  and, as a consequence of the antagonistic effect on V. harveyi, protected the  fish from an immune response in vivo. A comprehensive combined proteomics and  metabolomics analysis of antagonistic WCPW15003 and pathogenic V. harveyi in a  coculture compared to a monoculture was performed to investigate the antagonistic  molecular mechanisms. The results showed that during the antagonistic process,  WCPW15003 in a coculture had significantly downregulated metabolic pathways for  histidine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism, and  upregulated glycerophospholipid metabolism, leading to a competitive advantage  against the co-occurring species, V. harveyi. This defined a mechanism by which  multi-costimulatory pathways drove P. piscicida WCPW15003 against V. harveyi.

As a result of this, scientists have intensified efforts  in exploiting plants, plant extracts or natural plant compounds as potential  natural alternatives for enhancing the livestock productivity. This paper  discusses work on the effects of various phytochemicals and plant secondary  metabolites in ruminant and fish species.

These smooth and  shaking patterns were selected for training with an artificial neural network.  Parameters characterizing the movement tracks, such as speed, degree of backward  movements, stop duration, turning rate, meander, and maximum distance movements  in the y-axis of 1-min duration, were given as input (six nodes) to a multi-layer  perceptron with the back propagation algorithm. Binary information for the smooth  and shaking patterns was separately given as the matching output (one node),  while eight nodes were assigned to a single hidden layer.

A. and Pacheco, M.",,eng,,,"Organophosphate herbicides are among the most dangerous agrochemicals for the aquatic environment. In this context, Roundup(®), a glyphosate-based herbicide,  has been widely detected in natural water bodies, representing a potential threat  to non-target organisms, namely fish. Thus, the main goal of the present study  was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of Roundup(®) in the teleost fish  Anguilla anguilla, addressing the possible causative involvement of oxidative  stress. Fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of this  herbicide (58 and 116 μgL(-1)) during one or three days. The standard procedure  of the comet assay was applied to gill and liver cells in order to determine  organ-specific genetic damage. Since liver is a central organ in xenobiotic  metabolism, nucleoids of hepatic cells were also incubated with a lesion-specific  repair enzyme (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase - FPG), in order to recognise  oxidised purines. Antioxidants were determined in both organs as indicators of  pro-oxidant state. In general, both organs displayed an increase in DNA damage  for the two Roundup(®) concentrations and exposure times, although liver showed  to be less susceptible to the lower concentration. The enzyme-modified comet  assay showed the occurrence of FPG-sensitive sites in liver only after a 3-day  exposure to the higher Roundup(®) concentration. The antioxidant defences were in  general unresponsive, despite a single increment of catalase activity in gills  (116 μgL(-1), 3-day) and a decrease of superoxide dismutase activity in liver (58  μgL(-1), 3-day). Overall, the mechanisms involved in Roundup(®)-induced DNA  strand-breaks showed to be similar in both organs. Nevertheless, it was  demonstrated that the type of DNA damage varies with the concentration and  exposure duration. Hence, after 1-day exposure, an increase on pro-oxidant state  is not a necessary condition for the induction of DNA-damaging effects of  Roundup(®). By increasing the duration of exposure to three days, ROS-dependent  processes gained preponderance as a mechanism of DNA-damage induction in the  higher concentration.",,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2011.10.017,"*DNA Damage;Anguilla/*genetics;Animals;Antioxidants/metabolism;Comet Assay;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Fishes/genetics;Gills/drug effects;Glycine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity;Glyphosate;Herbicides/toxicity;Liver/drug effects;Mutagens/*toxicity;Organ Specificity;Oxidative Stress/*physiology;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism;Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA Damage;Oxidative Stress;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA",NA,NA,dna damage in fish anguilla anguilla exposed to a glyphosatebased herbicide elucidation of organspecificity and the role of oxidative stress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crayfish are polytrophic, meaning that they  feed on and become prey for all levels of the aquatic food web as well as are  also important for the transfer of energy between benthic and terrestrial food  webs. Because crayfish are a keystone species, it is important to investigate any  factors that may affect their population size. Crayfish are active at night and  rely heavily on their sensory appendages (e.g., antennulues, maxillipeds, and  pereopods) to localize food sources. In this experiment, we investigated the  effects of atrazine (ATR) exposure on the chemosensory responses of male and  female crayfish to food odors. We exposed crayfish to environmentally relevant,  sublethal levels of ATR [80 ppb (µg/L)] for 72 h and then examined the behavioral  responses of both ATR-treated and control crayfish to food odor delivered from  one end of a test arena. We used Noldus Ethovision XT software to measure odor  localization and locomotory behaviors of crayfish in response to food (fish)  odor. We found that control crayfish spent more time in the proximal region of  the test arena and at the odor source compared with ATR-treated crayfish.  Furthermore, there were no differences in the time spent moving and not moving,  total distance travelled in the tank, and walking speed (cm/s) when control and  ATR-treated crayfish were compared.

The  increased GST activity and GSH levels after 96 h exposure suggested possible MgHP  accumulation and concentration- and time-dependent response. Histopathology in  the gills of exposed fish occurred at high MgHP concentrations.

To achieve this, animals  were exposed for 4 and 7 days, to nominal concentrations of chlorothalonil at 0  μg/L (DMSO, 0.001%), 0.1 μg/L and 10 μg/L, and after the exposure period, the  tissues (gills and liver) were removed for biochemical analysis. Antioxidant  capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and enzyme activities, such as  superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and  glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), were evaluated in both tissues. In addition, the  concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced glutathione (GSH) and  lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were also analysed.

However, there was a significant reduction of ACAP and CAT activity, as  well as a significant increase of GST activity and LPO levels in gills exposed to  the lower concentration after 7 days. The liver was less affected, presenting a  significant reduction in CAT activity and LPO levels after 4 days. However, a  significant increase in SOD activity and LPO levels occurred after 7 days.

However, after 7 days, the lowest concentration of this compound  caused oxidative stress in this same organ. Also, the results show that gills  were more affected than the liver, probably because gills can be involved in  chlorothalonil metabolisation.

The A domain comprises a zinc-metalloprotease moiety that  cleaves the NF-kB p65, and the B domain is involved in binding and  internalisation of the toxin into susceptible cells. Previous experiments  suggested that disruption of AIP56 disulphide bond partially compromised  toxicity, but conclusive evidences supporting the importance of that bond in  intoxication were lacking.

Recent studies demonstrated that E. piscicida can  invade and survive within multiple nonphagocytic cells, but the internalization  mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we used HeLa cells as a nonphagocytic  cell model to investigate the endocytic strategy used by the pathogenic E.  piscicida isolate EIB202. Using a combination of optical and electron microscopy,  we observed obvious membrane ruffles and F-actin rearrangements in HeLa cells  after EIB202 infection. We also revealed that EIB202 internalization  significantly depended on the activity of Na(+)/H(+) exchangers and multiple  intracellular signaling events related to macropinocytosis, suggesting that E.  piscicida utilizes the host macropinocytosis pathway to enter HeLa cells.  Further, using inhibitory drugs and shRNAs to block specific endocytic pathways,  we found that a caveolin-dependent but not clathrin-dependent pathway is involved  in E. piscicida entry and that its entry requires dynamin and membrane  cholesterol. Together, these data suggest that E. piscicida enters nonphagocytic  cells via macropinocytosis and caveolin-dependent endocytosis involving  cholesterol and dynamin, improving the understanding of how E. piscicida  interacts with nonphagocytic cells.IMPORTANCE Bacterial internalization is the  first step in breaking through the host cell defense. Therefore, studying the  mechanism of bacterial internalization improves the understanding of the  pathogenic mechanism of bacteria. In this study, the internalization process on  nonphagocytic cells by Edwardsiella piscicida was evaluated. Our results showed  that E. piscicida can be internalized into nonphagocytic cells via  macropinocytosis and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and that cholesterol and  dynamin are involved in this process. These results reveal a new method for  inhibiting E. piscicida infection, providing a foundation for further studies of  bacterial pathogenicity.",,10.1128/JB.00548-18,"*Endocytosis;Actins/metabolism;Caveolins/metabolism;Cholesterol/metabolism;Dynamins/metabolism;Edwardsiella piscicida;Edwardsiella/*physiology;endocytosis;Epithelial Cells/*microbiology/ultrastructure;HeLa Cells;Humans;internalization;macropinocytosis;Microscopy;Microscopy, Electron;nonphagocytic cells;Signal Transduction;Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/metabolism",NA,NA,edwardsiella piscicida enters nonphagocytic cells via a macropinocytosisinvolved hybrid mechanism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our current study, zebrafish, an ideal model  animal for behavioral studies, were exposed to cyprodinil from fertilization to  240 days postfertilization at 0.1 μg/L (environmentally relevant concentration)  and 1, 10 μg/L. Firstly, we observed that aggressive behavior of zebrafish was  significantly enhanced after exposure to 0.1-10 μg/L cyprodinil and antipredator  behavior was decreased after exposure. Cyprodinil exposure altered the  adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels, which regulate cortisol  homeostasis and were significantly reduced in all exposure groups (0.1-10 μg/L).  In addition, most of the key genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal gland  axis, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone and melanocortin 2 receptor, were  downregulated significantly in all exposure groups, which was consistent with the  hormone levels. In addition, in the hypothalamus, the number of apoptotic cells  increased in a dose-dependent manner in the cyprodinil exposure groups. Moreover,  these changes were potentially responsible for the increased aggression of  zebrafish during the mirror-like aggressive test and for the reduced antipredator  behavior during the predator avoidance test.

Their effects at  environmentally relevant concentrations are often unclear, especially concerning  mixtures of pesticides. This study thus investigated the impacts of one of the  most used herbicides: S-metolachlor and its two metabolites, metolachlor oxanilic  acid (MOA) and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (MESA) on the development of  zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to the individual  substances and their environmentally relevant mixture until 120 hpf (hours  post-fertilization). The focus was set on sublethal endpoints such as  malformations, hatching success, length of fish larvae, spontaneous movements,  heart rate and locomotion. Moreover, expression levels of eight genes linked to  the thyroid system disruption, oxidative stress defense, mitochondrial  metabolism, regulation of cell cycle and retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway  were analyzed. Exposure to S-metolachlor (1 μg/L) and the pesticide mixture  (1 μg/L of each substance) significantly reduced spontaneous tail movements of  21 hpf embryos. Few rare developmental malformations were observed, but only in  larvae exposed to more than 100 μg/L of individual substances (craniofacial  deformation, non-inflated gas bladder, yolk sac malabsorption) and to 30 μg/L of  each substance in the pesticide mixture (spine deformation). No effect on  hatching success, length of larvae, heart rate or larvae locomotion were found.  Strong responses were detected at the molecular level including induction of p53  gene regulating the cell cycle (the pesticide mixture - 1 μg/L of each substance;  MESA 30 μg/L; and MOA 100 μg/L), as induction of cyp26a1 gene encoding cytochrome  P450 (pesticide mixture - 1 μg/L of each substance). Genes implicated in the  thyroid system regulation (dio2, thra, thrb) were all overexpressed by the  environmentally relevant concentrations of the pesticide mixture (1 μg/L of each  substance) and MESA metabolite (1 μg/L). Zebrafish thyroid system disruption was  revealed by the overexpressed genes, as well as by some related developmental  malformations (mainly gas bladder and yolk sac abnormalities), and reduced  spontaneous tail movements.

These pre-clinical studies demonstrated the narrow therapeutic window of  cysteamine bitartrate, with toxicity at millimolar levels directly correlating  with marked induction of hydrogen peroxide production. Micromolar range  cysteamine bitartrate treatment in Caenorhabditis elegans gas-1(fc21) RC complex  I (NDUFS2-/-) disease invertebrate worms significantly improved mitochondrial  membrane potential and oxidative stress, with corresponding modest improvement in  fecundity but not lifespan. At 10 to 100 μm concentrations, cysteamine bitartrate  improved multiple RC complex disease FBXL4 human fibroblast survival, and  protected both complex I (rotenone) and complex IV (azide) Danio rerio vertebrate  zebrafish disease models from brain death. Mechanistic profiling of cysteamine  bitartrate effects showed it increases aspartate levels and flux, without  increasing total glutathione levels. Transcriptional normalization of broadly  dysregulated intermediary metabolic, glutathione, cell defense, DNA, and immune  pathways was greater in RC disease human cells than in C. elegans, with similar  rescue in both models of downregulated ribosomal and proteasomal pathway  expression. Overall, these data suggest cysteamine bitartrate may hold  therapeutic potential in RC disease, although not through obvious modulation of  total glutathione levels.

CAT  activity was significantly reduced following exposure to endosulfan when cells  were pretreated with ATA. Pretreatment with L-BSO significantly decreased  glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in a  concentration-related manner following exposure to endosulfan, while GSH levels  were significantly higher in NAC pretreated cells compared to untreated cells.  Finally, pretreatment with ATA and L-BSO increased, while pretreatment with NAC  decreased, lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) levels.

In this  work, we generated mutants of V. anguillarum defective in FrpA and analyzed their  ability to use piscibactin as iron source. The results showed that inactivation  of frpA completely disables piscibactin utilization, and the original phenotype  could be restored by gene complementation, confirming that FrpA is the OMT that  mediates ferri-Pcb uptake. Additionally, the ability of several Pcb thiazole  analogues, with different configurations at positions 9, 10, and 13, to be  internalized through FrpA, was evaluated measuring their ability to promote  growth under iron deficiency of several indicator strains. The results showed  that while those analogues with a thiazole ring maintain almost the same activity  as Pcb, the maintenance of the hydroxyl group present in natural piscibactin  configuration at position C-13 is crucial for Fe(3+) chelation and, in  consequence, for the recognition of the ferri-siderophore by the cognate OMT.

Results indicated that both systems  produce high-quality safe organic food. The economic feasibility analysis  indicated that Integrated Aqua-Vegaculture System is producing more crops with a  wider variety of almost 20% less capital expenditure and operational expenditure  costs. Fish production for both systems was close, yet slightly higher in Deep  Water Culture. Although, on the short term, aquaponics entails relatively high  capital and operational expenditure costs compared with conventional agriculture;  yet, on the long term, it is more profitable, while saving up to 85% of the water  wasted by conventional farming techniques.

Presently, little is known about the potential for  developmental neurotoxicity or the behavioral consequences of OPFR exposure. Our  aim was to characterize the life-long neurobehavioral effects of 4 widely used  OPFRs using the zebrafish model. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.1% DMSO  (vehicle control); or one of the following treatments; isopropylated phenyl  phosphate (IPP) (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 µM); butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate (BPDP)  (0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 3 µM); 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDP) (0.03, 0.3,  1 µM); isodecyl diphenyl phosphate (IDDP) (0.1, 0.3, 1, 10 µM) from 0- to 5-days  postfertilization. On Day 6, the larvae were tested for motility under  alternating dark and light conditions. Finally, at 5-7 months of age the exposed  fish and controls were tested on a battery of behavioral tests to assess  emotional function, sensorimotor response, social interaction and predator  evasion. These tests showed chemical-specific short-term effects of altered  motility in larvae in all of the tested compounds, and long-term impairment of  anxiety-related behavior in adults following IPP, BPDP, or EHDP exposures. Our  results show that OPFRs may not be a safe alternative to the phased-out BFRs and  may cause behavioral impacts throughout the lifespan.

Commercial test panel configurations are relatively constant over time, and as  new species are defined, appropriate discriminatory tests may not be present in  current test panel arrangements. While phenobiochemical tests fail to  discriminate between these taxa, data presented here revealed discriminatory  peaks for each Edwardsiella species using matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) methodology, suggesting that MALDI-TOF can  offer rapid, reliable identification in line with current systematic  classifications. Furthermore, a multiplex PCR assay was validated for rapid  molecular differentiation of the Edwardsiella spp. affecting fish.

The present study therefore aimed at detecting the  biochemical changes caused by diazinon. To accomplish this aim, we studied the  effects of sublethal concentrations (0.0036, 0.018, and 0.036 ppb) of diazinon on  acetylcholine esterase activity, antioxidant enzyme activities, and lipid  peroxidation in the liver of Cyprinus carpio on days 5, 15, and 30 after the  exposure. The results revealed that the antioxidant enzyme activities such as  superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase were induced by  diazinon exposure. In addition, the highest catalytic activity of glutathione  S-transferase (GST) was obtained with 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). GST  activity toward 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB) was also observed in the  liver, yet it was relatively low as opposed to the other substrates tested. On  the other hand, hepatic malondialdehyde level did not show any significant  alteration except after the exposure on day 15. The exposure of low  concentrations of diazinon to C. carpio can induce oxidative stress in liver; yet  restoring susceptibility and adapting to oxidative stress are likely to occur  when low level of oxidative stress is administered. Furthermore, no significant  change was observed in hepatic lipid peroxidation after diazinon treatment  indicating that liver tissue resisted to oxidative stress by enhancing their  antioxidant mechanisms. The level of lipid peroxidation was assumed to be  associated with the concentrations of diazinon and experimentation periods.

To do so, an experimental system consisting of  eight similar 400 L tanks with a flow-through of fresh river water was used to  perform daily chemical contamination. Fish were exposed to 850 ng/L for one hour  and the pendimethalin concentration was then gradually diluted during the day to  maintain optimal conditions for the fish throughout the experiment and to achieve  a mean theoretical exposure level of around 100 ng L(-1) per day. Every November,  males and females were stripped to collect eggs and sperm and two new first  generations of offspring were obtained. Kinetic sampling revealed differences in  immune system parameters and antioxidative defences in the contaminated trout  compared to the controls, due to pesticide exposure combined with seasonal  changes related to gamete maturation. Moreover, reproductive capacity was  significantly affected by exposure to the herbicide; a time lag of more than five  weeks was observed for egg maturation in contaminated females and high  bioconcentrations of pendimethalin were measured in eggs and sperm.

Zinc pyrithione is an organometallic biocide, with bactericidal, algicidal and  fungicidal activities. It has been recently incorporated in antifouling formulas,  such as paints, which prevent the establishment of a biofilm on surfaces exposed  to the aquatic environment. It has also been used in cosmetics, such as  anti-dandruff shampoos and soaps. Previously reported data has shown the presence  of this substance in the aquatic compartment, a factor contributing to the  potential exertion of toxic effects, and there is also evidence that  photodegradation products of zinc pyrithione were involved in neurotoxic effects,  namely by inhibiting cholinesterases in fish species. Additional evidence points  to the involvement of zinc pyrithione in alterations of metal homeostasis and  oxidative stress, in both aquatic organisms and human cell models. The present  work assesses the potential ecotoxicity elicited by zinc pyrithione in the  freshwater fish Gambusia holbrooki after an acute (96 h) exposure. The oxidative  stress was assessed by the quantification of the activities of specific enzymes  from the antioxidant defense system, such as catalase, and  glutathione-S-transferases; and the extent of peroxidative damage was quantified  by measuring the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels. Neurotoxicity  was assessed through measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity; and a  standardized method for the description and assessment of histological changes in  liver and gills of was also used. Zinc pyrithione caused non-specific and  reversible tissue alterations, both in liver and gills of exposed organisms.  However, histopathological indices were not significantly different from the  control group.

R. and Balcomb, R.",,eng,,,"Irgarol 1051 is an algaecide used in copper-based antifoulant paints for controlling fouling organisms on the hulls of recreational and commercial  watercraft. Paints containing this algaecide have been used in Europe since the  mid-1980s. In 1998, the first antifouling paints containing Irgarol 1051 were  registered for use in the U. S. To examine the risk that Irgarol may pose to  aquatic ecosystems, a probabilistic ecological risk assessment was conducted  using distributions of exposure and toxicity data. Exposure data for this  assessment were derived from 11 monitoring studies (146 stations) conducted in  marinas, estuaries, and coastal waters from 1992 to 1997 in six European  countries. A comparison of 90th percentile concentrations pooled by station types  across all regions showed that concentrations in marinas (316 ng/l) were higher  than in estuaries and coastal waters (41 and 19 ng/l, respectively). A 90th  percentile of 133 ng/l was reported for all pooled stations. Temporal trends  showed that Irgarol concentrations typically peaked in early summer after  launching of small boats with much lower concentrations occurring during the  spring, fall, and winter. Toxicity data used for this risk assessment were  derived primarily from unpublished studies submitted to regulatory agencies.  Because Irgarol is a photosynthesis-inhibiting herbicide, it is much more toxic  to plants than animals. Toxicity values for animals (fish and invertebrates) were  much greater than concentrations of Irgarol reported in the environment.  Therefore, a conservative approach using a distribution of only plant toxicity  data (EC50s for plant growth) was used to derive a 10th percentile of 136 ng/l.  This plant toxicity benchmark of 136 ng/l was used for risk characterization.  Results from probabilistic analysis showed that ecological risk from Irgarol  exposure was low in estuaries, coastal areas, and various open-type marinas.  However, 10% or more of the plant species in enclosed marinas with low flushing  rates may be exposed to Irgarol concentrations that would reduce photosynthesis  activity and growth during the summer. Ecological risk to these sensitive plant  species in enclosed marinas will likely be moderated because of the reversibility  of Irgarol's inhibition of photosynthesis and the rapid recovery potential of  plant communities. The ecological significance of marinas that generally contain  numerous stressors such as trace metals, tributyltin, petroleum hydrocarbons,  high nutrient concentrations, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations is a  management issue that needs to be addressed.",,,"*Ecology;Biomass;Eukaryota/*drug effects;Herbicides/chemistry/*toxicity;Models, Biological;Paint/analysis/*toxicity;Risk Assessment/methods;Ships;Triazines/chemistry/*toxicity;Water Pollutants/*toxicity;Risk Assessment",NA,NA,an ecological risk assessment for the use of irgarol 1051 as an algaecide for antifoulant paints,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M.",,eng,,,"Efforts to control the spectrum of diseases that affect humans, our crops and our animals pose problems which need to be debated openly. Widespread use of  chemicals in such a broad sphere raises important concerns not only about safety  for the users, consumers and target species, but especially about the not so  obvious effects upon the ecosystems in which they are used. Some undetermined  level of biological diversity is necessary to maintain ecological function and  resilience. These, in turn, are necessary for generating the biological resources  (trees, fish, wildlife, crops) and ecological services (watershed protection, air  cleansing, climate stabilisation, erosion control) on which economic activity and  human welfare depend. The driving forces behind decline of biodiversity stem  entirely from human activities. Underlying causes are those resulting from the  cultural and social factors associated with economic activities and lead to  direct depletion of species, and degradation or destruction of habitats. The  broad spectrum and high efficacy of the macrocyclic lactones against nematode and  arthropod parasites of livestock and companion animals are unprecedented. Cattle,  horses, sheep, swine, dogs--to varying degrees all are utilised by humans for  economic gain. Detrimental impact upon non-target animals is considered  acceptable in eradicating parasites because of their economic importance to  commercial livestock production. Production will increase when these parasites  are eliminated, but we remain oblivious to the long-term consequences of our  actions. What are the ecological limits to rural economic activities? Decomposing  animal faeces help to maintain our ecosystem by returning valuable nutrients to  the soil. Dung fauna-fungi, yeast, bacteria, nematodes, insects and  earthworms--play a non-conspicuous but important and varied role in this  decomposition process, a role dependent upon many factors, especially  environmental ones. Anthelmintics and pesticides are of considerable value in  agriculture, but largely at an unevaluated cost to the greater environment. We  have insufficient knowledge of the extent to which a spectrum of anthelmintics  and pesticides affect ecological function and ecosystem resilience in our  commercial plant and animal production systems. It is time we developed a genuine  interest in avoiding ""the dialogue of the deal"" that in the past has minimised  interdisciplinary research between environmental ecology and commercial plant and  animal production.",,10.1016/s0020-7519(96)00147-6,"*Ecosystem;*Parasitic Diseases, Animal;Animals;Anthelmintics/therapeutic use/*toxicity;Humans;Parasitic Diseases/drug therapy/prevention & control;Pesticides/*toxicity",NA,NA,endoparasite control strategies implications for biodiversity of native fauna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus,  effective and safe prevention and control of this bacterium are urgently needed  to combat the related infections. Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) effectively  prevent infectious diseases. However, most of the existing E. piscicida LAVs are  based on the deletion of genes encoding the translocon components of the type III  secretion system (T3SS), the core virulence system, which is the most prominent  protective bacterial antigen with the strongest immunogenicity. In this study, we  systematically deleted all of the 9 established T3SS effectors in E. piscicida  (aka 9Δ) and the rpoS gene encoding the alternative sigma factor, the esrB  repressor (10Δ), then we overexpressed esrB and T3SS in E. piscicida to obtain  the recombinant strain 10Δ/esrB(OE). The modified strains 10Δ and 10Δ/esrB(OE)  exhibited severe attenuation and in vivo colonization defects. Additionally,  vaccination by intraperitoneal injection with 10Δ and 10Δ/esrB(OE) could  significantly upregulate the expression of the antigen recognition related gene  (TLR5) and the adaptive immune response-related gene (MHC II) in the  spleen/kidney of turbot fish, and it also enhanced the hosts' serum bactericidal  capacity. Finally, vaccination with 10Δ/esrB(OE) led to increased immune  protection against the challenge of wild type E. piscicida EIB202 in turbot fish.

Ubiquitous, persistent, and substantial uses of  Harness(®) in agricultural processes have resulted in the pollution of nearby  water sources, posing a threat to various aquatic biotas, including fish. The  effects of Harness(®) toxicity on fish health are little known. So, this study  aimed to describe the impact of herbicide Harness(®) on the oxidative stress and  reproductive and thyroid performance of male and female tilapia (Oreochromis  niloticus) and also investigate the prospective role of the natural antioxidant  lycopene supplementation in dismissing the adverse properties of Harness(®).  Antioxidant enzyme (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and total antioxidant  capacity) and hormone measurements (T, E2, T3, and T4) were carried out, and  gonadal and thyroid follicle histological sections were examined as a method to  investigate the effects of Harness(®) toxicity on fish. Male and female tilapia  were exposed to 10 μmol/L and 100 μmol/L of Harness(®) and treated with 10 mg  lycopene/kg for 15 days of exposure. Our results demonstrated that the  antioxidant enzyme activity was altered by Harness exposure and serum T for both  males and females dropped; also, female E2 levels decreased, but male E2  increased. Exposure to higher dose of Harness(®) induced elevation in both T3 and  T4 levels, although the low exposure dose stimulated T4 levels. Harness(®)  exposure prompted histological variations and degenerative changes in testicular,  ovarian, and thyroid follicle tissues. Lycopene supplement administration  diminished oxidative stress induced by Harness(®), alleviating its endocrine  disparaging effects by neutralizing T3, T4, T, and E2 and ameliorating the  histological structure of gonadal and thyroid tissues. In conclusion, lycopene  supplementation was preformed to normalize the alterations and oxidative damage  caused by Harness(®) in Nile tilapia, suggesting that lycopene-supplemented diet  functioned as potent antioxidants and had the ability to alleviate oxidative  stress and thyroid and reproductive toxicity caused by herbicide Harness(®).

As such, the evaluation of  acetylcholinesterase activity, in combination with the evaluation of  biotransformation and antioxidants enzymes levels, is useful for indicating  damage in fish exposed to this insecticide. Moreover, evaluating mitochondrial  activity might evidence how the hierarchic responses occur in relation to the  length of time that the fish is exposed. Therefore, the aim of our study is to  evaluate whether the length of exposure to malathion differentially affects the  biochemical responses of tambaqui. Our hypothesis is that the physiological  alterations due to exposure are time dependent. Fish were exposed to sublethal  concentrations of the insecticide during 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Contrary to  expectations, there was no acetylcholinesterase activity inhibition during the  experiment, which indicates an absence of neurotoxicity.

Oxidative damage was evident in the first hours of exposure and was concurrent  with the activation of antioxidant enzymes.

METHODS: The research was based on retrieval and critical review of  relevant articles and abstracts cited in international and regional journals. The  literature search was done on MedLine from the year 1975 to 2010. The analyses of  published data on various vertebrates (birds, fish, mice, human, among others)  were considered. RESULTS: The effect of DDT on body functions is purely dependent  on the degree of exposure. Whereas mild exposure (1-5mg/kg) may not have  significant effects, very high concentrations (>100mg/kg) of DDT generally  adversely affect the reproductive functions of animals. Eggshell quality, egg  hatch-ability and health of chicks are affected by high DDT exposure. Very high  DDT levels may increase the chances of spontaneous abortion and preterm birth,  which is one of the main causes of infant mortality in humans. The health of a  growing foetus and infant may also be compromised by DDT transfer from an exposed  mother through the placenta and breast milk. The DDT affects the estrous cycle of  exposed animals by altering the hormonal functions. In male rats, DDT has been  observed to alter spermatogenesis and reduce aggression behaviour. However the  effect in higher male animals has not been clearly elucidated. CONCLUSION: DDT  exposure has drastic effects on reproductive functions in vertebrates, and safer  alternatives should be considered rather than re-introducing DDT as a control  agent for mosquitoes as has been suggested recently.",,,*Vertebrates/physiology;Animals;DDT/*pharmacology;Environmental Pollutants/*adverse effects;Female;Humans;Infant;Insecticides/*adverse effects;Male;Mice;Pregnancy;Rats;Reproduction/*drug effects,NA,NA,dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane ddt and its observed effects on body functions in vertebrates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although triazole fungicides are widely found in  the aquatic environment, little is known about their acute toxicity on fish. In  this study we assessed the effects of short-term exposure to Topas on some  parameters of homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the levels of  markers of oxidative stress and parameters of the antioxidant defense system of  goldfish (Carassius auratus L.). Gills appeared to be the main target organ of  Topas toxicity, showing the greatest number of parameters affected. Gills of  Topas-treated fish showed a higher content of low (L-SH) and high (H-SH)  molecular mass thiols and higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD),  catalase, glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) as well as reduced carbonyl protein  content (CP), as compared with those in the control group. In the liver, goldfish  exposure to 15-25mgL(-1) Topas resulted in a higher L-SH and H-SH content, but  lower CP levels and activity of GST. In kidney, Topas exposure resulted in higher  activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and G6PDH, but lower L-SH content and  activity of GST. The results of this study indicate that acute goldfish exposure  to the triazole fungicide Topas increased efficiency of the antioxidant system in  fish gills, liver, and kidney.

Fish were exposed to sub-lethal and nominal concentration of fenthion  after intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 or 400 mg/kg NAC. Brain tissues were then  dissected and homogenized to analyse GSH, GSSG, TBARS, and protein contents.  Enzymes that constitute the first line antioxidant defence, namely SOD and CAT,  GSH-related enzymes, GR and GST, together with AChE activities were also  determined spectrophotometrically. Fenthion did not cause any alteration in SOD  and CAT activities while increasing GSH content, GSH/GSSG ratio and GST specific  enzyme activity and decreasing GSSG, TBARS, and protein contents. Although, the  highest induction in SOD and GST enzymes activities and the highest increase in  GSH content were observed in the 0.5 mg/kg NAC-injected fish, their protein  contents showed a decrease. 400 mg/kg NAC impeded the activation of the GST  enzyme and a higher decrease in lipid peroxidation was observed. Fish were also  protected against protein depletion by the higher dose NAC application. AChE  activity was not influenced by fenthion exposure. Xenobiotic and GSH transporters  may cause mild oxidative stress conditions in brain. Cellular redox status could  trigger a series of reactions that result in an increase in SOD activity and a  decrease in protein content.

The effects of Excis on mussels are  also examined by measuring the neutral red retention time of lysosomes, aerial  survival and shell closure. The isomeric ratios of cis:trans cypermethrin  measured in mussels are around 80:20; a marked increase from 40:60 to which the  mussels were exposed. This is most likely due to preferential metabolism of  trans-isomers, as the same response is seen in vertebrates. There is a pronounced  behavioural effect of shell closure, where mussels exposed to 1000 microg/l  cypermethrin shut their shells within an hour of exposure. Arguments are  presented for this effect being either a voluntary response on recognition of  cypermethrin, or an effect arising from an involuntary action of cypermethrin on  the adductor muscle.

Male ornamental fin size, dimorphic yellow coloration and display  rates were all compromised in exposed fish, but unaffected in their paternal  half-sibling controls and in their sisters (morphology and colour). Exposure  resulted in smaller fish of both sexes, thus the differential effect by sex was  restricted to attributes such as fin size only above the naturally selected  magnitude shown by females. Father phenotype predicted offspring morphology of  controls, but not of exposed males, which were discriminated against by both  control and exposed females.

At the end of the feeding trial, fish fed  with PB2 and PB4 showed lower final body weight when compared with the other  dietary groups. Respiratory burst activity and nitric oxide production were not  affected by probiotic supplementation. Fish fed with PB5 presented lower  peroxidase activity compared to CTRL. Lysozyme and alternative complement pathway  activity (ACH50) showed no significant differences between treatments. The innate  immune responses were significantly affected after handling stress and bacterial  infection. In trial A, the ACH50 levels of infected fish were significantly lower  than the placebo groups. On the other hand, in trial B fish infected with Pdp  demonstrated higher ACH50 levels when compared to placebos. Peroxidase levels  were strongly modulated by bacterial infection and handling stress. In trials A  and B, infection had a clear downgrade effect in peroxidase levels. Lipid  peroxidation, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase were  altered by both bacterial infection and transport.

Investigations in frogs  suggested that early life exposure to a pesticide resulted in higher tolerance to  a subsequent challenge. This led to the hypothesis that early-life stage  exposures can alter phenotypically plastic traits during development, resulting  in induced tolerance. Here, we used Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) to test the  role of detoxification pathway priming in this inducible tolerance. In frogs, the  induced tolerance is present five days after the end of the pre-exposure, but  absent after a month. We show that a pre-exposure early in life with carbaryl,  induces the activity of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and increases the ability of  pre-exposed groups to metabolize carbaryl, likely because of activation of the  aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. Embryos pre-exposed to carbaryl had a  350-500% increase in CYP1A activity, threefold greater capacity to metabolize  carbaryl and were more tolerant to a lethal challenge five days after the end of  pre-exposure. However, ten days later the differences in CYP1A activity,  metabolic capacity and tolerance between pre-exposed and control groups were no  longer present. Thus, we conclude that the increase in tolerance observed in  pre-exposed fish embryos was due to the activation of the AHR and other metabolic  pathways, resulting in a prolonged increase in biotransformation capacity. This  allowed individuals to more efficiently deal with subsequent chemical challenges  for a short period after the initial pre-exposure. However, this induced  tolerance was only short-lived due to the recycling of biotransformation enzymes  in the cells as part of general cellular protein maintenance. These findings  suggest that induced tolerance was likely due to induction of defense mechanisms  during the duration of response to the original stressor, rather than a more  permanent change in their ability to respond to future challenges.",,10.1016/j.envpol.2017.02.046,"Animals;Aryl hydrocarbon receptor;Carbaryl;Carbaryl/*toxicity;CYP1A;Fundulidae/*metabolism;Life Cycle Stages/*drug effects;Pesticides;Pesticides/*metabolism;Phenotypic plasticity;Texas;Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism/*toxicity",NA,NA,induced pesticide tolerance results from detoxification pathway priming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Haematological and  biochemical profiles of blood provide important information about the internal  environment of the organism and the general physiology and health status of  triazine exposed fish. According to studies using biotransformation and  bioaccumulation indices to estimate the effects of triazines on fish, changes in  fish metabolism reflect the pollution of the environment by these herbicides. The  responses of antioxidant defence systems in fish to triazine exposure could be an  adaptive mechanism to protect the fish from triazine-induced oxidative stress.

We previously demonstrated that miR-155 was significantly  downregulated in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in response to fipronil  (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl)  sulphinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile) exposure. However, the regulation of this  miRNA's predicted target gene cyb561d2, which is a member of the cytochrome b561  (cyt b561) family involved in electron transfer, cell defence, and chemical  stress, has not been experimentally validated to date. In this study, we  evaluated the effects of fipronil on miR-155 and cyb561d2 in zebrafish. The  expression of miR-155 was downregulated, whereas cyb561d2 was upregulated in both  mRNA and protein level in a dose-dependent manner upon stimulation of fipronil.  The dual luciferase report assay demonstrated that miR-155 interacted with  cyb561d2 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR).

It is attributed to many factors  including exposure to agropesticides such as manganese ethylenebis  (dithiocarbamate) (maneb), which is one of the most frequently used fungicides in  Cameroon. Previous reports support efficiency of some medicinal plants commonly  used in Cameroonian folk medicine for the treatment of this disorder. OBJECTIVE:  The present study was aimed at assessing the protective effect of extracts from  selected plant species, namely Basella alba L. (Basellaceae) (MEBa) and  Carpolobia alba G. Don (Polygalaceae) (AECa), in alleviating the maneb-induced  impairment of male reproductive function in Wistar albino rats. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: The rats were treated with vehicle, plant extract (MEBa or AECa), maneb  and maneb plus plant extract, respectively, and their fertility was assessed.  Animals were thereafter sacrificed and organs (liver, kidneys and reproductive  organs) were dissected out and weighed. Serum androgens together with alanine  aminotransferase, liver glutathione and thiobarbituric acid reactive species  (TBARS) were also measured. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From this study, both plant  extracts stimulated testosterone and improved fertility. Administration of MEBa  plus maneb prevented fertility reduction by maneb and minimized the inhibitory  effect of maneb on testosterone levels. AECa also improved fertility of the  maneb-exposed rats, though without restoring testosterone levels, and other  investigated parameters remained unaffected by different treatments. CONCLUSION:  These findings emphasized the beneficial effects of B. alba and C. alba extracts  on male fertility, and suggest their protective effect against maneb-induced  toxicity in male reproductive function.",,10.3109/13880209.2013.816860,"Animals;Cameroon;Disease Models, Animal;Fungicides, Industrial/toxicity;Infertility, Male/*prevention & control;Magnoliopsida/*chemistry;Male;Maneb/toxicity;Medicine, Traditional;Plant Extracts/*pharmacology;Polygalaceae/*chemistry;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Testosterone/blood;Infertility, Male;Infertility",NA,NA,protective effect of basella alba and carpolobia alba extracts against manebinduced male infertility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the current study was undertaken to highlight the effects of  penoxsulam exposure on O. niloticus and to evaluate the advantages of Chlorella  vulgaris (CV) dietary supplementation against the induced effects. The 96-h  lethal concentration 50 (LC(50)) penoxsulam value for O. niloticus was estimated  at 8.948 mg/L by probit analysis in a static bioassay experiment. Next, 360  healthy fish were randomly allocated into 6 treatment groups. The T1 group served  as the negative control and was fed a basal diet. The T2 group served as the  positive control and was fed a basal diet supplemented with 10% CV. The fish in  the T3 and T4 groups were exposed to 1/10 the 96-h LC(50) of penoxsulam  (0.8948 mg/L) and were fed the basal diet alone or the basal diet supplemented  with 10% CV, respectively. The fish in the T5 and T6 groups were exposed to 1/5  the 96-h LC(50) of penoxsulam (1.7896 mg/L) and fed the basal diet alone or the  basal diet supplemented with 10% CV, respectively. Sub-acute penoxsulam exposure  significantly altered hematological indices, as well as compromised the fish's  immune defense mechanisms, including the phagocytic percentage, phagocytic index,  nitric oxide production, immunoglobulin M levels and lysozyme, anti-trypsin and  bactericidal activities subsequently decreasing O. niloticus's resistance to the  Aeromonus sobria challenge and increasing disease symptoms and the mortality  rate. Furthermore, sub-chronic penoxsulam exposure markedly altered growth  performance, oxidant/antioxidant status and liver status and down-regulated the  expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis-α (TNF-α). Interestingly,  incorporating 10% CV into the diet protects fish against sub-acute  penoxsulam-induced immunotoxicity via improvement of immune responses that  increases the resistance against bacterial infection. Further, it improved the  growth performance, oxidant/antioxidant status, liver status and markedly  up-regulated immune-related gene expression, IL-1β and TNF-α, in the spleens of  fish sub-chronically exposed to penoxsulam. These outcomes showed that dietary CV  supplementation can protect the commercially valuable freshwater fish O.  niloticus against penoxsulam toxicity and may be a potential feed supplement for  Nile tilapia in aquaculture.",,10.1016/j.fsi.2018.04.011,"Aeromonas/physiology;Animal Feed/analysis;Animals;Chlorella vulgaris;Chlorella vulgaris/*chemistry;Cichlids/blood/growth & development/*immunology;Diet/veterinary;Dietary Supplements/analysis;Disease Resistance/*immunology;Fish Diseases/*immunology;Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/immunology;Herbicides/adverse effects;IL-1β and TNF-α;Immunity, Innate/*drug effects;O. niloticus;Penoxsulam;Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction;Random Allocation;Sulfonamides/*toxicity;Uridine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity;Water Pollutants, Chemical/toxicity;Dietary Supplements;Chlorella",NA,NA,influences of chlorella vulgaris dietary supplementation on growth performance hematology immune response and disease resistance in oreochromis niloticus exposed to sublethal concentrations of penoxsulam herbicide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

N. and Bailey, J. M. and Levin, E. D.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have grown in usage since concerns about the health effects of the previously used polybrominated flame  retardants led to their being phased out. The potential for OPFRs to cause  adverse health effects of their own is still unexamined. Because of their  structural similarities to organophosphate pesticides, which have themselves been  heavily researched and shown to be neurobehavioral teratogens, we investigated  the possibility that developmental exposure to two OPFRs, triphenyl phosphate  (TPHP), and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) might lead to  behavioral impairment across the lifespan, as has been observed with the  organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos. METHODS: Zebrafish were exposed to 0.03  or 0.3 μM of TPHP, TDCIPP, or chlorpyrifos from 0 to 5 days post fertilization.  Vehicle control consisted of 0.03% solution of DMSO. At 6 days post  fertilization, larvae were tested on a locomotor assay. Separate cohorts of 6 day  old larvae that were not tested on the larval assay were allowed to grow to  adulthood. At 12 weeks post fertilization, these adult zebrafish were tested on a  battery of behavioral assays that included tests of novel environment  exploration, startle habituation, social affiliation, and predator escape.  RESULTS: Developmental exposure altered zebrafish behavior across the lifespan.  Larval zebrafish exposed to the 0.03 μM doses of chlorpyrifos or TDCIPP exhibited  significant (p<0.05) hyperactivity in the locomotor assay. Organophosphate  exposure significantly (p<0.05) altered the time course of adult zebrafish  behavior in the novel environment, startle habituation, and social affiliation  assays. Predator escape behavior was significantly (p<0.05) reduced in fish  exposed to the 0.3 μM dose of TDCIPP. Exposure also caused hyperactivity in adult  fish, with fish exposed to the 0.3 μM dose of TDCIPP exhibiting significantly  (p<0.05) elevated locomotor behavior in the novel environment assay. DISCUSSION:  Early developmental exposure to OPFRs produced behavioral impairment that  persisted into adulthood. These findings support broader research investigating  the role of organophosphate compounds, including the OPFRs used here, in  developmental neurotoxicity.",,10.1016/j.ntt.2015.08.008,"Animals;Behavior;Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Cognition;Developmental;Embryonic Development/*drug effects;Escape Reaction/drug effects;Exploratory Behavior/drug effects;Flame retardant;Flame Retardants/*toxicity;Habituation, Psychophysiologic/drug effects;Motor Activity/*drug effects;Organophosphate;Organophosphates/toxicity;Organophosphorus Compounds/*toxicity;Reflex, Startle/drug effects;Social Behavior;Zebrafish;Zebrafish/embryology;Organophosphates",NA,NA,developmental exposure to organophosphate flame retardants causes behavioral effects in larval and adult zebrafish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, as androgen receptor antagonists, the  fungicide vinclozolin and the principal DDT metabolite p,p'-DDE have been  demonstrated to induce demasculinization in rats. Whether this is also the case  in fish remains to be demonstrated. For a period of 30 days, groups of adult male  guppies were exposed to vinclozolin, p,p'-DDE, or the therapeutic antiandrogen  flutamide (used as positive control) applied to the fodder at concentrations  between 0.1 and 100 microg/g fodder. Subsequently, sexual characteristics of  relevance to the male reproductive capacity were measured and compared with  untreated control fish. All three chemicals caused profound alterations at  increasing levels of biological organization, even in these fully matured males.  At the cellular level, the three compounds induced a significant reduction in the  number of ejaculated sperm cells. At the organ level, the sexually attractive  orange-yellow coloration was reduced in area and discolored, and treated fish  also had smaller testes. Further, at the organismal level, computer-aided  behavior analyses demonstrated a severe disruption in male courtship behavior.

DESIGN: The toxicity tests were performed on common carp according to OECD 203  methodologies. The common carp were exposed to Fury 10 EW at concentrations, 5,  7, 10, 50 and 100 μg.l-1 for 96 h and compared to common carp in a non-treated  control group. Acute toxicity tests were detected value 96hLC50=13.8 µg.l-1. On  the basis of the results was assessed the effect on the hematological profile,  oxidative stress parameters, and antioxidants biomarkers in tissues, in another  acute test. RESULTS: The observed 96hLC50 value of Fury 10 EW was 13.8 μg.l-1. A  significantly lower large lymphocyte and monocyte count, and a significantly  greater number of segmented eosinophil granulocyte and higher hematocrit was  found in the pesticide-exposed common carp compared to controls. Oxidative damage  was not detected in the experimental common carp, however there were significant  differences from control in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and  glutathione reductase (GR) in tissue after acute exposure to 13.8 μg.l-1 Fury 10  EW.

The rate of pest adaptation is influenced by the type of control,  the selective pressure it imposes, and the gene flow between farms. By  understanding how these factors influence evolution at the metapopulation level,  pest management strategies that prevent resistance from evolving can be  developed. We developed a model for the metapopulation and evolutionary dynamics  of the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which is a major parasite  affecting salmon aquaculture. Different management scenarios were simulated  across a network of salmon farms covering half of Norway, and their effects on  louse epidemiology and evolution were investigated. We compared louse controls  that differed in how they were deployed through time (discrete vs. continuous),  how they impacted the louse life cycle, and in their overall efficacy. We  adjusted the strength of selection imposed by treatments, the dominance effect of  the resistant allele, and the geographic location at which resistance originated.  Continuously acting strategies (e.g., louse-resistant salmon) were generally more  effective than discrete strategies at controlling lice, especially when they  increased louse mortality during early developmental stages. However, effective  strategies also risked imposing frequent and/or strong selection on lice, thus  driving rapid adaptation. Resistant alleles were more likely to be lost through  genetic drift when they were recessive, had a low-fitness advantage, or  originated in low-farm-density areas. The north-flowing current along the  Norwegian coastline dispersed resistant genes from south to north, and limited  gene flow in the opposite direction. We demonstrate how evolutionary models can  produce quantitative predictions over large spatial and temporal scales and for a  range of pest control scenarios. Quantitative outputs can be translated into  practical management decisions applied at a regional level to minimise the risk  of resistance developing.",,10.1111/eva.13618,evolution model;integrated pest management;meta‐population;pesticide resistance;sea lice,NA,NA,evolutionary predictions for a parasite metapopulation modelling salmon louse resistance to pest controls in aquaculture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study,  a cDNA of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) SAA (gcSAA) was cloned and  characterized, displaying a high homology with its counterparts in vertebrates.  gcSAA mRNA was expressed with highest abundance in the liver and its levels were  increased by a 24-hour infection of Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) for more  than 5 folds in the intestine, 15 folds in the spleen, 75 folds in the head  kidney and 100 folds in the liver, implying that it is an acute phase protein in  grass carp. Subsequently, recombinant gcSAA protein (rgcSAA) was prepared from a  prokaryotic expression system after codon optimization of its coding sequence.  The direct antibacterial activity assay and the plate count assay disclosed that  gcSAA inhibited the growth and survival of A. hydrophila but not Edwardsiella  piscicida (E. piscicida) which both are common bacterial pathogens in  aquaculture. The propidium iodide (PI) uptake assay confirmed the bactericidal  property of gcSAA, showing that it is able to enhance the uptake of PI in A.  hydrophila but not E. piscicida.

METHODS: Both low malarious (DDT spray from 1958 to 1976) and high malarious (DDT  spray from 1958 to April 2006) villages were selected for the study in Arid zone  district Jodhpur, Rajasthan during March-April 2006. Resting behaviour of the  species during all its movement rhythms covering 24 h period related to: (i)  swarming/ mating; (ii) pre- and post-biting rest; (iii) after feed resting  between hoping movements; (iv) night and day time resting and; (v) diel activity  movements in response to temperature changes, were carried out. RESULTS: The  results showed that household objects like cupboards, furnitures, hanging  clothes, goods stacked on loft, stored clothes, cobwebs and floor were the  dominant resting sites both in sprayed and unsprayed villages. About 95 and 97%  of An. stephensi preferred to rest on household objects of unsprayed and sprayed  villages respectively. There was no significant difference in resting behaviour  of the species in both groups of villages (p >0.05). The pre-biting resting time  was recorded as 5 to 15 min whereas post-biting resting time lasted for 15 to 25  min. After biting outdoor (in courtyard--open to sky) species starts entering the  rooms at around 2330 hrs. It was observed that during III quarter (0100 to 0400  hrs) maximum species entered into the room were 56% in unsprayed and 62% in  sprayed villages. Statistically there was no significant difference in the entry  of mosquitoes (p >0.05) in both the groups of villages. CONCLUSION: Before DDT  era, An. stephensi was found resting at all heights of the walls inside the human  dwellings. Present study revealed that An. stephensi is trying to avoid sprayable  surfaces and tend to rest on unsprayable surfaces during all its movement rhythms  starting from swarming, pre-/post-biting and during hopping movements in the  courtyard and thereafter household objects inside the room as final day time  resting. It was concluded that changed behaviour of resting of An. stephensi on  unsprayable objects in sprayed rooms largely accounted for failure of malaria  control. Control of An. stephensi, thus requires an integrated vector control  strategy based upon interesectoral, environmental, larviciding with  chemical/biolarvicide and use of larvivorous fish wherever feasible. Such a  control strategy offers cost-effective and sustainable option than indoor  residual spray.",,,"*Behavior, Animal;Animals;Anopheles/*physiology;DDT/administration & dosage;Housing;India;Insect Bites and Stings;Insecticides/administration & dosage;Malaria/*prevention & control;Mosquito Control/*methods;Movement;Seasons;Malaria;Rest",NA,NA,resting behaviour of anopheles stephensi type form to assess its amenability to control malaria through indoor residual spray,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biomarkers involved in xenobiotic-mediated responses were individually  contrasted in fish of both species and 17 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)  analysed in muscle to reveal bioaccumulation trends. The parameters were in  muscle: cholinesterases, metabolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and citrate  synthase (CS); and in liver: cytochrome P450 dependent activities (EROD and  BFCOD), carboxylesterase (CE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione  reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT). All markers are  considered adaptive defence mechanism to face stress. Sensitivity to a model  pesticide: dichlorvos was also contrasted in vitro in muscular  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and hepatic CE to reveal species sensitivity to  neurotoxic chemicals. Enzymatic activities related to protective mechanisms such  as butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), CE and CAT were higher in chub whereas the  antioxidant defences GR and GPX were higher in barbel. Aerobic CS was also higher  in barbel while anaerobic LDH was so in chub. EROD activity did not differ  between the two species but BFCOD activity was higher in barbel. Levels of PFAS  were higher in barbel likely due to its benthic habitat. The in vitro tests  revealed higher sensitivity to dichlorvos of muscular AChE in chub (lower IC50)  which was probably compensated by a higher catalytic efficiency of CE.

In  particular, the paradigm for strong, directly density-dependent (DDD)  postsettlement mortality stands in contrast to recent evidence for inversely  density-dependent (IDD) mortality. We review the processes responsible for DDD  and IDD per capita mortality in reef fishes, noting that the pattern observed  depends on predator and prey behavior, the spatial configuration of the reef  habitat, and the spatial and temporal scales of observation. Specifically,  predators tend to produce DDD prey mortality at their characteristic spatial  scale of foraging, but prey mortality is IDD at smaller spatial scales due to  attack-abatement effects (e.g., risk dilution). As a result, DDD mortality may be  more common than IDD mortality on patch reefs, which tend to constrain predator  foraging to the same scale as prey aggregation, eliminating attack-abatement  effects. Additionally, adjacent groups of prey on continuous reefs may share a  subset of refuges, increasing per capita refuge availability and relaxing DDD  mortality relative to prey on patch reefs, where the patch edge could prevent  such refuge sharing. These hypotheses lead to a synthetic framework to predict  expected mortality patterns for a variety of scenarios. For nonsocial,  nonaggregating species and species that aggregate in order to take advantage of  spatially clumped refuges, IDD mortality is possible but likely superseded by DDD  refuge competition, especially on patch reefs. By contrast, for species that  aggregate socially, mortality should be IDD at the scale of individual  aggregations but DDD at larger scales. The results of nearly all prior reef fish  studies fit within this framework, although additional work is needed to test  many of the predicted outcomes. This synthesis reconciles some apparent  contradictions in the recent reef fish literature and suggests the importance of  accounting for the scale-sensitive details of predator and prey behavior in any  study system.",,10.1890/09-0298.1,"*Behavior, Animal;*Ecosystem;Animals;Anthozoa;Fishes/*physiology;Longevity;Population Density",NA,NA,synthesizing mechanisms of density dependence in reef fishes behavior habitat configuration and observational scale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the  possible effects of exposure to EDCs on reproductive behavior in a wild  population of songbirds, we examined the effects of vinclozolin in wild-caught  Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis). For this and many other temperate songbird  species, testosterone has powerful activational effects on affiliative behaviors  in adulthood. We hypothesized that vinclozolin would affect male behaviors  associated with female preference. Male juncos received daily oral gavage for 10  weeks with 2mM vinclozolin in vehicle or vehicle alone. Juncos were  photostimulated (16L:8D) to induce breeding behavior. Each pair of a treated and  non-treated male was presented to an estrogen-primed female to assess female  preference. Seven of eight females exhibited a strong preference for a male  exposed to vinclozolin over a control male (p=0.01). The only significant  difference in measured male behaviors was increased beak wiping in controls  (p=0.006) and there was no difference in gonad size or brain weight (p>0.05 for  each).

Environmental pollutants, notably endocrine disrupting compounds,  can interfere with the proper functioning of hormones, thereby impacting the  expression of hormonally regulated traits. Atrazine, one of the most widely used  herbicides, can alter sex hormone levels in exposed animals. I tested the effects  of environmentally relevant atrazine exposures on mating signals and behaviors in  male guppies, a sexually dimorphic freshwater fish. Prolonged atrazine exposure  reduced the expression of two honest signals: the area of orange spots  (ornaments) and the number of courtship displays performed. Atrazine exposure  also reduced aggression towards competing males in the context of mate  competition. In the wild, exposure levels vary among individuals because of  differential distribution of the pollutants across habitats; hence, differently  impacted males often compete for the same mates. Disrupted mating signals can  reduce reproductive success as females avoid mating with perceptibly suboptimal  males. Less aggressive males are at a competitive disadvantage and lose access to  females.

The objective of the  present study was to evaluate the environmental factors that may have influenced  the development oh hypospadias in children treated at the Maternal and Child  University Hospital od Las Palmas of Gran Canaria Island during the years  2012-2015. METHODS: The present study represents a retrospective analysis of  patients treated for hypospadias in the Maternal-Paediatric University Hospital  of Las Palmas of Gran Canaria during 4 years (2012 -2015) by the use of medical  records and telephone survey to families' patients. To perform the statistical  analysis of the data, the SPSS program was used in version 15.0. The level of  statistical significance was established for an error α = 0.05. The chi-square  test and Fisher's correction were applied if necessary to test the associations  between the qualitative variables. RESULTS: From 2012 to 2015, 128 patients were  treated; we could only follow 116 patients.

This study examined morphological (length, weight, age), biochemical  (lipid content, δ(13)C, δ(15)N), population and OC data for 9 fishes and  zooplankton between 1993 and 2003 (2010 for lake trout) to investigate causes for  the OC declines. Growth dilution was a major factor influencing the decrease of  OCs in lake trout, round whitefish and possibly zooplankton most notably in the  early 2000s. A decline in lipids of most fish species also contributed to OC  declines, although no such change was evident for zooplankton. It is suspected  that increases in fish populations or climate variations over the 1990s, may have  contributed towards a shift in plankton community composition. From 1991 to 1999,  CPUE increased for 7 of the fish species and declined for 2 others. Concurrently,  the zooplankton community shifted from an abundance of C. scutifer in 1993 to  dominance by D. pribilofensis in 2001. Nitrogen and carbon stable isotope data  suggested that food web interactions for most fish species have not changed over  time. Although concentrations of OCs have declined in many fishes, the ""rate"" of  OC transfer (using slopes of log OC vs. nitrogen isotope ratios) through the food  web was greater in 2001 than in 1993. Overall, the declines in OC concentrations  in the fish from Lake Laberge occurred concurrently with changes in their growth,  lipid, and abundance, suggesting that ecosystem responses to the closure of the  fishery were in part responsible for the lower contaminants in these fishes.

To investigate the immunotoxicity of LC and the improvement effect of MA in  lymphocytes (Cyprinus carpio), lymphocytes were treated with LC (80 M) and/or MA  (50 M) for 24 h. Firstly, CCK8 combined with PI staining results showed that MA  significantly attenuated the LC-induced lymphocyte death rate. Secondly, LC  exposure resulted in excessively damaged mitochondrial and mtROS, diminished  mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, which could be improved by MA.  Thirdly, MA upregulated the levels of mitophagy-related regulatory factors  (Beclin1, LC3, ATG5, Tom20 and Lamp2) induced by LC. Importantly, MA decreased  the levels of pyroptosis-related genes treated with LC, including NLRP3, Cas-4,  GSDMD and active Cas-1. Further study indicated that LC treatment caused  excessive miRNA-194-5p and reduced levels of FoxO1, PINK1 and Parkin, which was  inhibited by MA treatment.

Cadmium (Cd) is a genotoxic heavy metal that has  been recognized as a human carcinogen. Oxidant stress and inhibition of DNA  repair have been proposed as major factors underlying Cd genotoxicity. Our  previous studies indicated the ability of Cd to disturb the gene expression of  MSH6 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. This study was undertaken to explore if  Cd-induced oxidative stress down-regulated MSH gene activities. Following the  exposure of zebrafish embryos at 1 h post fertilization (hpf) to sublethal  concentrations of Cd at 3-5 μM for 4 or 9 h, a parallel down-regulation of MSH2,  MSH6 and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) gene expression was detected by  real-time RT-PCR and the expression levels were 40-50% of control after a 9-h  exposure. Cd exposure also induced oxidative stress, yet no inhibition of  catalase gene activity was observed. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed a  wide distribution of msh6 mRNA in the head regions of 10 hpf embryos and  pretreatment of embryos with antioxidants butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), d-mannitol  or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 1-10 μM restored Cd-suppressed msh6 expression. QPCR  confirmed the protective effects of antioxidants on Cd-suppressed msh2/msh6 mRNA  production. Down-regulated MSH gene activities reaching about 50% of control were  also induced in embryos exposed to paraquat, a reactive oxygen species  (ROS)-generating herbicide, or hydrogen peroxide at 200 μM. Hence, Cd at  sublethal levels down-regulates msh2/msh6 expression primarily via ROS as  signaling molecules. The transcriptional activation of human msh6 is known to be  fully dependent on the specificity factor 1 (Sp1). Cd failed to inhibit the DNA  binding activity of zebrafish Sp1 unless at lethal concentrations based on band  shift assay, therefore excluding the involvement of Sp1 inactivation in  Cd-induced MSH gene inhibition in zebrafish embryos.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2012.09.020,"Animals;Antioxidants/pharmacology;Cadmium/*toxicity;DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics;Down-Regulation/*drug effects;Embryo, Nonmammalian/drug effects;MutS Homolog 2 Protein/*genetics;Oxidative Stress/*drug effects;Protein Binding/drug effects;Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity;Zebrafish/embryology/*physiology;Oxidative Stress",NA,NA,cadmiumcdinduced oxidative stress downregulates the gene expression of dna mismatch recognition proteins muts homolog 2 msh2 and msh6 in zebrafish danio rerio embryos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seafood is known to contain nutrients beneficial for  the normal development and function of the brain, but also contaminants such as  PCBs which are neurotoxic. Exposure to non-coplanar PCBs during brain development  can disrupt spontaneous behaviour in mice and lead to hyperactive behaviour.  Humans are chronically exposed to the highest relative levels of organochlorines  in early childhood during brain development, though usually at doses which do not  give clinical symptoms of toxicity. This study aimed to elucidate the  developmental and behavioural effects of 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexachlorobiphenyl  (PCB153) in mice, mimicking human exposure during gestation and lactation.  METHODS: Environmentally relevant doses of PCB153 were added to the experimental  diets. Feed concentrations were approximately 0.5, 6.5, and 1500 μg PCB153/kg  feed, representing a realistic and a worst case scenario of frequent consumption  of contaminated fish. The study also investigated the effects of maternal  nutrition, i.e. a standard rodent diet versus a high inclusion of salmon. Mice  pups were examined for physical- and reflex development, sensorimotor function  and spontaneous behaviour from five days after birth until weaning. A selection  of pups were followed until 16 weeks of age and tested for open field behaviour  and the acoustic startle response (ASR) with prepulse inhibition (PPI). Blood  thyroid hormones and liver enzymes, blood lipids and PCB153 content in fat were  examined at 16 weeks. Statistical analyses modelled the three way interactions of  diet, PCB exposure and litter size on behaviour, using generalized linear models  (GLM) and linear mixed effect models (LME). The litter was used as a random  variable. Non-parametric tests were used for pair wise comparisons of biochemical  analyses. RESULTS: Litter size consistently influenced pup development and  behaviour. Few lasting PCB153 related changes were observed, but results  indicated effects on synchronization of physical development. Perinatal PCB153  exposure appeared to reduce habituation and cause aggression in males, though not  statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Litter size and maternal diet influenced  physical development and function more than PCB153 in perinatally exposed mouse  pups and supports the developmental importance of maternal care and the social  environment.",,10.1186/1744-9081-7-3,"Adipose Tissue/chemistry;Animals;Behavior, Animal/*drug effects;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Exploratory Behavior/drug effects;Female;Lipids/blood;Litter Size;Liver/enzymology;Male;Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects;Mice;Mice, Inbred BALB C;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/*toxicity;Pregnancy;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/blood/*psychology;Reflex, Startle/drug effects;Thyroid Hormones/blood",NA,NA,longterm effects of environmentally relevant doses of 224455 hexachlorobiphenyl pcb153 on neurobehavioural development health and spontaneous behaviour in maternally exposed mice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutrophils were  easily distinguished from macrophages in Antonow stained preparations by the  pattern of peroxidase positivity. Using ultrastructural cytochemistry,  neutrophils were found to have abundant cytoplasmic granules positive for  peroxidase and arylsulphatase and were negative for alpha-naphthyl butyrate (ANB)  esterase.

The aim of this study was to assess if dietary diphenyl  diselenide (PhSe)₂ has a protective effect in tissues of fish species Cyprinus  carpio exposed to the quinclorac herbicide. The fish were fed with either a  standard or a diet containing 3.0 mg/Kg of diphenyl diselenide for 60 d. After  were exposed to 1 mg/L of Facet® (quinclorac commercial formulation) for 192 h.

In  fish exposed to quinclorac and feeding with standard diet TBARS levels increased  in liver and gills. However, SOD activity decreases in liver whereas no  alterations were observed in catalase activity in this tissue. Quinclorac also  decrease GST activity in liver and brain, NPSH in brain and muscle and ascorbic  acid in muscle. Concerning protein carbonyl exposed to herbicide the fish did not  show any alterations. The diphenyl diselenide supplemented diet reversed these  effects, preventing increases in TBARS levels in liver and gills. GST activity  was recovered to control values in liver.

Here we show in the gilthead seabream, an  immunologically tractable teleost fish model, that the first lymphocyte marker  genes, those coding for the two subunits for the recombination activating gene,  were detected by RT-PCR around 21-27 days post-hatching (dph). In addition, the  transcripts coding for the alpha and beta subunits of the T-cell receptor and the  light and heavy chains of immunoglobulin M were detected at 27-48 dph. However,  most innate immune genes analyzed were already expressed at hatching, including  those coding for the toll-like receptors, pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules,  antiviral and antibacterial factors, and phagocyte markers. Using the information  from the gene expression study, we also examined the achievement of  immunocompetence by analyzing the protection induced by a bacterin against the  pathogenic bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida.

These inconsistent results may  stem from the fact that exposure typically occurs in the context of fish  consumption, which is also associated with cardioprotective factors such as  omega-3 fatty acids. Mechanistic information may help to understand whether MeHg  represents a risk to cardiovascular health. MeHg is a pro-oxidant that  inactivates protein sulfhydryls. These biochemical effects may diminish critical  antioxidant defense mechanism(s) involved in protecting against atherosclerosis.  One such defense mechanism is paraoxonase-1 (PON1), an enzyme present on  high-density lipoproteins and that prevents the oxidation of blood lipids and  their deposition in vascular endothelium. PON1 is potentially useful as a  clinical biomarker of cardiovascular risk, as well as a critical enzyme in the  detoxification of certain organophosphate oxons. MeHg and other metals are known  to inhibit PON1 activity in vitro. MeHg is associated with lowered serum PON1  activity in a fish-eating population. The implications of lowering PON1 are  evaluated by predicting the shift in PON1 population distribution induced by  various doses of MeHg. An MeHg dose of 0.3 μg/kg/d is estimated to decrease the  population average PON1 level by 6.1% and to increase population risk of acute  cardiovascular events by 9.7%. This evaluation provides a plausible mechanism for  MeHg-induced cardiovascular risk and suggests means to quantify the risk.

Zebrafish CD44a deficiency inhibits cell growth and proliferation, impairs cell  growth and death pathways, and regulates the expression levels of many genes  involved in p53 signaling, apoptosis and autophagy.

These  neurobehavioral injuries have been linked to reduced survival and population  declines. Despite the importance of maintaining proper olfactory signaling  processes in the presence of chemical exposures, little is known regarding  chemical detoxification in the salmon olfactory system, and in particular, the  antioxidant defenses that maintain olfactory function. An understudied, yet  critical component of cellular antioxidant defense is phospholipid hydroperoxide  glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx/GPx4), an isoform within the family of  selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzymes that can directly reduce  lipid peroxides and other membrane-bound complex hydroperoxides. In this study,  we cloned two gpx4 isoforms (gpx4a and gpx4b) from Coho salmon olfactory tissues  and compared their modulation in olfactory and liver tissues by cadmium, an  environmental pollutant and olfactory toxicant that cause oxidative damage as a  mechanism of toxicity. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the two gpx4 isoforms  shared 71% identity, and also relatively high sequence identities when compared  with other fish GPx4 isoforms. Sequence comparisons with human GPx4 indicated  conservation of three important active sites at selenocysteine (U46), glutamine  (Q81), and tryptophan (W136), suggesting similar catalytic activity between fish  and mammalian GPx4 isoforms. Tissue profiling confirmed the expression of gpx4a  and gpx4b in all ten Coho tissues examined. The expression of gpx4 mRNAs in the  Coho olfactory system was accompanied by comparably high initial rates of GPx4  enzymatic activity in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. Exposure to low (3.7  ppb) and high (347 ppb) environmental Cd concentrations for 24-48 h significantly  decreased gpx4a expression in Coho olfactory rosettes, whereas olfactory gpx4b  mRNA expression was not modulated by exposures at these concentrations. In  summary, Coho salmon express two paralogs of gpx4, a key enzyme in the  maintenance of signal transduction processes that protect against cellular  oxidative damage. The Cd-associated downregulation of salmon olfactory gpx4a  expression in particular, may be associated with the loss of olfactory signal  transduction that accompanies metal-associated loss of olfaction in salmonids.",,10.1016/j.aquatox.2012.02.025,"Animals;Cadmium/*toxicity;Cloning, Molecular;Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects;Glutathione Peroxidase/classification/genetics/*metabolism;Liver/drug effects/*enzymology;Olfactory Mucosa/drug effects/*enzymology;Oncorhynchus kisutch;Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase;Protein Isoforms;RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism;Signal Transduction/drug effects;Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity;Peroxidases;Peroxidase;Liver;Phospholipids;Glutathione;Hydrogen Peroxide",NA,NA,characterization of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione metabolizing peroxidase gpx4 isoforms in coho salmon olfactory and liver tissues and their modulation by cadmium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some important control interventions (e.g.  long-lasting insecticidal nests) have contributed to reduce malaria morbidity and  mortality in different parts of the world. Moreover, the development and  effective use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) hold promise to further enhance  the control and elimination of malaria, particularly in areas where health  services are deficient. The aim of this study was to determine knowledge,  attitudes, practices and beliefs in relation to RDTs for malaria in rural Côte  d'Ivoire. METHODS: One hundred individuals from Bozi and Yoho who sought care at  the health centre in Bozi and were offered an RDT for malaria were interviewed in  April 2010 using a pre-tested questionnaire on practice and perceptions in  relation to RDTs for malaria. The relationships between acceptance of RDTs and  factors related to opinions were identified, using generalized linear mixed  models. Qualitative data from open-ended questions complemented the quantitative  analysis. RESULTS: Only 34 out of 100 patients who were offered an RDT for  malaria were willing to undergo the test. People who perceived blood as a sacred  body fluid were less likely to comply with an RDT. The concurrent availability  and use of RDTs for HIV and malaria was associated with an unwilling attitude  towards RDTs for malaria (Fisher's exact test, p <0.001). The initial willingness  of patients to accept malaria testing with RDTs was significantly related to  general fear and wanting to know malaria infection status. For further and  regular use of RDTs, a strong relationship was observed between acceptance and  the idea that an RDT is a pretext used by health worker to know HIV status (odds  ratio (OR) = 16.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-268.5). Those thinking  that blood samples were useful for medical diagnoses were 8.31-times (95% CI =  2.22-31.1) more likely to undergo an RDT compared to those rejecting blood  sampling as a diagnostic strategy. CONCLUSION: Socio-cultural factors might be  barriers for accepting RDTs in general health services. There are social  representations of malaria and HIV/AIDS, symbolic for blood or experiences in  relation to blood taking and blood-related diseases in relation to the  introduction and routine use of RDTs. Special attention should be given to these  barriers as otherwise the promotion of RDTs for prompt and effective diagnosis  and subsequent management of malaria is hampered.",,10.1186/1471-2458-12-1089,"*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;*Rural Population;Adolescent;Adult;Cote d'Ivoire;Cross-Sectional Studies;Diagnostic Tests, Routine/*statistics & numerical data;Female;Humans;Linear Models;Malaria/*diagnosis/prevention & control;Male;Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*psychology/statistics & numerical data;Social Class;Surveys and Questionnaires;Young Adult;Malaria;Poly dA-dT",NA,NA,willingness to use a rapid diagnostic test for malaria in a rural area of central côte divoire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity assay performed in liver  primary cell cultures from sole determined that the different ulvan  concentrations assayed did not impair cell viability. Juveniles were  intraperitoneally (IP) injected with ulvan (0.5 mg/fish) followed by a challenge  with Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp) at 7 days.

Although ITNs have been  widely distributed to malaria-endemic regions in the past, their success has been  threatened by misuses (in fishing, agriculture etc.) and decay in ITN efficacy.  Decision-making in using the ITNs depends on multiple coevolving factors: malaria  prevalence, mosquito density, ITN availability and its efficacy, and other  socio-economic determinants. While ITN misuse increases as the efficacy of ITNs  declines, high efficacy also impedes proper use due to free-riding. This  irrational usage leads to increased malaria prevalence, thereby worsening malaria  control efforts. It also remains unclear if the optimum ITN use for malaria  elimination can be achieved under such an adaptive social learning process. Here,  we incorporate evolutionary game theory into a disease transmission model to  demonstrate these behavioural interactions and their impact on malaria  prevalence. We show that social optimum usage is a function of transmission  potential, ITN efficacy and mosquito demography. Under specific parameter  regimes, our model exhibits patterns of ITN usage similar to observed data from  parts of Africa.

After PQ exposure, fish liver showed high levels of glucose-6-P  dehydrogenase (G-6PDH) and GSSG reductase activities. The increased antioxidant  status and the lack of a specific transport system could explain the lack of  susceptibility of liver to DNA oxidative damage induced by PQ. Increased levels  of 8-oxodG were detected in the gills of PQ-exposed fish after 8 and 24 h. In  contrast, after 48 h exposed fish contained lower 8-oxodG levels than controls.  The existence of a PQ transport system in this O2-rich organ and the lack of a  significant increase in antioxidant defenses would explain the sensitivity of  gills to DNA damage promoted by PQ. Elimination of this soluble chemical and the  putative induction of DNA-repair enzymes specific for oxidative damages could  explain the drop of 8-oxodG levels at longer times.

These eco-types are genetically  distinct and differ in various aspects of morphology, vocalization patterns, diet  and habitat use. Various genetic and photo-identification studies of eastern  North Pacific killer whales have provided information on the male-female  composition of most of these resident pods and transient groups, as well as the  approximate ages, reproductive status and putative recruitment order (birth  order) of the individual whales.

Concentrations of OCs in transient killer whales (marine mammal-eating) were much  higher than those found in resident animals (fish-eating) apparently due to  differences in diets of these two killer whale eco-types. Certain life-history  parameters such as sex, age and reproductive status also influenced the  concentrations of OCs in the Alaskan killer whales. Reproductive female whales  contained much lower levels of OCs than sexually immature whales or mature male  animals in the same age class likely due to transfer of OCs from the female to  her offspring during gestation and lactation. Recruitment order also influenced  the concentrations of OCs in the Alaskan killer whales.

However, their biophysical  features showed wide variations according to the botanical agent using for the  green synthesis, outlining the importance of screening local floral resources  used as reducing and stabilizing agents. In this study, we focused on the  biophysical properties and the mosquitocidal action of Quisqualis  indica-fabricated AgNPs. AgNPs were characterized using spectroscopic (UV, FTIR,  XRD) and microscopic (AFM, SEM, TEM and EDX) techniques. AFM, SEM and TEM  confirmed the synthesis of poly-dispersed AgNPs with spherical shape and size  ranging from 1 to 30nm. XRD shed light on the crystalline structure of these  AgNPs. The acute toxicity of Quisqualis indica extract and AgNPs was evaluated  against malaria, arbovirus, and filariasis vectors, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes  aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, as well as on three important non-target  aquatic organisms. The Q. indica leaf extract showed moderate larvicidal  effectiveness on Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50=220.42), Ae. aegypti (LC50=203.63)  and An. stephensi (LC50=185.98). Q. indica-fabricated AgNPs showed high toxicity  against Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50=14.63), Ae. aegypti (LC50=13.55) and An.  stephensi (LC50=12.52), respectively. Notably, Q. indica-synthesized AgNPs were  moderately toxic to non-target aquatic mosquito predators Anisops bouvieri  (LC50=653.05μg/mL), Diplonychus indicus (LC50=860.94μg/mL) and Gambusia affinis  (LC50=2183.16μg/mL), if compared to the targeted mosquitoes. Overall, the  proposed one-pot biogenic fabrication of AgNPs using Q. indica is a low-cost and  eco-friendly tool in the fight against Zika virus, malaria and filariasis  vectors, with little impact against non-target aquatic mosquito predators.",,10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.07.036,"AFM;Animals;Anopheles/*drug effects/growth & development;Aquatic Organisms/drug effects;Arbovirus;Combretaceae/*chemistry/metabolism;Green synthesis;Insecticides/*chemistry/toxicity;Larva/drug effects/growth & development;Malaria/prevention & control;Metal Nanoparticles/chemistry/*toxicity/ultrastructure;Microscopy, Atomic Force;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning;Mosquito Vectors/*drug effects;Mosquito-borne diseases;Nanobiotechnology;Particle Size;Plant Extracts/chemistry;Plant Leaves/chemistry/metabolism;Silver/*chemistry;Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission;Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet;Zika Virus/*drug effects;Culicidae;Malaria",NA,NA,onepot biogenic fabrication of silver nanocrystals using quisqualis indica effectiveness on malaria and zika virus mosquito vectors and impact on nontarget aquatic organisms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using high taxonomic and temporal resolution, we contrast the  dominance structure of carabids and dynamics of the most abundant species in  maize (both sweet and field corn) agroecosystems using pest management tactics  determined by the purchase of seed and application of pyrethroid insecticides. In  the seed-based treatments, sweet corn contained Cry1Ab/c proteins, whereas field  corn contained the coupled technology of Cry3Bb1 proteins for control of corn  rootworm and neonicotinoid seed treatments aimed at secondary soil-borne pests.  The insecticide treatments involved foliar pyrethroids in sweet corn and  at-planting pyrethroids in field corn. The carabid community, comprised of 49  species, was dominated by four species, Scarites quadriceps Chaudoir, Poecilus  chalcites Say, Pterostichus melanarius Illiger, and Harpalus pensylvanicus  DeGeer, that each occupied a distinct temporal niche during the growing season.  Two species, Pt. melanarius and H. pensylvanicus, exhibited differences between  treatments over time. Only H. pensylvanicus had consistent results in both years,  in which activity densities in field corn were significantly higher in the  control in July and/or August. These results, along with laboratory bioassays,  led us to hypothesize that lower adult captures resulted from decrease in prey  availability or exposure of H. pensylvanicus larvae to soil-directed  insecticides-either the neonicotinoid seed treatment in the transgenic field corn  or an at-planting soil insecticide in the conventional field corn.",,10.1603/022.038.0348,"*Bacterial Proteins;*Coleoptera;*Ecosystem;*Endotoxins;*Hemolysin Proteins;*Insecticides;*Seasons;Agriculture/methods;Animals;Bacillus thuringiensis Toxins;Insect Control/methods;Plants, Genetically Modified;Population Dynamics;Zea mays/genetics",NA,NA,carabidae population dynamics and temporal partitioning response to coupled neonicotinoidtransgenic technologies in maize,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of illnesses are initiated or aided by the presence of  certain perturbing factors. In the case of autism spectrum disorder, the  environmental component plays an important part in determining the overall  picture. Moreover, the lack of therapies to relieve existing symptoms complicates  the fight against this condition. As a result, animal models have been used to  make biomedical research easier and more suited for disease investigations. The  current study used zebrafish as an animal model to mimic a real-life scenario:  acute exposure to an increased dose of pesticides, followed by prospective  intervention-based therapy with vitamin B(12) (vit. B(12)). It is known that vit.  B(12) is involved in brain function nerve tissue, and red blood cell formation.  Aside from this, the role of vit. B(12) in the redox processes is recognized for  its help against free radicals. To investigate the effect of vit. B(12), fish  were divided into four different groups and exposed to a pesticide mixture (600  μg L(-1) fipronil + 600 μg L(-1) pyriproxyfen) and 0.24 μg L(-1) vit. B(12) for  14 days. The impact of the compounds was assessed daily with EthoVision XT 11.5  software for behavioral observations, especially for sociability, quantified by  the social interaction test. In addition, at the end of the study, the activities  of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde  (MDA) were measured. The results showed significant improvements in locomotor  activity parameters and a positive influence of the vitamin on sociability.  Regarding the state of oxidative stress, high activity was found for SOD and GPx  in the case of vit. B(12), while fish exposed to the mixture of pesticides and  vit. B(12) had a lower level of MDA. In conclusion, the study provides new data  about the effect of vit.

The insecticide caused a reduction in the number of erythrocytes  and hemoglobin content after 96 h exposure, probably due to hemolysis.  Hyperglycemic response indicated energy mobilization, and may have contributed to  the increase in osmolarity after 96 h exposure to DFB. The induction of  glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase activities in liver pointed to the  activation of xenobiotic metabolic pathways and antioxidant defenses. The  decrease in muscle AChE at all experimental times showed that DFB is an AChE  inhibitor. In addition, DFB induced hepatic alterations that might impair normal  liver functions.

L. and Richter, Manuela",,eng,,,"An ecotoxicological test battery based on a mode-of-action approach was designed and applied to the hazard identification and classification of modes of action of  six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ethinyl estradiol, ibuprofen,  propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole). The rationale behind the design of the  battery was to cover the relevant interactions that a compound may have with  biological targets. It is thus not comprehensive but contains representative  examples of each category of mode of toxic action including nonspecific,  specific, and reactive toxicity. The test battery consists of one test system for  nonspecific toxicity (baseline toxicity or narcosis), two test systems for  specific effects, and two test systems for reactive toxicity. The baseline  toxicity was quantified with the Kinspec test, which detects membrane leakage via  measurements of membrane potential. This test system may also be used to detect  the specific effects on energy transduction, although this was not relevant to  any compound investigated in this study. As examples of specific  receptor-mediated toxicity, we chose the yeast estrogen screen (YES) as a  specific test for estrogenicity, and the inhibition of chlorophyll fluorescence  in algae to assess specific effects on photosynthesis. Reactive modes of action  were assessed indirectly by measuring the relevance of cellular defense systems.  Differences in growth inhibition curves between a mutant of Escherichia coli that  could not synthesize glutathione and its parent strain indicate the relevance of  conjugation with glutathione as a defense mechanism, which is an indirect  indicator of protein damage. DNA damage was assessed by comparing the growth  inhibition in a strain that lacks various DNA repair systems with that in its  competent parent strain. Most compounds acted merely as baseline toxicants in all  test systems. As expected, ethinylestradiol was the only compound showing  estrogenic activity. Propranolol was baseline-toxic in all test systems  exceptforthe photosynthesis inhibition assay, where it surprisingly showed a  100-fold excess toxicity over the predicted baseline effect. The exact mode of  toxic action could not be confirmed, but additional chlorophyll fluorescence  induction experiments excluded the possibility of direct interference with  photosynthesis through photosystem II inhibition. Mixture experiments were  performed as a diagnostic tool to analyze the mode of toxic action. Compounds  with the same mode of toxic action showed the expected concentration addition. In  the photosynthesis inhibition assay, agreement between experimental results and  prediction was best for two-stage predictions considering the assigned modes of  action. In a two-stage prediction, concentration addition was used as a model to  predict the mixture effect of the baseline toxicants followed by their  independent action as a single component combined with the specifically acting  compound propranolol and the reference compound diuron. A comparison with acute  toxicity data for algae, daphnia, and fish showed generally good agreement for  the nonspecifically acting compounds but also that the proposed test battery  offered better diagnostic value in the case of the specifically acting compounds.",,10.1021/es048590e,"*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions;*Food Chain;*Models, Theoretical;Animals;Daphnia;Eukaryota;Fishes;Risk Assessment;Toxicity Tests;Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity",NA,NA,in vitro assessment of modes of toxic action of pharmaceuticals in aquatic life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effects of TCF  on the antioxidant defense system, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and  stress responses in various tissues of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). C.carpio  L. were exposed to different concentrations of TCF (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and  4 mg L(-)(1)) at 25 and 15 °C for two weeks (measurements were taken after week 1  and 2). TCF exposure induced significant alterations in antioxidant responses in  the gills and the liver. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and  glutathione S-transferase (GST) increased considerably after TCF exposure,  depending on water temperature, whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH)  levels decreased notably after one and two weeks. Remarkable antioxidant  responses were observed in the gills, suggesting the gills were more sensitive to  oxidative stress than the liver based on CAT, GST, and GSH levels. Notable  increases in MDA levels were observed in the gills and the liver. AChE activity  was significantly inhibited in the brain and muscles even at the lowest TCF  concentration of 0.5 mg L(-)(1), indicating neurotoxicity following TCF exposure.  As a stress indicator, plasma cortisol was significantly elevated following  exposure to TCF depending on water temperature, thereby enhancing stress.

Bacteria that reside free and inside phagocytes cause acute and chronic forms of  photobacteriosis. Infections of juveniles rapidly kill up to 90-100% fish.  Factors underlying failure of the immune protection against bacteria remain  largely unknown. The reported study used a transcriptomic approach to address  this issue. Juvenile sea breams (0.5 g) were challenged by immersion in salt  water containing 2.89 × 10(8) CFU of a virulent Phdp and the head kidney was  sampled after 24- and 48-h. Analyses were performed using the second version of a  44 k oligonucleotide DNA microarray that represents 19,734 sea bream unique  transcripts and covers diverse immune pathways. Expression changes of selected  immune genes were validated with qPCR. Results suggested rapid recognition of the  pathogen, as testified by up-regulation of lectins and antibacterial proteins  (bactericidal permeability-increasing protein lectins, lysozyme, intracellular  and extracellular proteases), chemokines and chemokine receptors. Increased  expression of proteins involved in iron and heme metabolism also could be a  response against bacteria that are dependent on iron. However, negative  regulators of immune/inflammatory response were preponderant among the  up-regulated genes. A remarkable finding was the increased expression of IL-10 in  concert with up-regulation of arginase I and II and proteins of the polyamine  biosynthesis pathway that diverts the arginine flux from the production of  reactive nitrogen species. Such expression changes are characteristic for  alternatively activated macrophages that do not develop acute inflammatory  responses.

The  antibacterial protein, termed SSAP (S. schlegeli antibacterial protein), was  purified to homogeneity by lectin affinity column chromatography, anion-exchange  HPLC and hydroxyapatite HPLC. It was found to be a glycoprotein containing  N-linked glycochains and FAD. Its molecular mass was estimated to be 120 kDa by  gel filtration HPLC and 53 kDa by SDS/PAGE, suggesting that it is a homodimer.

The evolution of resistance (a  heritable decrease in susceptibility to Bt toxins) can pose a threat to sustained  control of target pests, but a high-dose refuge (HDR) management strategy has  been key to delaying countervailing evolution of Bt resistance. The HDR strategy  relies on the mating frequency between susceptible and resistant individuals, so  either partial dominance of resistant alleles or nonrandom mating in the pest  population itself could elevate the pace of resistance evolution. Using classic  Wright-Fisher genetic models, we investigated the impact of deviations from  standard refuge model assumptions on resistance evolution in the pest  populations. We show that when Bt selection is strong, even deviations from  random mating and/or strictly recessive resistance that are below the threshold  of detection can yield dramatic increases in the pace of resistance evolution.  Resistance evolution is hastened whenever the order of magnitude of model  violations exceeds the initial frequency of resistant alleles. We also show that  the existence of a fitness cost for resistant individuals on the refuge crop  cannot easily overcome the effect of violated HDR assumptions. We propose a  parametrically explicit framework that enables both comparison of various field  situations and model inference.

Due to rise in resistance against existing pesticides, development of novel drugs  or vaccines is necessary. Posttranscriptional gene silencing by RNA interference  (RNAi), when established in a high throughput system is a potential method for  evaluation of molecular targets for new medical compounds or vaccine antigens.  Successful use of RNAi has been reported in several stages of salmon lice.  However, when we employed a previously described protocol for planktonic stages,  no reproducible down-regulation of target genes was gained. In the present study,  we describe a robust method for RNAi, where nauplius larvae are soaked in  seawater added double stranded RNA (dsRNA). In order to test for when dsRNA may  be introduced, and for the efficacy and duration of RNAi, we performed a series  of experiments on accurately age determined larvae, ranging from the hatching egg  to the copepodid with a salmon louse coatomer and a putative prostaglandin E  synthase gene. Presumptive knock-down was monitored by real time PCR. Significant  gene silencing was obtained only when nauplius I larvae were exposed to dsRNA  during the period in which they molted to nauplius II. A knock down effect could  be detected 2days after soaking, and it remained stable until the last  measurement, on day 12. Soaking nauplius I larvae, knock-down was verified for  six additional genes with a putative role in molting. For one chitinase, a  loss-of-function phenotype with abnormal swimming was obtained.

The  ways in which stratospheric ozone depletion is directly altering climate in the  southern hemisphere and the consequent extensive effects on aquatic ecosystems  are also addressed. The primary objective is to synthesise novel findings over  the past four years in the context of the existing understanding of ecosystem  response to UV radiation and the interactive effects of climate change. If it  were not for the Montreal Protocol, stratospheric ozone depletion would have led  to high levels of exposure to solar UV radiation with much stronger negative  effects on all trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems than currently experienced in  both inland and oceanic waters. This ""world avoided"" scenario that has curtailed  ozone depletion, means that climate change and other environmental variables will  play the primary role in regulating the exposure of aquatic organisms to solar UV  radiation. Reductions in the thickness and duration of snow and ice cover are  increasing the levels of exposure of aquatic organisms to UV radiation. Climate  change was also expected to increase exposure by causing shallow mixed layers,  but new data show deepening in some regions and shoaling in others. In contrast,  climate-change related increases in heavy precipitation and melting of glaciers  and permafrost are increasing the concentration and colour of UV-absorbing  dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulates. This is leading to the  ""browning"" of many inland and coastal waters, with consequent loss of the  valuable ecosystem service in which solar UV radiation disinfects surface waters  of parasites and pathogens. Many organisms can reduce damage due to exposure to  UV radiation through behavioural avoidance, photoprotection, and photoenzymatic  repair, but meta-analyses continue to confirm negative effects of UV radiation  across all trophic levels. Modeling studies estimating photoinhibition of primary  production in parts of the Pacific Ocean have demonstrated that the UV radiation  component of sunlight leads to a 20% decrease in estimates of primary  productivity. Exposure to UV radiation can also lead to positive effects on some  organisms by damaging less UV-tolerant predators, competitors, and pathogens. UV  radiation also contributes to the formation of microplastic pollutants and  interacts with artificial sunscreens and other pollutants with adverse effects on  aquatic ecosystems. Exposure to UV-B radiation can decrease the toxicity of some  pollutants such as methyl mercury (due to its role in demethylation) but increase  the toxicity of other pollutants such as some pesticides and polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons. Feeding on microplastics by zooplankton can lead to bioaccumulation  in fish. Microplastics are found in up to 20% of fish marketed for human  consumption, potentially threatening food security. Depletion of stratospheric  ozone has altered climate in the southern hemisphere in ways that have increased  oceanic productivity and consequently the growth, survival and reproduction of  many sea birds and mammals. In contrast, warmer sea surface temperatures related  to these climate shifts are also correlated with declines in both kelp beds in  Tasmania and corals in Brazil. This assessment demonstrates that knowledge of the  interactive effects of ozone depletion, UV radiation, and climate change factors  on aquatic ecosystems has advanced considerably over the past four years and  confirms the importance of considering synergies between environmental factors.",,10.1039/c8pp90062k,"*Adaptation, Biological;*Climate Change;*Ozone Depletion;*Ultraviolet Rays/adverse effects;Animals;Aquaculture;Aquatic Organisms/*physiology/radiation effects;Ecosystem;Environmental Pollution/adverse effects/analysis;Fishes/physiology;Fresh Water/analysis;Ice Cover/chemistry;Oceans and Seas;Photosynthesis;Stratospheric Ozone/analysis;Zooplankton/physiology;Ozone",NA,NA,the interactive effects of stratospheric ozone depletion uv radiation and climate change on aquatic ecosystems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P. and Segner, H.",,eng,,,"P-glycoproteins (P-gps) encoded by multidrug resistance 1 (mdr1) genes are ATP-dependent transporters located in the cytoplasmic membrane which mediate the  efflux of a broad spectrum of hydrophobic compounds from the cell. The tissue  distribution of P-gps suggests their role in the organismal defense against  xenobiotics by effecting xenobiotic excretion and reducing xenobiotic uptake. In  the present work, the interaction of P-gp(s) in the liver and in primary cultured  hepatocytes of rainbow trout with two model pollutants was studied - the  imidazole fungicide prochloraz and the alkylphenolic surfactant nonylphenol  diethoxylate (NP2EO). Using a monoclonal antibody (mAB C219) directed against a  conserved P-gp epitope, an immunoreactive protein of 160 kDa was detected in  immunoblots of liver extracts from control trout. In sections of control trout  livers, immunohistochemistry with the mAB C219 resulted in specific staining of  bile canaliculi. In juvenile trout exposed for 7 days to sublethal concentrations  of prochloraz (0.027 microM; 0.27 microM) or NP2EO (0.32 microM; 1.30 microM), no  changes in levels of hepatic P-gp(s) were found in immunoblot and immunochemical  investigations. The efflux of the fluorescent mdr 1 substrate rhodamine 123  (Rh123) from cultured isolated trout hepatocytes was partly inhibited by  verapamil and vinblastine, compounds known to interfere with mdr 1-dependent  transport. This demonstrates the presence of a mdr1-like mechanism in trout liver  which is probably involved in the biliary excretion of hydrophobic xenobiotics.  Non-cytotoxic concentrations of prochloraz and NP2EO were tested for effects on  the efflux of Rh123 from trout hepatocytes. Prochloraz was a potent inhibitor of  the mdr1-like mechanism, being effective at 0.3 microM and above. NP2EO inhibited  Rh123 efflux only at the highest concentration tested (31.6 microM). The  accumulation and elimination of 14C-prochloraz by cultured trout hepatocytes was  not affected by mdr 1-type substrates (Rh123, vinblastine) and a mdr 1 inhibitor  (verapamil). This shows that prochloraz is, despite its inhibitory potency, not a  substrate of the mdr1-like mechanism in trout liver. The inhibition by prochloraz  and NP2EO of the md r1-like mechanism in trout hepatocytes suggests that water  pollutants can interfere with P-gp-function in fish and thus may impair the  organismal defense against xenobiotics.",,10.1016/s0166-445x(01)00167-9,"Animals;ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology;Cells, Cultured;Female;Hepatocytes/chemistry/drug effects;Imidazoles/metabolism/*toxicity;Immunohistochemistry;Liver/chemistry/*drug effects;Male;Oncorhynchus mykiss;Phenols/*toxicity;Glycoproteins;P-Glycoproteins;P-Glycoprotein",NA,NA,prochloraz and nonylphenol diethoxylate inhibit an mdr1like activity in vitro but do not alter hepatic levels of pglycoprotein in trout exposed in vivo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The parameters were in muscle: cholinesterases, metabolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and citrate synthase (CS); and in liver: cytochrome P450 dependent activities (EROD and BFCOD), carboxylesterase (CE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT). All markers are considered adaptive defence mechanism to face stress. Sensitivity to a model pesticide: dichlorvos was also contrasted in vitro in muscular acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and hepatic CE to reveal species sensitivity to neurotoxic chemicals. Enzymatic activities related to protective mechanisms such as butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), CE and CAT were higher in chub whereas the antioxidant defences GR and GPX were higher in barbel. Aerobic CS was also higher in barbel while anaerobic LDH was so in chub. EROD activity did not differ between the two species but BFCOD activity was higher in barbel. Levels of PFAS were higher in barbel likely due to its benthic habitat. The in vitro tests revealed higher sensitivity to dichlorvos of muscular AChE in chub (lower IC50) which was probably compensated by a higher catalytic efficiency of CE.

Studies related to the immune functions and activities of CD9 in teleost fish are limited. In this study, we characterized two CD9 homologs, PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3, from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Sequence analysis showed that PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 possess characteristic transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) structures. PoCD9.1 shares 70.61% sequence identity with PoCD9.3. The expression of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 in the three main immune tissues was significantly induced in a time-dependent manner by extracellular and intracellular pathogen infection, which indicates that the two CD9 homologs play an important role in the response to pathogenic infection. Following infection with the extracellular pathogen Vibrio anguillarum, the expression profiles of both PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 were similar. After infection with the intracellular pathogen Edwardsiella piscicida, the expression levels of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 were different at different stages of infection, especially in the spleen. The spleen was the most important tissue for the PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 responses to pathogen infection among the three examined immune tissues. Knockdown of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 attenuated the ability of host cells to eliminate pathogenic bacteria, and PoCD9.1 knockdown was more lethal than PoCD9.3 knockdown for host cells with E. piscicida infection. Overexpression of PoCD9.1 and PoCD9.3 promoted host or host cell defence against E. piscicida infection.

In view of the East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW), India, this paper has examined the trend, causes, extent and impacts of landscape transformation during the last few decades. Hence we aim to present a review of several studies in and around EKW and suggests a sustainable model for EKW. This 'Ramsar site of International Importance' is one of the world's largest wastewater-fed aquaculture systems where the city sewage is recycled for pisciculture and agriculture, and acts as flood resistance for the city of Kolkata. Rapid encroachment in the EKW due to unplanned development has caused various environmental, social and economic impacts. The key ecological impacts found in the study included loss of faunal and floral diversity, eco-toxicological impacts, etc. In terms of biodiversity loss, while the number of bird species in the EKW decreased from 248 in 1960s to 72 in 2005, about 59% fish species are near threats, vulnerable and endangered. Reported persistent organic pollutants (POPs) around the EKW region were found to pose deleterious impact on environment and ambient biota. Several studies have evidenced that the open burning of solid waste in the dumping ground of Dhapa is a potential source of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo dioxin/furans (PCDD/Fs). Further the ecological transformation of the EKW focussing on policy development and regulatory compliance issues has been studied in this paper. The aspects of encroachment and wetland shrinkage triggered by economic drivers like urban sprawl have been analyzed. The paper presents adaptive co-management as the future roadmap for action to curb further degradation of the wetlands, and adopt an integrated approach of environmental, political, physical, economic and institutional aspects. It is envisaged that the adaptive co-management model will contribute to long-term sustainable sustenance of this precious ecosystem.

Chemical control is achieved either by using synthetic or natural insecticides where the latter is more preferable. In biological control, bacteria, fungi and larvivorous fish are utilised to reduce the vector population. Moreover, genes of mosquitoes are also explored to produce progenies which are sterile with low survival ability. Vaccines are among the most effective ways to prevent viral infection. Various approaches have been used and are still being explored towards producing vaccines for dengue. These include live attenuated, inactivated, recombinant subunit, nucleic acid and virus-like particles vaccines. The aim is to produce a vaccine which can target all the four serotypes of the virus. Monoclonal antibodies are widely researched on to equip the host defense mechanism against the dengue virus.

Population growth has led to the need to increase global food production. Pesticides are an important tool used in efforts to control insect pests. About 20-30% of agricultural produce is lost annually due to insect pests, diseases, weeds and rodents. While pesticides are effective against pest populations, if used injudiciously, they may pose health hazards to humans, domestic animals, natural enemies of crop pests and other forms of life through unwanted contamination of food, feed, water bodies and the environment.        Objectives. The aim of the present study was to examine farmers' level of knowledge and awareness of environmental pollution due to unsafe use of pesticides for controlling rice pests and to explore ways of reducing their usage.        Methods. The research population consisted of 120 rice farmers: 40 farmers randomly selected from each of the three rice growing districts of Bangladesh; Mymensingh, Tangail and Jamalpur. Data was collected through group discussions, direct observations and personal interviews during March 2013 to May 2014.        Results. Farmers mainly sought advice on pesticide use from pesticide dealers or retailers and a very few farmers contacted government extension workers for this purpose. Most of the farmers had an understanding of natural enemies of rice pests and that the application of synthetic insecticides in the field can reduce their population. A few farmers followed integrated pest management (IPM) practices with little understanding of the adverse effects of insecticides on the environment and ecosystem. The majority of farmers understood the harmful effects of pesticides on health of human and animals, beneficial species, fish, insect resistance, soil and food. It was also found that education on pest management, information through television, more contact with extension personnel and farmers' awareness of IPM were critical factors for improving rice farmers' understanding of the ecological hazards caused by overuse of pesticides. Most of the farmers suggested that timely removal of weeds, appropriate timing for pesticide application, balanced doses of fertilizers, pest monitoring, correct dose of appropriate pesticides, pest tolerant varieties, increasing technical knowledge and skills and creating social awareness of environmental pollution among farmers were necessary to reduce the quantity of pesticides and minimize environmental hazards.        Conclusions. The present study identified a need to intensify farmers' awareness and knowledge of integrated pest management and environmental pollution through extension organizations which could help promote sustainable agricultural development and improve the currently endangered bio-diversity of Bangladesh.

We examined the effects of mercury and the organophosphate pesticide dimethoate on EROD, MROD, glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholine esterase (AChE), metallothionein (MT) and glutathione (GSH) in the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus). Crayfish were injected with mercury chloride or dimethoate (0.3, 0.6, 0.9 mu g kg(-1)) and dissected after 72 h. EROD activity in the hepatopancreas did not change in response to mercury chloride treatment but exhibited a dose dependent decrease at all concentrations of dimethoate tested. MROD (hepatopancreas) exhibited a significant decrease at the 0.9 mu g kg(-1) treatment for both chemicals. GST (hepatopancreas) demonstrated a significant dose dependent decrease at all concentrations of both mercury chloride and dimethoate. AChE (tail muscle) decreased at the 0.6 and 0.9 mu g kg(-1) concentrations of dimethoate and 0.9 mu g kg(-1) mercury chloride. In gill tissue, MT increased in response to 03 and 0.6 mu g kg(-1) of mercury chloride but no effect was observed at the 0.9 mu g kg(-1) concentration of mercury chloride or any concentrations of dimethoate tested. MT did not change in response to mercury or dimethoate in tail tissue. Furthermore, neither chemical modulated GSH concentrations. Our results indicate that, apart from GSH, these markers are sensitive to the pollutants tested and that animals exposed in the wild are potentially compromised in their ability to detoxify environmental contaminants and carry out normal cellular processes.

In China, there are six species of dominant indoor cockroaches which are increasingly hard to control due to their high adaptability, strong fecundity and extensive insecticide resistance. These cockroaches harbour abundant microorganisms varying from bacteria to viruses, fungi and protists, which have formed an interdependent symbiotic relationship with hosts in the process of long-term coevolution. A growing research has revealed that symbionts can modulate limited metabolic networks, thereby expanding ecological niches of host insects as a significant regulatory factor in insect growth and development. Therefore, in-depth study on the mechanisms of symbiont-insect interactions can shed light on a new perspective for pest prevention and control technology. Here, we give a general overview on classification and hazards of indoor cockroaches in China, as well as species, distribution and transmission mechanism of symbionts within cockroaches. Besides, we mainly discuss the interactions between insects and symbionts from the following aspects: nutritional physiology, reproductive regulation, pesticide resistance, defence, behaviour and so on. Based on the earlier symbiotic interactions, we propose some promising new insights into integrated pest management of cockroaches (i.e., utilizing symbionts to control cockroaches), such as application of Wolbachia to restrict population number, utilization of interactions between symbionts and entomopathogenic fungi including synergism or antagonism to accelerate host death, limiting host's vectorial capacity via paratransgenesis, push-pull strategy.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  22     Cited Reference Count:  268,10.1016/bs.aiip.2018.07.001     WE  - Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CYPRINUS-CARPIO L.;FACULTATIVE BACTERIAL ENDOSYMBIONTS;INNATE IMMUNE-RESPONSES;BLATTELLA-GERMANICA;GUT MICROBIOTA;INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE;HEAT-SHOCK;PEA APHID;MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION;ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGI;China,NA,NA,the potential control strategies based on the interaction between indoor cockroaches and their symbionts in china,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neotropical tadpoles experience large temperature fluctuations in their habitats and many species are distributed in areas impacted by agriculture. This study evaluated the effects caused by the exposure to clomazone (Gamic) at different temperatures (28, 32 and 36 degrees C) on biochemical stress responses and esterase activities in Physalaemus nattereri and Rhinella schneideri tadpoles. Results evidenced that temperature modulates the effects of clomazone on biochemical response of tadpoles. Antioxidant enzymes, including catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase had their activities increased by clomazone in P. nattereri treated at higher temperatures. The biotransformation enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was also induced by clomazone at 32 and 36 degrees C. In R. schneideri, clomazone failed to alter antioxidant enzymes at 28 degrees C, but SOD and GST were increased by clomazone at higher temperatures after three days. All enzymes had their activities returned to the control levels after eight days in R. schneideri. Lipid peroxidation was induced in both species exposed to clomazone at 32 and 36 degrees C, but not at 28 degrees C. Acetylcholinesterase was not sensitive to clomazone and temperature, while most treatments impaired carboxylesterase activity. Integrated biomarker response (IBR) was notably induced by temperature in both species, and a synergic effect of temperature and clomazone was mostly observed after three days of exposure. These findings imply that tadpoles from tropical areas may present differential responses in their physiological mechanism linked to antioxidant defense to deal with temperature fluctuations and agrochemicals presence in their habitats.

Although species, trophic level, and means of production are typically considered in predicting fish pollutant load, and thus recommendations of consumption, capture location is usually not accounted for.        OBJECTIVES: Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) are harvested from across the world's oceans and are widely consumed. Here, we determined geographic variation in the overall mass, concentration, and composition of POPs in yellowlin and examined the differences in levels of several POP congeners of potential relevance to human health.        METHODS: We sampled dorsal muscle of 117 yellowfin tuna from 12 locations worldwide, and measured POP levels using combined liquid or gas chromatography and mass spectrometry according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standard procedures.        RESULTS: POP levels varied significantly among sites, more than 36-fold on a mass basis. Individual fish levels ranged from 0.16 to 138.29 ng/g wet weight and lipid-normalized concentrations from 0.1 to 12.7 mu M. Levels of 10 congeners that interfere with the cellular defense protein P-glycoprotein, termed transporter interfering compounds (TICs), ranged from 0.05 to 35.03 ng/g wet weight and from 0.03 to 3.32 mu M in tuna lipid. Levels of TICs, and their individual congeners, were strongly associated with the overall POP load. Risk-based analysis of several carcinogenic POPs indicated that the fish with the highest levels of these potentially harmful compounds were clustered at specific geographic locations.

Lifetime exposures to four PCB congeners in 6128 participants from NHANES 1999-2004 are simulated using the ACC-Human model supplied with individualized input parameters obtained from NHANES questionnaires (e.g., birth year, sex, body mass index, dietary composition, reproductive behavior). Modeled and measured geometric mean PCB-153 concentrations in NHANES participants of 13.3 and 22.0 ng g(-1) lipid, respectively, agree remarkably well, although lower model-measurement agreement for air, water, and food suggests that this is partially due to fortuitous error cancellation. The model also reproduces trends in the measured data with key factors such as age, parity and sex. On an individual level, 62% of all modeled concentrations are within a factor of three of their corresponding measured values (Spearman r(s) = 0.44). However, the model attributes more of the inter-individual variability to differences in dietary lipid intake than is indicated by the measured data.

He hypothesized that these chemical residues adversely affected fish and wildlife, and particularly the declining populations of amphibians in Sierra Nevada streams and lakes. Fumio and his students and colleagues found residues of toxaphene and PCBs at higher elevations, an apparent result of atmospheric drift and deposition in the mountains.

In order to assess its response to some particular widespread pollutants, juveniles of S. senegalensis were administered an intraperitoneal injection of the model aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist P-naphto-flavone (beta NF) and chemicals of environmental concern, such as the fungicide ketoconazole (KETO), the lipid regulator gemfibrozil (GEM), the surfactant nonylphenol (NP) and the synthetic hormone ethinylestradiol (EE2). Two days after injection, the effect of these chemicals was followed up as alterations of hepatic microsomal activities of the cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and associated reductases, carboxylesterases (CbEs) and the conjugation enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT). In the cytosolic fraction of the liver, the effect on CbEs, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and antioxidant activities was also considered. Alterations on the endocrine reproductive system were evaluated by plasma levels of vitellogenin (VTG) and the sex steroids estradiol (E-2), testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) and the progestin 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta-P). Injection with the model compound PE induced the hydrolysis rate of the seven CYP substrates assayed. The xenobiotic GEM induced three CYP-related activities (e.g. ECOD) and UDPGT, but depressed antioxidant defenses. EE2 induced four CYPs, more significantly ECOD and BFCOD activities. The xenoestrogens NP and EE2 altered the activities of CbE in microsomes and catalase, and were the only treatments that induced de nova VTG synthesis. In addition, the progestin 17,20 beta-P, was induced in NP-injected fish. None of the treatments caused statistically significant effects on steroid plasma levels. In conclusion, the CYP substrates assayed responded specifically to treatments and juveniles of S. senegalensis appear good candidates for assessing xenobiotics exposure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Bivalve mollusks are filter-feeding organisms that can accumulate chemical and microbiological contaminants in their tissues from very low concentrations in the water or sediments. Consumption of contaminated shellfish is one of the main causes of seafood poisoning. Thus, marine bivalves are normally depurated in sterilized seawater for 48 h to allow the removal of bacteria. However, this depuration time might be insufficient to eliminate chemical contaminants from their tissues. We have developed a novel technology that accelerates up to fourfold the excretion rate of xenobiotics in bivalves by treatment with the antioxidant and glutathione (GSH) pro-drug N-acetylcysteine (NAC) during the depuration period. NAC improved dose-dependently the detoxification of the organophosphate (OP) pesticide fenitrothion in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, diminishing its levels up to nearly a hundred fold compared to conventional depuration, by enhancing the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and inducing the GSH anabolism (GSH synthesis and reduction by glutathione reductase). Notably, this induction in GSH anabolism and GST activity was also observed in uncontaminated bivalves treated with NAC. As the GSH pathway is involved in the detoxification of many pollutants and biotoxins from harmful algal blooms, we validated this proof of principle in king scallops (Pecten maximus) that naturally accumulated the amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) toxin domoic acid. We illustrate here a method that enhances the elimination of organic contaminants in shellfish, opening new avenues of depuration of marine organisms.

On entering aquatic habitats, these chemicals target and disrupt both physiological and behavioral functioning in various aquatic organisms. Herbicides, such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), can have negative impacts on chemoreception because these receptor cells are in direct contact with water-soluble chemicals in the environment. Studies focusing on lethal concentration (LC50) levels may understate the impact of herbicides within aquatic habitats because damage to the chemoreceptors can result in modified behaviors or lack of appropriate responses to environmental or social cues. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether exposure to sublethal levels of 2,4-D alters the foraging behaviors of crayfish Orconectes rusticus. We hypothesized that crayfish exposed to greater concentrations of 2,4-D would be less successful in locating food or on locating food would consume smaller amounts possibly due to an inability to recognize the food odors in the contaminated waters. Crayfish were exposed to three sublethal levels of 2,4-D for 96 h and placed into a Y-maze system with a fish gelatin food source placed randomly in the right or left arm. Average walking speed, average time spent in the correct arm, and percent consumption were analyzed. Our data show that crayfish were impaired in their ability to forage effectively.

While, for PCBs concentrations, three stations (A8, B1, and B2) were higher than their effect range median values which may indicate high potential toxicity of the sediment with probable adverse effects to the living biota.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  70     Total Times Cited:  72     Cited Reference Count:  61,10.1007/s11356-011-0582-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Persistent organic compounds;River basin;Environmental chemistry;Urban;agricultural;industrial effluents;SUSPENDED PARTICULATE MATTER;QUALITY ASSESSMENT;COASTAL SEDIMENTS;BIZERTE LAGOON;PCB CONGENERS;PAH CONTENT;WATER;ESTUARY;FISH;LAKE;Hydrocarbons, Aromatic;France;Pesticides;Hydrocarbons",NA,NA,aliphatic hydrocarbons polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls organochlorine and organophosphorous pesticides in surface sediments from the arc river and the berre lagoon france,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rayyan-1227191191,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance phosmet,2011,5,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,9,5,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"EFSA, Parma, Italy","Phosmet is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20003, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20024. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the European Commission.        Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on phosmet in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 23 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 03 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Margarita Internacional. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6 April 2006 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 12 May 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 75).        Phosmet was included in Annex I of Directive 91/414 by Commission Directive 2007/25/EC of 23 April, 20075. The entry into force of the Annex I inclusion was 1 October 2007.        In March 2010 the European Commission received a request to modify the ADI for phosmet, based on an evaluation of new toxicological data carried out by the United Kingdom following an application from Gowan Comercio Internacional e Servicos. In compliance with the Guidance Document SANCO 10328/2006 rev. 6, the European Commission invited all Member States and EFSA to provide comments on the new evaluation. Following consideration of the comments received, the European Commission requested EFSA to organise a peer review of the new evaluation and to deliver its conclusions on the new proposed ADI for phosmet.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an acaracide and insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises tractor-mounted spraying and airblast assisted sprayers in orchards. Application is made to citrus fruit at a rate of 0.5 kg phosmet per hectare, pome fruit at 0.3 kg phosmet per hectare and potatoes at 0.5 kg phosmet per hectare.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Imidan 50 WP a wettable powder (WP) registered under different trade names in Europe. The representative uses assessed were located in southern Europe only as stated in the application for annex 1 listing. No conclusion on the equivalence of the two sources could be made as some mammalian toxicology data were missing.        In the main adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. The residue definition for water can not be finalised due to outstanding ecotoxicology data. The method for body fluids and tissues is currently only validated for phosmet and as the oxon is in the residue definition further validation data will be required. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Limited analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are some outstanding issues related to the relevant impurities.        The toxicological risk assessment is based on the assumption that the studies have been performed with a test material that covers the current technical specification.        The absorption is rapid and almost complete, there is no accumulation in tissues and the excretion is mainly via urine. Phosmet is toxic by oral administration and the proposed classification is T, R25. It is non-irritant to skin and eyes and does not cause sensitisation by skin contact.        The critical effect after repeated exposure is depression of the plasma, erythrocyte and brain acetylcholinesterase activities. The most sensitive species is the dog. Phosmet is an in vitro but not in vivo genotoxic agent. Increased incidence of liver tumours is observed in mice at the highest dose level (14 mg/kg bw/day), higher than controls but within the same range as historical control data. In a two-generation study with rats, the fertility parameters and the offspring are not directly affected. Phosmet shows no evidence of teratogenicity in rat or rabbits, and no potential to induce delayed neurotoxicity. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, based on a NOAEL of 1 mg/kg bw/day from the rat multigeneration study, supported by short-term studies in dogs and rats and a long-term study in rats. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.045 mg/kg bw and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) 0.02 mg/kg bw/day.        For the use on potatoes and pomes, exposure estimates according to the German model are below the AOEL for operators wearing personal protective equipment and respiratory protective equipment. In spite of these high protection measures, the operator exposure is above the AOEL during application on citrus fruits. Estimates of worker and bystander exposure are below the AOEL for all the supported uses.        Plant metabolism studies with 14C-phosmet in cherries, potatoes and corn are available covering the representative uses. A common metabolic pathway is proposed. Phosmet is able to penetrate through the plant surface where the main metabolic reactions take place. Within the plant tissues only a limited transport is observed. The primary metabolic reactions are hydrolysis and conjugation reactions which produce phthalic acid and a range of related compounds, none of them containing the phosphorodithioate group. Oxidation reaction leading to the oxygen analogue phosmet oxon is a minor metabolic reaction. Considering the fact that oxygen analogue compounds are of high toxicity and the fact that no specific information on the toxicological significance of this compound is available, it was concluded to include phosmet oxon in the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring purposes. However, pending on the outcome of the study aimed to address the relative potency of phosmet oxon in comparison with the parent compound, it might be necessary to reconsider the residue definitions. Supervised residue trials in oranges, apples and potatoes have been submitted, which allow the proposal of the following MRLs: oranges and pome fruit: 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, potatoes: 0.02* mg/ kg. No MRLs are proposed for other citrus fruit as the available trials in oranges are not suitable for extrapolation to the whole crop group.        Supervised residue trials in oranges, apples and potatoes have been submitted, which allow the proposal of the following MRLs: oranges and pome fruit: 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, potatoes: 0.02* mg/kg. No MRLs are proposed for other citrus fruit as the available trials in oranges are not suitable for extrapolation to the whole crop group.        The effects of processing on the nature and the level of residues were investigated. Under conditions simulating pasteurisation, baking/brewing/boiling and sterilisation, phosmet degraded to less toxic compounds or compounds that occurred also in animal metabolism studies. The transfer factors to apple juice, apple pure and canned apples were very low, with residues essentially left in the pomace and peel fractions.        Studies on succeeding or rotational crops are not required due to the fast degradation of phosmet in soil.        Livestock can be exposed to residues of phosmet through consumption of fruit pomace and potatoes. Metabolism studies in lactating goat and laying hens demonstrated that phosmet will not occur in animal tissues, milk and eggs when livestock is fed with feed produced according to GAP for the supported use.        The consumer risk assessment was carried out taking into account chronic and acute exposures according to the provisional residue definition (sum of phosmet and phosmet oxon, expressed as phosmet). The calculations indicate that the exposure will be below the ADI and the ARfD, respectively.        In aerobic laboratory soil degradation studies (20 degrees C, 21-50% soil maximum water holding capacity) phosmet exhibited low persistence and did not form any major (>10% AR) extractable non volatile soil metabolites. The major sink for the radiolabels used in the experiments was mineralisation to CO2 (5377% applied radioactivity (AR) at 120-150 days). Residue not extracted by acetone /acidified acetone accounted for 17-38% AR at 150 days. In field dissipation studies carried out in the USA phosmet also exhibited low persistence. Under laboratory (23 degrees C) anaerobic soil conditions the major (14.5% AR) metabolite N-hydroxymethyl phthalamic acid was identified.        Based in the results of laboratory batch adsorption studies phosmet exhibited low mobility being considered immobile in one of the four soils tested. In a BBA guideline lysimeter study carried out in Switzerland that covers the applied for representative uses if applications are made in July, there was no leaching of radioactivity (excluding CO2) in collected leachate samples > 0.06 mu g/L, confirming the results of FOCUS scenario groundwater modelling for parent phosmet and indicating leaching of the soil metabolites that are formed at low levels is unlikely to be significant. All this information indicates, that for the applied for intended uses, the potential for groundwater exposure above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is negligible.        In laboratory (20 degrees C) natural sediment water systems phosmet both dissipated rapidly by partitioning to sediment and degraded rapidly, resulting in it exhibiting very low persistence. The major (>10% AR) metabolites identified were: phthalamic acid phthalic acid and N-hydroxymethyl phthalimide. Based on the available sterile hydrolysis studies and laboratory aqueous photolysis study O, Odimethylphosphorodithioc acid and O, O-dimethylphosphoric acid may also be formed as major metabolites in natural surface waters. In sediment the only major component of the residue in addition to phosmet was phthalamic acid. All these identified breakdown products were themselves relatively labile. CO2 from the carbonyl radiolabel used in the natural sediment water studies was the major sink for the applied radioactivity (accounting for 80-92% AR at 100 days). FOCUS step 2 to 4 surface water assessments have been completed for parent phosmet (with step 4 just considering spray drift mitigation) but only southern European scenarios and then only early season application timings were simulated. As the applied for representative southern European uses assessed are not restricted to applications only being made later in the growing season, if phosmet is included in annex 1, then southern member states where later season uses are applied for, should carry out national assessments of the potential for surface water exposure and associated aquatic risk assessments from the drainage and runoff routes of entry to surface water, as it is not clear that the available EU level assessment covers these situations. Also the current assessment identifies that for the early season application southern European scenarios assessed, only 1 scenario for each crop (D6 potatoes, R4 citrus and pome fruit), represented a low risk to aquatic organisms without mitigation to reduce runoff input to surface water being considered. For all other geoclimatic situations assessed high risk was identified when only the spray drift risk was mitigated.        A high acute risk to insectivorous birds was identified for all evaluated uses and also for herbivorous birds in potatoes. The initially identified high long-term risk to birds for all evaluated uses was reassessed based on measured residues in insects and grass. The refined long-term TER values for birds are above the Annex VI trigger. For a generic herbivorous mammal a potential high long-term risk was identified for all uses. The refined assessment based on selected focal mammalian species needs to be further justified.        Phosmet is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Since data on acute toxicity to seven fish species are available the safety factor was lowered from 100 to 20. Risk mitigation measures to reduce spray drift input corresponding to 40 m in orchards and 20 m in potatoes are needed in order to meet this trigger for one FOCUS scenario in each crop. Based on data from an available mesocosm study, the same buffer zones will also be sufficient to protect aquatic invertebrates in southern Europe in case of early application for one FOCUS scenario in each crop. The risk assessment for the aquatic environment needs to be complemented with scenarios for later in the season, when drainage and runoff routes of entry are likely to contribute to the concentration in surface water from the assessed uses in southern Europe.        Phosmet is very toxic to bees. The high risk needs to be managed at Member State level. Application should be avoided when there are likely to be any bees in the crop and a withholding period needs to be established. The risk to non-target arthropods is high. A potential for in-field recolonisation has been demonstrated, however further data is required to address the impact off-field and the potential for recolonisation from off-field areas.        The risk to earthworms, other non-target soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  5,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2162     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Phosmet;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;insecticide;acaricide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance phosmet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Willapa Bay oyster reserves were set aside in 1890 to preserve stocks of the native oyster Ostrea lurida in this estuary, but these stocks were overfished and replaced with the introduced Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas during the late 1920s. Pacific oysters have spawned and set naturally in this estuary on a fairly regular basis since that time, and have formed the basis of a sustainable fishery established on state oyster reserves. The fishery is managed as an annual sale of oysters to private aquaculture interests. Oysters are harvested mostly by hand from intertidal tracts, usually moved to better growing areas closer to the estuary mouth, and shell is required to be returned to the reserves to perpetuate the fishery. Although oyster harvest for human consumption will remain an important social management goal, these bivalves have been shown to provide a suite of other ecosystem functions and services. A survey of the reserves suggests that they represent 11.2% of the intertidal habitat in Willapa Bay and cover substantial subtidal areas as well. A comparison with historical maps suggests that most of the low intertidal area in the reserves formerly populated by native oysters is now covered primarily with eelgrass (Zostera marina), which potentially serves as important habitat for numerous other organisms, including juvenile salmon. Dungeness crab, and migratory waterfowl like black Brant. Native oysters can still potentially be restored to some of these areas, but the value of both introduced oysters and eelgrass as habitat and ecosystem engineers also deserves attention, and the reserves provide an excellent place to elucidate the role of these additional conservation targets at the landscape scale.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  34     Total Times Cited:  40     Cited Reference Count:  98,10.2983/035.030.0111     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),oyster reserves;Ostrea lurida;Crassostrea gigas;Washington;oysters;habitat;eelgrass;recruitment;LURIDA CARPENTER 1864;OSTREA-LURIDA;OLYMPIA OYSTER;CRASSOSTREA-GIGAS;CHESAPEAKE BAY;ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS;CALLIANASSA-KRAUSSI;EELGRASS ABUNDANCE;PESTICIDE CARBARYL;UPOGEBIA-AFRICANA,NA,NA,the willapa bay oyster reserves in washington state fishery collapse creating a sustainable replacement and the potential for habitat conservation and restoration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triflumuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 28 February 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 30 September 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 194).        Following the Commission Decision of 16 March 2009 (2009/241/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of triflumuron in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Bayer CropScience AG made a resubmission application for the inclusion of triflumuron in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues and concerns identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/146/08) as follows:        The risk to consumers        The risk to aquatic organisms.        The acute toxicity of metabolite M07.        The lack of data to determine an appropriate residue definition.        The lack of data on the levels of residues in processed commodities.        The high risk to the aquatic environment        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Italy, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 5 March 2010.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 10 March 2010 and 11 March 2010 respectively. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 26 April 2010.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to deliver its conclusions on triflumuron.        The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on apples, pears, peaches and nectarines. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Alsystin SC 480"", a suspension concentrate (SC), containing 480 g/l triflumuron.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.        Sufficient data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Data for the relevant impurity 4-trifluoro-methoxyaniline are missing.        With regard to its toxicological properties, triflumuron is extensively absorbed after oral administration and has a low acute toxicity. The main adverse effect after repeated administration is haemolytic anaemia with compensative responses and secondary effects in different organs. No mutagenic or carcinogenic potential has been demonstrated in the available tests. In the reproductive toxicity testing, no specific effects on the fertility parameters, on the growth of the offspring or on the foetal development were observed in the absence of maternal toxicity. It was agreed that triflumuron has no specific neurotoxic potential.        Several tests were performed on metabolites and/or impurities. The plant metabolites M01, M02, M07 and M08 were considered as covered by the toxicological studies with the parent (use of the same acceptable daily intake). Since it was shown to be acutely more toxic than triflumuron, new toxicological data were provided for the plant metabolite M07 during the resubmission, allowing the derivation of a specific acute reference dose.        The agreed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for triflumuron is 0.014 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 1-year dog study supported by the 2-year rat study and with the use of a safety factor of 100. The agreed Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.036 mg/kg bw/day, based on the overall NOAEL of the 90-day rat studies and applying a safety factor of 100. The derivation of an Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not considered needed for triflumuron.        The agreed dermal absorption values resulting from in vivo and in vitro testing are 1% for the concentrate (mixing/loading) and 5% for the dilution (application). The estimated operator exposure levels according to the models are below the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment, and the estimated exposure values for the workers and bystanders are even lower.        The plant metabolism of triflumuron was investigated in apple, tomato, potato and soya bean. Triflumuron was seen to be the major component of the residues in all plant groups investigated. Therefore, the residue definition for monitoring was proposed as triflumuron alone. For the fruit crop group, since no metabolite was detected in significant levels in the metabolism studies conducted on apple and tomato, triflumuron alone was also proposed to define the residue for risk assessment. For the oilseed and root crop groups, metabolites M07 and M08 were, in addition to the parent, included in the definition for risk assessment. Sufficient supervised residue trials were submitted to derive MRL on pome fruit, peaches and nectarines. Processing factors were calculated for processed fruit commodities, and additional studies on apples and peaches confirmed that metabolites M07 and M08 are not expected to be present above the LOQ in processed fractions. However a data gap was identified for peaches, asking for supplementary information on the initial residue levels in the raw products, prior processing. It was concluded that, based on the representative uses, no MRLs are necessary for products of animal origin. No chronic risk was identified for the consumers, the highest TMDI being 46% of the ADI. The acute risk was not considered since no ARfD was allocated to triflumuron.        Triflumuron is low to moderate persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions. Two major metabolites are formed: 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl urea. The trifluoromethoxyphenyl ring was less mineralized and more prone to form unextractable residues than the chlorophenyl ring.        From the data available it was not possible to derive reliable half-lives either for parent or for major soil metabolites under anaerobic conditions. Metabolites M02 (max 46.7 % AR) and M08 (max. 48.5 % AR) were the only major metabolites identified under dark anaerobic conditions. According the study available, triflumuron may be considered stable to photolysis in soil.        PECs soil have been updated in the Additional Report.        According to the available adsorption / desorption studies triflumuron may be considered immobile to low mobile in soil (Koc = 1629 - 30006 mL/g), metabolite M08 may be considered medium to high mobile in soil (Koc = 113 - 280 mL/g) and M02 may be considered very high mobile in soil (Koc = 4.0 - 8.8 mL/g).        Triflumuron was stable to hydrolysis at pH 5 and 7 and degrades with a half-life between 29 and 57 d at pH 9. Main hydrolysis metabolites at this pH were M02 (max. 28.9 % AR after 30 d) and M08 (max. 48.8 % AR after 30 d). According to the available study, aqueous photolysis is considered to contribute only in a minor extent to the overall degradation of triflumuron. In the absence of a corresponding study, it is proposed to classify triflumuron as not readily biodegradable.        In water sediment systems triflumuron partitioned to the sediment and degraded (DT50 = 4.1 - 7.1 d) to major metabolites M08 (max in water: 47.8 % AR after 14 d, max. in sed.: 20.4 % AR after 7 d; DT50 = 11.4 - 11.7 d) and M02 (max in water: 60.4 % AR after 14 d, max. in sed.: 7.9 % AR after 14 d; DT50 = 17.6 - 62.9 d). Mineralization was more important for the chlorophenyl ring than for the trifluoromethoxyphenyl moiety. The pH of the water phase of the systems investigated was in the alkaline range. A data gap, which was not considered essential to finalize the EU risk assessment, was identified for water / sediment studies within a wider range of pH values.        Updated PEC (SW/SED) were presented in the resubmission dossier following the FOCUS SW scheme. New calculations have been presented in the Addendum to the Additional Report. Only the Step 4 calculations taking into account 95% mitigation for spray drift have been retained for the assessment.        PEC GW calculations have been updated with FOCUS PELMO 3.3.2 and FOCUS PEARL 3.3.3 to the current GAP and with the new degradation data available. Neither the parent triflumuron nor the two soil metabolites 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl urea are expected to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L for any of the relevant scenarios.        Based on the physical and chemical properties of triflumuron, the volatilization study available and the calculated photochemical half-life for triflumuron, it is expected that it will not be transported over long range distances and will not accumulate in air.        The first-tier risk assessment for birds resulted in acute and short-term TERs above the Annex VI trigger of 10 but the long-term TER was below the trigger of 5. The refined long-term risk assessment was based on blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) as a focal species. A PT of 0.61 and a RUD of 5.1 ( birds feeding only on large insects) were suggested to refine the risk assessment. The experts rejected the RUD refinement since no data supported the assumption that blue tits would feed only on large insects. The long-term TER was below the trigger of 5 on the basis of the agreed refinement steps and the revised long-term NOEC of 20 ppm. Therefore a data gap was identified in the expert meeting. The refinements suggested by the applicant and evaluated by the RMS in the Additional Report were not accepted and therefore the data gap remains.        The acute and long-term trigger values for mammals were exceeded in the first-tier risk assessment indicating a low risk. The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm- and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low.        Triflumuron was very toxic to aquatic invertebrates. The acute and chronic TERs for daphnids were significantly below the Annex VI triggers of 100 and 10 for all FOCUS step 4 scenarios with a no-spray buffer zone of 30 m. A mesocosm study was submitted. The experts agreed on a regulatory endpoint of 0.1 mu g a.s./L in combination with an assessment factor of 3. A no-spray buffer zone of 30 m would not be sufficient to achieve TERs >3. Further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment is needed. New FOCUS step 4 calculations including the maximum spray drift reduction of 95% did not result in a FOCUS scenario where all TERs exceeded the trigger of 3 (applied to a mesocosm NOAEC of 0.1 mu g a.s./L). A high risk to the aquatic environment is indicated.        The risk to adult bees was low but bee brood was very sensitive for exposure to triflumuron (insect growth regulator). Exposure of bees was considered to take place via flowering weeds in the orchards. Increased mortality of pupae was observed at an application rate relevant for exposure on weeds. It was further noted that the second application was not covered by the field studies. It was not sufficiently demonstrated that the risk to bee brood development was low and risk mitigation measures such as cutting flowering weeds in the treated field were suggested to protect bees. Chrysoperla carnea was the most sensitive non-target arthropod species tested. This observation was confirmed in a field study in an apple orchard. Full recovery of affected arthropod populations (including the most sensitive species C. carnea) was observed. The study provided some evidence that a sufficiently high number of Chrysoperla larvae could survive in the untreated area to allow recolonisation of the treated in-field area. Overall it was concluded that the risk to non-target arthropods was sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. Since triflumuron inhibits the chitin synthesis the experts considered the potential adverse long-term effects on earthworms necessary to be investigated and therefore a data gap was identified under the first review. For the resubmission, a long-term (reproduction) study with earthworms was submitted and the long-term risk to earthworms was evaluated as low. No studies with other soil non-target macro-organisms were made available for triflumuron under the first review. The experts agreed in the meeting that studies with collembola should be conducted considering the high toxicity to arthropods and that the DT90 can be longer than 100 days under some soil conditions. For the resubmission, new soil degradation studies were made available which indicated that the DT90 is less than 100 days and therefore a study with collembola was not triggered any longer.        The risk to soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  11,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1941     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),triflumuron;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;insecticide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triflumuron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR.        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Spain being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 03 November 2009.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 10 November 2009.

The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of flurochloridone as a herbicide on sunflower and potato as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        No critical areas of concern were indentified in the physical chemical properties section, however several data gaps were identified for the active substance and formulation (see section 1).        A data gap was identified in the toxicology section to address the relevance of the impurities present in the technical specification. No toxicological information is available on the metabolite R42819 that may be found in groundwater at levels above the threshold value of 0.1 mu g/L according to environmental models; based on the classification proposal as R61 (Repr. Cat. 2, ""May cause harm to the unborn child"") and R62 (Repr. Cat. 3, ""Possible risk of impaired fertility"") for the parent, this metabolite is relevant according to the Guidance document on assessment of the relevance of metabolites in groundwater (European Commission, 2003) and a critical area of concern was identified.        Based on the metabolism studies conducted on sunflower and potato (oilseeds/pulses group and tubers/roots group), the residue for monitoring and risk assessment was defined as flurochloridone (sum of cis and trans isomers). MRLs were proposed at the LOQ (0.01 mg/kg). No risk was identified for the consumers, the TMDI and IESTI being less than 0.1% of the ADI and less than 4% of the ARfD.        The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses. A high potential for groundwater contamination by metabolite R42819 in a wide range of geoclimatic conditions above the parametric drinking water limit (0.1 mu g/L) is indicated by the exposure assessment that could be finalised with the available data. (All the FOCUS groundwater scenarios pertinent for sunflower and 7 of the 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios pertinent for potato have annual average groundwater recharge concentrations predicted to be >0.1 mu g/L).        Two data gaps were identified in the environmental risk assessment to address the potential risk to birds and fish from flurochloridone acting as endocrine disruptor and to address the risk to algae for the representative uses.

The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 27 January 2010.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 1 February 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 18 March 2010.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology and ecotoxicology and to deliver its conclusions on dithianon.        The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of dithianon as a fungicide on pome fruit and table and wine grapes as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        No critical areas of concern were identified in the area of identity, and physical and chemical properties, however several data gaps were identified.        A data gap was identified in the mammalian toxicology section for the submission of a new valid Comet assay.        An acute consumer intake concern was identified for table grapes (149% of the ARfD). Given the identified areas of uncertainty regarding the storage stability of dithianon incurred residues in pome fruit and grape wine and the nature of the residues in processed products under standard hydrolytic conditions, the consumer risk assessment can only be considered as provisional at this stage, and the potential for exceedance of the ADI (grapes and pome fruit) and the ARfD (pome fruit) cannot be excluded.        With regard to environmental fate and behaviour, information is lacking regarding the route of aerobic degradation, and specifically the quantification/identification of the unidentified soil transformation products formed in two aerobic soil degradation studies that would trigger a further exposure assessment in the environmental compartments. Although anaerobic conditions are unlikely to occur under the representative uses, a complete assessment of the degradation pathway of dithianon in soil under anaerobic conditions is not available. As a consequence of the lack of information on reliable soil degradation rates for the major soil photolysis degradation product phthalic acid, data gaps were identified for surface water and groundwater exposure assessments for this photodegradation product. A data gap was also identified for an aquatic exposure assessment for the major aqueous photolysis degradation products phthalaldehyde and 1,2-benzenedimethanol.        A high long-term risk for insectivorous birds was identified for all representative uses, even though several options for refinement and ecological data were taken into account. Therefore a critical area of concern and a data gap are identified. The long-term risk for herbivorous mammals was assessed as low on the basis of ecological data and further refinements. Dithianon is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The risk was assessed as low for fish and invertebrates for the representative use on grapes at FOCUSsw step 4, including drift and run-off mitigation measures and refined toxicity endpoints. However, the risk for fish (chronic) and invertebrates (acute) was assessed as high for the representative use on pome fruit and a data gap was identified. Data gaps were also identified to further address the risk to soil and aquatic organisms for the soil and aqueous photodegradation product phthalic acid, and the risk to aquatic organisms for the aqueous photodegradation products phthalaldehyde and 1,2-benzenedimethanol.

The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use of paclobutrazol as a plant growth regulator on winter oilseed rape, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative use can be found in Appendix A to this report.        Data gaps were identified in the section on identity and analytical methods.        No data gaps were identified for the representative use in the section on mammalian toxicology.        Based on the metabolism study conducted on rapeseed, the residue definition for monitoring was limited by default, to the parent paclobutrazol only and two separate definitions were proposed for risk assessment 1) paclobutrazol and 2) triazole derivative metabolites (provisional, pending the definition of a global and harmonized approach for all compounds of the triazole chemical class). A data gap to address the possible residue levels of the TDM metabolites in primary crop, rotational crops and in animal matrices was identified, as these metabolites were detected in significant proportions in the primary and rotational crop metabolism studies.        The data available on fate and behaviour in the environment are essentially sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative use. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative use by paclobutrazol above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be high in geoclimatic situations that are represented by one of the relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios, while for all other scenarios it was concluded to be low. The potential for groundwater exposure regarding soil metabolites was concluded to be low over a wide range of geoclimatic conditions represented by the FOCUS groundwater scenarios.

In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology and ecotoxicology and to deliver its conclusions on fluazifop-P.        The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of fluazifop-P-butyl as a herbicide on pome fruit, pea (green without pod), bean (green with pod), pulses (dry pea and dry bean), potato, and oilseed rape as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        No critical areas of concerns or data gaps were identified in the section identity, physical and chemical properties and analytical methods.        The technical specification is not supported by the batches used in the toxicological studies and a data gap and a critical area of concern have been identified. Further data are needed to address the toxicological relevance of the impurity R154719 and a data gap was identified. The groundwater metabolite Compound X is considered to be a relevant metabolite for toxicology. As Compound X is considered to be a relevant metabolite for leafy crops, further data are needed to conclude on its toxicological properties and a data gap is identified.        Additional data are required to confirm that residues do not concentrate during processing for peas (green without pods), beans (green with pods) and pulses (dry peas and dry beans). Supervised residue trials are also required to confirm the no-residue situation in pome fruit in Southern Europe. Since Compound X has to be considered as a relevant metabolite for leafy crops rotated with the representative uses (except for pome fruit), and given the lack of information on the toxicological properties of Compound X, the consumer risk assessment could not be finalised and was limited to the sum of all the constituent isomers of fluazifop, its esters and its conjugates expressed as fluazifop (sum of isomers) only.        The data available on fate and behaviour in the environment were considered insufficient to carry out a complete environmental exposure assessment at the EU level for the representative uses. Several data gaps were identified for further investigation of the route of degradation of fluazifop-P-butyl in the environment, and for more reliable data for the properties of the metabolites Compound X and Compound IV. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by the metabolite Compound X above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be high in geoclimatic situations that are represented by the relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios. This was identified as a critical area of concern. A data gap was identified for a reliable estimation of the leaching potential of Compound IV.        A data gap was identified to further address the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals for the representative uses on pome fruit, peas and beans.

Following the Commission Decision of 18 September 2008 (2008/744/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of dicloran in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Gowan Comercio Internacional e Servicos, Limitada (Margarita International) made a resubmission application for the inclusion of dicloran in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/1340/08 - rev.0).        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Spain, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 6 October 2009.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 8 October 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 30 November 2009.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology and fate and behaviour in the environment, and deliver its conclusions on dicloran.        The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of dicloran as a fungicide on tomatoes, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        There are no critical areas of concern in the physical-chemical properties section. Data gaps are identified in relation to relevant impurities.        Two critical areas of concern are identified in the section for mammalian toxicology: the compliance of batches tested in the data package submitted compared to the proposed specification could not be proven, and the estimated exposure for re-entry workers exceeds the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL), even with the use of personal protective equipment.        In the residues area, for the specific use on tomatoes, the pertinent issues for consumer risk assessment have been reasonably addressed for the primary crop. For rotational crops and food of animal origin further consideration is necessary. Further data are required to confirm residue levels in following crops, including fruit crops. A risk assessment considering residues in following crops and in animal commodities is required. The implications for the consumer risk assessment are currently unknown.        The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses. However, the characterisation/identification of a fraction of unidentified degradates formed in the aqueous photolysis study was not available. The potential for groundwater contamination by dicloran above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L consequent to the representative uses was assessed as low.        The risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for the representative use on glasshouse tomatoes. Risk mitigation is required to address the risk to aquatic organisms for FOCUSsw scenario R2 and R3 for the representative use on outdoor tomatoes. It was not possible to identify a low risk for fish and invertebrates in the additional (relevant) FOCUSsw scenario R4 and D6, based on the data available. It was not possible to finalise the risk assessment for aquatic organisms from exposure to photodegradates of dicloran, based on the data available, for any of the representative uses. It remains to be verified whether the mixtures of photodegradates tested on fish, daphnia and algae are representative for field situations. It was not possible to finalise the risk assessment for non-target soil macro-invertebrates for the field use on tomatoes, based on the data available. The risk to birds, mammals, bees, earthworms, non-target soil micro-organisms, non-target plants, and the function of waste water treatment plants was assessed as low for the representative uses on tomatoes.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  8,10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1698     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Dicloran;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;fungicide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance dicloran european food safety authority,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rayyan-1227191199,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance buprofezin European Food Safety Authority,2010,6,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,8,6,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"EFSA, Parma, Italy","Buprofezin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR for buprofezin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 7 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 2 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Nihon Nohyaku Co. Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May -June 2007 and in December 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with Member States in February -March 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion fmalised on 3 March 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 128).        Following the Commission Decision of 30 September 2008 (2008/771/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of buprofezin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Nihon Nohyaku Co. Ltd made a resubmission application for the inclusion of buprofezin in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/110/08 -rev. final) as follows:        the information available was insufficient to satisfy the requirements set out in Annex II and Annex III Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to:        the substantial lack of data to assess the consumer exposure, which is regarded as inconclusive        the substantial lack of data to assess the risk to soil-dwelling macro-organisms and concerns were identified with regard to:        the consumer exposure        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the United Kingdom, being the designated RMS in the resubmission procedure, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 21 August 2009.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 24 August 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 8 October 2009.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to deliver its conclusions on buprofezin.        The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on tomatoes, lettuce and citrus. The conclusions of the resubmission were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of buprofezin as an insecticide and acaricide on tomatoes, lettuce and citrus, with a modification for the use on lettuce only. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, Applaud 25 WP"", a wettable powder formulation (WP).        Sufficient analytical methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Adequate methods are available to monitor buprofezin residues in all matrices.        In mammals, the acute oral, dermal or inhalation toxicity of buprofezin is low (oral and dermal LD5 0 > 2000 mg/kg bw, LC50 4.57 mg/L air/4h). Buprofezin is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a skin sensitiser.        Target organs in subchronic and chronic studies are the liver and thyroid, showing increased weight, and histological and clinical chemistry findings. The relevant short-term NOAEL in rats is 13 mg/kg bw/day, while in dogs the relevant NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant long-term toxicity NOAEL in rats is 0.9 mg/kg bw/day, while in mice it is 1.82 mg/kg bw/day.        The genotoxicity of buprofezin was discussed in an opinion of the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) based on a new micronucleus test in the bone marrow of mouse, showing the induction of micronuclei in the erythrocytes of mouse bone marrow when administered by oral gavage, once daily, for two consecutive days. The Panel considered buprofezin non-genotoxic, and the in vivo micronucleus test on bone marrow as not interpretable. The PPR Panel re-evaluated also the long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity studies on buprofezin and concluded that buprofezin is not carcinogenic in rats or mice.        Buprofezin did not show any reproductive toxicity potential: the relevant parental and offspring NOAELs are 6.46 mg/kg bw/day and 9.21 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The reproductive NOAEL is 66 mg/kg bw/day. As for teratogenicity studies, overall, the NOAEL for both maternal and foetal effects is 50 mg/kg bw/day (based on decreased food consumption and increased water intake, and decreased foetal weight, skeletal effects and subcutaneous oedema, respectively). It was agreed not to propose any classification.        Buprofezin does not have potential to induce neurotoxicity in mammals.        The Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day is based on the relevant NOAEL of 0.9 mg/kg bw/day from the 24-month study in rats, with a safety factor of 100. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level is 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, based on a NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100 and a correction for oral absorption of 40 %. The Acute Reference Dose is 0.5 mg/kg bw, based on the NOAEL from the developmental toxicity study and applying a safety factor of 100.        The operator exposure was below the AOEL for tractor-mounted spraying with personal protective equipment (PPE) for tomatoes and citrus, calculated with the German model. For hand-held application, the exposure was below the AOEL with PPE for tomatoes outdoors (UK-POEM). The exposure was below the AOEL with PPE/RPE for hand-held application for tomatoes and lettuce in glasshouse (Dutch model), and for hand-held application in citrus (German model). For bystanders the estimated exposure levels were below the AOEL (< 15%), for both field applications on tomatoes and citrus; bystander exposure for application in greenhouses is unlikely. The worker exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL with gloves when handling tomatoes or lettuce in glasshouse, or tomatoes outdoors. However, the exposure was above the AOEL even with gloves when handling citrus.        The metabolism of buprofezin in plants has been elucidated in three plant groups (fruit crops, leafy crops and oilseed/pulse crops). The parent compound is the major constituent of the final residue, accounting for 47 -89 % of the TRR for pre-harvest intervals (PHIs) < 27 days. The residues in plants are mainly composed of the parent compound and the sugar conjugates of the metabolite BF4, which are identified as BF9 and BF12 under acidic analysis conditions, or as BF26 when the analytical procedures include neutral or alkaline steps. Therefore, the residues were defined as, buprofezinY' only for monitoring, and as, sum of buprofezin and BF4 conjugates analysed as BF9 and BF 12 under acidic hydrolysis and expressed as buprofezin"" for risk assessment. Maximum residue limits (MRLs) are proposed for tomatoes and citrus, however a complete residue data set is requested for all representative uses in order to derive appropriate conversion factors (CF) for risk assessment, and to propose an MRL for indoor lettuce. Provisionally, and based on the metabolism studies, a CF of 1.5 is proposed for fruit crops.        Based on new studies, processing factors are proposed for citrus and tomato. However, a data gap is identified concerning the possible transfer of the metabolite aniline, especially in processed fractions subject to pasteurisation or sterilisation.        A potential transfer of residues to rotational crops has been noted. Based on the representative uses, no residues are expected in animal commodities, and no residue definitions and MRL are proposed for products of animal origin.        Even if the toxicological profile of some metabolites is not fully addressed, with some of them considered to be of similar or of higher toxicity than the parent compound, the consumer risk assessment gives sufficient margin to conclude on the absence of chronic or acute concerns for the consumer, with the refined calculated intakes being below 10 % of the toxicological reference values. It should be noted that lettuce was not considered in this assessment, since the residue trials were not performed according to the critical GAP and are not appropriate to propose an MRL for this crop. In addition, the assessment for tomatoes and citrus has to be considered provisional, pending the submission of new residue trials on tomatoes and citrus in order to derive sound conversion factors for risk assessment.        In soil under aerobic conditions buprofezin exhibits medium to high persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 19-51 % applied radioactivity (AR) after 90 -98 days.        The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 23-33 % AR after 90-98 days. Only minor (< 5% AR) metabolites were formed. Buprofezin exhibits slight mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of buprofezin was pH dependent.        In dark natural sediment water systems buprofezin degraded exhibiting moderate persistence in both water and sediment, forming the metabolite BF 10 in water (max. 12 % AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance, accounting for a maximum of 18 % AR at 91 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 14-15 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out (including some updated calculations for sediment presented in the Additional Report), using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for buprofezin at steps 1-3 for tomatoes, and steps 1-4 for citrus, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolite BF10 appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by buprofezin above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 gg/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        The acute and long-term risk to birds and mammals from the representative uses of buprofezin was assessed as low. The risk assessment for small herbivorous mammals in citrus plantations assumed an interception rate of 70 %, resulting in a TER value that exceeded the Annex VI trigger value. A low risk was also identified for birds and mammals exposed via the ingestion of contaminated earthworms or fish, or via contaminated drinking water.        Buprofezin is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Low risk was identified from the use of buprofezin on tomatoes. However, the application in citrus plantations requires a no-spray-buffer zone of 21 metres when applied adjacent to edge-of-field water courses. The risk to sediment-dwelling organisms was assessed as low from the representative field uses of buprofezin. Buprofezin is not considered to bioaccumulate in fish.        Low risk was identified for all other non-target organisms.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  12,10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1624     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Buprofezin;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;insecticide;acaricide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance buprofezin european food safety authority,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rayyan-1227191200,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance napropamide,2010,4,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,8,4,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"EFSA, Parma, Italy","Napropamide is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on napropamide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 September 2005. The peer review was initiated on 17 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant United Phosphorus. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in April - May 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February - March 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 26 March 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 140).        Following the Commission Decision of 7 November 2008 (2008/902/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of napropamide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant United Phosphorus made a resubmission application for the inclusion of napropamide in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/112/08) as follows:        Leaching of metabolites to groundwater        The minimum purity can not be concluded The impurity specification can not be concluded        and concerns were identified with regard to:        Groundwater contamination of the active substance in the Southern EU No risk assessment for aquatic organisms available A potential risk to soil functioning (organic matter breakdown)        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Denmark, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 29 June 2009.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 30 June 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 13 August 2009.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology, and deliver its conclusions on napropamide.        The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of napropamide as a pre-planting herbicide on head cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, calabrese, tomatoes and oilseed rape. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Devrinol SC 450', a suspension concentrate (SC), registered under different trade names in Europe.        Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of napropamide. It should be noted that the residue definition for water is not finalised, and therefore further methods could be required in the future.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. In the mammalian metabolism studies, napropamide was rapidly and extensively absorbed (> 90 %), and widely distributed. Extensive metabolism and enterohepatic circulation were observed as biliary excretion was a major pathway, and then excretion was rapid through urine and faeces. Fifteen metabolites were identified, and only < 0.5 % of the dose was recovered as the parent compound.        Napropamide has low acute toxicity, and no classification is proposed related to acute toxicity testing including irritancy and sensitisation. The critical effect observed in short-term and long-term studies was decreased body weight. Two out of six in vitro gene mutation assays showed positive effects, as well as one weak positive effect was observed for DNA damage and repair in mammalian cells out of five chromosomal tests, but the three in vivo tests were all negative. Overall, no genotoxic potential is attributed to napropamide. No potential for carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed. No adverse effects on fertility or on reproductive parameters were observed, except for a higher abortion rate at maternally toxic doses in rabbits, which could not be ruled out as being a substance-related effect. No foetotoxicity or teratogenicity was evidenced. The relevant short-term NOAEL was the dose level of 50 mg/kg bw/day from the 1-year oral toxicity study in dogs and the 90-day oral study in rats, and the overall relevant long-term NOAEL was set at 30 mg/kg bw/day derived from both 2-year rat studies. The toxicological hazard assessment of the metabolite NOPA according to the guidance document on the relevance of metabolites in groundwater, using the available data, indicates that this metabolite is not relevant, and that the ADI of the parent compound is applicable to this metabolite if groundwater concentrations would exceed the trigger value of 0.75 mu g/L.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of napropamide is set at 0.3 mg/kg bw/day, based on the long-term rat studies and applying a safety factor of 100; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 1-year dog study and a safety factor of 100. No acute reference dose (ARfD) is allocated.        The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL when no personal protective equipment (PPE) is used according to the German model estimates; according to the UK POEM model, operator exposure is below the AOEL when gloves are worn during mixing/loading and application. No risk is anticipated for workers or bystanders.        Napropamide is extensively metabolised in plants. More than 10 metabolites have been identified, but their individual concentration levels are not expected to exceed 0.01 mg/kg. Considering the low consumer exposure and the toxicological profile of the compound, the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring is proposed to be restricted to the parent compound only. Supervised residue trials confirmed that maximum residue limits (MRLs) can be set at the analytical limit of quantification (0.01* mg/kg) for all representative uses. Investigation of the effect of processing on residues is not needed. Livestock exposure is minimal, and a residue definition for animal commodities is not necessary. A potential transfer of soil residues of napropamide above 0.01 mg/kg is present for root crops for plant back intervals up to 180 days. No risk for the consumer resulting from the presence of napropamide residues in plant commodities has been identified. However, the consumer exposure to the metabolite NOPA present in drinking water could not be finalised, as the assessment of the levels that might be present in groundwater is not finalised.        In soil under aerobic conditions napropamide exhibits moderate to very high persistence, forming the minor non-transient soil metabolite NOPA (accounting for a maximum of 5.78% of the applied radioactivity (AR) in 30 degrees C incubations and 1.1% AR in 20 degrees C incubations), which exhibits low persistence. It should be noted that the database is limited, and further data are necessary to further clarify the persistence of napropamide (southern European field studies). Mineralisation of the 1-naphthyl radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for only 5% AR after 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 12.7-14.7 % AR after 90 days. Napropamide exhibits medium to low mobility in soil, while metabolite NOPA exhibits high mobility in soil. The adsorption behaviour of NOPA was pH dependant (lower adsorption as soil pH increased).        In dark natural sediment water systems napropamide partitioned relatively slowly from water to sediment where it degraded, exhibiting high to very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance, accounting for a maximum of 3.6 % AR at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were the major sink, representing 11-19 % AR at study end. In a laboratory aqueous photolysis study napropamide was photolysed to 4 major metabolites (all identified). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments (including the potential for accumulation in sediment) using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach are available.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by napropamide above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low under the geoclimatic situations that are represented by all the FOCUS groundwater scenarios. For the metabolite NOPA further assessment is required to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment. However, based on the available simulations, that use too favourable input parameters, it is clear that a groundwater non-relevance assessment is triggered, and NOPA concentrations will be > 0.75 mu g/L. From the mammalian toxicological point of view, sufficient information is available to conclude on the nonrelevance of NOPA. However, a consumer risk assessment would be required before a conclusion on groundwater non-relevance of NOPA could be finalised, and this requires the estimates of potential levels in groundwater to be finalised.        The risk to birds was assessed as low for all representative uses. The first-tier long-term TER value of 4.5 was below the trigger of 5 for the use on tomatoes. It was agreed that the risk to insectivorous birds is likely to be low, because the end point (NOEC reproduction) is based on the highest tested dose, and that a certain proportion of the insect prey would consist of large insects (lower residues compared to small insects). The risk to earthworm-eating and fish-eating birds from secondary poisoning was assessed as low.        The risk to mammals is considered to be low for the representative uses. The long-term TERs for insectivorous mammals and earthworm-eating mammals were below the trigger of 5 for the use in southern Europe (tomatoes). The submitted information gave some indication that the proportion of time spent feeding in the treated area (PT) is likely to be considerably lower than assumed in the firsttier risk assessment. In a weight of evidence approach it was agreed that the risk to insectivorous and earthworm-eating mammals is low. The risk from plant metabolites was considered to be addressed by the risk assessment for the parent napropamide.        Napropamide is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The risk assessment for aquatic organisms is driven by the toxicity to Lemna gibba. The refinement based on a study containing sediment in the test system was not accepted by the experts in the PRAPeR 33 meeting. The end points to be used in the risk assessment were discussed, since several studies with Lemna species and different aquatic invertebrate species were available. The experts suggested using in the aquatic risk assessment the end point of 0.067 mg a.s./L, and a geometric mean value of 5.4 mg a.s./L, for macrophytes and invertebrates, respectively. The risk to aquatic organisms (excluding rooted aquatic macrophytes) was assessed as low based on FOCUS step 3 PECsw values for the representative use on brassicas. Two full FOCUS scenarios out of 6 resulted in TER values above the trigger of 10 for Lemna (D4 and R1) for the use on winter oilseed rape, and no full FOCUS scenario resulted in a TER exceeding the trigger of 10 for the use on tomatoes. No major metabolites in surface water were identified in the water/sediment study. However, the experts on environmental fate and behaviour agreed that the parent compound, as well as 5 different photolysis metabolites and NOPA (where groundwater becomes surface water) should be considered for risk assessment. The risk assessment from the metabolite NOPA remains open since the PECgw is not finalised. In addition, data gaps were identified to address the risk to macrophytes rooted in the sediment, and to refine the risk to aquatic organisms for the use in southern Europe (tomatoes), with e.g. FOCUS step 4 calculations.        The risk of bioconcentration in fish was assessed as low. The risk to earthworms and soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed as low for the uses in northern Europe, but is not finalised for the use in southern Europe. The risk to soil functioning (organic matter breakdown) was assessed as low for northern European uses (brassicas and oilseed rape), but cannot be excluded for the higher application rates for the southern European use on tomatoes.

rayyan-1227191201,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance imazalil European Food Safety Authority,2010,3,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,8,3,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"European Food Safety Author, Parma, Italy","Commission Regulation (EC) No 737/20073 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation') lays down the procedure for the renewal of the inclusion of a first group of active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and establishes the list of those substances. Imazalil is one of the first group of active substances listed in the Regulation.        In accordance with Article 6 of the Regulation, the notifiers Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Certis Europe B.V., Makhteshim Chemical Works Ltd., AgriChem B.V. and Laboratorios Agrochem S.L. submitted a dossier on imazalil to The Netherlands and Spain, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), and co-rapporteur Member State (co-RMS), respectively.        In accordance with Article 10 of the Regulation, The Netherlands prepared an Assessment Report in consultation with Spain, which was submitted to the EFSA and the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'). The Assessment Report was received by the EFSA on 9 June 2009.        In accordance with Article 11 of the Regulation, the EFSA distributed the Assessment Report to Member States and the notifiers for comments on 11 June 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 13 July 2009.        In accordance with Article 12, following consideration of the Assessment Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange an expert consultation on the Assessment Report as appropriate and deliver its conclusions on imazalil The conclusions presented in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses        of imazalil as a fungicide on citrus post harvest, protected tomatoes grown on artificial substrate, and as a cereal seed treatment, as proposed by the notifiers. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        There is no agreed specification for imazalil.        No areas of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicity section. The exposure/risk assessment for re-entry workers (scenario: tomatoes) with regard to the exposure to the individual enantiomers that make up the active substance residue on treated fruit was considered as a data gap. In plants, the residue was defined as imazalil for monitoring and sum of imazalil and metabolite R014821 for risk assessment, although this metabolite is of no concern for the currently supported uses. The residue definition for ruminant matrices could not be finalised and the notifier was asked to propose a residue definition for monitoring including at least the parent imazalil and the metabolites FK284 and/or FK772. No chronic concern was identified with the maximum refined TMDI (IEDI) being 4% of the ADI only. Acute concern can not be totally excluded since the maximum refined IESTI is 92% of the ARfD when calculations are performed using the mean processing factor (0.07) derived for citrus pulp, but 115% of the ARfD for grapefruit (DE, child) and 105% of the ARfD for orange (UK infant) when calculations are performed using the individual processing factors derived for grapefruit (0.13) and for orange (0.08).        With regard to environmental fate and behaviour, for the representative use as a cereal seed treatment information is missing regarding the route of degradation in soil and natural surface water systems and consequently the groundwater exposure assessment for potential soil metabolites is not finalised. For the representative use on glasshouse tomatoes grown on artificial media, information is missing regarding the route of degradation in natural surface water systems. The assessment of the representative use post harvest on citrus is based on there being no soil or surface water exposure from this use, consequent from appropriate management measures to preclude such exposure being implemented. A data gap was identified to address the long-term risk to granivorous birds and mammals from uses of imazalil as a seed treatment. The potential endocrine disrupting effects of imazalil on fish should be addressed for uses on tomatoes in glasshouses and for seed treatment.        A data gap was identified to assess the long-term effect of the metabolite R014821 on soil micro-organisms for the use as a seed treatment.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  18,10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1526     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Imazalil;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;fungicide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance imazalil european food safety authority,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rayyan-1227191202,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance oxadiazon,2010,2,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,8,2,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"EFSA, Parma, Italy","Oxadiazon is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023.        Oxadiazon was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 2 July 2008 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.        Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on oxadiazon in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 11 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 29 March 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Bayer CropScience. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA identifying the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April - May 2009.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2009.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a herbicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprises pre-emergence spraying in sunflower for the control of weeds. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'RONSTAR', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 250 g/L oxadiazon. The minimum purity and specification of the active substance could not be concluded on. Data gaps for vapor pressure, flash point and surface tension were identified.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Oxadiazon residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin can be monitored by the multi-residue method DFG S19. Adequate methods are available to monitor oxadiazon residues in environmental matrices.        A critical area of concern was highlighted based on the lack of information whether the tested material used in the toxicological studies is representative of the product manufactured and commercialised at present.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, oxadiazon was moderately rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. No potential for accumulation was observed, the majority of the substance being excreted within 48 hours.        The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route; no eye or skin irritation was observed, and no potential for skin sensitisation was found in a Magnusson and Kligman test.        The main target organs of oxadiazon were the liver and the haematopoietic system consistent with oxadiazon's ability to inhibit protoporphyrinogen oxidase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of both haem and chlorophyll. The overall short term no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was 18 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day study in rat.        Oxadiazon itself did not present genotoxic potential, however a positive Ames test suggested the presence of a mutagenic impurity in the batch tested. The notifier should address the apparent presence of a mutagenic impurity in the technical specification (data gap).        Liver tumours were observed in both the rat and mouse species; mechanistic studies confirmed that oxadiazon is a peroxisome proliferator. Although peroxisome proliferators are hepatocarcinogens in rodents, the current scientific opinion is that humans are not responsive to this class of non-genotoxic carcinogens and therefore, oxadiazon is unlikely to present a carcinogenic risk to humans. The relevant long term NOAEL was the dose level of 0.36 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study.        Effects on the reproduction (increase in gestation length and irregular oestrus cycle) were more prominent in a preliminary dose-range finding study to the multigeneration study where total litter losses were observed at ca.30 mg/kg bw/day, as the main study was conducted with much lower dose levels. On this basis a classification with the risk phrase R62 ""possible risk of impaired fertility"" was proposed. The NOAEL in the main study was 5 mg/kg bw/day for reproduction toxicity while the NOAEL for parental and offspring's toxicity was 15 mg/kg bw/day. In the developmental toxicity studies, the rat presented the more critical (developmental) NOAEL for the risk assessment of 12 mg/kg bw/day.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of oxadiazon is 0.0036 mg/kg bw/day based on the long-term rat study and applying a safety factor of 100. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.05 mg/kg bw/day based on the multigeneration study in rat and applying a safety factor of 100; no correction factor for enteral resorption is needed. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is set at 0.12 mg/kg bw, based on the developmental NOAEL of 12 mg/kg bw/day from the rat developmental toxicity study and a safety factor of 100.        Dermal absorption was determined for the representative formulation, Ronstar (R) as 2 % for the concentrate and 3% for the in-use spray dilution based on an in vitro study performed with human skin. The level of operator exposure for the representative formulation at a maximum dose rate of 750 g oxadiazon/ha in sunflowers was below the AOEL according to the German model without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and according to the UK POEM when the use of gloves during mixing/loading and application was considered. Re-entry worker exposure represented 68 % of the AOEL when no specific PPE is worn and bystander exposure to oxadiazon was considered negligible. Metabolism of oxadiazon was investigated in sunflowers, rice and tomatoes and in rotational crops (spinach, radish and barley).        Metabolism was found to be moderate. Besides oxadiazon, its metabolites AE0618785, AE0608021, AE0616182 and AE0618784 were identified. Additionally metabolite AE608033 is possibly present in sunflowers and rotational crops. As AE0608033 is not covered by the rat metabolism nor addressed by other toxicology data on metabolites a data gap was formulated. The notifier should clarify the occurrence of metabolite AE0608033 in primary crops and rotational crops. As parent oxadiazon was the prevalent residue found in metabolism studies on primary and rotational crops, the plant residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was proposed as oxadiazon alone.        A sufficient number of residue trials on sunflowers supporting the notified GAPs have been submitted to propose an MRL. Based on the residue levels found in the metabolism on rotational crops it was concluded that field trials on rotational crops (root crops and cereals) are necessary. A provisional MRL for root and tuber crops was proposed on the basis of the results of the metabolism study on rotational crops.        No metabolism studies on livestock are available. Provisional dietary burden calculations show an exceedance of the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg feed (DM) for beef cattle and pigs. Based on this provisional calculation a metabolism study on ruminants is necessary.        Chronic and acute dietary intake calculations showed that an exceedance of ADI or ARfD is not expected for intake of crops after treatment of sunflowers with oxadiazon according to the notified GAPs. The finalisation of the risk assessment is pending the submission of field trials on rotational crops to confirm the estimated residue levels in root and tuber crops.        Oxadiazon exhibits a high to very high persistence in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C or 25 degrees C (DT50 = 187-1238 d). A number of minor or very minor metabolites were found. Mineralization was low (CO2: max. 6.41 % after 300 d). Unextractable radioactivity reached levels of 5.44 - 35.5 % AR at the later data points (269 - 365 d).        Under dark anaerobic conditions in soil at 20 degrees C oxadiazon also exhibits a very high persistence (DT50 = 841 d), metabolite AE 0608022 (max. 4.6 % AR after 120 d) is still increasing at the end of the study. Therefore, this metabolite would need to be further addressed with respect to potential ground water contamination in situations for which prolonged anaerobic conditions may be expected to occur.        In the photolysis experiments in soil, the extent of degradation was low and no major metabolites were identified.        The dissipation of oxadiazon under field conditions has been investigated in four sites in EU and two sites in USA. In the field trials performed in Germany oxadiazon exhibits a high persistence in soil (DT50 = 262 - 330 d). In the field trials performed in the Southern EU (Spain and S- France) oxadiazon exhibited a medium persistence in soil (DT50 = 90 - 95 d). The geometric mean of the normalized (20 degrees C, pF 2) field half lives (DT50 (norm. field geomean) = 120 d) was agreed to represent degradation of oxadiazon in soil for modelling purposes.        The study performed in USA was considered supplementary information.        The peer review identified a data gap for representative field soil accumulation studies. Potential for accumulation was addressed by PEC soil calculations based on the worst case field non normalized half life.        Two soil batch adsorption desorption studies were performed with oxadiazon. According these studies, oxadiazon is expected to exhibit low mobility in soil (K-Foc = 979 - 1527 mL /g). Oxadiazon was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, pH 5 and pH 7. At pH 9 oxadiazon hydrolysed (DT (50) = 11.7 d) yielding two major hydrolysis metabolites: AE 0608022 and AE 0592465.        Aqueous photolysis of oxadiazon was fast under the irradiated experimental conditions. Half life in the surface water was calculated for different latitudes (30 degrees N - 50 degrees N) and seasons. Three major aqueous photolysis metabolites were identified: AE 0608035 (max. 15 % AR), AE 0608033 (max. 12.2 % AR) and AE 1117150 (max. 10.6 % AR).        Oxadiazon is not readily biodegradable according to the available study.        Dissipation / degradation was investigated in two dark water /sediment systems at 20 degrees C. Oxadiazon partitions with the sediment and degrades slowly in both systems (DT50 whole system. = 126.4 - 126.6 d). During the peer review, new FOCUS Step 3 and Step 4 PEC SW /SED calculations were provided by the notifier. The meeting of experts identified some drawbacks in these calculations. In addendum 2, RMS provided new PECSW/SED calculations in accordance with the meeting discussions. An estimation of the potential for oxadiazon to accumulate in the sediment was provided in addendum 1. An accumulation factor of 1.96 was derived from the 10 years plateau identified in this calculation.        A generic FOCUS Step 1 and Step 2 PECSW/SED calculation is available for the photolysis metabolite AE0608022.        Potential contamination of ground water by oxadiazon was assessed with FOCUS GW PEARL and PELMO models. In both cases, annual average concentration of oxadiazon in the leachate was below the regulatory limit of 0.1 mu g / L for the 80th percentile concentration at 1 m depth over 20 yr of continuous application in sunflowers.        Oxadiazon may be considered medium to low volatile. A photochemical half life in the atmosphere of 0.22 d has been calculated with Atkinson's method. Oxadiazon is not expected to contaminate remote areas through long range transport.        The Tier I assessment provided TER values above the Annex VI trigger for the acute and short-term risk to medium herbivorous and insectivorous birds. The long-term TER value was above the Annex VI trigger for herbivorous birds, whereas the TER value for insectivorous birds (based on a diet of small insects) failed to meet the trigger. Member State experts considered that insectivorous birds to a certain (sufficient) degree would base their diet on large insects with lower residue levels and therefore the long-term risk to insectivorous birds was considered as low. The acute and long-term risk to mammals was assessed as low, as was the risk to birds and mammals from eating fish and consumption of contaminated drinking water. Data gaps were identified for the notifier to address the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals.        Oxadiazon was considered to be very toxic to aquatic organisms, with algae and fish reproduction as the most sensitive endpoints. The acute risk to fish, invertebrates and higher plants was addressed at FOCUSsw Step 3 without risk mitigation. Only one out of four relevant FOCUSsw scenarios passed the Annex VI trigger for the risk assessment of algae, based on a higher tier algae biomass endpoint and 20m buffer zones to mitigate spray drift and run-off. In order to address the long-term risk to fish further refinements are needed (i.e. data gap), since exposure mitigation was insufficient to address the risk and refinement of the chronic fish toxicity endpoint was not accepted by Member State experts (i.e. adding sediment to the test system). Refinements in line with the recommendation in the PPR-panel opinion on Dimoxystrobin were suggested. The in-field risk assessment to non-target arthropods indicated a high risk to T. pyri, whereas the off-field risk could be considered as low. Laboratory and extended laboratory studies with three species of soil living non-target arthropods indicated that the risk from the intended spraying of bare soil could be considered as low.        The risk to bees, earthworms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  7,10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1389     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),oxadiazon;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;herbicide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance oxadiazon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rayyan-1227191204,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance <i>Lecaniciium muscarium</i> strain Ve6 notified as <i>Verticillium lecanii</i> European Food Safety Authority,2010,1,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,8,1,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"EFSA, Parma, Italy","Lecanicillium muscarium, notified as Verticillium lecanii, is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004.        Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 May 2009 pursuant to Article 24b of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as, jhe Regulation'). In accordance with Article 25a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as,, the Commission') in accordance with Article 25(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.        The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 5 July 2007. The peer review was initiated on 7 May 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation to the sole notifier Koppert Beheer B.V., and on 21 January 2009 to the Member States. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a scientific meeting with Member State experts in June 2009.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in November 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses on cucumber, tomato, sweet pepper, strawberry and ornamentals for the control of whitefly and thrips. The formulation is applied as a spray to the crops. Full details of the application rate and timings can be found in the list of end points attached at appendix A to this report.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Mycotal"", a wettable powder formulation (WP).        The available data indicate that the micro-organism is not competitive in the environment unless the host species are present, it is not pathogenic to humans, nor toxic or infective and does not produce any known toxicologically significant secondary metabolites, therefore methods of analysis for monitoring are not required. However, it should be noted that some methods are given in the DAR although there are no validation data.        Sufficient test methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available. Methods for the unequivocal identification of the strain could not be concluded on, as the new information has not been peer-reviewed. The acceptability of the methods for microbial contaminants was questioned as they appeared not to be ISO methods. After the experts"" meeting the notifier confirmed that ISO methods were used. Further validation is needed for the whitefly assay. It was considered that the level of contaminating pathogens was in some cases too high when compared to internationally available proposed levels for pathogenic microbial contaminants, and this is considered by EFSA as a critical area of concern.        In acute toxicity studies, Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 did not induce signs of toxicity, pathogenicity or infectivity. The human/rat body temperature would mean that the micro-organism would not remain viable in these warm-blooded species. Clinical cases of systemic infection were described in the open literature in immuno-compromised patients, either receiving chemo/radiotherapy, or treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics; very rare cases of keratitis were caused by Lecanicillium species.        No potential for skin sensitisation was found in a Magnusson & Kligman test. Sensitisation studies with micro-organisms are considered to be of limited value, as reactions to foreign proteins (most micro-organisms) can be anticipated. Therefore, all micro-organisms should be regarded as potential sensitisers ( in contact with skin and by inhalation). The following phrase was agreed by the experts ""Micro-organisms may have the potential to provoke sensitising reactions"", since labelling with risk phrases applicable to chemicals ( according to Directive 67/548/EEC4 and Directive 1999/45/EC5) is not appropriate for micro-organisms.        In a 28-day study by inhalation in rats conducted with the representative formulation, MVycotal"", the no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL) was found at 1 mg/m(3), based on macro- and microscopic changes in the lungs, nasal cavity and mediastinal lymph nodes most pronounced at 10 and 100 mg/m3 groups. Although these changes were indicative of a local immune reaction rather than a toxicological effect, this could not be confirmed due to the lack of a control group in the study. Short-term toxicity is not expected, because accumulation of Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 has not been demonstrated in the body. No potential for genotoxicity was found in vitro. As no known toxicologically significant metabolite was identified, the PRAPeR M3 meeting of experts agreed that no further data would be required for the genotoxicity end point.        No reference values were set and none were needed as the micro-organism is not pathogenic or infective and does not produce toxins.        Low risk was anticipated for operators if adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and respiratory protective equipment (RPE) are worn. Workers are also required to use PPE to lower dermal exposure. No bystanders should be allowed during greenhouse applications. A concern was raised by the experts over outdoor bystander exposure by inhalation due to the potential sensitisation by inhalation and no protection possible for bystanders. The rapporteur Member State provided a risk characterisation for bystanders after the experts"" meeting, concluding that bystander exposure is low when compared to the amount of micro-organisms that are inhaled daily as a background value. Nevertheless, a concern over outdoor bystander inhalation remains. Furthermore, for outdoor uses, as there is an outstanding issue with the specification of the product with regard to some pathogenic contaminants, the exposure risk assessment of bystanders could not be finalized.        Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 does not colonise the plant surface, and thus, the micro-organism is considered not likely to grow and multiply on plant material. Dietary exposure from use of Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 is likely to be minimal. Moreover, any potentially occurring residual deposits on the treated crops are not relevant, as no human health concerns have been identified due to the toxicological profile of this strain. This assessment is subject to a final specification for microbial contamination of the plant protection product.        The available data on the fate and behaviour in the environment indicated that the only component that required environmental exposure and risk assessment was the colony forming units of Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6. Data on the competitiveness and persistence of added Lecanicillium muscarium to soil and natural surface water indicated that the organism was not very competitive, and that following addition of Lecanicillium muscarium to the soil environment or common artificial plant substrate, or spray drift exposure to surface water, levels would be expected to decline. However, information on the natural background concentrations in soil was not presented and no specific data on the influence of UV light on persistence and multiplication in water were available. There was sufficient evidence to show that Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 does not produce any known secondary metabolites of toxicological or environmental concern.        A general consideration to address the risk to non-target organisms was the very narrow 'natural' host or target range of Lecanicillium muscarium, in addition to the apparent lack of evidence that birds, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms and terrestrial plants are among the 'natural' target or host range of Lecanicillium muscarium. Furthermore, it was considered that the occurrence of 'natural' epizootics in the field could impose the same 'risks' to non-target organisms as epizootics induced by products with Lecanicillium muscarium.        No acute toxic, infective or pathogenic effects were identified in any of the studies on birds, aquatic organisms, bees or earthworms based on the data available.        However, data gaps were identified during the peer review to address the potential infectivity in fish and the potential toxicity to aquatic invertebrates, both being relevant for outdoor uses only.        Many studies indicated no or only minimal effects on different non-target arthropod species exposed to Lecanicillium muscarium. There were however concerns among Member State experts about the strains and formulations used in the studies, and also concerns about the test conditions. Some effects were in fact seen on the species Encarsia formosa. A data gap was identified to further address the risk to non-target arthropods.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  2,10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1446     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6;Verticillium lecanii Ve6;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;biocontrol agent;insecticide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides;Food,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance <i>lecaniciium muscarium<i> strain ve6 notified as <i>verticillium lecanii<i> european food safety authority,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ASDs disproportionately affect male children. Mercury (Hg), a heavy metal, is widespread and persistent in the environment. Mercury is a ubiquitous source of danger in fish, drugs, fungicides/herbicides, dental fillings, thermometers, and many other products. Elevated Hg concentrations may remain in the brain from several years to decades following exposure. This is important because investigators have long recognized that Hg is a neurodevelopmental poison; it can cause problems in neuronal cell migration and division, and can ultimately cause cell degeneration and death. Case-reports of patients have described developmental regressions with ASD symptoms following fetal and/or early childhood Hg exposure, and epidemiological studies have linked exposure to Hg with an elevated risk of a patient being diagnosed with an ASD. Immune, sensory, neurological, motor, and behavioral dysfunctions similar to traits defining or associated with ASDs were reported following Hg intoxication with similarities extending to neuroanatomy, neurotransmitters, and biochemistry. The sexual dimorphism of ASDs may result from synergistic neurotoxicity caused by the interaction of testosterone and Hg; in contrast, estrogen is protective, mitigating the toxicity of Ha. Mercury exposure may significantly increase androgen levels, and as a result, patients diagnosed with an ASD may significantly benefit from anti-androgen therapy. Finally, the clinical geneticist has a wealth of biomarkers to evaluate and treat patients diagnosed with an ASD.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  119,,"autistic;estradiol;ethylmercury;merthiolate;methylmercury;Thimerosal;ENVIRONMENTAL MERCURY RELEASE;NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS;THIMEROSAL EXPOSURE;METHYL MERCURY;BLOOD MERCURY;CELL-DEATH;IN-VITRO;CHILDREN;TOXICITY;METHYLMERCURY;Child Development Disorders, Pervasive;Autistic Disorder;Causality",NA,NA,the biological basis of autism spectrum disorders understanding causation and treatment by clinical geneticists,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rayyan-1227191206,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance haloxyfop-P (haloxyfop-R),2009,11,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,11,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"EFSA, Parma, Italy","Haloxyfop-P is the ISO common name for the substance formerly referred to by the synonym 'haloxyfop-R' (introduced by DOW AgroSciences) which is in common use but without official status. This conclusion refers to the ISO common name haloxyfop-P.        Haloxyfop-P is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20003, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20024 Following the Commission Decision of 19 June 2007 (2007/437/EC). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on haloxyfop-P in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 21 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 26 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.        A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 28 July 2006 (EFSA, 2006).        Following the Commission Decision of 19 June 2007 (2007/437/EC) 5 concerning the non-inclusion of haloxyfop-P in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant, Dow AgroSciences made a resubmission application for the inclusion of haloxyfop-P in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the European Commission review report as follows:        The potential contamination of groundwater        The risk to mammals        The high toxicity to fish        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Denmark, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on haloxyfop-P in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 3 April 2009.        In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 8 April 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 13 May 2009. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 13 July 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days.        The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the rapporteur Member State's evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific meetings via telephone conference with Member State experts in September 2009.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in the areas of mammalian toxicology, environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology.        The original conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control annual and perennial grasses in carrots, fodder legumes (peas and beans), rape seed, soy bean and sugar beet. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses as a herbicide. Full details of the GAP can be found in the end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'EF-1400' which was given the commercial name of 'Gallant' in the resubmission, an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), and registered under different trade names in Europe.        For food of plant and animal origin, methods of analysis are available that will quantify haloxyfop and its esters, salts and conjugates, expressed as haloxyfop. However, it is not clear if the hydrolysis step is validated and therefore it is not known if it was comparable to the hydrolysis step in the metabolism studies. As a consequence of this the residue may be underestimated. Methods of analysis are available for soil, water and air which also include a hydrolysis step that is not necessary but which in this case will over estimate the residue.        Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method such as the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        The toxicological studies were generally performed with pure (> 98%) racemic haloxyfop or haloxyfop-P methyl ester or with neat substances. The toxicokinetic studies indicate that absorbed methyl ester will rapidly be hydrolysed to the parent acid and the S-form haloxyfop present in racemic haloxyfop will instantaneously undergo stereochemical inversion to haloxyfop-P. Therefore, the various compounds used for testing are assumed to elicit the same systemic effects following administration and these effects can be attributed to haloxyfop-P. The absorption is rapid (> 80%) and the excretion extensive. The acute oral toxicity is moderate i. e. LD50 is around 300 mg/kg bw and the dermal toxicity low LD50> 2000 mg/kg bw, proposed classification of Xn, R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"". No acute inhalation toxicity studies are available. Neither racemic haloxyfop nor haloxyfop-P methyl ester was irritating to skin and haloxyfop-P methyl ester was not a sensitizer. Haloxyfop-P methyl ester is not irritating to the eye whereas racemic haloxyfop induced signs of irritation in the conjunctival sacs and iris and caused corneal opacity covering up to 100% of the cornea in all animals. Signs of irritation (corneal opacity) persisted for 21 days in un-rinsed eyes racemic haloxyfop is therefore irritating to the eye and the classification of Xi; R41 "" Risk of serious damage to eyes"" is proposed. The relevant short term NOAEL is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1year dog study which would also be said to cover the effects observed in the 90-day studies in the dog and monkey at 2 mg/kg bw/day.        There is no mutagenic or genotoxic potential for haloxyfop-P. Haloxyfop is not carcinogenic in the rat but there are hepatocellular adenomas in the highest dose in the mice associated with peroxisome proliferation.        No reproductive effects were observed at the highest dose level of 1 mg/kg bw/day, thus being a NOAEL for reproductive effects, the NOAEL for offspring toxicity is 0.065 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight of f1a pups after 21 days at 1 mg/kg bw/day.        The NOAEL for maternal effects is 1 mg/kg bw/day and 7.5 mg/kg bw/day (in rat and rabbit, respectively) and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 7.5 mg/kg bw/day in the rat study and 15 mg/kg bw/day in the rabbit study.        The groundwater metabolites DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone were not of relevance based on hazard assessment. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.00065 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.075 mg/kg bw, with the safety factor of 100 applied.        The operator exposure was estimated using the standard models UK-POEM and the German model.        The dermal absorption is 7% and 12% for the concentrate and the diluted product, respectively. The AOEL is exceeded (169%) according to the UK-POEM even with PPE (coverall) but is below according to the German model if PPE (coverall and gloves) is applied (12%). The estimated worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL.        To investigate the residue behaviour of haloxyfop-P in plants and livestock either the haloxyfop Risomer or the unresolved isomeric mixture or ester variants of both compounds were used.        Plant metabolism was studied following foliar application to crops representing leafy crops, root vegetables, pulses and oilseeds. Irrespective of the ester variant or whether the racemic mixture or only the R-isomer was applied, the metabolism in all the studied crops was found to be similar commencing by a rapid and almost complete degradation to haloxyfop (R, S) very soon after application, followed by conjugation with carbohydrates and triglycerides. These conjugates appeared to be unstable under alkaline and acidic conditions, releasing haloxyfop (R, S) again.        Metabolism studies with goats and hens indicated that haloxyfop (R, S) is excreted unmetabolised by livestock animals. In tissue and organs residues were present as haloxyfop (R, S) in either form, free and conjugated.        Due to the lack of isomeric specificity of the pre-registration analytical methods any possible stereochemical inversion in either direction in food of plant and animal origin could not be detected, even though it is assumed based on available data in soil and in rats that if such inversion occurs it will be most likely from the S-to the R-isomer.        A sufficient number of residue trial data with haloxyfop-P methyl according to the GAP proposed for the representative uses is available to conclude the risk assessment for consumers and to propose MRLs. From crop rotation studies it can be concluded that no significant residue levels are expected in rotational and succeeding crops following application of haloxyfop-P methyl according to the critical GAP. The residue levels that could occur in food of animal origin when crops treated with haloxyfop-P methyl are fed to animals were assessed based on livestock feeding studies and MRLs have been proposed.        The dietary risk assessment performed for different consumer groups indicates that there are no chronic and acute concerns related to dietary exposure resulting from the representative uses assessed within the peer review procedure.        Soil degradation studies suggested a possible main degradation route for haloxyfop-P methyl ester under aerobic conditions. Haloxyfop-P methyl ester degraded rapidly (DT50 < 0.6 d at 20 degrees C) in six soils to produce the acid metabolite haloxyfop-P-6 (DE-535 acid, max. 53-91% AR), which further degraded to DE-535 pyridino17 (max. 29-52% AR). Other two metabolites, DE-535 pyridinone(8) and DE-535 phenol(9), exceeded the trigger value of 10% AR on a limited number of occasions: DE-535 pyridinone reached a maximum of 11.0% AR after 120 days, and DE-535 phenol with maximum concentration of 12.6% AR after 14 days. Final degradation ended up in minor unidentified metabolites, non-extractable soil residues (max. 44% AR after 90 days) and carbon dioxide (max. 35% AR after 90 days). Haloxyfop-P can be considered as very low to low persistent, DE-535 pyridinol as medium to high persistent, and DE-535 phenol as moderate to high persistent. A data gap for reliable degradation rates in soil for DE-535 pyridinone was identified at the PRAPeR teleconference TC18.        Sorption characteristics indicated that haloxyfop-P, DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone are very high to high mobile in soil, whereas DE-535 phenol can be classified as low mobile. Haloxyfop-P and the metabolite trifluoroacetic acid exceeded the limit value of 0.1 mu g/L on individual occasions in some lysimeter studies, but the annual average concentrations were < 0.1 mu g/L for haloxyfop-P methyl ester and all its metabolites.        Because the calculation model for PECsoil was not consistent with the method used for the degradation rates values, soil concentrations at later time points for haloxyfop-P, DE-535 phenol and DE-535 pyridinone should be recalculated. However, the new PECsoil values will not have an impact on the risk assessment for terrestrial organisms as safe uses have been shown using the reliable initial PECsoil.        The hydrolysis rate of haloxyfop-P methyl ester was directly correlated with pH (stable at pH 4, DT50= 43 days at pH 7 and DT50= 0.63 days at pH 9). The photolysis of haloxyfop-P methyl ester and haloxyfop-P was investigated in pH 5 sterile buffer and natural water (pH 8.5). A new metabolite, with a chemical structure similar to dibenzofuran, was identified up to 18.6% AR in the sterile buffer system. The aquatic exposure of DE-535 furan was appropriately addressed in the resubmission dossier.        Two natural water-sediment systems under controlled laboratory conditions showed that haloxyfop-P methyl ester was rapidly hydrolyzed to haloxyfop-P, the concentrations of which were in the range of 63.8- 81.5% AR after 1-30 days. At the same time the concentration of the metabolite DE-535 pyridinol increased up to 19.7% AR after 59 days. The same two metabolites were also found in the sediment phase up to 33.7% AR (haloxyfop-P) and 16.4% AR (DE-535 pyridinol). Haloxyfop-P methyl ester degraded rapidly in both the water and sediment phases with first order DT50 values < 0.3 days. The calculated DT50 values for haloxyfop-P ranged from 39.2 - 51.7 d (whole system) and from 31.5-54.6 d (water phase).        The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route on entry to surface water for haloxyfop-P methyl ester, haloxyfop-P and DE-535 pyridinol. Additional calculations were performed including a worst-case contamination contribution from run-off and drainage of 15% of the application rate.        After the resubmission procedure, a new FOCUS groundwater modelling with agreed input parameters was still necessary to fully address the potential for groundwater exposure for haloxyfop-P and major soil metabolites DE-535 phenol, DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone. Based on provisional results presented in the DAR, not complying with the recommendations of FOCUS groundwater guidance regarding the use of first order degradation kinetics, a high potential for groundwater exposure for soil metabolites DE-535 pyridinol (80th percentile annual average concentrations: 0.55-2.87 mu g/L) and DE-535 pyridinone (0.26-0.90 mu g/L) was identified. In the resubmission dossier the toxicological assessment was able to conclude that metabolites DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone were not relevant. However, in case the new FOCUS PECGw calculations will indicate that these metabolites will exceed the trigger of 0.75 mu g/L, a consumer risk assessment might be needed. Based on the available volatilisation experiment and the calculated atmospheric half-life, contamination of the air compartment and long range transport through air are not expected.        The first tier risk assessment for herbivorous and insectivorous birds resulted in TER values above the Annex VI trigger indicating a low risk. For medium herbivorous and insectivorous mammals the acute risk is considered to be low, while a first tier high long-term risk was identified. The Member State experts in EPCO 22 did not accept a proposed refinement using a higher endpoint from a 16-week dietary study. It was agreed to use the endpoint of 1 mg/kg bw/day from a 2-generation reproduction study. Furthermore, since the half-life for residues in vegetation was observed to be longer than the default value, residue decline data for each crop should be used in the risk assessment. The resulting TER values were foreseen to be below the Annex VI trigger indicating a high risk, and the risk to mammals was not addressed in the original review. The long-term risk was addressed for herbivorous mammals in the Additional Report based on the reproductive endpoint and refinement of PD for the intended uses in sugar beet, field peas and beans. For the intended autumn use in oilseed rape refinements based on a developmental endpoint were not accepted as the intended used may coincide with the breeding season of herbivorous mammals, but it was agreed that a safe use could be shown in Northern Europe. A data gap was identified to address the risk to herbivorous mammals for the Southern Member States, at the European level. Consequently, a similar data gap was identified to address the long-term risk to insectivorous mammals from the use in oilseed rape in Southern Member States.        Haloxyfop-P methyl ester is very toxic to aquatic organisms, fish being the most sensitive group of organisms. Risk mitigation comparable to 5 m buffer zones is required to meet the Annex VI trigger. The risk for aquatic organisms from the surface water metabolites haloxyfop-P, DE-535 pyridinol, and DE-535 furan was assessed as low. Two metabolites were found in concentrations >0.1 mu g/L in the FOCUS ground water modelling. DE-535 pyridinol is considered to be of no ecotoxicological relevance. An assessment of new data on DE-535 pyridinone indicated a lower toxicity to aquatic organisms than the parent and the risk was assessed as low in the Additional Report (March 2009). The risk to bees and other non-target arthropods is low. The risk to earthworms, other soil macro organisms and soil micro-organisms from haloxyfop-P methyl ester and haloxyfop-P is considered to be low.        The risk to soil organisms from exposure to the persistent soil metabolites DE-535 pyridinol, DE-pyridinone and DE-535 phenol was not addressed in the original review. Assessment of the soil metabolites DE-535 pyridinol, DE-pyridinone and DE-535 phenol in the Additional Report (March 2009) indicated a low risk to earthworms, non-target soil macro-organisms and micro-organisms. The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low. The risk to non-target plants was assessed as low.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  5,10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1348     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),haloxyfop-P;haloxyfop-R;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;herbicide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance haloxyfopp haloxyfopr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rayyan-1227191209,Response to letter to the editor from Dr Rahman Shiri: The challenging topic of suicide across occupational groups.,2018,1,1,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",1795-990X 0355-3140,44,1,108-110,"Niedhammer, Isabelle and Milner, Allison and Witt, Katrina and Klingelschmidt, Justine and Khireddine-Medouni, Imane and Alexopoulos, Evangelos C. and Toivanen, Susanna and Chastang, Jean-François and LaMontagne, Anthony D.",,eng,,,"We thank Dr Rahman Shiri (1) for his careful reading of our systematic review and meta-analysis on suicide among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers (2).  Our paper had the objective of providing a pooled effect size of suicide for this  occupational group. Suicide is a crucial issue in public and occupational health.  Suicide has a multifactorial etiology and recent systematic reviews and  meta-analyses have pointed out the role of occupational exposures, mainly  psychosocial work stressors, as risk factors for suicide (3, 4). Suicide is a  very rare event in the general population and still more seldom in the working  population. Indeed, unemployed and economically inactive people have a higher  risk of suicide compared to employed people (5, 6). However, the total number of  suicides is greater in the employed population than among the economically  inactive or unemployed (6). Shiri's letter (1) questioned several aspects of our  review and meta-analysis. One comment related to the single reference database  used in our review and a suggestion that our review could not be considered to be  systematic. The review was based on Medline because our main interest was in  quantitative epidemiologic studies. This is the largest database for biomedical  literature and we would argue the most pertinent. Furthermore, we checked the  reference lists of the most recent papers and literature reviews, and Shiri did  not report any paper that was missing. No review, whether searching one or more  databases, can expect to be totally exhaustive. There may always be missing  studies, especially if we consider grey literature. Thus we assert that our  review was systematic, while acknowledging that it may not be perfectly  comprehensive. Shiri suggested an absence of quality assessment of the studies  included in our meta-analysis. First, quality was considered in the context of  our comments in the discussion section. Second, as suggested by Rothman et al  (7), quality assessment was replaced by regression analyses of the effect of each  quality item (study characteristics, ie, study design, effect measure, reference  group, and adjustment). Third, because most studies included in this review were  based on objective data (census, administrative, or register data), they were  free of many of the sources of bias that exist in studies where information on  exposure and outcome must be collected from participants. Consequently, many of  the items related to quality were not pertinent, such as response and follow-up  rates, coverage and representativeness of the sample, selection, etc. Contrary to  what Shiri suggested, all study designs can be informative in this topic because  all of them are able to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect size. In  addition, the prospective and case-control studies may have shortcomings. For  example, we excluded five studies including three prospective and case-control  studies in the sensibility analysis because the group of interest was defined on  the basis of the exposure to chemicals (pesticides) rather than job title. Our  choice to retain the least adjusted models was justified because aggregated data  were used for the meta-analysis. Therefore, unless all included studies adjusted  for the same covariates measured in the same way, adjusted estimates cannot be  meaningfully provided in an aggregate data meta-analysis. In addition, as the  objective was above all descriptive and not etiological or explanatory, and as it  is the norm in the exploration of social inequalities in health (8), the results  from the least (gender- and age-) adjusted models were in line with the  objective. Indeed, including more adjustment variables could lead to  overadjustment as they may be intermediate variables on the causal pathways  between occupation and suicide. Our strategy was in line with previous  meta-analyses on similar topics (9-11). Consequently, we would argue that our  results are not likely to be largely due to confounding, contrary to the comment  by Shiri. Indeed, the study of the contribution of underlying factors in  explaining social inequalities in health outcomes is a fully-fledged topic of  research (12-15), but this is relevant research to conduct after demonstrating  that inequalities exist between social or occupational groups. Several of Shiri's  comments were about statistical aspects of our analyses. First, it was suggested  that we did not correctly extract the confidence intervals for the estimates of  several studies. We disagree. We used the STATA metan suite of commands using  log-transformed effect sizes and standard errors. Our figure 1 and the values of  effect sizes and confidence intervals were provided by STATA, this explains why  there may be small differences in these values compared with the results  published in some studies. Using log-transformed effect sizes and confidence  intervals, the analysis provided the same results. Second, our subgroup  comparison was based on subsamples that were independent. As not all studies  provided information for these subgroups, each subgroup was treated as a unit of  analysis. This strategy allows the use of all relevant subgroups and comparisons  between them (16). Third, we were also criticized for the use of random-effects  models. Random-effects models are generally more plausible for meta-analysis  based on studies from the published literature, because the fixed-effect model  assumed that the entire corpus of literature has been obtained, ie, that every  study has been or ever will be written on the topic has been included, which is  an implausible assumption. We also assumed differences in effect size between  studies and between subgroups, and the use of random-effects models was  consistent with such an assumption. However, random-effects models produce wider  confidence intervals compared to fixed-effect models (16). These models are thus  more conservative, making our results all the more robust. One of Shiri's  comments related to the reference group used in the studies for the comparison of  agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers. Although we reported that the  studies using a specific occupational group as reference group provided a higher  effect size than the studies using other reference groups, we did not explicitly  recognize and state in the paper that the results for Japan were based on two  studies using a specific occupational group as reference; we concede that this  may explain why we found a much more elevated effect size for Japan. Shiri's  results (1) allow to conclude that the difference between Japan and the other  geographic areas could be explained by the choice of reference group-we are  grateful to him for raising this point. However, we would note that the effect  size of suicide was still elevated and significant for agricultural, forestry,  and fishery workers even after this change in the reference group for these two  studies. Nevertheless, the choice of the optimal reference group is not obvious.  If we consider the general population as the reference group, as unemployed  people and economically inactive people (including people who may not be working  due to illness or disability) are part of it and have a higher risk of suicide  than employed people, the effect size provided by the nine studies using the  general population as the reference is likely to be underestimated, which may  contribute to an underestimation of the observed effect size of suicide among  agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers in our study. The comparison was made  in our paper with the other occupational groups (ie, the working population  except the group of interest) as the reference, which was used by nine other  studies, but this did not allow to determine the exact rank of the group of  interest in the occupational hierarchy. Another relevant choice would have been  to retain the group with the lowest suicide risk (for example, the high-skilled  occupational group) as the reference, which would have led to a much higher  effect size of suicide for agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers. To  conclude, as statistical power in detecting differences between subgroups may be  low in subgroup analyses and meta-regression, the absence of significant results  according to subgroups found in our results cannot be interpreted as evidence  that the effect size is the same across subgroups. Consequently, our  meta-analysis reporting a significant excess of risk of suicide among  agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers may also be a good incentive for more  research among this group of workers to (i) confirm this observed excess of risk  using differing methodological approaches to meta-analysis and (ii) explore the  potential differences within this group and the underlying factors that may  explain this excess of risk.

The most important functional  elements are the native fish. The aim of this study was to identify the native  species of lavivorous fish in Rudan County, southern Iran, to introduce an  effective species and to propose its' implementation in the national malaria  control program. METHODS: This ecologically descriptive study was conducted  during 2011-2012 using random sampling from different fish habitats of Rudan  County. The shoals of fish were caught using fishing net. Fish samples were then  identified in the Ichthyology lab, Department of Fisheries and the Environment,  Hormozgan University. RESULTS: Three species of larvivorous fish were identified  as follows: Gambusia holbrooki, Aphaniusdispar dispar and Aphanius sp. The latter  species has the most distribution in the study area and needs more morphological  and molecular studies for identification at the species level. CONCLUSION: Two  species of native fish, i.e., A. dispar and A. sp. with larvivorous potential  live in the area. Further studies on their predatory property are recommended in  order to apply this local potential against malaria vectors in the area.",,,Aphanius;Biological control;Iran;Larvivorous fish;Malaria,NA,NA,native larvivorous fish in an endemic malarious area of southern iran a biological alternative factor for chemical larvicides in malaria control program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article describes the context, methods, limitations and findings of the  Northway Wild Food and Health Project (NWFHP). OBJECTIVE: The NWFHP comprised 2  pilot studies: the Northway Wild Food Study (NWFS), which investigated  contaminants in locally prioritized traditional foods over time, and the Northway  Health Study (NHS), which investigated locally suspected links between resource  uses and health problems. DESIGN: This research employed mixed methods. The NWFS  reviewed remedial documents and existing data. The NHS collected household  information regarding resource uses and health conditions by questionnaire and  interview. NHS data represent general (yes or no) personal knowledge that was  often second hand. Retrospective cohort comparisons were made of the reported  prevalence of 7 general health problems between groups based on their reported  (yes or no) consumption of particular resources, for 3 data sets (existing,  historic and combined) with a two-tailed Fisher's Exact Test in SAS (n = 325  individuals in 83 households, 24 of which no longer exist). RESULTS: The NWFS  identified historic pathways of exposure to petroleum, pesticides, herbicides,  chlorinated byproducts of disinfection and lead from resources that were consumed  more frequently decades ago and are not retrospectively quantifiable. The NHS  found complex patterns of association between reported resource uses and cancer  and thyroid-, reproductive-, metabolic- and cardiac problems. CONCLUSION: Lack of  detail regarding medical conditions, undocumented histories of exposure, time  lapsed since the release of pollution and changes to health and health care over  the same period make this exploratory research. Rather than demonstrate  causation, these results document the legitimacy of local suspicions and warrant  additional investigation.

On entering aquatic  habitats, these chemicals target and disrupt both physiological and behavioral  functioning in various aquatic organisms. Herbicides, such as  2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), can have negative impacts on  chemoreception because these receptor cells are in direct contact with  water-soluble chemicals in the environment. Studies focusing on lethal  concentration (LC50) levels may understate the impact of herbicides within  aquatic habitats because damage to the chemoreceptors can result in modified  behaviors or lack of appropriate responses to environmental or social cues. The  purpose of this experiment was to determine whether exposure to sublethal levels  of 2,4-D alters the foraging behaviors of crayfish Orconectes rusticus. We  hypothesized that crayfish exposed to greater concentrations of 2,4-D would be  less successful in locating food or on locating food would consume smaller  amounts possibly due to an inability to recognize the food odors in the  contaminated waters. Crayfish were exposed to three sublethal levels of 2,4-D for  96 h and placed into a Y-maze system with a fish gelatin food source placed  randomly in the right or left arm. Average walking speed, average time spent in  the correct arm, and percent consumption were analyzed. Our data show that  crayfish were impaired in their ability to forage effectively.

Behavioral data was acquired and analyzed  by idTracker and MATLAB. By comparing the effects of all treatments on behavior  parameters, we confirmed that the spatial distribution was more easily altered  rather than general locomotor parameters, e.g. 0.7-70 mg/L PTZ and 5-20 mg/L  paraquat being effective for altering spatial distribution but having little  effects on general locomotor parameters. Based on the heatmap, i.e., the  cumulative proportion of grids and that of frequency in grids, we calculated the  behavioral Gini coefficient (G(b)) for quantitative assessment of fish spatial  distribution. The Gini coefficient ranged from zero to 1, with larger values  meaning poorer evenness of spatial distribution. Of note, G(b) showed smaller  coefficient of variations (CV) with 3%-19% between replicate tanks in all  treatments than the highest frequency (4%-79%), displaying well robustness.

To  manipulate the infection potential of the environment, we added either a  Saprolegnia infection vector into UV-filtered water or a fungicide into natural  Baltic Sea water. Saprolegnia are widely spread water moulds that are a key cause  of egg mortality in aquatic organisms in fresh- and brackish water.

However, the different factors influenced egg viability  interactively, with a higher egg density having negative effects at low, but not  in high, salinity.

For this study, Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed  subchronically to the organophosphate pesticide malathion in a series of two  experiments. In the first set of studies, fish were exposed for 7 or 14 d to  untreated well water (i.e., controls) or to waterborne malathion at 0.2 or 0.8  mg/L. Following exposure, fish from each group were sacrificed and their kidneys  (primary organ of leukopoiesis in fish and equivalent to mammalian bone marrow)  were used to provide cells for assessing any malathion-induced effects upon  nonspecific and acquired immune defense mechanisms. Effects upon humoral-mediated  immunity were determined by enumerating antibody plaque-forming cell (PFC)  numbers from a subset of fish exposed to malathion for 14 d and then injected  intraperitoneally (ip) with sheep erythrocytes (sRBC). Results of these studies  demonstrated that while malathion exposure had no significant effect upon  hematocrit/leukocrit values or upon mitogen-stimulated T-cell  lymphoproliferation, PFC numbers in the kidney of exposed fish were significantly  reduced (compared to control fish) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, total  recoverable kidney cell numbers and viability, as well as superoxide anion  production by kidney phagocytes, were reduced slightly (compared to control  values) in fish exposed for 14 d to the highest malathion concentration tested.  In the second set of experiments, medaka exposed for up to 21 d to either 0.1 or  0.3 mg malathion/L were challenged ip with an LD50 dose of the bacterial fish  pathogen Yersinia ruckeri. Results from these infectivity studies demonstrated  that exposure to either malathion concentration, for 14 or 21 d reduced host  resistance against Yersinia infection. Taken together, these findings demonstrate  the applicability of mammalian immune assays for predicting malathion-induced  immunosuppression in a teleost fish, as well as the potential utility of a small  laboratory fish to serve as an alternate model for mammals in immunotoxicological  studies.",,10.1080/00984109909350175,Animals;Antibody Formation/drug effects/immunology;Cholinesterase Inhibitors/*toxicity;Immunoassay/methods;Insecticides/*toxicity;Kidney/cytology/drug effects/immunology;Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects;Malathion/*toxicity;Oryzias/*immunology;Phagocytes/drug effects/metabolism;Predictive Value of Tests;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism;T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology;Immunoassay,NA,NA,mammalian immunoassays for predicting the toxicity of malathion in a laboratory fish model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Occupational  and environmental exposures were studied in several countries and found to play  important role in the disease development. However, in Egypt, a little attention  has been paid to study the effect of these factors in the disease development.  OBJECTIVE: To identify the occupational and environmental risk factors associated  with the development of IPF in Egypt. METHODS: A multicenter hospital-based  case-control study was carried out in chest hospitals affiliated to three  Egyptian cities-Cairo, Tanta and Mansoura. Subjects were 201 patients with  confirmed IPF (cases) and 205 age-, sex- and residence-matched controls. Data on  occupational and environmental factors were obtained from a questionnaire.  Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent risk  factors of IPF in both sexes for single factors with adjustment for age,  residence and smoking status. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the risk of  IPF in male workers was observed to increase significantly in chemical and  petrochemical industries and carpentry and wood working (OR = 2.56, 95% CI:  1.02-7.01), and with occupational exposures to wood dust and wood preservatives.  Among female workers, a significant increase was observed in farming (OR = 3.34,  95% CI: 1.17-10.12), raising birds and occupational exposures to animal feeds,  products and dusts and pesticides. Risk of IPF decreased significantly in male  workers and insignificantly among female workers in sales and clerical related  activities. The environmental exposures to birds and cats were significantly  associated with elevated risk of IPF development in both sexes. CONCLUSION: In  Egypt, farming, raising birds and wood working are important risk factors for the  development of IPF.",,,Adult;Agricultural Workers' Diseases/epidemiology;Case-Control Studies;Egypt/epidemiology;Female;Humans;Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis/*epidemiology;Male;Middle Aged;Occupational Exposure;Risk Factors;Wood;Egypt,NA,NA,occupational and environmental risk factors for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in egypt a multicenter casecontrol study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional methods for  detection of fungicide resistance are time-consuming, which are routinely based  on tedious operation, reliance on expensive equipment, and specially trained  people. Therefore, it is important to establish efficient methods for field  detection of benzimidazole resistance in V. carpophila to make suitable  management strategies and ensure food safety. Based on recombinase polymerase  amplification (RPA) combined with CRISPR/Cas12a, a rapid one-pot assay  ORCas12a-BRVc (one-pot RPA-CRISPR/Cas12 platform) was established for the  detection of benzimidazole resistance in V. carpophila. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay  enabled one-pot detection by adding components at the bottom and wall of the tube  separately, solving the problems of aerosol contamination and decreased  sensitivity caused by competing DNA substrates between Cas12a cleavage and RPA  amplification. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay could accomplish the detection with a  minimum of 7.82 × 10(3) fg μL(-1) V. carpophila genomic DNA in 45 min at 37 °C.  Meanwhile, this assay showed excellent specificity due to the specific  recognition ability of the Cas12a-crRNA complex. Further, we combined a method  that could rapidly extract DNA from V. carpophila within 2 min with the  ORCas12a-BRVc to achieve more rapid and simple detection of V. carpophila with  benzimidazole resistance in fields. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay has the advantages of  simplicity, rapidity, high sensitivity, high specificity, and ease of operation  without the need for precision instruments and the need to isolate and culture  pathogens. This assay is the first application of the one-pot platform based on  the combination of RPA and CRISPR/Cas12a in fungicide resistance detection and  can be used for monitoring of resistant populations in fields, providing guidance  on making suitable management strategies for peach scab.",,10.1021/acs.jafc.2c06549,"*Fungicides, Industrial;*Recombinases;Benzimidazoles/pharmacology;CRISPR-Cas Systems;CRISPR/Cas12a;fungicide resistance;Humans;MBC fungicides;Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques;Nucleotidyltransferases;one-pot detection;RPA;Venturia carpophila;Benzimidazoles",NA,NA,onepot assay for rapid detection of benzimidazole resistance in venturia carpophila by combining rpa and crisprcas12a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Early developmental stages of fish, from embryo to larvae,  were exposed to terbuthylazine at concentrations of 0.9, 160, 520, and 820 μg/L,  and metribuzin at concentrations of 0.9, 4, 14, and 32 mg/L for 30 days and  compared to the non-treated control group. For assessment of free radical defence  the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR)  were measured; the lipid peroxidation (TBARS) level was determined as a marker of  free radical damage. RESULTS: Terbuthylazine had no significant effect (p>0.05)  at any tested concentrations on GST activity. Terbuthylazine caused an increase  (p<0.05) in GR activity at the concentration of 520 μg/L. We found a  non-significant (p>0.05) effect of terbuthylazine exposure on TBARS level. In  metribuzin treated groups, the activity of GST was increased (p<0.05) in all  experimental groups, with the highest at the concentration of 32 mg/L. GR  activity was increased in the 0.9, 4, and 14 mg/L groups and the TBARS levels  were the highest in the 0.9 mg/L group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that  terbuthylazine and metribuzin induced oxidative stress in embryo-larval stages of  common carp. Increased activities of biotransformation enzymes or antioxidant  defence enzymes were markers of free radical attack.

Refusal rate of IRS in living rooms was 81.93% due to lack  of knowledge regarding the importance of IRS, no prior information to villagers,  houses locked, reluctance to remove domestic articles, dislike of smell of DDT  spray. Compliance rate of ITN uses was 71.66% during the night, which might be a  factor for decline in malaria cases in the study area.

METHODS: Information on time to pregnancy, subfertility,  and infertility was collected retrospectively by self-administered questionnaires  in 2 cohorts of fishermen's wives from the Swedish east (by the Baltic Sea) and  west coasts. In addition to cohort affiliation, current fish consumption and  growing up in a fishing village were used as proxies for exposure within the  eastcoast cohort. RESULTS: A decreased success (ie, pregnancy) rate and a  tendency towards increased subfertility was found for heavy smokers (> or =10  cigarettes/day) in the eastcoast cohort as compared with the westcoast cohort  [success rate ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.49-.89; subfertility  odds ratio 1.64, 95% CI 0.91-2.91).

To defend host-generated oxidants, Salmonella encodes primary antioxidants and protein  repair enzymes. Methionine (Met) residues are highly prone to oxidation and  convert into methionine sulfoxide (Met-SO) which compromises protein functions  and subsequently cellular survival. However, by reducing Met-SO to Met,  methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) enhance cellular survival under stress  conditions. Salmonella encodes five Msrs which are specific for particular Met-SO  (free/protein bound), and 'R'/'S' types. Earlier studies assessed the effect of  deletions of one or two msrs on the stress physiology of S. Typhimurium. We  generated a pan msr gene deletion (Δ5msr) strain in S. Typhimurium. The Δ5msr  mutant strain shows an initial lag in in vitro growth. However, the Δ5msr mutant  strain depicts very high sensitivity (p < 0.0001) to hypochlorous acid (HOCl),  chloramine T (ChT) and superoxide-generating oxidant paraquat. Further, the Δ5msr  mutant strain shows high levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls, and  protein aggregation. On the other side, the Δ5msr mutant strain exhibits lower  levels of free amines. Further, the Δ5msr mutant strain is highly susceptible to  neutrophils and shows defective fitness in the spleen and liver of mice. The  results of the current study suggest that the deletions of all msrs render S.

In the present work, we studied the main genes related to  efflux transporters in zebrafish liver (ZFL) cells exposed to MP with and without  an inhibitor of ABC transporters (verapamil). The results concerning transporters  activity showed that the MXR mechanism is activated to detoxify from methyl  parathion. The toxic effects of MP on ZFL cells were increased in the presence of  the efflux transporter inhibitor, once cell viability was significantly decreased  in co-exposure experiments. The combined exposure to MP and the inhibitor caused  an increase in gene expression of P-gp1 (Abcb1) and MRP4 (Abcc4), suggesting that  these transporters isoforms are associated with MP efflux. In general, the  expression of genes related to the antioxidant defense system (ADS) was  significantly increased in ZFL cells co-exposed to MP and verapamil.

To our knowledge, the mechanisms  of toxicity to fish by the carbamate fungicide Tattoo that contains mancozeb  [ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate)] have not been studied. The present study aimed to  evaluate the effects of Tattoo on goldfish gills and blood, tissues that would  have close early contact with the pollutant. Exposure of goldfish Carassius  auratus to 3, 5 or 10mgL(-1) of Tattoo for 96h resulted in moderate lymphopenia  (by 8 percent) with a concomitant increase in both stab (by 66-88 percent) and  segmented (by 166 percent) neutrophils. An increase in the content of protein  carbonyl groups in blood (by 137-184 percent) together with decreased levels of  protein thiols (by 23 percent) and an enhancement of lipid peroxide  concentrations (by 29 percent) in gills after exposure to 10mgL(-1) of Tattoo  demonstrated the induction of mild oxidative stress in response to Tattoo  exposure. At the same time, the activities of selected antioxidant enzymes were  enhanced in gills: superoxide dismutase by 18-25 percent and catalase by 27  percent. A 34 percent increment in low molecular mass thiol concentrations  (mainly represented by glutathione) also occurred in gills and could be related  to increased activity (by 13-30 percent) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.  The results indicate that Tattoo exposure perturbs free radical processes, i.e.  induces mild oxidative stress and enhances the activity of certain antioxidant  and associated enzymes in goldfish gills.

In the present study, we have used  paraquat, a generator of exogenous reactive oxygen species, to investigate  whether it was the depletion of glutathione or an increase in the level of  reactive oxygen species which resulted in horizontal cell uncoupling after  L-buthionine sulfoximine injection. Intracellular recordings were made from  L-type horizontal cells at various time-points after intravitreal injection of  paraquat. Injection of 25nmol paraquat caused an increase in response amplitude  to central spot light stimuli by two days after injection, which continued for a  further two to three days and had almost disappeared by seven days after  injection. There was also a sharp increase in reactive oxygen species production,  peaking at four days and disappearing by seven days after injection, and an  accompanying depletion and a restoration of glutathione levels with a similar  time-course. Marking cells with Lucifer Yellow clearly illustrated uncoupling of  horizontal cells after paraquat injection. If paraquat and L-buthionine  sulfoximine were injected simultaneously, the increase in response to central  spots was observed as early as one day after injection. This response amplitude  was not more enhanced than that observed after L-buthionine sulfoximine injection  alone, although a dramatic increase in the level of reactive oxygen species was  observed. From these results, we suggest that reactive oxygen species are  involved in uncoupling, while recovery from uncoupling is dependent on  glutathione. Furthermore, we conclude that a balance between glutathione and  reactive oxygen species levels is the most important factor controlling gap  junctional intercellular communication of L-type horizontal cells in the carp  retina.",,10.1016/s0306-4522(00)00527-3,"Animals;Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology;Carps;Cell Communication/physiology;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacokinetics;Gap Junctions/*metabolism;Glutathione/*metabolism;Herbicides/pharmacology;Isoquinolines/pharmacokinetics;Paraquat/pharmacology;Photic Stimulation;Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism;Retina/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism;Reactive Oxygen Species;Retina;Oxygenators",NA,NA,reactive oxygen species uncouple external horizontal cells in the carp retina and glutathione couples them again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D. and Scott, E. A.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: To describe environmental health problems encountered in some Ontario family practices and to describe differences between the environmental concerns  of urban (small and large) and rural physicians. DESIGN: A self-completed  questionnaire was mailed to 536 family physicians with hospital affiliations in  three areas of Ontario. SETTING: Family practices (rural, small urban, and large  urban) in Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Of 521 eligible community family physicians with  hospital affiliations, 214 returned usable questionnaires for a 41% response  rate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Environmental health problems encountered in  practice were measured using questions about physician concerns, reported patient  questions, physician-identified high-risk groups, problems related to  environmental exposure, self-rated knowledge, and current and preferred sources  of information on environmental health effects. RESULTS: Physicians were highly  concerned and reported many patient questions about the health effects of  environmental exposures. Pregnant women, agricultural workers, and children were  considered important at-risk groups. Self-ratings of knowledge were generally  very low. Rural physicians were concerned about agricultural pesticide exposure  and their patients about moldy hay. Urban physicians had different concerns about  lead and reported patient concerns about exposure to Great Lakes fish. All groups  used similar sources of current environmental health information. CONCLUSIONS:  Family physicians who participated in this study identified important patient and  professional concerns about environmental health issues and reported a lack of  resources to meet those concerns. This study provides information to family  medicine residency programs and continuing medical education providers to help  them enhance their focus on environmental health.",,,"*Environmental Health;*Family Practice/education/methods;*Rural Health;*Urban Health;Adult;Child;Environmental Exposure/adverse effects;Female;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Humans;Information Services;Male;Ontario;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Pregnancy;Risk Factors;Surveys and Questionnaires;Family Practice;Environmental Health",NA,NA,environmental health concerns in urban and rural family practice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gills of the fish are the  primary corridor formolecularexchange between the internal milieu of a fish and  its environment. Gills perform numerous functions such as oxygen uptake and CO2  excretion, osmoregulation, acid-basic balance, excretion of nitrogenous compounds  and taste. Hazardous chemicals present in water may alter the morphology of the  epithelial cells of gills of the fish, which may affect the process of diffusion  of gases and ultimately the overall health of the fish. To prove this fact  Cyprinus carpio communis Linn. was kept in water for 30 days having low  concentration of 0.038 ppm (1\10th of LC50) of monocrotophos and an attempt was  made to study the different types of degenerations produced in the epithelial  cells of gills as compared to the normal epithelial cells of gills of this  culturable fish using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) technique. The  ultrastructural changes due to the toxic exposure at finer scale were thinning of  microridges, upliftment of epithelial cells, development of hyperplasia, decrease  in the density of mucous cells which are considered to be the first line of  defence and total dystrophy of epithelial tissue. Thus, it is opined that a low  concentration of monocrotophos has the potential to bring different type of  degenerations at finer scale hence affecting the fish's health drastically and  altering the fitness of the fish in water even having insignificant amount of  this toxicant in the ambient water",,,"*Carps;Animals;Epithelial Cells/*drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure;Gills/*drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure;Insecticides/*toxicity;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning;Monocrotophos/*toxicity;Water Pollutants, Chemical/*toxicity;Epithelial Cells",NA,NA,impact of low dose of organophosphate monocrotophos on the epithelial cells of gills of cyprinus carpio communis linnsem study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In predator-prey interactions,  mediation signals allow prey to detect their predators and can be crucial in the  process of avoiding them. Since organisms in many natural waterbodies are often  subjected to anthropogenic stressors, it is hypothesised that low concentrations  of xenobiotic compounds can disturb this chemical communication, acting as  infodisruptors. This study analyzes whether two anthropogenic pollutants  (chromium and an insecticide) interfere in two freshwater predator-prey  interactions, by altering the behavioural responses of a cladoceran and a copepod  species to a fish chemical cue. The concentrations tested were lower than those  considered innocuous under international water quality guidelines, and two types  of behaviour were analysed: escape ability and depth selection in an artificial  water column. Both species tested demonstrated a higher escape ability when  exposed to the cue than when they were not exposed. Xenobiotics modified the  responses of the copepod in opposite ways: chromium inhibited this behaviour and  the insecticide prompted a higher than expected level of escape ability. The  depth selection patterns were different between N. conifer and C. dubia. Fish  kairomones did not modify them, however chromium and the insecticide caused  important alterations in both cases.

N. and Radic, Z. and Manker, D. and Faulkner, D. J. and Taylor, P.",,eng,,,"Onchidal has been identified as the major lipid-soluble component of the defensive secretion of the mollusc Onchidella binneyi, and it has been proposed  as the compound responsible for the chemical protection of Onchidella [Bioorg.  Chem. 7:125-131 (1978)]. In support of this hypothesis, we now report that  onchidal can be found in several different species of Onchidella and that it is  toxic to fish. Because onchidal is an acetate ester similar to acetylcholine, its  ability to interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and  acetylcholinesterase was investigated. Although onchidal did not prevent the  binding of 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, it  inhibited acetylcholinesterase in a progressive, apparently irreversible, manner.  The apparent affinity of onchidal for the initial reversible binding to  acetylcholinesterase (Kd) was approximately 300 microM, and the apparent rate  constant for the subsequent irreversible inhibition of enzyme activity (kintact)  was approximately 0.1 min-1. Onchidal was a substrate for acetylcholinesterase,  and approximately 3250 mol of onchidal were hydrolyzed/mol of enzyme irreversibly  inhibited. The calculated kcat for onchidal was 325 min-1. Irreversible  inhibition resulted from either onchidal itself or a reactive intermediate in the  enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of onchidal, rather than from the hydrolysis products  of onchidal. Irreversible inhibition of enzyme activity was prevented by  coincubation with reversible agents that either sterically block (edrophonium and  decamethonium) or allosterically modify (propidium) the acetylcholine binding  site. Enzyme activity was not regenerated by incubation with oxime reactivators;  therefore, the mechanism of irreversible inhibition does not appear to involve  acylation of the active site serine. Because onchidal contains a potentially  reactive alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, irreversible inhibition of  acetylcholinesterase may result from formation of a novel covalent bond between  the toxin and the enzyme. Thus, this novel toxin could potentially be exploited  in the design of a new class of anticholinesterase insecticides and in the  identification of amino acids that contribute to the binding and hydrolysis of  acetylcholine.",,,"*Cholinesterase Inhibitors;Acetylcholinesterase/*metabolism;Animals;Binding Sites;Kinetics;Mollusca/analysis;Mollusk Venoms/analysis/metabolism/*pharmacology;Oximes;Pyridinium Compounds/pharmacology;Receptors, Nicotinic/drug effects;Structure-Activity Relationship;Terpenes/metabolism/*pharmacology;Cholinesterase Inhibitors",NA,NA,onchidal a naturally occurring irreversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase with a novel mechanism of action,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Questionnaire-based protocol prepared by the National  Vector Borne Disease Control Programme was used to evaluate the activities.  Sixteen villages belonging to five different Primary Health Centres (PHCs) of  three districts were selected for investigations. RESULTS: Results of monitoring  of indoor residual spraying (IRS) revealed inadequate spraying coverage. Although  recorded to be about 69-99%, but apparently it was 17-43% in the districts  investigated. Cross-examination of 180 blood smears (90 positive and negative  each) in the laboratories of the study PHCs, revealed discrepancy in the results  of 67 blood smears. Maximum (44%) discrepancy was observed in positive blood  smears and 30% in negative blood smears. Out of 22 Accredited Social Health  Activists (ASHA) interrogated, none was found involved in antimalaria activities.  However, out of 13 fever treatment depots monitored, one was found partially  functional. Criteria laid down for preparation of micro action plan were not  followed properly in any of the districts sruveyed. Various important components  of the programme like constitution of Village Health Sanitation Committee,  information education communication (IEC) activities, capacity building, use of  larvivorous fishes, supervision, etc. were not exercised properly. However, 100%  community acceptance was recorded for insecticide-treated bed nets in the  villages surveyed. Indiscriminate use of rapid diagnostic test kits yielded poor  and unsatisfactory response. Declining trend of malaria was observed during  2002-06 in Districts Nagaon and Karbi-Anglong (up to 2005). In District Cachar,  however, a little increasing trend was observed during 2002-04. CONCLUSION: The  results of this investigation revealed that the malaria control programme had  been jeopardized seriously due to improper implementation of vector control  measures, lack of adequate professional support and varied commitment on the part  of the State Government. It can be concluded that long-term malaria control  strategy should be based on generation of increased awareness on the disease and  various methods of its control, health care access and administrative commitment  for increased prosperity in resource-poor settings. The observation also  necessitates further in-depth evaluation with appropriate regular active  surveillance round the year with prompt detection and treatment facilities in  order to control malaria effectively in these districts.",,,"*Mosquito Control;Humans;India/epidemiology;Malaria/*prevention & control;Reagent Kits, Diagnostic;India;Malaria",NA,NA,evaluation of malaria control programme in three selected districts of assam india,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
