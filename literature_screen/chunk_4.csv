In the current study, we analyzed olfactory-mediated alarm responses, epithelial injury and recovery, and a suite of olfactory molecular biomarkers encoding genes critical in maintaining olfactory function in juvenile coho salmon receiving acute exposures to cadmium (Cd). The molecular biomarkers analyzed included four G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) representing the two major classes of odorant receptors (salmon olfactory receptor sorb and vomeronasal receptors svra, svrb, and gpr27), as well as markers of neurite outgrowth (nrn1) and antioxidant responses to metals, including heme oxygenase 1 (hmox1), and peroxiredoxin 1 (prdx1). Coho received acute (8-168 h) exposures to 3.7 ppb and 347 ppb Cd, and a subset of fish was analyzed following a 16-day depuration. Coho exposed to 347 ppb Cd over 48 h exhibited a reduction in freeze responses, and an extensive loss of olfaction accompanied by histological injury to the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory injury in coho exposed to 347 ppb Cd was accompanied at the gene level by significant decreases in expression of the olfactory GPCRs and increased expression of hmoxl. Persistent behavioral deficits, histological injury and altered expression of a subset of olfactory biomarkers were still evident in Cd-exposed coho following a 16-day depuration in clean water. Exposure to 3.7 ppb Cd also resulted in reduced freeze responses and histological changes to the olfactory epithelium within 48 h of Cd exposure, although the extent of olfactory injury was less severe than observed for fish in the high dose Cd group. Furthermore adverse behavioral effects were present in some coho receiving the low dose of Cd following a 16-day depuration. In summary, acute exposures to environmental levels of Cd can cause olfactory injury in coho salmon that may persist following depuration. Mechanism-based biomarkers of oxidative stress and olfactory structures can augment the evaluation of olfactory injury manifested at the physiological level. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to find out if the HtrA protease contributes to protection of the cell against oxidative stress. We compared the influence of various oxidizing agents on htrA mutant cells with their effects on wild-type bacteria, and found that the htr A mutation did not increase sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide or paraquat but made the cell extremely sensitive to ferrous [Fe(II)] ions, which are known to enhance oxidation of proteins. Treatment with ferrous ions caused a larger increase in the level of protein carbonyl groups in the membrane fraction of the cell than in the periplasm and cytoplasm. Iron-induced oxidation of membrane proteins was enhanced in the htrA mutant relative to wild-type cells. Inhibition of the growth of the htrA mutant by iron could be alleviated more efficiently by a nitroxide antioxidant that localizes in the membranes (A-TEMPO) than by a derivative (40H-TEM-PO) that acts mainly in the soluble fraction of the cell. Inhibition of the growth of the htrA mutant was more pronounced following treatment with cumene hydroperoxide, which partitions into membranes, than with t-butyl hydroperoxide, which forms radical mainly in the cytosol. Both ferrous ions and cumene hydroperoxide, but not hydrogen peroxide, paraquat or t-butyl hydroperoxide, induced synthesis of HtrA. Our results show that HtrA plays a role in defense against oxidative shock and support the hypothesis that HtrA participates in the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins localized in the cell envelope, especially those associated with the membranes.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  73     Total Times Cited:  82     Cited Reference Count:  54,10.1007/s004380051092     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),HtrA protease;oxidative stress;ferrous ions;nitroxide antioxidants;arthritis;SALMONELLA-TYPHIMURIUM;SERINE-PROTEASE;ELEVATED-TEMPERATURES;DENATURED PROTEINS;LIPID-PEROXIDATION;HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE;CELL-ENVELOPE;GENE;IDENTIFICATION;DEGRADATION;Oxidative Stress;Hot Temperature;Escherichia coli,NA,NA,the <i>escherichia coli<i> heat shock protease htra participates in defense against oxidative stress

However, the roles of other virulence factors in regulating inflammasome activation during E. piscicida infection remain poorly understood. In this study, we focused on clarification the role of ETAE_RS10155, a thioredoxin-like protein (Trxlp), during bacterial infection in macrophages. We found that mutation of this gene barely influences the bacteria growth and infection capability. Interestingly, the inflammasome activation was reduced in Delta trxlp-infected macrophages, compared with wild-type E. piscicida did. Moreover, Trxlp mainly promotes the NLRC4, but not NLRP3 inflammasome activation during E. piscicida infection. Finally, Trxlp-mediated NLRC4 inflammasome activation is crucial for host surveillance in vivo.

Early detection and prevention of crop diseases is critical to control the diseases, improve crop yields, reduce the economic losses and control pesticide pollution. Therefore, the research of recognition methods for crop diseases is necessary. This paper proposed a disease recognition method of phomopsis vexans in Solanum melongena, based on leaf disease spot features. In this method, computer vision technology was used as a means of digital image processing and pattern recognition technique, focusing on analysis of the diseased leaf spots of color, shape, texture parameters. Diseased sample image was collected through an image acquisition system which composed of FitPC and server with long-distance point-to-point transmission. The collected diseased leaf images were processed using a series of image pre-processing methods, such as image transforming, smoothing, and segmentation. After removing disturbance of noise with a median filter and excluded non-blade portion with Grabcut algorithm, the preprocessed image was obtained. Since the H-values of preprocessed image in the HSI color space were concentrated within a certain range, the threshold preprocessed image was chosen as the background of the diseased leaf image. The image segmentation method, based on the result of the background and the preprocessed image multiplication, was applied to separate the disease spot images from the diseased leaf images. The twelve color characteristic parameters, eleven shape feature parameters and eight texture feature parameters for each disease spot area, i. e. the 31 disease unions classifying features were extracted by statistical analysis. The feature vectors consisted of twenty strong classification feature parameters, which were selected by the variance and principal component analysis methods. Based on the training set that composed of 35 phomopsis vexans spot feature vectors and feature vectors of 35 other disease of Solanum melongena spot, Fischer discriminant function classification which use to classify the testing set was constructed. The recognition results of the kinds of phomopsis vexans by the proposed method were 90%. Under the premise of not changing the identify objects, to improve the accuracy of recognition, it required to consider of the influence of different classification feature vectors and different samples of training set on the recognition results. The results of control experiment showed that, the identification accuracy rate decreased with the reduction of the training set, and the identification accuracy of Fisher classification discriminant function constructed by feature vectors dropped without characteristic optimization. The causes of these results were that the sample of other disease of Solanum melongena contained phomopsis vexans similar diseases and redundancy parameters were presented in the original classification feature vetor. The analysis and experimental results in this paper demonstrate that before constructing discriminant function, enough training samples should be acquired and it's nesessary to select the effective parameters that identified well from the feature parameters. The proposed method indicated that using computer vision technology could realize the rapid and accurate identification of leaf diseases of Solanum melongena, and provide supporting technology to real-time detection on solanum melongena diseases in open field. This paper only studied crop leaf disease, while diseases of the stem and fruit were not involved, which remains to be further studied. ¬© 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The biodegradation of this insecticide is principally catalyzed through P450 enzymes, carboxylesterases, and glutathione-S-transferase, increasing the amount of free radicals that could promote the activation of oxidative stress response. The present study identified and evaluated the transcriptomic expression of genes related to the antioxidant system in male and female C. rogercresseyi exposed to deltamethrin (AlphaMax‚Ñ¢). Herein, thirty-three transcripts were identified from an EST-database, including CrGST, CrGST-kappa 1, CrSOD, CrCAT, CrSE-GPx, CrPHGP1, CrPHGP2, CrPRX6, CrPRX2, CrPRX4, and CrFERR.

Synthetic pyrethroids have been shown to enter the aquatic environment from agricultural runoff or drift from aerial and ground-based spraying applications posing threat to fishes which are less tolerant to pesticides through direct exposure. These insecticides interfere with the sodium channel of the nervous system resulting in prolonged sodium tail current. Widespread application of these chemicals has warranted the attention of the ecologist to understand the impact of these chemicals on the aquatic environment. In this perspective, an updated account of toxicological evaluation of three type II synthetic pyrethroids, viz. deltamethrin, cypermethrin and fenvalerate in terms of their physico-chemical, metabolic, hematological, histological, behavioral and reproductive aspects with respect to the fishes has been presented which may be useful for policy makers, academics, environmental scientists and agricultural professionals needing ready access to this information. The aim of the present synoptic literature appraisal was to summarize the main effect of current use, type II synthetic pyrethroids (deltamethrin, cypermethrin and fenvalerate) on aquatic environment due to their persistence and accumulation. This article will focus on non-target organisms in inland fresh water environment with special reference to fin fishes and will critically evaluate the toxicity of these pyrethroids in terms of growth inhibition, metabolic disorders, neurotoxicity, reproductive failure, enzymatic dysfunction, haematological alterations, and tissue damages. The rationalized information in this milieu may be useful in ecological risk evaluation and human health management as fish serves as an important bio-indicator for aquatic systems health. ¬© 2015, The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 41; Correspondence Address: D.K.

It has been demonstrated that ES can cause negative effects on aquatic animals, including disruption of hormonal systems. However, the alterations produced by this pesticide on the reproductive axis of fish prior to sexual maturity, as well as possible modes of action have hardly been studied. This study aimed at assessing the effect of waterborne exposure to the pesticide ES on the reproductive axis during sexual differentiation of juveniles of the South American freshwater cichlid fish Cichlasoma dimerus. No mortality was observed due to ES subchronic exposure (90 days post-fertilization). Exposure to ES did not affect body weight nor morphometric parameters, indicating that larvae nutritional state was not affected. Timing of sexual differentiation, gonadal morphology and sex ratio were likewise not altered by ES. However, ES acted as an endocrine disrupting chemical in this species as the morphometry of gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH) producing cells was altered. Exposure to ES altered nuclear area, cell area and nucleus/cytoplasm ratio of GnRH II neurons, and cell and nuclear area and diameter of GnRH III neurons. Interestingly, in our previous study, exposure before sex differentiation (30 day exposure) caused no alteration to GnRH II and III, and did alter GnRH I and FSH cells. These alterations could lead to changes in circulating hormone levels, especially when fish are exposed for prolonged periods, ultimately impairing reproductive fitness. C. dimerus juveniles can be an interesting biological model to perform toxicological studies with the intent to assess early disruption endpoints in the reproductive axis during development. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 19; CODEN: EESAD,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.03.013,"Cichlids;GnRH;Gonadotrops;Organochlorine pesticides;Reproductive axis;Analysis of Variance;Animals;Endocrine Disruptors;Endosulfan;Fresh Water;Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone;Gonads;Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated;Insecticides;Larva;Neurons;Protein Precursors;Sex Differentiation;Water Pollutants, Chemical;Animalia;Cichlasoma;Cichlidae;Perciformes;endocrine disruptor;endosulfan;gonadorelin;chlorinated hydrocarbon;fresh water;insecticide;progonadoliberin I;protein precursor;water pollutant;ecotoxicology;hormone;juvenile;morphometry;perciform;pollution effect;pollution exposure;reproductive behavior;sexual maturity;adult;animal cell;animal experiment;animal tissue;Article;biological model;body weight;brain nerve cell;cell nucleus;cell structure;Cichlasoma dimerus;cichlid;controlled study;cytoplasm;development;exposure;female;gonad;juvenile animal;larva;male;morphometrics;nonhuman;nutritional status;reproductive fitness;reproductive toxicity;sex differentiation;sex ratio;analysis of variance;animal;drug effects;metabolism;nerve cell;physiology;toxicity",NA,NA,endosulfan affects gnrh cells in sexually differentiated juveniles of the perciform cichlasoma dimerus

CBD has low affinity for cannabinoid neuroreceptors and agonistic properties to 5-HT receptors. An interaction between cannabinoid and purinergic receptor systems has been proposed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate CBD properties on memory behavioral and locomotor parameters and the effects of pre-treatment of adenosine receptor blockers on CBD impacts on memory using adult zebrafish. CBD (0.1, 0.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) was tested in the avoidance inhibitory paradigm and anxiety task. We analyzed the effect of a long-term caffeine pre-treatment (~ 20 mg/L - four months). Also, acute block of adenosine receptors was performed in co-administration with CBD exposure in the memory assessment. CBD promoted an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve in the anxiety task; in the memory assessment, CBD in the dose of 5 mg/Kg promoted the strongest effects without interfering with social and aggressive behavior. Caffeine treatment was able to prevent CBD (5 mg/kg) effects on memory when CBD was given after the training session. CBD effects on memory were partially prevented by co-treatment with a specific A2A adenosine receptor antagonist when given prior to or after the training session, while CBD effects after the training session were fully prevented by adenosine A1 receptor antagonist. These results indicated that zebrafish have responses to CBD anxiolytic properties that are comparable to other animal models, and high doses changed memory retention in a way dependent on adenosine. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, whether this process also weakens the toxicity of organic pollutants to non-target aquatic organisms is not clear. Therefore, natural sediments were chosen as suspended sediment examples in this research applying atrazine as the target pollutant and Brachydanio rerio (more recently, Danio rerio (Zebrafish)) as the target organism to conduct acute toxicity experiments. The concentration of atrazine in aqueous solution was measured as a time series. Results show that without suspended sediments, the 96-h LC50 of atrazine to Brachydanio rerio is 29.06 mg/l at 95 % confidence interval (24.41 to 40.70 mg/l). For suspended sediments of 7500 and 15,000 mg/l, the LC50 (i.e., concentration resulting in 50 % mortality) equates to 30.74 and 39.51 mg/l, respectively, and the corresponding confidence intervals are between 27.17 and 40.91 mg/l and between 30.43 and 126.93 mg/l in that order. Probit analysis, which is a type of regression used to analyze binomial response variables, was applied using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. For the series of no suspended solids (SS), 7500 and 15,000 mg/l SS, the so-called no-observed-effective concentrations were 3, 9, and 15 mg/l, correspondingly. The uptake quantity and uptake rate of atrazine by B. rerio according to atrazine concentrations in the aqueous solution were computed. The research indicates that suspended sediments can decrease the absorbed rate of atrazine by B. rerio. Thus, suspended sediments weaken the acute toxicity of atrazine to B. rerio. ¬© 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 9; CODEN: WAPLA,10.1007/s11270-015-2296-7,Ecotoxicology;Environmental pollution;Herbicide;Poison;Suspended solids;Zebrafish;Danio rerio;Aquatic organisms;Financial data processing;Herbicides;Organic pollutants;Pollution;Sediments;Solutions;Toxicity;atrazine;Eco-toxicology;Environmental pollutions;aqueous solution;bioaccumulation;biological uptake;concentration (composition);confidence interval;ecotoxicology;fish;reaction kinetics;suspended sediment;absorption;acute toxicity;adsorption kinetics;animal experiment;Article;controlled study;ecotoxicity;nonhuman;particle resuspension;suspended particulate matter;toxicokinetics;transport kinetics;zebra fish;Suspended sediments;Kinetics,NA,NA,kinetic processes of acute atrazine toxicity to brachydanio rerio in the presence and absence of suspended sediments

Numerous models have been developed for predicting dementia. To evaluate these models we undertook a systematic review in 2010 and updated this in 2014 due to the increase in research published in this area. Here we include a critique of the variables selected for inclusion and an assessment of model prognostic performance. Methods: Our previous systematic review was updated with a search from January 2009 to March 2014 in electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science). Articles examining risk of dementia in non-demented individuals and including measures of sensitivity, specificity or the area under the curve (AUC) or c-statistic were included. Findings: In total, 1,234 articles were identified from the search; 21 articles met inclusion criteria. New developments in dementia risk prediction include the testing of non-APOE genes, use of non-traditional dementia risk factors, incorporation of diet, physical function and ethnicity, and model development in specific subgroups of the population including individuals with diabetes and those with different educational levels. Four models have been externally validated. Three studies considered time or cost implications of computing the model. Interpretation: There is no one model that is recommended for dementia risk prediction in populationbased settings. Further, it is unlikely that one model will fit all. Consideration of the optimal features of new models should focus on methodology (setting/sample, model development and testing in a replication cohort) and the acceptability and cost of attaining the risk variables included in the prediction score. Further work is required to validate existing models or develop new ones in different populations as well as determine the ethical implications of dementia risk prediction, before applying the particular models in population or clinical settings.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 117; CODEN: POLNC,10.1371/journal.pone.0136181,"Dementia;Humans;Models, Theoretical;Risk Factors;high density lipoprotein cholesterol;pesticide;age;alcohol consumption;Alzheimer disease;area under the curve;arterial wall thickness;Article;body mass;case control study;cholesterol blood level;cognition;cohort analysis;coronary artery bypass surgery;cross-sectional study;dementia;depression;diabetes mellitus;dietary intake;digit symbol substitution test;disease association;education;experimental cognitive test;external validity;fish;follow up;genetic analysis;genotype;human;incidence;integrated discrimination improvement;longitudinal study;measurement accuracy;mild cognitive impairment;Mini Mental State Examination;net reclassification index;nuclear magnetic resonance imaging;physical activity;prediction;predictive value;risk assessment;risk factor;sensitivity and specificity;sex;smoking;social aspect;social engagement;statistical model;systematic review;traumatic brain injury;white matter lesion;theoretical model",NA,NA,current developments in dementia risk prediction modelling an updated systematic review

The tissues of infected fish were subjected to an ordinary bacteriological identification and were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry techniques. The results indicated that the selective primers that have been designed for detecting the gene encoding the apoptotic-induced protein, AIP56, represent a powerful tool for sensitive and specific detection of virulent strains of Phdp. AIP56 toxin triggers apoptosis of host macrophages and neutrophils, contributing to the lesions observed during the pathological investigation. Immunohistochemistry allows bacterial identification and antigen expression to be directly correlated to the disease; the immune-positive bacteria were detected in gills, liver, kidneys, spleen, and brain tissues in acute photobacteriosis.

Administration of lambda cyhalothrin also causes damage to the tissues of the testes, kidney and liver. Marked changes in the histoarchitecture of these organs were observed. All these results suggest that the lambda cyhalothrin induced changes in C. batrachus directly or indirectly by modulating the physiological functions in the fishes. ¬© 2015 Informatics Publishing Limited and The Society of Toxicology.

Yearling oysters were exposed to three concentrations of glyphosate (0.1, 1 and 100ŒºgL-1) for 56days. Various endpoints were studied, from the individual level (e.g., gametogenesis and tissue alterations) to the molecular level (mRNA quantification), including biochemical endpoints such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase activities and malondialdehyde content. No mortality and growth occurred during the experiment, and individual biomarkers revealed only slight effects. The levels of gene expression significantly increased in oysters exposed to the highest glyphosate concentration (GST and metallothioneins) or to all concentrations (multi-xenobiotic resistance).

Totally 384 samples of four varieties were scanned by using the NIR hyperspectral imaging system (871.61~1766.32 nm). The region of interest (ROI) in hyperspectral image of samples was selected, and the mean spectra of all pixels in the region of interest was calculated. At the same time, optimal image selection was carried out by principal component analysis (PCA). The first principal component (PC1) image and the second principal component (PC2) image were used for texture features analysis. Among the processing of spectral data, successive projections algorithm (SPA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to obtain characteristic wavelengths. Finally, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Mahalanobis distance (MD), Fisher linear discriminate analysis (FLDA) algorithm were used for model establishments respectively based on spectral feature and the combined features in full and characteristic wavelength. In all models, the performance of FLDA based on the combination of texture and spectral features by SPA has its superiority in classification recognition with the training rate of 98.90% and prediction rate of 100%.

As a consequence of their massive application, they have become and remain significant environmental pollutants, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Fish are an integral part of the aquatic environment and are, therefore, suitable models for the study of the behavioral, biological, and biochemical effects of triazine exposure. We have summarized and evaluated the effects of triazine herbicides on fish in order to provide an overview of current information on triazines. The overall effects of triazine herbicide exposure on the physiology of fish were evaluated by considering a variety of parameters in a number of reports. Haematological and biochemical profiles of blood provide important information about the internal environment of the organism and the general physiology and health status of triazine exposed fish. According to studies using biotransformation and bioaccumulation indices to estimate the effects of triazines on fish, changes in fish metabolism reflect the pollution of the environment by these herbicides. The responses of antioxidant defence systems in fish to triazine exposure could be an adaptive mechanism to protect the fish from triazine-induced oxidative stress. Acute exposure to triazines affects reproduction or reproductive development in fish; however, some triazines did not affect fish behavior during long-term exposure to low concentrations. Nevertheless, an impact on the overall behavioral response of fish cannot be excluded. ¬© 2014 Neuroendocrinology Letters.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: M.

For bioassays, putative cuticle-related genes from sea lice exposed to deltamethrin or azamethiphos were evaluated using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and RT-qPCR analysis. From the previously reported C. rogercresseyi transcriptome, a total of 479 transcripts were annotated as proteins linked to cuticle formation. RNA-Seq analysis evidenced high transcription levels of cuticle precursors during the larval stage, while in adults cuticle proteins were highly regulated. Furthermore, 234 transcripts were highly regulated in response to delousing drugs, such as cuticle proteins, P4H, PDI, and chitinase.

CBD has low affinity for cannabinoid neuroreceptors and agonistic properties to 5-HT receptors. An interaction between cannabinoid and purinergic receptor systems has been proposed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate CBD properties on memory behavioral and locomotor parameters and the effects of pre-treatment of adenosine receptor blockers on CBD impacts on memory using adult zebrafish. CBD (0.1, 0.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) was tested in the avoidance inhibitory paradigm and anxiety task. We analyzed the effect of a long-term caffeine pre-treatment (~ 20 mg/L - four months). Also, acute block of adenosine receptors was performed in co-administration with CBD exposure in the memory assessment. CBD promoted an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve in the anxiety task; in the memory assessment, CBD in the dose of 5 mg/Kg promoted the strongest effects without interfering with social and aggressive behavior. Caffeine treatment was able to prevent CBD (5 mg/kg) effects on memory when CBD was given after the training session. CBD effects on memory were partially prevented by co-treatment with a specific A2A adenosine receptor antagonist when given prior to or after the training session, while CBD effects after the training session were fully prevented by adenosine A1 receptor antagonist. These results indicated that zebrafish have responses to CBD anxiolytic properties that are comparable to other animal models, and high doses changed memory retention in a way dependent on adenosine. ¬© 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: R.S.

The overuse of synthetic insecticides to control mosquito vectors lead to resistance, adverse environmental effects and high operational costs. Therefore, the development of eco-friendly control tools is an important public health challenge. In this study, the mosquito larvicidal activity of Pinus kesiya leaf essential oil (EO) was evaluated against the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and the lymphatic filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The chemical composition of the EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. GC-MS revealed that the P. kesiya EO contained 18 compounds. Major constituents were alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, myrcene and germacrene D. In acute toxicity assays, the EO showed significant toxicity against early third-stage larvae of An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, with LC50 values of 52, 57, and 62 mu g/ml, respectively. Notably, the EO was safer towards several aquatic non-target organisms Anisops bouvieri, Diplonychus indicus and Gambusia affinis, with LC50 values ranging from 4135 to 8390 mu g/ml.

Yet, knowledge on biochemical outcomes of prenatal exposure in elasmobranchs is notably limited. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to contaminants in embryos of the critically endangered Brazilian guitarfish, Pseudobatos horkelii. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pharmaceuticals and per-sonal care products, and metals were determined in embryos. Additionally, glutathione S-transferase activity (GST), glutathione (GSH), and metallothionein levels (MT) were analyzed. Finally, lipid peroxidation levels (LPO) and protein carbonyl groups (PCO) were assessed. Embryonic exposure depended on yolk consumption, which was conspicuous in earlier development. We observed a dilution effect of contaminants levels, potentially related to biotransformation of these compounds throughout the embryonic development. Nevertheless, GST was not correlated to contaminant concentrations. The multivariate relationship between antioxidant components (GSH and GST) and LPO and PCO was negative, suggesting the lack of efficient defense of these biomarkers in early development, leading to oxidative damage. In this context, our results indicate that prenatal exposure to contaminants might impact the redox status in embryos of P. horkelii, leading to oxidative damage.

The effects of the herbicide oxyfluorfen on the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase were evaluated in freshwater fish Oreochromis niloticus. These were determined in tilapia liver exposed to sublethal concentrations (0.3 and 0.6 mg/L at 7, 14, and 21 days of exposure. This study also analyzed the effects of oxyfluorfen on the total fatty acid profile. The results showed that CAT activity was higher in tilapia exposed to oxyfluorfen at the sampling days, except at the highest concentration after 21 days. Similarly, the enhancing effect of the herbicide was observed on the GR activity. However, its effect was moderate at the highest dose. On the contrary, fish treated with oxyfluorfen at both doses displayed a decrease in the SOD activity. After 7 days of treatment at both concentrations tilapia showed a significant increase in GST levels, although the enzymatic activity decreased at 14 and 21 days of exposition when compared with the control. The major saturated fatty acids measured in tilapia liver were the palmitic acid (C16:0;17.9%) and stearic acid (C18:0; 8.7%). The exposure to oxyfluorfen caused a significant increase of the oleic acid (C18:1), whereas the amount of nervonic acid (C24:1) increased at all sampling data. The results of the present study should be taken in account when using tilapia as an environmental indicator species in studies of xenobiotic biotransformation and biomarker response, as well as in monitoring programmes.

In this context, the azole pesticides have earned special attention due to their cytochrome P450 aromatase inhibition potential. Cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19) catalyses the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into oestrone and oestradiol, respectively. Thus, aromatase modulates the oestrogenic balance essential not only for females, but also for male physiology, including gonadal function. Its inhibition affects reproductive organs, fertility and sexual behaviour in humans and wildlife species. Several studies have shown that azole pesticides are able to inhibit human and fish aromatases but the information on birds is lacking. Consequently, it appeared to be of interest to estimate the aromatase inhibition of azoles in three different avian species, namely Gallus gallus, Coturnix coturnix japonica and Taeniopygia guttata. In the absence of the crystal structure of the aromatase enzyme in these bird species, homology models for the individual avian species were constructed using the crystal structure of human aromatase (hAr) (pdb: 3EQM) that showed high sequence similarity for G. gallus (82.0%), T. guttata (81.9%) and C. japonica (81.2%). A homology model with Oncorhynchus mykiss (81.9%) was also designed for comparison purpose. The homology-modelled aromatase for each avian and fish species and crystal structure of human aromatase were selected for docking 46 structurally diverse azoles and related compounds. We showed that the docking behaviour of the chemicals on the different aromatases was broadly the same. We also demonstrated that there was an acceptable level of correlation between the binding score values and the available aromatase inhibition data. This means that the homology models derived on bird and fish species can be used to approximate the potential inhibitory effects of azoles on their aromatase.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  86,10.1080/1062936X.2015.1090749     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Homology modelling;aromatase;azole pesticides;human;bird;fish;endocrine disruptors;ACUTE ORAL TOXICITY;SEXUAL-DIFFERENTIATION;MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS;TERRITORIAL AGGRESSION;ESTROGEN SYNTHESIS;BRAIN AROMATASE;EXPOSURE;FUNGICIDES;LETROZOLE;FADROZOLE;Pesticides;Danazol;Aromatase,NA,NA,modelling inhibition of avian aromatase by azole pesticides

A series of 89 diverse environmental contaminants, including industrial chemicals, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, was tested and highly effective Mate7 interactors were identified in all of the aforementioned groups. Some of the inhibitors identified could be of environmental concern because they may potentially impair Mate7 efflux function, lowering the fish defence capacity against environmental contaminants, or interfering with transport of yet unidentified physiological substrates.

As a result, the ability to characterize dynamic hydrologic properties at adequate temporal and spatial scales has greatly improved. These advances have led to improved statistical and mechanistic modeling in monitoring of water quality trends at local, watershed and regional scales for freshwater, estuarine and marine ecosystems. In addition, they have greatly enhanced rapid (e.g., real-time) detection of hydrologic variability, recognized as a critical need for early warning systems and rapid response to harmful algal bloom events. Here, we present some of the landmark developments and technological achievements that led to the advent of real-time remote monitors for hydrologic properties.

A prospective study in a Faroese birth cohort documented subtle deficits of several functional domains at prenatal MeHg exposure levels previously thought to be safe. Recent additional studies also showed neurobehavioral deficits associated with exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with concomitant MeHg poisoning. In contrast, a prospective study in the Seychelles did not detect a similar association between MeHg exposure and neurodevelopmental deficits; children of the highest MeHg exposure group showed better scores in some developmental tests than those of the lower exposure groups for both prenatal and postnatal MeHg exposures. This paradoxical difference between both studies is summarized herein. The primary source of human exposure to MeHg is fish. Since a considerable number of pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides, are also present in fish, and since some organochemical substances including PCBs are also well documented to be neurotoxic to the developing brain from epidemiological studies, the combined effects of these pollutants should be considered in discussing the neurotoxicity of MeHg.

However, little information is available especially regarding the characteristics and influencing factors of breeding sites of An. sinensis in Yongcheng City, a representative region of unstable malaria transmission in the Huang-Huai River region of central China. The aims of this study were to determine the breeding site characteristics of An. sinensis and related environmental and physicochemical parameters, to find out which breeding site characteristics could best explain the presence of An. sinensis larvae, and to determine whether the breeding habit of An. sinensis has changed or not.        Methods: Random repeated cross sectional study was undertaken in six villages of the Yongcheng city characterized by different levels of the historical incidence of P. vivax malaria. The potential breeding sites of An. sinensis larvae in each village were examined twice per month both in the household courtyards and the village surroundings. The larval sampling was done by the standard dipping method. Some important breeding site characterizations were recorded and characterized. The anopheline mosquito larvae and emerged adults were identified to the species level morphologically and to sub-species by the ribosomal DNA PCR technique. Chi-square analysis and logistic regression analysis were applied to determine the importance of factors for explaining the presence or absence of An. sinensis larvae.        Results: According to the ribosomal DNA PCR assay, all sampled anopheline mosquito larvae and emerged adults belonged to An. sinensis. Only 3 containers that were sampled from the household courtyards were found to contain An. sinensis larvae. There were no differences in the species composition of mosquito larvae among containers that contained water in the household courtyards (P > 0.05). An. sinensis larvae were shown to be present in a total of 60 breeding sites in the village surroundings, this included 8 (13.3%) river fringes, 26 (43.3%) ponds, 23 (38.3%) puddles, and 3 (5.0%) irrigation/drainage ditches. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the breeding site type, water depth, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen, and sulphate were found to be the key factors determining the presence of An. sinensis larvae. Approximately 94.9% of An. sinensis larvae inhabited relatively large and medium-sized water bodies, with depths between 0.5 m and 1.0 m (73.3%), COD lower than 2 mg/L (75%), ammonia nitrogen lower than 0.4 mg/L (86.7%), and sulphate lower than 150 mg/L (58.3%), respectively.        Conclusion: These results indicate that the majority of An. sinensis larval breeding sites were relatively large and medium-sized water bodies with depths between 0.5 m and 1.0 m, and containing low levels of COD, ammonia nitrogen, and sulphate, respectively. For effective An. sinensis larval control, the type of breeding site, water depth, COD, ammonia nitrogen, and sulphate should be given higher priority over other factors in areas where it is the primary vector.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  32     Total Times Cited:  37     Cited Reference Count:  75,10.1186/1756-3305-5-58     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Breeding site;Characterization;Mosquito;Anopheles vectors;Ecology;Malaria elimination;WESTERN KENYA HIGHLANDS;SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION;MOSQUITO LARVAE;MALARIA CONTROL;HABITAT CHARACTERIZATION;DIPTERA-CULICIDAE;PLASMODIUM-VIVAX;CLIMATE-CHANGE;INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE;GAMBIAE COMPLEX;Cesarean Section;Breeding;Cross-Sectional Studies;China;Taiwan,NA,NA,random repeated cross sectional study on breeding site characterization of <i>anopheles sinensis<i> larvae in distinct villages of yongcheng city peoples republic of china
rayyan-1227193180,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triadimenol,2008,10,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,10,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Triadimenol is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triadimenol in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 29 May 2006. The peer review was initiated on 30 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer Crop Science AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the attached list of endpoints.        Since clarification is required with respect to certain impurities, the specification for the technical material as a whole should be regarded as provisional for the moment.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Bayfidan EC 250"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 250 g/L triadimenol and ""Baytan FS 094"" a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) containing 75 g/L triadimenol, 9 g/L fuberidazole and 10 g/L imazalil.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor triadimenol residues in food/feed of plant origin, soil, water and air.        In mammals, triadimenol is harmful to rats via the oral route (R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" proposed); it is not acutely toxic via the dermal and inhalation routes, nor is a skin or eye irritant; it is not a skin sensitiser. In repeated dose studies liver is the target, with enlargement of the liver and related clinical chemistry changes. The relevant short term toxicity NOAELs are 9 and 15 mg/kg bw/day, in rats and dogs, respectively, whereas the relevant long term toxicity and carcinogenicity NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day. Triadimenol does not have genotoxic and carcinogenic potential. The relevant parental and reproductive NOAEL in multigeneration studies is 6 mg/kg bw/day, and the relevant offspring NOAEL 9 mg/kg bw/day. Reduced pup survival in the multigeneration study during lactation period was noted. Furthermore, a decrease in fertility index was noted in all matings (all generations) in one study, possibly linked to the aromatase inhibition seen in an in vitro study. Therefore R64 ""May cause harm to breastfed babies"" and R62 ""Possible risk of impaired fertility"" were considered as appropriate (to be confirmed by EChA). As for developmental toxicity, in several rat developmental toxicity studies inconsistent effects which could be considered adverse were found (e.g. cervical and lumbar extra ribs). Placental weight was increased in the rats indicating that the substance might be an endocrine disruptor. A range of skeletal findings was seen at slight maternal toxic dose levels. R63? ""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed for consideration by EChA. Relevant maternal NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day and 25 mg/kg bw/day in rat and rabbit, respectively, and relevant developmental toxicity NOAEL is 15 mg/kg bw/day and 40 mg/kg bw/day (rat and rabbit). Based on similar neurotoxic potential of triadimenol and triadimefon2, data from the latter were used, showing a NOAEL of 2 mg/kg bw for acute exposure (reversible hyperactivity and increased motor and locomotor activity in rats, no neuropathological changes), and a subchronic NOAEL of 3.4 mg/kg bw/day. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.05 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.05 mg/kg bw (based on an overall NOAEL of 5 mg/kg bw/day, SF 100). The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure to the EC and the FS formulations is below the AOEL even without the use of PPE.        The metabolism of triadimenol in plant was investigated following foliar applications on grapes, cereals and sugar beet and seed treatment on cereals. After foliar or seed treatments triadimenol was found to be the major compound in grapes, cereal grains and straw and sugar beet leaves and roots, accounting for 23 to 73% of the TRR. Hexose conjugate of the parent and the hydroxy metabolite M103 as free or conjugated were also detected in levels above 10%. Together these metabolites are present in amounts similar to or lower than the parent. Triazole Derivative Metabolites (TDMs) were also detected in cereal grains and straw following seed treatment and in cereals sown as rotational crops. Considering the significant proportion of the parent compound in the different plant parts investigated, the residue definition for monitoring was limited to triadimenol. For risk assessment, it was proposed to include in the residue definition the parent triadimenol, the metabolite M10 and their conjugates. Taking into account the proportions of the parent and of the metabolites, a conversion factor of 2 was proposed for the risk assessment for cereals only.        Concerning the TDMs, the meeting of experts was of the opinion not to include these metabolites in the triadimenol residue definitions since TDMs are not specific to triadimenol and there is currently no EU approach on how to consider these common triazole metabolites in the risk assessment. A separate residue definition has to be set and a separate risk assessment has to be performed for TDMs taking into account all the active substances of the triazole chemical class. This issue should be reconsidered when a general approach on triazole compounds and their triazole derivative metabolites is defined.        Supervised residue trials on grapes and cereals have been submitted. Residues were analysed for triadimenol only and no information was provided on the possible residue levels of the hydroxy metabolite M10 or the TDMs. Sufficient data were provided to propose a Maximum Residue Level (MRL) on wine and table grapes. On cereals, a provisional MRL was proposed for barley and oat only, awaiting additional residue data on barley in southern EU and in northern and southern EU for wheat. Triadimenol was stable under standard hydrolytic conditions and processing studies on grape showed a limited transfer of residues to wine. The submitted rotational crop studies, not performed in compliance with the requested standards, indicated that residues of the parent compound and its triazole derivative metabolites may be expected to be above the limit of quantification (LOQ). The experts' meeting was of the opinion that a new field study on rotational crops conforming to the current guidelines is required, where crops should be analysed for triadimenol and TDMs residues. Moreover, the residue situation in rotational crops should be reconsidered with regard to a global approach on TDMs.        Metabolism studies in goats and hens were carried out with the active substance triadimefon. Nevertheless and given that the major metabolic pathway of triadimefon in animals consists as a first step in producing triadimenol, these studies were considered as fully acceptable for the understanding of the triadimenol metabolism in animals The metabolism of triadimenol in livestock is extensive and proceeds mainly via oxidation of the tertiary butyl group to the hydroxy metabolite M10 and the carboxy metabolite M024, both being subjected to conjugation with sulphate or glucuronic acid respectively. In hens, an additional pathway consisting of desmethylation was identified. The meeting of experts concluded that triadimenol could not be a valid marker for animal products since it was observed in significant levels in ruminant liver and in poultry fat and eggs only. Therefore, the animal residue definition for risk assessment was proposed as triadimenol plus metabolite M10 and M02 and their conjugates and metabolite M28(5). For monitoring the residue definition was proposed as triadimenol plus metabolite M10 and their conjugates and metabolite M28. Considering the limited transfer observed in the animal feeding studies and the low potential exposure to triadimenol residues through the consumption of treated food items (cereals), the meeting was of the opinion that there is no need to set MRLs for products of animal origin at this stage.        As for plants, the possible inclusion of the TDMs in the animal residue definition has been discussed. It was concluded that no significant TDMs residues resulting from the direct intake of triadimefon/triadimenol are expected in products of animal origin. Nevertheless the animal dietary burden should also take into account the additional exposure arising from TDMs residues present in feeding commodities from both, primary and rotational crops (especially in cereal straw and cereal grains). As for plants, this issue will need to be reconsidered at a later stage when a global EU approach on TDMs is defined.        The consumer risk assessment has been performed through the residues of triadimenol only and according to the residue definition proposed for plants. The contribution of the TDMs residues in primary crops, rotational crops and products of animal origin resulting from the use of triadimenol has not been evaluated and not been taken into account in the consumer risk assessment awaiting the definition of a global EU approach concerning these metabolites which are common to all active substances of the triazole chemical class. Taking into account the above considerations, the chronic and acute consumer exposures performed using the EFSA model and the proposed MRLs for cereals and grape were found to be less than 3% of the ADI and 27% of the ARfD.        In soil under aerobic conditions triadimenol exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the soil metabolite M046 (accounting for up to 8.2% of applied radioactivity (AR) in a lysimeter study) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of the triazole ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 3.8-41% AR after 100 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 4.5-22.3 % AR after 100 days. Triadimenol exhibits low to very high mobility in soil, M04 exhibits high to very high mobility in soil. It was concluded that it was unlikely that adsorption of triadimenol was pH dependent. The adsorption of M04 was not pH dependent.        In dark laboratory natural sediment water systems triadimenol exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 3.7 % AR after 13 weeks. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were performed for triadimenol (up to FOCUS step 3 calculations) and for M04 (with appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations). These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by triadimenol and 1,2,4triazole above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all the FOCUS groundwater scenarios relevant to the intended uses applied for. The atmospheric half life estimated for triadimenol (2.5 hours) gives an indication that it has not the potential to be subject to long range transport to areas where it has not been used, via the atmosphere.        Whereas the acute and short-term risk to birds from spray use in cereals indicated a low risk at Tier 1, the long-term assessment required further refinements. Use of field residue data, PD refinements and focal species in a refined assessment, indicated a low risk for large herbivorous birds. Further refinements were however required to identify a low risk to skylark feeding on insects. For vine use (spray application) the risk assessment indicated a low risk to birds, except for the long-term risk to insectivorous birds in South Europe. Refinements of PT with Chaffinch, Blue tit and Robin as focal species were derived from UK orchard studies. It was concluded in the meeting of experts that further data were required to support the use of UK orchard data to refine the long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds in South Europe. For seed treatment use a low acute risk was identified for birds. The short-term risk assessment required further refinements. The meeting of experts did not accept the PT refinements suggested for yellowhammer, wood pigeon and skylark as focal species, and further data to substantiate the refinements were required. The long-term risk to birds was considered to be negligible, due to lack of exposure in the breeding season. EFSA however, noted that the breeding season for birds may extend into the season for use of triadimenol as a seed treatment in South Europe.        The acute risk assessment for small herbivorous and insectivorous mammals indicated a low risk for spray use in cereals. Low risk was also identified for small herbivorous mammals in the long-term assessment, after refinement of residue data. For spray use in vine the acute risk was considered as low for both North Europe and South Europe. The long-term risk assessment for both North Europe and South Europe required further refinements of interception, dissipation rate and TWA concentration in ground vegetation before a low risk was identified. For seed treatment uses, the acute risk to mammals was concluded to be low after refinement of PD. The long-term risk assessment, however, needed to be refined further. No exposure to contaminated drinking water was expected and the risk from secondary poisoning was considered to be low. The potential endocrine disrupting effects on birds may require further assessment.        Triadimenol should be classified as R51/53 ""Toxic to aquatic organisms, may cause long term adverse effects in the aquatic environment."" and the risk assessment for aquatic organisms indicated a low risk for all uses, based on FOCUS PECsw estimations up to Step 3. The risk to aquatic organisms from triadimenol metabolites was found to be low, as was the potential for bioaccumulation of triadimenol and its metabolites. The potential for endocrine effects on fish was not assessed in the DAR, as no relevant studies were available. A fish early life study (ELS) and a fish screening assay (FSA) were carried out by the applicant during the peer-review process to address potential endocrine effects. However they were not eligible for submission in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007.        The risk assessment for bees indicated a low risk for all uses. As triadimenol is systemic, the risk assessment for seed treatment use was based on the assumption that the concentration in the honey dew would correspond to the concentration in the plant.        The risk to non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro and macro organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.        No studies using the formulated products Baytan FS 094 for seed treatment were available. In consequence the risk to non-target organisms from the use of Baytan FS 094 could not be concluded since this product, besides triadimenol, also contains fuberidazole and imazalil.

The liver is the detoxification organ of the body and TMT exposure accumulates in the liver. Tea polyphenol (TP) is a natural antioxidant extracted from tea leaves and has been widely used as a food and feed additive. To investigate the mechanism of toxicity caused by TMT exposure on grass carp hepatocytes (L8824 cells) and the mitigating effect of TP, we established a hepatocyte model of TMT toxicity and/or TP treatment. L8824 cells were treated with 0.5 mu M of TMT and/or 4 mu g/mL of TP for 24 h and assayed for relevant indices. The results showed that TMT exposure caused oxidative stress, resulting in increased intracellular ROS content, resulting in intracellular ROS accumulation and increased MDA content, and inhibiting the activities of T-AOC, SOD, CAT, and GSH. Meanwhile, TMT exposure activated the endoplasmic reticulum apoptotic signaling pathway, resulting in abnormal expression of GRP78, ATF-6, IRE1, PERK, Caspase3 and Caspase-12. In addition, TMT exposure also led to up-regulation of cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and decreased expression of IL-2, IFN-gamma, and antimicrobial peptides Hepcidin, beta-defensin, and LEAP2. However, the addition of TP could mitigate the above changes. In conclusion, TP can alleviate TMT exposure-mediated hepatotoxicity by inhibiting ROS/ER stress in L8824 cells.

In this work, we generated mutants of V. anguillarum defective in FrpA and analyzed their ability to use piscibactin as iron source. The results showed that inactivation of frpA completely disables piscibactin utilization, and the original phenotype could be restored by gene complementation, confirming that FrpA is the OMT that mediates ferri-Pcb uptake. Additionally, the ability of several Pcb thiazole analogues, with different configurations at positions 9, 10, and 13, to be internalized through FrpA, was evaluated measuring their ability to promote growth under iron deficiency of several indicator strains. The results showed that while those analogues with a thiazole ring maintain almost the same activity as Pcb, the maintenance of the hydroxyl group present in natural piscibactin configuration at position C-13 is crucial for Fe3+ chelation and, in consequence, for the recognition of the ferri-siderophore by the cognate OMT. All these findings allowed us to propose a Pcb analogue as a good candidate to vectorize antimicrobial compounds, through the Trojan horse strategy, to develop novel compounds against bacterial fish diseases.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  34,10.1007/s00775-021-01916-1,Vibrio anguillarum;Photobacteriumdamselae subsp;piscicida;Siderophores;Piscibactin;Fe(III)-siderophore transporter;DAMSELAE SUBSP PISCICIDA;SIDEROPHORE BIOSYNTHESIS;FISH,NA,NA,frpa is the outer membrane piscibactin transporter in <i>vibrio anguillarum<i> structural elements in synthetic piscibactin analogues required for transport

In particular, by combining analysis of gut microbiota and metabolites, we noticed acetate, a key metabolite, which decreased sharply after exposure to high concentration of CPZ. Expectedly, after supplementing with Bifidobacterium (a core bacterium that produces acetate), we noticed that the acetate content was quickly restored. Further, we also verified that the increase in acetate content after Bifidobacterium supplementation at least partially promoted IL-22 secretion, which in turn stimulated the secretion of beta-defensins (zfbd-1, zfbd-2, zfbd-3), thereby repairing the intestinal damage.

In our previous study, we found that neburon has strong aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist activity, but whether it causes reproductive toxicity is not clear. In the present study, zebrafish were conducted as a model organism to evaluate whether environmental concentrations of neburon (0.1, 1 and 10 pg/L) induce reproductive disorder in males. After exposure to neburon for 150 days from embryo to adult, that the average spawning egg number in high concentration group was 106.40, which was significantly lower than 193.00 in control group. This result was mainly due to the abnormal male reproductive behavior caused by abnormal transcription of genes associated with reproductive behavior in the brain, such as secretogranin-2a. The proportions of spermatozoa in the medium and high concentration groups were 82.40% and 83.84%, respectively, which were significantly lower than 89.45% in control group. This result was mainly caused by hormonal disturbances and an increased proportion of apoptotic cells. The hormonal disruption was due to the significant changes in the transcription levels of key genes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis following neburon treatment. Neburon treatment also significantly activated the AhR signaling pathway, causing oxidative stress damage and eventually leading to a significant increase in apoptosis in the exposed group. Together, these data filled the currently more vacant profile of neburon toxicity and might provide information to assess the ecotoxicity of neburon on male reproduction at environmentally relevant concentrations.

Due to rise in resistance against existing pesticides, development of novel drugs or vaccines is necessary. Posttranscriptional gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi), when established in a high throughput system is a potential method for evaluation of molecular targets for new medical compounds or vaccine antigens. Successful use of RNAi has been reported in several stages of salmon lice. However, when we employed a previously described protocol for planktonic stages, no reproducible down-regulation of target genes was gained. In the present study, we describe a robust method for RNAi, where nauplius larvae are soaked in seawater added double stranded RNA (dsRNA). In order to test for when dsRNA may be introduced, and for the efficacy and duration of RNAi, we performed a series of experiments on accurately age determined larvae, ranging from the hatching egg to the copepodid with a salmon louse coatomer and a putative prostaglandin E synthase gene. Presumptive knock-down was monitored by real time PCR. Significant gene silencing was obtained only when nauplius I larvae were exposed to dsRNA during the period in which they molted to nauplius II. A knock down effect could be detected 2 days after soaking, and it remained stable until the last measurement, on day 12. Soaking nauplius I larvae, knock-down was verified for six additional genes with a putative role in molting. For one chitinase, a loss-of-function phenotype with abnormal swimming was obtained. Hence, RNAi, induced in the nauplius, may facilitate studies of the molecular biology of the louse, such as the function of specific genes in developmental processes and physiology, host recognition, host-parasite interaction, and, in extension, the engineering of novel medicines.

In this study, we synthesized a derived peptide, TroHepc2-22, from the mature peptide of T. ovatus hepcidin2. Our results showed that TroHepc2-22 has superior antibacterial abilities against both Gram-negative (Vibrio harveyi and Edwardsiella piscicida) and Grampositive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae) bacteria. Based on the results of a bacterial membrane depolarization assay and propidium iodide (PI) staining assay in vitro, TroHepc2-22 displayed antimicrobial activity by inducing the bacterial membrane depolarization and changing the bacterial membrane permeability. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) visualization illustrated that TroHepc2-22 brought about membrane rupturing and the leakage of the cytoplasm for the bacteria. In addition, TroHepc2-22 was verified to have hydrolytic activity on bacterial genomic DNA in view of the results of the gel retardation assay. In terms of the in vivo assay, the bacterial loads of V. harveyi in the tested immune tissues (liver, spleen, and head kidney) were significantly reduced in T. ovatus, revealing that TroHepc2-22 significantly enhanced the resistance against V. harveyi infection. Furthermore, the expressions of immune-related genes, including tumor necrosis factor-ff (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 1-beta (IL-beta b), IL-6, Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1), and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) were significantly increased, indicating that TroHepc2-22 might regulate inflammatory cytokines and activate immune-related signaling pathways.

However, neurobehavioral effects associated with exposure have not been characterized in detail. We investigated the behavioral effects of FM 550 in zebrafish to facilitate the integration of the cellular and molecular effects of FM 550 with its behavioral consequences. The effects of developmental FM 550 exposure on zebrafish larvae swimming shortly after the end of exposure as well as the persisting effects of this exposure on adolescent behavior were studied. In addition, the acute effects of FM 550 on behavior with exposure during adolescence in zebrafish were studied. Methods: Developmental exposure to 0, 0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion spanned 0-5 days post fertilization, with larval testing on day 6 and adolescent testing on days 40-45. Acute adolescent (45 dpf) exposure was to 0, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion, for 24 h, with testing 2 h or 1 week later. The vehicle condition was colony tank water with .0004% (developmental) or .0012% (adolescent) DMSO. Zebrafish behavior was characterized across several domains including learning, social affiliation, sensorimotor function, predator escape, and novel environment exploration. Results: Persisting effects of developmental FM 550 exposure included a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in social behavior among all dose groups. Acute FM 550 exposure during adolescence caused hypoactivity and reduced social behavior (p's < 0.05) when the fish were tested 2 h after exposure. These effects were attenuated at the 1 week post exposure testing point. Discussion: Taken together, these data indicate that FM 550 may cause persisting neurobehavioral alterations to social behavior in the absence of perturbations along other behavioral domains and that developmental exposure is more costly to the organism than acute adolescent exposure. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 31; Correspondence Address: E.D.

We examined the effects of brown trout removal using rotenone on zooplankton and phytoplankton community composition in the Upper Karori Reservoir, New Zealand. Significant shifts were observed in zooplankton and phytoplankton composition following removal of brown trout from the reservoir. Shifts in zooplankton community composition did not occur immediately following trout removal (February), but instead followed the likely timing of galaxiid spawning (July). The removal of brown trout likely resulted in reduced predation pressure on galaxiids. A major change occurred in the zooplankton community with the dominance shifting from larger crustaceans to smaller rotifers, indicating an increased predation pressure from the larval native galaxiid. A delayed response in zooplankton community composition change indicates rotenone was not the direct cause of this. A major shift in phytoplankton community composition occurred immediately following trout removal. This was not consistent with the trophic cascade hypothesis of reduced grazing pressure from larger zooplankton due to increased galaxiid predation as a result of brown trout removal. ¬© 2015 The Royal Society of New Zealand.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: I.C.

Pesticides are important chemicals recurrently applied for enhancing crop yields in agriculture and also for amelioration of vector-borne diseases. Rampant use of these chemicals has led to serious health implications to man and his environment. In developing nations (like India), 76 % of the total pesticide used is harmful insecticide as against just 44 % in the developed countries. This difference in the pesticide usage pattern evidently affects the total cost-benefit ratio between these nations. It is commonly believed by the general public that ‚Äòif little is good, a lot more will be better‚Äô. This unchecked and unwise use of pesticides leads to deposition of 95 % of pesticides in soil, water and atmosphere as well as in nontarget organisms. Consequently, pesticide residues have been found in raw as well as processed fruits and vegetables. Pesticides not only kill insects and weeds but also are toxic to a variety of other nontarget organisms like birds, fish, beneficial insects and plants. Soil microflora has also been adversely affected by treatment of soil with pesticides. Xenobiotics, such as pesticides, trigger a defence response in plants. The mechanism by which pesticide is perceived and the signalling is transmitted within plant cells still remains elusive. Various xenobiotics induce oxidative stress and often activate cell signalling pathways, leading to production of stress proteins and upregulation of antioxidants. These changes include the evolution of new metabolic pathways, generation/accumulation of low molecular weight metabolites, synthesis of special proteins, detoxification mechanisms and reduction/elevation in phytohormone levels. Comparison of metabolic pathways, detoxification mechanisms and variance in tolerance level of different plants to pesticides can aid us in designing efficient and cheap vegetative treatment systems for decontaminating soil and water containing pesticide residues. Thus, understanding metabolism of pesticides in plants is necessary for developing strategies for amelioration of their harmful effects in nontarget organisms and also for remediation of contaminated soil, water and atmosphere. ¬© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2016.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: S.M.

Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russian Federation""]","One of the most important breakthroughs in the history of genetics and plant breeding was the development of plant cytology and experimental mutagenesis, which later brought about plant cytogenetics and mutation breeding and now they have entered in functional biology era with the unprecedented development of plant molecular cytogenetics, genetics, and functional genomics. Application of cell biology particularly chromosome biology in the fields of plant genome structure and function has ushered the development of plant cytogenomics. Development of advanced technology like DNA base-specific fluorescence banding, GISH, and FISH-based chromosome painting has greatly facilitated the identification, localization, and mapping of chromosome-specific markers in plants, which is of high importance in plant molecular systematics, species identification, detection of hybrid nature, alien chromosomes and chromosomal aberrations, analysis of somaclonal variations, and diversity analysis. The dynamism of chromatin architecture and cell cycle, representing chromosome functional biology, is another important part of plant cytogenomics. On the other hand, mutagenomics is defined as applied mutation breeding, in which genomic information and tools are utilized in the designing of breeding strategies, screening, selection and verification/authentication of natural and induced mutants, and the utilization of desirable mutations in the breeding processes. Considerable progress has been made in recent times in breeding of cereals, legumes, oil seeds, vegetables, horticultural crops, spices and condiments, fiber-yielding plants, and medicinal and aromatic plants for diverse types of desirable agronomic and functional traits including disease and abiotic stress resistance/tolerance; herbicide resistance; lowering of anti-nutritional factors; enhancement of proteins, minerals, vitamins, essential amino acids, flavonoids, antioxidants, and dietary fibers; enrichment of soil nutrition; enhancement of ornamental, medicinal, and aromatic values; and development of functional and therapeutic foods and other diverse traits related to nutritional quality and high yield. This can be found in a mutant population which carries variant forms of potentially each and every gene present in a particular genome. The functionality of mutagenomics is greatly enhanced due to integration of classical mutagenesis with modern ‚Äúomics‚Äù technology through the development of desirable diploid mutants, recombinant inbred lines, and aneuploid and polyploid lines as effective cytogenetic tools, utilizable in genome mapping and analysis. Functional sets of aneuploid tools are now available in different edible plants, through which several morphological, biochemical, and molecular traits/markers have been assigned on definite chromosomes to construct linkage maps. Recently, induced mutations showing alterations in antioxidant defense response have been identified and tested against diverse types of abiotic stresses to reveal intrinsic cellular and metabolic events toward sensitivity of seed plants to salinity, drought, metal toxicity, and other stresses. These mutations are giving vital inputs, which can be used in formulating effective breeding strategies in different agroclimatic conditions. Mutagenized population has revealed altered pattern of genome response and can also be exploited in enhancing production of natural plant products like antioxidants and flavonoids. Furthermore, these large mutant populations have the potential in reverse genetics approach by employing various techniques, particularly ‚ÄúTargeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomics (TILLING)‚Äù technology to better understand gene functions through high-throughput mutation screening, and have been successfully used in major crop plants along with model plant Arabidopsis.

The growth curves of nematodes were similar to those of controls, suggesting that sesamin did not induce prolongevity effects through dietary restriction. Notably, sesamin made the worms more resistant to infection by Legionella pneumophila and more resistant to oxidative stressors such as paraquat and hydrogen peroxide and prolonged the lifespan of a mev-1 mutant that produces abundant superoxide anions. However, the accumulation of protein carbonyls and lipofuscin was similar in sesamin-exposed and control worms, suggesting that sesamin is unlikely to work simply as an antioxidant. Sesamin supplementation failed to extend the lifespan of loss-of-function mutants of daf-2, daf-16, pmk-1, and skn-1.; Conclusions: Sesamin enhances the host defense of C. elegans and increases the average lifespan via activation of both skn-1 (encoding a component of the p38 MAPK pathway) and daf-16 (encoding a component of the IGF-1 pathway).; Purpose: Nutritional control has been proposed as a potential therapy for slowing the senescence of immune function and decreasing mortality. This study investigated whether sesamin could modify host defense systems and extend the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.; Methods: Nematodes were fed standard food (the bacterium Escherichia coli strain OP50) supplemented with various doses of sesamin/Œ≥-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds starting from young adulthood. The mean lifespan, muscle function, lipofuscin accumulation, protein carbonyl content, and stress resistance of the worms were examined. Then, C. elegans mutants harboring loss-of-function lesions in longevity- and host defense-related signaling pathways were supplemented with sesamin to identify the genes involved in the longevity effects. ¬© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 30; CODEN: EJNUF,10.1007/s00394-014-0671-6,"Aging;Host defense;Longevity;Nematodes;Sesamin;Administration, Oral;Animals;Antioxidants;Caenorhabditis elegans;Dioxoles;Escherichia coli;gamma-Cyclodextrins;Insulin-Like Growth Factor I;Legionella pneumophila;Lignans;Oxidative Stress;p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases;Protein Carbonylation;Salmonella enterica;Signal Transduction;Animalia;Bacteria (microorganisms);Nematoda;1,3 dioxolane derivative;antioxidant;gamma cyclodextrin derivative;gamma-cyclodextrin;lignan;mitogen activated protein kinase p38;sesamin;somatomedin C;animal;drug effects;genetics;longevity;metabolism;oral drug administration;oxidative stress;physiology;protein carbonylation;signal transduction",NA,NA,influence of oral supplementation with sesamin on longevity of caenorhabditis elegans and the host defense

Some strains have proven effective as biological control agents and plant-growth promoters, while other strains have been implicated in diseases of a broad range of plant hosts and humans. By analysing the pan-genome of eight sequenced P. ananatis strains isolated from different sources we identified factors potentially underlying its ability to colonize and interact with hosts in both the plant and animal Kingdoms.Results: The pan-genome of the eight compared P. ananatis strains consisted of a core genome comprised of 3,876 protein coding sequences (CDSs) and a sizeable accessory genome consisting of 1,690 CDSs. We estimate that ~106 unique CDSs would be added to the pan-genome with each additional P. ananatis genome sequenced in the future. The accessory fraction is derived mainly from integrated prophages and codes mostly for proteins of unknown function. Comparison of the translated CDSs on the P. ananatis pan-genome with the proteins encoded on all sequenced bacterial genomes currently available revealed that P. ananatis carries a number of CDSs with orthologs restricted to bacteria associated with distinct hosts, namely plant-, animal- and insect-associated bacteria. These CDSs encode proteins with putative roles in transport and metabolism of carbohydrate and amino acid substrates, adherence to host tissues, protection against plant and animal defense mechanisms and the biosynthesis of potential pathogenicity determinants including insecticidal peptides, phytotoxins and type VI secretion system effectors.Conclusions: P. ananatis has an 'open' pan-genome typical of bacterial species that colonize several different environments. The pan-genome incorporates a large number of genes encoding proteins that may enable P. ananatis to colonize, persist in and potentially cause disease symptoms in a wide range of plant and animal hosts. ¬© 2014 De Maayer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 91; Correspondence Address: P.

Propagation was based on stripping of spawners after hormonal induction and rearing of fry in artificial ponds. Fish were injected with acetone-dried carp pituitary extract at a dose of 4.0 mg/kg homogenized in a fish physiological saline. When ovulation was detected, the eggs were stripped and weighed. Eggs were collected from each ovulated female and fertilized with milt from the male. Stickiness of zander eggs was removed before transferring them into Zuger jars. Data collected from four consecutive spawning seasons were analyzed statistically calculating individual and group-based pseudogonadosomatic index (PGSI) values. Reproduction capacity assays were grouped on the basis of three aspects: (1) examination of differences between years, (2) within a reproductive season, and (3) examination of the effects of females‚Äô size. During the four-year trial period eggs were gained from 121 hormonally treated females, 64.7% of the total 187. Based on the data of the investigated period the mean PGSI was 10.7%. At 95% significance level PGSI data of different years were considered to be similar. There were no significant differences between PGSI data collected from different periods of the reproductive season. Previous findings on the positive correlation between the amount of stripped eggs and body weight of females were confirmed (r2=0.103). Correlation was not justified between PGSI and body weight (r2=0.002). Advanced rearing of zander fry in a 2.0 hectare pond was carried out in six consecutive years. Before stocking the nutrient level of the pond was increased by organic manuring and the Copepods were eliminated by insecticides. To prevent cannibalism, four weeks after stocking the advanced fry of zander were harvested. On the basis of the results from six consecutive years, after rearing of advanced fry in a shallow, 2.0 hectare rearing pond for four weeks, the mean survival rate was 13.4 ¬± 4.37% (mean¬±SD). By considering our results, breeders can calculate their hatchery's and pond‚Äôs production in advance. These results will also be helpful in calculating the total weight of broodstock which must be held in order to produce a specific number of advanced fry. ¬© Published by Central Fisheries Research Institute (CFRI) Trabzon, Turkey.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: T.

Pollutants can affect chemical communication at several levels: production, detection and transmission, and behavioral responses to odors. Several studies using electrophysiological techniques (i.e., EOG and EEG) have demonstrated disturbances in the function of the olfactory receptor cells. In the majority of these studies, the olfactory epithelium was exposed to organic pesticides or heavy metal ions followed by olfactory stimulation with amino acids. Several pesticides and metals decreased electrical responses of the olfactory receptor cells. Another set of studies has addressed effects of pollutants on olfactory-mediated behaviors, and many of these have found effects on social behaviors. Examples also exist of the effects of pollutants on the transmission of odors and resulting effects on behavior responses to alarm cues, conspecific juvenile attractants, and endocrine priming pheromones. Although many fish are dependent on an intact olfactory sense to mediate social interactions, reproduce, detect predators, migrate, and find food, our knowledge of the effects of pollutants is unfortunately very limited. ¬© 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 5,10.1002/9781118794739.ch10,Behavioral effects;Copper;Cue chemistry;Endocrine disrupting chemicals;Endocrine responsiveness;Manufactured humic acids;Organic pesticides;PH;Receptor sensitivity;Cues,NA,NA,effects of pollutants on olfactory detection and responses to chemical cues including pheromones in fish

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the introduced fish species Gambusia affinis as a bioindicator of environmental pollution in the middle-lower basin of the Suqu√≠a River. The assessment was performed by measuring biomarkers at different levels of biological organization, at two sampling sites (before and after C√≥rdoba city), and at dry and wet seasons. Water quality evaluation was made through a water-quality index (based on physico-chemical parameters), heavy-metals and pesticides concentrations in water. The water quality varied between sampling sites, showing the most degraded conditions downstream C√≥rdoba city. The same pattern of variation was detected in the biomarkers studied, mainly in: gill and liver histopathological indexes, copulatory organ (gonopodium) morphology and vitellogenin expression in males and females. The present study characterized the environmental conditions in the middle-lower basin of the Suqu√≠a River and revealed the low freshwater quality at the most polluted site. Although G. affinis is an introduced species, it could be considered a good sentinel of water resource quality of invaded Neotropical basins. Our results demonstrated the importance of addressing the environmental quality monitoring through an integrated analysis of water quality parameters together with histological, morphological and molecular parameters. Thus, our study provides a good model for application in other basins of South America. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Yemen is still in the control phase without sustainable reduction in the proportion of malaria cases. A cross-sectional household survey was carried out in different districts in the southeast of the country to determine malaria prevalence and identify factors that impede progress of the elimination phase.; Methods. Blood specimens were collected from 735 individuals aged 1-66 years. Plasmodium species were detected and identified by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears. A household-based questionnaire was used to collect demographic, socioeconomic and environmental data.; Results: The overall prevalence of malaria was 18.8% with Plasmodium falciparum as the predominant species (99.3%), with a low rate of Plasmodium vivax detected (0.7%). The infection rate was higher in Al-Raydah and Qusyer districts (21.8%) compared to Hajer district (11.8%). Fifty-two percent of the persons positive for Plasmodium were asymptomatic with low parasite density. The adults had a higher infection rate as compared to children. Univariate analysis identified those whose household's head are fishermen (OR = 11.3, 95% CI: 3.13 - 40.5) and farmers (OR = 4.84, 95% CI: 1.73 - 13.6) as high-risk groups. A higher number of positive smears were observed in people living in houses with uncemented brick walls (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.32 - 3.30), without access to toilets (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.05 - 2.32), without a fridge (OR = 1. 6, 95% CI: 1.05 - 2.30), or without TV (OR = 1. 6, (95% CI: 1.05 - 2.30). People living in houses with water collection points located less than 200 meters away were also at higher risk of acquiring malaria (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.05 - 2.30). Knowledge about the importance of using insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) for prevention of malaria was 7% and 2%, respectively.; Conclusions: Several environmental, socioeconomic and behavioral issues were discovered to be the contributing factors to the high prevalence of malaria in southeast Yemen. Novel strategies adapted to the local situations need to be established in order to improve the effectiveness of malaria control. ¬© 2014Bamaga et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 24,10.1186/1756-3305-7-351,"Epidemiology;Hadhramout;KAP;Malaria;Plasmodium;Yemen;Adolescent;Adult;Child;Child, Preschool;Data Collection;Female;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Humans;Malaria, Falciparum;Malaria, Vivax;Male;Questionnaires;Risk Factors;adolescent;adult;aged;agricultural worker;Article;attitude;bed net;blood smear;child;cross-sectional study;demography;environmental factor;female;fisherman;geographic distribution;health education;health survey;high risk population;human;indoor residual spraying;major clinical study;malaria;malaria control;male;microorganism detection;Plasmodium falciparum;Plasmodium vivax;prevalence;questionnaire;risk factor;social status;attitude to health;information processing;preschool child;Prevalence;Southeastern United States",NA,NA,malaria in hadhramout a southeast province of yemen prevalence risk factors knowledge attitude and practices kaps

This allows for subsequent monitoring and evaluation of the project impact on malaria vectors. This study aimed at assessing the vectorial system and malaria transmission in two ecologically different villages of the South-Cameroon forest bloc targeted for the creation of an agro-industrial complex. For four consecutive seasons in 2013, adult mosquitoes were captured using Human Landing Catch in NDELLE village (located along a main road in a degraded forest with many fish ponds) and KOMBO village (located 5km far from the main road in a darker forest and crossed by the Mvobo River). Morpho-taxonomic techniques were used alongside molecular techniques for the identification of mosquito species. ELISA test was used for the detection of circumsporozoite protein antigen of Plasmodium falciparum. Mosquito biting rate was higher in NDELLE than in KOMBO (28.18 versus 17.34 bites per person per night). Mosquitoes had a strong tendency to endophagy both in NDELLE (73.57%) and KOMBO (70.21%). Three anophelines species were identified; An. gambiae, An. funestus s.s and An. moucheti s.s.. An. gambiae and An. funestus s.s. represented the bulk of aggressive mosquitoes in NDELLE (n=10,891; 96.62%). An. gambiae was responsible for 62.6% and 77.72% of malaria transmission in KOMBO and NDELLE respectively. Mean entomological inoculation rate recorded in KOMBO and NDELLE were 4.82 and 2.02 infective bites per person per night respectively. Vector control was mainly based on the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying. The degraded forest environment added to the presence of fishponds resulted in the increase of aggressive mosquito density but not of malaria transmission. The managers should use these data for monitoring and evaluation of the impact of their project; malaria control strategies should be included in their project in order to mitigate the risk of increased malaria transmission as a result of the implementation of their projects. ¬© P.

Fish were divided into 8 groups and treated with NO alone or in combination with CN, vitamin E and clean water. NO interfered with the antioxidant defense system of O. niloticus, as there was a decrease in GST, CAT and SOD activities in all studied organs as compared to control group. These alterations in antioxidants activities were accompanied with the occurrence of histological lesions and damage in gills, liver and posterior kidney tissues. The addition of CN and Vitamin E in fish diets could protect the fish O. niloticus against NO-induced oxidative damage and histopathological changes showing recovery of fish organs. It was concluded that although botanical pesticides are being considered as less toxic/safe, but it may provoke deleterious changes in vital organs of the fish.

Among antioxidative enzymes, significant changes were revealed mainly in catalase and glutathione-S-transferase activity (P < 0.05). In gills, metallothionein content increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the group exposed to the highest copper concentration (70 Œºg/l) compared with the other tested groups, including the control. A significant (P < 0.05) change in total glutathione content was recorded in liver and gills, although the reduced/oxidised ratio was not affected. Oxidative damage to lipids increased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing copper concentration in liver and kidney.

The aim of this study was to explore the potential relationships between organic contaminants accumulated in the soft tissues of juvenile oysters, defence responses and physiological condition. Oysters were transplanted during summer and winter periods in different sites in the Marennes-Ol√©ron Bay, the first area of oyster production in France, and in the Gironde Estuary, the biggest estuary in Occidental Europe. Amongst the battery of biochemical and physiological biomarkers applied in the present work [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondyaldehyde (MDA), catecholase, laccase and lysozyme in gills, digestive glands, mantle and haemolymph, glycogen, proteins and lipids in the digestive gland and the condition index at the whole-organism level], MDA and lysozyme in the digestive gland and SOD, GPx and laccase in plasma contributed in order to significantly discriminate the sites in which oysters bioaccumulated different levels of heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HPAHs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polybromodiphenylethers (PBDEs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and lindane. These results strengthen the hypothesis that it is possible to differentiate sites depending on their contamination levels and biological effects by carrying out studies with transplanted juvenile oysters. In addition, correlations were found between antioxidant and immune-defence responses, and PAH and DDT body burdens in the first area of oyster production in France (the Marennes-Ol√©ron Bay) and where considerable oyster mortalities have been reported. This result suggests that the presence of organic chemical contaminants in the Marennes-Ol√©ron Bay may influence defence responses in juveniles of C. gigas, and, therefore, could influence their ability to resist infectious diseases. gigas. ¬© 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 36; CODEN: STEVA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.050,"Active biomonitoring;Crassostrea gigas;Immune humoral defences;Oxidative stress;Persistent organic pollutants;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;Animals;Bays;Catalase;Crassostrea;Environmental Monitoring;Estuaries;France;Gills;Glutathione Peroxidase;Hazardous Substances;Malondialdehyde;Muramidase;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic;Seawater;Water Pollutants, Chemical;Aromatic compounds;Aromatic hydrocarbons;Contamination;Enzymes;Hydrocarbons;Impurities;Marine pollution;Molluscs;Organic chemicals;Oxygen;Physiological models;Physiology;Pollution;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Shellfish;catalase;catechol oxidase;chlorphenotane;glutathione peroxidase;glycogen;laccase;lindane;lipid;lysozyme;malonaldehyde;polybromodiphenyl ether;polychlorinated biphenyl;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon;superoxide dismutase;unclassified drug;dangerous goods;sea water;water pollutant;Chemical contaminants;Glutathione peroxidase;Persistent organic pollutant (POP);Physiological biomarkers;Physiological condition;animal tissue;Article;bioaccumulation;biological monitoring;body burden;environmental impact;exocrine gland;gill;hemolymph;host resistance;innate immunity;juvenile animal;nonhuman;organic pollution;physiological process;pollution monitoring;priority journal;tissue distribution;water contamination;animal;bay;environmental monitoring;estuary;metabolism;Organic pollutants;Military Personnel",NA,NA,persistent organic pollutants in a marine bivalve on the marennesol√©ron bay and the gironde estuary french atlantic coastpart 2 potential biological effects

In aquatic toxicology, fishes have been developed as established models for studying toxic responses of xenobiotics including pesticides. Pendimethalin (PD), an herbicide, is widely present in the aquatic environment, but little is known regarding its potential neurotoxicity in fish. The present study was conducted on Channa punctata Bloch exposed to sub-lethal doses of PD (0.5 and 0.8 ppb) for 96 h. The exposure resulted in alterations in epinephrine levels in the fish brain. Epinephrine levels decreased significantly in a dose dependent manner with increase in the PD exposure. A marked decrease in the activity of acetylcholinesterase along with reduction in Na+-K+-ATPase and monoamine oxidase activity was also observed. In comparison with the corresponding controls, the sub-lethal doses of PD also caused significant changes in the oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxidation and carbonyl derivatives of protein oxidative destruction levels) and antioxidant defenses (reduced glutathione levels, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase activity) in brain tissue. Our results reflect that a detailed investigation is warranted regarding the toxicity potential of PD. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Biocide treatment to eradicate unwanted populations has been tried on small water bodies in the UK and a few other countries. It needs to be applied to the whole water body occupied by crayfish, so partial dewatering may reduce the cost of biocide. The whole population must be in the submerged dosed area, because if some individuals remain in exposed areas they may avoid treatment and hence eradication will not be achieved. This study looks at the response of signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus to exposure of occupied burrows, in tanks and in the banks of a dewatered pond. Some crayfish emerged from exposed burrows by day (34% in tanks, 9% in field); the rest remained in burrows until after dark. In tanks, 96% of crayfish vacated exposed burrows on the first night when submerged burrows were available, but when all burrows were exposed, poorer-quality submerged refuges (open-ended tubes) and competition between crayfish kept subordinate individuals in the damp exposed burrows (32.5%). Subordinates did not vacate exposed burrows until dominant crayfish were removed. In the field, most crayfish emerged in 1-2 nights, but 0.5% remained alive in burrows six nights after exposure. In tank and field, about half of the crayfish climbed up onto dry exposed areas. In light of these findings, we recommend that if dewatering is a precursor to biocide treatment, exposed areas should be tested for presence of crayfish. If dewatering is for other management the potential for terrestrial roaming to other sites should be considered. ¬© 2014 Dipartimento di Biologia, Universit√† di Firenze, Italia.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: S.

CDNs originate from the cytosolic DNA of both pathogens and hosts. STING activation promotes efficient immune responses against viral infections; however, its impact in bacterial infections is unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of Sting in bacterial infections by successfully creating a sting-deficient (sting((-/-)) with a 4-bp deletion) knockout zebrafish model using CRISPR/Cas9. The transcriptional modulation of genes downstream of cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase)-Sting pathway-related genes was analyzed in seven-day-old wild-type (WT) and sting((-/-)) embryos, as well as in four-day-old LPS-stimulated embryos. The expression of downstream genes was higher in sting(-/-) than in healthy WT fish. The late response was observed in sting((-/-)) larvae following LPS treatment, demonstrating the importance of Sting-induced immunity during bacterial infection by activating the cGAS-STING pathway. Furthermore, adult sting((-/-)) fish had a high mortality rate and significantly downregulated cGAS-STING pathway-related genes during Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida) infection. In addition, we assessed NF-kappa B pathway genes following E. piscicida infection. Our results show fluctuating patterns of interleukin-6 (il6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf alpha) expression, which is likely due to the influence of other NF-kappa B pathway-related immune genes.

The fungus Beauveria bassiana is a biological pesticide that is pathogenic to mosquitoes but harmless to the environment.Results We found a microRNA (miRNA) that can modulate the antifungal immunity of Aedes aegypti by inhibiting its cognate serine protease. Fungal infection can induce the expression of modular serine protease (ModSP), and ModSP knockdown mosquitoes were more sensitive to B. bassiana infection. The novel miRNA-novel-53 is linked to antifungal immune response and was greatly diminished in infected mosquitoes. The miRNA-novel-53 could bind to the coding sequences of ModSP and impede its expression. Double fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that this inhibition occurred in the cytoplasm. The amount of miRNA-novel-53 increased after miRNA agomir injection. This resulted in a significant decrease in ModSP transcript and a significant increase in mortality after fungal infection. An opposite effect was produced after antagomir injection. The miRNA-novel-53 was also knocked out using CRISPR-Cas9, which increased mosquito resistance to the fungus B. bassiana. Moreover, mosquito novel-circ-930 can affect ModSP mRNA by interacting with miRNA-novel-53 during transfection with siRNA or overexpression plasmid.Conclusions Novel-circ-930 affects the expression level of ModSP by a novel-circ-930/miRNA-novel-53/ModSP mechanism to modulate antifungal immunity, revealing new information on innate immunity in insects.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  74,10.1186/s12915-024-01811-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),miRNA;ModSP;Antifungal immunity;Beauveria bassiana;Aedes aegypti;CONSERVED MICRORNA MIR-8;TOLL PATHWAY;HEMOLYMPH PROTEINASE-14;RECOGNITION PROTEIN;PROTEOLYTIC CASCADE;INITIATION ENZYME;MESSENGER-RNAS;CIRCULAR RNAS;ACTIVATION;EXPRESSION;Serine;Fungi,NA,NA,the accumulation of modular serine protease mediated by a novel circrna sponging mirna increases <i>aedes aegypti<i> immunity to fungus

Propagation was based on stripping of spawners after hormonal induction and rearing of fry in artificial ponds. Fish were injected with acetone-dried carp pituitary extract at a dose of 4.0 mg/kg homogenized in a fish physiological saline. When ovulation was detected, the eggs were stripped and weighed. Eggs were collected from each ovulated female and fertilized with milt from the male. Stickiness of zander eggs was removed before transferring them into Zuger jars. Data collected from four consecutive spawning seasons were analyzed statistically calculating individual and group-based pseudo-gonadosomatic index (PGSI) values. Reproduction capacity assays were grouped on the basis of three aspects: (1) examination of differences between years, (2) within a reproductive season, and (3) examination of the effects of females' size. During the four-year trial period eggs were gained from 121 hormonally treated females, 64.7% of the total 187. Based on the data of the investigated period the mean PGSI was 10.7%. At 95% significance level PGSI data of different years were considered to be similar. There were no significant differences between PGSI data collected from different periods of the reproductive season. Previous findings on the positive correlation between the amount of stripped eggs and body weight of females were confirmed (r(2)=0.103). Correlation was not justified between PGSI and body weight (r(2)=0.002). Advanced rearing of zander fry in a 2.0 hectare pond was carried out in six consecutive years.

Microplastic (MP) and nanoplastic (NP) particles are pollutants that are present in the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at virtually every level of the food chain. Moreover, recently, airborne microplastic particles have been shown to reach and potentially damage respiratory systems. Microplastics and nanoplastics have been shown to cause increased oxidative stress, inflammation, altered metabolism leading to cellular damage, which ultimately affects tissue and organismal homeostasis in numerous animal species and human cells. However, the full impact of these plastic particles on living organisms is not completely understood. The ability of MPs/NPs to carry contaminants, toxic chemicals, pesticides, and bioactive compounds, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals, present an additional risk to animal and human health. This review will discusses the current knowledge on pathways by which microplastic and nanoplastic particles impact reproduction and reproductive behaviors from the level of the whole organism down to plastics-induced cellular defects, while also identifying gaps in current knowledge regarding mechanisms of action.

Results show that exposure to I nmol/L to 100 nmol/L of MC-LR decreased sperm motility and number of sperm cells and increased the sperm abnormality rate, whose values were significantly different from those of the control (P < 0.01). Moreover, the same dosage of MC-LR increased reactive oxygen species production and malondialdehyde content. At the same time, antioxidant enzyme (catalase and glutathione S-transferase) activity and glutathione reduced content rapidly increased, whereas antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase activity significantly decreased. These results imply that the defense system of the testes quickly responds to oxidative stress. Ultrastructural observation shows distention of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus and changes in the mitochondrial matrix color, cristae number, and morphology. Moreover, using real-time PCR, increased relative expressions of P450 aromatase and SF-1 genes were observed.

In this study, C. albicans infection model was developed in zebrafish to understand the host-pathogen interactions for straightforward anticandidal drug screening. Methods To develop the infection, 1 x 10(6 )cells of C. albicans suspended in phosphate-buffered saline were deposited in zebrafish dorsal muscle by manually operated syringe. The infection progression was externally assessed by a scale of wound-healing events, based on visible changes of yeast deposited in the muscle tissues. Chemotherapy was carried out with known antifungal drugs (fluconazole, nystatin, and amphotericin B) and a potential antifungal agent, chitosan silver nanocomposites (CAgNC), after the infection as direct exposure in the water. Histopathological analysis was performed to identify the pathogen virulence and the host-pathogen interaction during the infection. Results The light microscopic observations and histopathological analysis revealed the yeast-hyphae transition at the site of infection (at 72 hpi) and progression of the infection in the host tissues. The larval survival rate under fluconazole (up to 80 mu g mL(-1)) and nystatin (up to 20 mu g mL(-1)) was > 90% and for CAgNC it was 40% at 36 h post-exposure (hpe). The infection progression was suppressed with the fungicidal treatments. Among inflammatory genes, il-1 beta has been highly upregulated (14.68-fold) at 24 h post infection (hpi). Both il-1 beta and tnf-alpha were moderately upregulated in infected fish gills at 72 hpi. Among the C. albicans antioxidant genes, cat1 and sod2 have been upregulated during the infection, and relative expression folds were increased from low to moderate levels with the time.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloro-ethane (DDT) and its metabolites (DDX), hexachlorbenzene (HCB) and isomers of hexachlocyklohexane (HCHs) have been monitored in the breast milk of nursing mothers in the Czech Republic since 1994 as a part of The Environmental Health Monitoring System. Knowledge about long-term POPs distribution and accumulation in the human body is crucial to understanding uptake, degradation and subsequent effects as well as to conduct risk assessments. The main aim of this study is to evaluate 15-years long-term trends of selected POPs in human milk in the Czech Republic and to elucidate the questionnaire information about the age, parity and social habits, to the final concentrations. This effectiveness evaluation of POPs restriction is quite precisely after 15-years monitoring campaigns.        The human milk samples (4,753 samples) were analysed for a number of chlorinated organic chemicals including PCBs and selected chlorinated pesticides (OCPs, HCB, HCHs, DDX). The relative change of concentration per year for all chemicals was analysed. The remaining percentages of POPs in breast milk in comparison to 1994 are also expressed. Czech population half-lives of POPs in breast milk, derived from either linear or exponential models were computed.        The long-term data indicates a continuation of a decreasing trend of POPs concentrations on breast milk. Our study did not confirm lactation and parity as an important outflux resulting in the decrease in concentrations in mothers, which is in the antagonism with most of the studies. The higher BMI was associated with higher amounts of HCB and lower amounts of higher chlorinated PCBs. The results confirm the effectiveness of restrictions of POPs usage in the Czech Republic.

Leukocytes were separated from the head kidney and peripheral blood using Percoll density centrifugation. A flow cytometric analysis revealed that GBP binds with many cells and a variety of cell types including lymphocytes, granulocytes and thrombocytes. Intracellular calcium flux of the peripheral blood leukocytes induced by stimulation with GBP was confirmed by counting the fluo-3 loaded cells whose fluorescence increased after the stimulation using flow cytometry. The percentage of cells in which a calcium flux was induced peaked 1 min after the stimulation. Approximately 6% of the cells specifically responded I min after the stimulation. The proliferation response was determined by the level of BrdU uptake by the leukocytes after the stimulation. Cell proliferation was observed 2, 4 and 6 days after stimulation with GBP. The expression of cytokines IL-1beta and TGF-beta1 in the peripheral blood leukocytes, after the stimulation was evaluated by a semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Increased expression of IL-1beta was observed 4 h after stimulation with GBP. Variation of TGF-beta1 expression under the same conditions was not observed. The kinetics of intracellular calcium flux and the level of IL-1beta expression induced by GBP stimulation were different front those induced by phytohemagglutinin stimulation. These results confirmed that GBP is a pathogenic microbial component that can induce cell activation. GBP seems to induce the inflammatory response observed in the Aphanomyces infection.

In this study, we systematically deleted all of the 9 established T3SS effectors in E. piscicida (aka 9 Delta) and the rpoS gene encoding the alternative sigma factor, the esrB repressor (10 Delta), then we overexpressed esrB and T3SS in E. piscicida to obtain the recombinant strain 10 Delta/esrB(OE). The modified strains 10 Delta and 10 Delta/esrB(OE) exhibited severe attenuation and in vivo colonization defects. Additionally, vaccination by intraperitoneal injection with 10 Delta and 10 Delta/esrB(OE) could significantly upregulate the expression of the antigen recognition related gene (TLR5) and the adaptive immune response-related gene (MHC II) in the spleen/kidney of turbot fish, and it also enhanced the hosts' serum bactericidal capacity. Finally, vaccination with 10 Delta/esrB(OE) led to increased immune protection against the challenge of wild type E. piscicida EIB202 in turbot fish.

The studies were compared against each other, and against comparable data from other geographic locales.  A total of seven major categories of exposure sequelae were evaluated.  These ranged from the effects of primary exposure to contaminants upon maternal health status, to effects from secondary intrauterine fetal exposure, including alterations in birth size and gestational age, changes in neonatal health status, and effects persisting into early infancy.  Results of the evaluations suggest that the causal hypothesis may be strongly affirmed for the relationship between PCB exposure and transplacental passage of PCB molecules.  The relationship between PCB exposure and alterations in both neonatal health status and in health status in early infancy may be affirmed with reasonable certainty.  While the evidence from the Michigan Maternal/Infant Cohort related to maternal exposure to PCB and infant size at birth and gestational age affirms the causal hypothesis, studies from other geographic locales tend only to be supportive.  Analytic differences are likely responsible for this variation, but epidemiologically, the composite rating must be regarded as indeterminate.  The relationship with observed alterations in maternal health status, composite activity ranking, and McCarthy Memory Scale deficits were also classified as indeterminate.  No evidences of obvious negation were seen, although one portion of a study was disqualified because of incoherence.

Animals were exposed for 24 and 96 h to the following nominal concentrations of chlorothalonil: 0.1, 10.0 and 100.0 mu g/L. The antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and the activity of the enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and propionylcholinesterase (PChE) were evaluated in whole-body tissue. In addition, the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPO), glycogen and lactate levels were also analyzed. A reduction in ACAP levels was observed in animals exposed to the higher chlorothalonil concentration, concomitantly with an induction of GST activity as well as diminution in GSH content in these animals. This disturbance in the redox state of animal tissues leads to an oxidative stress situation, resulting in an induction in LPO levels. It was also demonstrated that chlorothalonil exposure causes alteration in AChE activity, possibly related to damage to membrane lipids.

Their residues and transformed products, released in the environment are toxic to both terrestrial and aquatic life. This necessitates remediation of wastewaters containing such hazardous chemicals to reduce threat to human health and environment. Bioremediation technologies using microorganisms become the present day choice. High Melting Explosive (HMX) is one of the nitroexplosives produced by nitration of hexamine using ammonium nitrate and acetic anhydride and hence the wastewater bears high concentration of nitrate and acetate. The present investigation describes potential of a soil isolate of yeast Pichia sydowiorum MCM Y-3, for remediation of HMX wastewater in fixed film bioreactor (FFBR). The flask culture studies showed appreciable growth of the organism in HMX wastewater under shake culture condition within 5-6 days of incubation at ambient temperature (28 +/- A 2A degrees C). The FFBR process operated in both batch and continuous mode, with Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) of 1 week resulted in 50-55% removal in nitrate, 70-88% in acetate, 50-66% in COD, and 28-50% in HMX content. Continuous operation of the reactor showed better removal of nitrate as compared to that in the batch operation, while removal of acetate and COD was comparable in both the modes of operation of the reactor. Insertion of baffles in the reactor increased efficiency of the reactor. Thus, FFBR developed with baffles and operated in continuous mode will be beneficial for bioremediation of high nitrate and acetate containing wastewater using the culture of P. sydowiorum.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  33,10.1007/s10295-008-0493-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Bioremediation;Pichia sydowiorum;Fixed film bioreactor;Nitrate;Nitroexplosive;MARINE SEDIMENT;BIODEGRADATION;OCTAHYDRO-1,3,5,7-TETRANITRO-1,3,5,7-TETRAZOCINE;EXPLOSIVES;BACTERIA;HMX;HEXAHYDRO-1,3,5-TRINITRO-1,3,5-TRIAZINE;REMEDIATION;DEGRADATION;METABOLISM;Yeasts",NA,NA,bioremediation of nitroexplosive wastewater by an yeast isolate <i>pichia sydowiorum<i> mcm y3 in fixed film bioreactor

Environmental exposure to contaminants may affect their capacity to respond to challenging conditions, to progress in a normal ontogenesis, and finally to survive and succeed in completing metamorphosis. We studied the effects of the exposure to two anticholinesterase agents, the carbamate carbaryl and the organophosphate azinphos methyl, on the antioxidant defenses of developing embryos of the toad Rhinella (Bufo) arenarum. Reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were increased early by carbaryl, but were decreased by both pesticides at the end of embryonic development. The GSH-dependent enzymes glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidases showed oscillating activity patterns that could be attributed to an induction of activity in response to oxidative stress and inactivation by excess of reactive oxygen species. Glutathione-S-transferases, which may participate in the conjugation of lipid peroxide products in addition to pesticide detoxification, showed an increase of activity at the beginning and at the end of development. Catalase also showed variations in the activity suggesting, successively, induction and inactivation in response to pesticide exposure-induced oxidative stress. Superoxide dismutase activity was increased by carbaryl and transiently decreased by azinphos methyl exposure. judging from the depletion in GSH levels and glutathione reductase inhibition at the end of embryonic development, the oxidative stress caused by azinphos methyl seemed to be greater than that caused by carbaryl, which might be in turn related with a higher number of developmental alterations caused by the organophosphate. GSH content is a good biomarker of oxidative stress in the developing embryos exposed to pesticides. The antioxidant enzymes are in turn revealing the balance between their protective capacity and the oxidative damage to the enzyme molecules, decreasing their activity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It can exert several actions on the immune system, growth and cellular metabolism, establishing a fine-tune regulation stress response and cross-talk interactions with other regulatory pathways. In this study, we investigated a causal relationship between high levels of glucocorticoids and susceptibility to pathogens and modification of gene expression profiles in Senegalese sole. For this purpose, we carried out two experiments using post-metamorphic individuals (21 days after hatching) that were exposed to dexamethasone (DXM), a potent glucocorticoid, in order to mimic cortisol effects. We quantified transcript levels of a wide set of genes involved in innate immune system (g-type lysozyme and hepcidin (hamp1)), HPI axis (crf, crfbp, pomc alpha, pomc beta, gr1 and gr2), HPT axis (tgb), cellular stress defense system (hsp70 and hsp90a), GH/IGF axis (igf-I and igf-Ir) and the neuropeptide trh. Short-term exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 ppm DXM provoked a reduction of pomc beta transcripts and an increase of crfbp mRNAs in a dose-dependent manner at 48 and 72 h after treatment. Moreover, g-type lysozyme transcript levels decreased significantly at 72 h whereas ham p I mRNA levels increased at 48 h after exposure. Long-term DXM treatment (10 ppm DXM) affected negatively weight of soles (similar to 20% lower than controls). Moreover, reduced mRNA levels were observed for pomcg after 1 week and igf-I and hampl after 2 weeks. In contrast, crfbp and crf increased mRNA levels after 2 weeks. hsp70 exhibited a dual response increasing transcript levels at 1 week after treatment and reducing thereafter. No significant changes in gene expression were observed at any time during this study for tgb, trh, hsp90a, pomca, gr1 and gr2. Finally, a challenge experiment using the pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp piscicida confirmed earlier and higher mortalities in DXM-treated animals. Taken together, these data indicate that a prolonged exposure to DXM increases the susceptibility to pathogens and reduces growth. Moreover, DXM can trigger a wide cellular response modulating the expression of genes involved in the innate immune system, HPI and GH/IGF axes as well as cellular stress defense. These results are highly valuable to evaluate responses associated to aquaculture stressful conditions and discriminate specific glucocorticoid-mediated effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The deletion (DEL) assay scoring for DNA deletions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to detect a wide range of carcinogens. Among approximately 60 compounds of known carcinogenic activity, the DEL assay detected 86% correctly whereas the Ames Salmonella assay detected only 30% correctly [R.J. Brennan, R.H. Schiestl, Detecting carcinogens with the yeast DEL assay, Methods Mol. Biol. 262 (2004) 111- 124]. Since the DEL assay is highly inducible by DNA double strand breaks, this study examined the utility of the DEL assay for detecting clastogens. Ten model compounds, with varied mechanisms of genotoxicity, were examined for their effect on the frequency of DNA deletions with the DEL assay. The compounds tested were: actinomycin D, camptothecin, methotrexate and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, which are anticancer agents, noscapine and furosemide are therapeutics, acridine, methyl acrylate and resorcinol are industrial chemicals and diazinon is an insecticide. The in vitro micronucleus assay (IVMN) in CHO cells, a commonly used tool for detection of clastogens, was performed on the same compounds and the results of the two assays were compared. The results of our study show that there is 70% concordance in the presence of metabolic activation (rat liver S9) and 80% concordance in the absence of metabolic activation between the DEL assay and the standard in vitro micronucleus assay. The lack of cytotoxicity observed for four of the ten compounds examined indicates limited diffusion of lipophilic compounds across the yeast cell wall. Thus, the development of a more permeable yeast tester strain is expected to greatly improve concordance of the DEL assay with the IVMN assay. The yeast DEL assay is inexpensive, amenable to automation and requires less expertise to perform than the IVMN. Thus, it has a strong potential as a robust, fast and economical screen for detecting clastogens in vitro. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Metal bioaccumulation and parasitic diseases could vary in different species depending on temperature changes and other environmental factors. Most studies conducted on endoparasites, such as acanthocephalans, cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes, indicate that only cestodes and acanthocephalans could absorb heavy metals successfully in their hosts, and that only adult worms could be used as indicators of environmental pollution. In Artemia parthenogenetica, cestodes increased resistance to arsenic (As) pollution and temperature changes; and infection was associated with improved antioxidant defense system without oxidative damage. The most serious parasite of Penaeus spp. is Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (Microsporidia: Enterocytozoonidae). Apostome ciliates are negatively impacting Pandalus borealis of the northeastern United States (Synophrya sp. that causes ""white eggs"" or Black Spot Gill Syndrome) and Penaeus spp. from the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Hyalophysa lynni that causes shrimp black gill). In freshwater fish, the larvae of the nematode Eustrongylides spp. Jagerskiold, 1909 (Nematoda: Dioctophymidae) absorbed lead (Pb), mercury, and cadmium, when the metal levels were close to zero in water and sediment. The concentration of Pb in the larvae was approximately 17 times higher than in the fish. Like the antioxidant defense reactions in the parasitized A. parthenogenetica exposed to As, an improved antioxidant defense system may be available in parasitized fish, limiting oxidative damage caused by metals. This study presents baseline concentrations of 30 metals in wild Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931 from Ecuador and other species, as well as the current taxonomy for selected shellfish species and their parasites.

The isolated strain was identified as Pseudoalteromonas ruthenica. In vivo experiments were con-ducted with P. ruthenica-immersed larvae and P. ruthenica-enriched Artemia fed to adult zebrafish. Disease tolerance of larval zebrafish against Edwardsiella piscicida was demonstrated by 66.34% cumulative per cent survival (CPS) in the P. ruthenica-exposed group, which was higher than the CPS of the control (46.67%) at 72 h post challenge (hpc). Heat-stressed larvae had 55% CPS in the P. ruthenica-immersed group, while the control had 30% CPS at 60 hpc. Immune-stress response gene transcripts (muc5.1, muc5.2, muc5.3, alpi2, alpi3, hsp70, and hsp90a) were induced, while pro-inflammatory genes (tnf alpha, il1b, and il6) were downregulated in P. ruthenica- immersed larvae compared to the control. This trend was confirmed by low pro-inflammatory and high stress -responsive protein expression levels in P. ruthenica-exposed larvae. Adult zebrafish had higher CPS (27.2%) in the P. ruthenica-fed group than the control (9.52%) upon E. piscicida challenge, suggesting increased disease tolerance. Histological analysis demonstrated modulation of goblet cell density and average villus height in the P. ruthenica-supplemented group. Metagenomics analysis clearly indicated modulation of alpha diversity indices and the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in the P. ruthenica-supplemented zebrafish gut. Furthermore, increased Firmicutes colonisation and reduced Bacteroidetes abundance in the gut were observed upon P. ruthenica supplementation. Additionally, this study confirmed the concentration-dependent increase of colony dispersion and macrophage uptake upon mucin treatment.

In this study, changes in NDEA precursors in drinking water treatment process were studied using the trial of its formation potential (FP), and the toxicity induced by NDEA to adult zebrafish was investigated. NDEA FP in the raw water of Taihu Lake ranged from 46.9 to 68.3 ng/L. The NDEA precursors were removed effectively by O-3/BAC process. Hydrophilic fraction and low-molecular-weight fraction (<1 kDa) had the highest NDEA FP. The toxicity results demonstrated that the acute lethal concentration of NDEA causing 50% mortality in 96 h (96-h LC50) was 210.4 mg/L, and NDEA was more likely to be accumulated in kidney, followed by liver and gill. NDEA induced oxidative stress and antioxidant defense to zebrafish metabolism system at concentrations over 5 mu g/L. After a 42-day exposure, a significant DNA damage was observed in zebrafish liver cells at NDEA concentrations beyond 500 a.

The period of sexual differentiation of gonads, brain, and behavior is probably the most sensitive to the influence of endocrine modulation. Exposure to small quantities of exogenous hormones during the critical periods for sexual differentiation can result in severe and permanent alterations in gonad and brain development and in subsequent adult reproductive behavior. Relatively great concentrations of organochlorine chemicals are generally required to illicit effects that are less dramatic than those caused by exogenous hormones. Female-female pairings and low male/female ratios in some gull populations may be related to endocrine disruption by environmental contaminants, but any mechanism that could cause differential male mortality in gull populations may be a viable alternate explanation. The mechanism by which some organochlorine contaminants cause eggshell thinning is complex and may vary among sensitive avian species. The modulation of calcium homeostasis may be involved, as the transport of calcium from the eggshell gland mucosa to the lumen fluid has been implicated as a proximate cause of eggshell thinning. The modulation of thyroid hormone homeostasis by xenobiotics is a possible cause of goiter in some wildlife populations. The histological presentation of goiter can vary depending upon the etiologic agent responsible. Histological criteria were used to rule out polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as a possible cause of goiter in a population of Great Lakes herring gulls.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  0,,Xenobiotics,NA,NA,xenobiotic modulation of endocrine function in birds

The evolution of resistance (a heritable decrease in susceptibility to Bt toxins) can pose a threat to sustained control of target pests, but a high-dose refuge (HDR) management strategy has been key to delaying countervailing evolution of Bt resistance. The HDR strategy relies on the mating frequency between susceptible and resistant individuals, so either partial dominance of resistant alleles or nonrandom mating in the pest population itself could elevate the pace of resistance evolution. Using classic Wright-Fisher genetic models, we investigated the impact of deviations from standard refuge model assumptions on resistance evolution in the pest populations. We show that when Bt selection is strong, even deviations from random mating and/or strictly recessive resistance that are below the threshold of detection can yield dramatic increases in the pace of resistance evolution. Resistance evolution is hastened whenever the order of magnitude of model violations exceeds the initial frequency of resistant alleles. We also show that the existence of a fitness cost for resistant individuals on the refuge crop cannot easily overcome the effect of violated HDR assumptions. We propose a parametrically explicit framework that enables both comparison of various field situations and model inference. Using this model, we propose novel empiric estimators of the pace of resistance evolution (and time to loss of control), whose simple calculation relies on the observed change in resistance allele frequency.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  48,10.1111/eva.12355     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),fitness cost;high-dose;incomplete resistance;insecticide resistance;nonrandom mating;partial dominance;refuge strategy;FIELD-EVOLVED RESISTANCE;EUROPEAN CORN-BORER;INSECT RESISTANCE;COTTON BOLLWORM;PINK-BOLLWORM;FITNESS COSTS;TOXIN CRY1AC;GENE FLOW;LEPIDOPTERA;CROPS,NA,NA,impact of violated highdose refuge assumptions on evolution of <i>bt<i> resistance

Recent phylogenomic investigations have determined that bacteria historically classified as Edwardsiella tarda actually represent three genetically distinct yet phenotypically ambiguous taxa with various degrees of pathogenicity in different hosts. Previous recognition of these taxa was hampered by the lack of a distinguishing phenotypic character. Commercial test panel configurations are relatively constant over time, and as new species are defined, appropriate discriminatory tests may not be present in current test panel arrangements. While phenobiochemical tests fail to discriminate between these taxa, data presented here revealed discriminatory peaks for each Edwardsiella species using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) methodology, suggesting that MALDI-TOF can offer rapid, reliable identification in line with current systematic classifications. Furthermore, a multiplex PCR assay was validated for rapid molecular differentiation of the Edwardsiella spp. affecting fish. Moreover, the limitations of relying on partial 16S rRNA for discrimination of Edwardsiella spp. and advantages of employing alternative single-copy genes gyrB and sodB for molecular identification and classification of Edwardsiella were demonstrated. Last, sodB sequencing confirmed that isolates previously defined as typical motile fish-pathogenic E. tarda are synonymous with Edwardsiella piscicida, while atypical nonmotile fish-pathogenic E. tarda isolates are equivalent to Edwardsiella anguillarum.

Previous works have used similar notions but with task-independent similarities and representations, i.e. they were not tailored to the end-goal of localization. This article proposes two contributions: (i) a metric learning algorithm and (ii) a representation of images as object probability maps, that are both optimized for detection. We show experimentally that these two contributions are crucial to DDD, do not require costly additional operations, and in some cases yield comparable or better results than state-of-the-art detectors despite conceptual simplicity and increased speed. As an application of prominent object detection, we improve fine-grained categorization by precropping images with the proposed approach. ¬© 2013 IEEE.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 5; Conference name: 2013 14th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2013; Conference date: 1 December 2013 through 8 December 2013; Conference code: 104551; CODEN: PICVE",10.1109/ICCV.2013.217,fine-grained categorization;Fisher vectors;image retrieval;metric learning;object detection;Detectors;Object recognition;Conceptual simplicity;Image representations;Metric learning;Object Detection;Probability maps;Prominent objects;Image retrieval,NA,NA,predicting an object location using a global image representation

Acute toxicity of 2,4-D herbicide was investigated through its effects on guppies (Poecilia vivipara Bloch et Schneider 1801). Fish were exposed to the herbicide at concentrations of 10, 20 and 40Œºl per liter of water for 24 hours to determine its effects on gills and liver epithelia. The estimated LC50 was 34.64Œºl of 2,4-D per liter of water. Histochemical analyses and Feulgen's reaction were conducted to detect glycoconjugates and DNA, respectively, in gills and liver epithelia. Histochemistry revealed qualitative variations of glycoconjugates present on mucous cells and granules. The four types of mucous cells contained neutral granules, acids, or both. Increasing amounts of syalomucins were observed from the control group to the group exposed to the highest concentration of 2,4-D, suggesting increased mucous viscosity and the formation of plaques that could inhibit gas exchange and osmoregulation. Lamellar fusion observed in the group exposed to 40Œºl of 2,4-D suggests a defense mechanism. Hepatocytes showed vacuolization in the 10 and 20Œºl/L groups. The 40 Œºl/L group showed normal hepatocytes as well as changed ones, many Ito cells, micronuclei, and nuclear swelling. These effects may be associated with toxicity or adaptative processes to cellular stress. The data from this study indicates the importance of assessing similar risks to aquatic species and suggests that Poecilia vivipara is an adequate biological model for analysis of environmental contamination.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 22; Correspondence Address: A.F.

The survival capacity of P. putida stems from its frequent exposure to various endogenous and exogenous oxidative stresses. Oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of interactions with various reactive oxygen species (ROS)-inducing agents existing in various niches. ROS could facilitate the evolution of bacteria by mutating genomes. Aerobic bacteria maintain defense mechanisms against oxidative stress throughout their evolution. To overcome the detrimental effects of oxidative stress, P. putida has developed defensive cellular systems involving induction of stress-sensing proteins and detoxification enzymes as well as regulation of oxidative stress response networks. Genetic responses to oxidative stress in P. putida differ markedly from those observed in Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. Two major redox-sensing transcriptional regulators, SoxR and OxyR, are present and functional in the genome of P. putida. However, the novel regulators FinR and HexR control many genes belonging to the E. coli SoxR regulon. Oxidative stress can be generated by exposure to antibiotics, and iron homeostasis in P. putida is crucial for bacterial cell survival during treatment with antibiotics. This review highlights and summarizes current knowledge of oxidative stress in P. putida, as a model soil bacterium, together with recent studies from molecular genetics perspectives. ¬© 2014 Springer-Verlag.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 87; Correspondence Address: W.

Two districts from each Regional State, 4 peasant associations (PAs) from each district and 10 households from each PA were purposively selected based on availability and recognition in the area of M. ferruginea. Data were collected using questionnaire. The period from February to May was reported as critical feed shortage seasons and SNNPRS respondents noted M. ferruginea as a feed resource was used to balance deficits during times of feed shortage. All respondents from SNNPRS and about 41% from ANRS used M. ferruginea as livestock feed. Some respondents from ANRS were however, unaware of the use of M. ferruginea as animal feed. Leaves, flowers and twigs of M. ferruginea were mentioned as edible parts of the plant by cattle, sheep and goats. Feeding M. ferruginea in mixture with other feedstuffs is a common practice in SNNPRS, while the sole M. ferruginea is fed in ANRS. All respondents from SNNPRS had a positive impression on the feeding value of M. ferruginea and indicated improved growth and milk output, no abortion, health problem and deaths of animals was observed due to M. ferruginea feeding. Conversely, the level of understanding of the feeding value of M. ferruginea in ANRS appeared to be low.

With the advance in various technologies, food production has dramatically increased in quantity but not necessarily in quality. The public has become more concerned about the risks from food hazards in recent years. So it is important to assess the level of awareness and food safety concerns amongst the public and to study how they perceived the risk aspects of several food safety issues. A survey was carried out on the general public (550 respondents) in the Klang Valley region, stratified according to their occupation classification by Malaysian Standard Classification of Occupations 1998. Risk perception was measured using self-developed questionnaires with seven point Likert scales. The Malaysian public was found to be highly attentive to food safety issues, but they only have moderate knowledge on food safety and divided on how to choose quality food. The level of awareness towards several food safety issues varies. Only food preservatives and pesticide residues were perceived as familiar. All six food safety issues were perceived as risky by the respondents and need high level of regulation. The level of perceived benefits and encouragement differed across food safety issues. GM palm oil and GM soybean were the only food safety issues perceived as beneficial and were moderately encouraged. The level of confidence towards Malaysian regulatory body related to food safety among the respondents who were aware about its existence was moderate. It can be concluded that the public perceived and assessed food risks as a complex and sensitive expressions of their value system as well as multi-dimensional. Results from this study provide some insights into the social acceptance of food-related technologies in developing countries that can be adopted by food scientists, food industries and government regulatory bodies in developing suitable risk communication strategies.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: L.

Similarly, possible involvement of hydroxyl radicals in some sort of chemically-induced carcinogenicity has been proposed. Notably, it is suggested that the hydroxyl radical can play a role in heavy metal-induced carcinogenicity that requires chronic exposure to the carcinogen. In these cases, hydroxyl radicals produced by Fenton-like reactions may be involved in the carcinogenicity. Meanwhile, potential advantages have been reported on the use of the hydroxyl radical, being included in host immune defense by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and medical applications such as for cancer treatment and antibiotics.

The upper Sacramento River bloom was dominated by chlorophytes, but biomass and photosynthetic efficiency (based on variable fluorescence, Fv/Fm) precipitously declined downstream when cells were exposed to sewage effluent and NH4+ levels>70ŒºM-N. Further downriver, substantial rates of nitrification occurred, based on increasing levels of NO3- and NO2- in proportion to decreasing NH4+ concentrations, reducing NH4+ levels to <10ŒºM-N. The other major tributary, the San Joaquin River, had extremely high nutrient levels (NO3->400ŒºM-N, PO43->13ŒºM-P, but NH4+~2ŒºM-N), very low chlorophyll a levels (~3ŒºgL-1) and low Fv/Fm values, but elevated bacterial production, suggesting presence of an algal inhibitor, possibly an herbicide. Both rivers converge above Suisun Bay, where elevated NO3- (>50ŒºM-N), sufficient PO43- (>3ŒºM-P), and reduced NH4+ levels (as low as 6ŒºM-N), and reduced flow created conditions conducive to a spatially large and physiologically healthy (elevated Fv/Fm) diatom bloom dominated by the species Entomoneis sp. We conceptualize this bloom as a ""window of opportunity"" response by these diatoms to multiple factors promoted by the drought, including longer residence time for cell growth and biomass accumulation, and longer time for in-river nitrification to occur, reducing sewage-derived NH4+ to a level where diatoms could access NO3- for uptake and growth. We suggest that management practices that favor higher rates of flow may narrow the ""window of opportunity"" for phytoplankton growth, potentially leading to low productivity and food limitation for fish. Under high flow, a condition of ""washout"" may develop where both chlorophyll and unassimilated nutrients are transported out of the bay, and the phytoplankton that do develop are less favorable in terms of community composition for supporting the upper food web. ¬© 2014.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 42; Correspondence Address: P.M.

The CASMATZ simulates the daily production of 20 periphyton and 6 aquatic vascular plant species. The modeled consumer community consists of 17 functionally defined species of zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, bacteria, and fish. Daily values of population biomass (grams of carbon per square meter) are calculated as nonlinear functions of population bioenergetics, physical-chemical environmental parameters, grazing/predator-prey interactions, and population-specific direct and indirect responses to atrazine. The CASMATZ uses Monte Carlo methods to characterize the implications of phenotypic variability, environmental variability, and uncertainty associated with atrazine toxicity data in estimating the potential impacts of time-varying atrazine exposures on population biomass and community structure. Comparisons of modeled biomass values for plants and consumers with published data indicate that the generic reference simulation realistically describes ecological production in lower-order midwestern streams. Probabilistic assessments were conducted using the CASMATZ to evaluate potential modeled changes in plant community structure resulting from measured atrazine exposure profiles in 3 midwestern US streams representing watersheds highly vulnerable to runoff. Deviation in the median values of maximum 30-d average Steinhaus similarity index ranged from 0.09% to 2.52% from the reference simulation. The CASMATZ could therefore be used for the purposes of risk assessment by comparison of site monitoring-based model output to a biologically relevant Steinhaus similarity index level of concern. Used as a generic screening technology or in site-specific applications, the CASMATZ provides an effective, coherent, and transparent modeling framework for assessing ecological risks posed by pesticides in lower-order streams. ¬© 2013 SETAC.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: S.M.

In this article, the effect of methyl parathion on the fighting behaviour of male Siamese fighting fish was investigated. The frequency and duration of opercular erection were taken as indicators of male aggressiveness towards another male. All male fish were housed in glass jars for 1-2 weeks prior to experiments. Sixteen naive males were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: methyl parathion (5 mg/L) and control. Males were placed in their respective treatment jars for 24 h, and then, each male was paired with another male of matching size in an 30x25x25 cm aquarium. The aquarium had an opaque divider to keep the two males separate for 10 min of acclimation period. The divider was then removed and behavioural measurements were taken for another 10 min. The results showed that fish placed in methyl parathion had significantly lower aggressive behavlour, as indicated by lower frequency and shorter duration of opercular erection.

Various stressors have been implicated as contributory factors, including increased bottom temperatures, extensive eutrophication with commensurate hypoxia, storm-induced thermal destratification, possible exposures to pesticides and metals, and fishery-induced stressors. Such stressors increase host susceptibility by weakening the host immune defenses and act to increase the transmission and severity of pathogens. The lobster mortality in western LIS in 1999 was linked to Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis, but a complex of stressors resulted in outright mortality from hypoxia or consequent immune suppression that increased susceptibility to the ameba. Similar stressors have been implicated in the etiology of epizootic shell disease and calcinosis. The role of environmental stressors has been hard to delineate, but recent declines in landings indicate that epizootic shell disease has had a negative impact on the lobster population in LIS. Calcinosis, blindness, and hepatopancreatitis are indicators of continued exposure to anthropogenic stressors, but their etiologies remain undetermined. More research is needed to understand emerging diseases, their complex etiologies, and their effects on the lobster population.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 45; Correspondence Address: J.

In order to realize quantitative and directional spraying, weed identification using image-processing technology is one of the focus problems in the precision-agriculture field. The foundation of automated identification is feature extraction. Because the dimensions of the feature are usually very high, before identification the dimensions must be reduced. The performance of any dimension-reduction method will directly affect the recognition results. The traditional dimension reduction method is a linear method, so it is very difficult to grasp the nonlinear nature of the original data. Locally linear embedding (LLE) is one kind of emerging manifold method. Compared with the traditional method, it is a nonlinear method, but it still has some limitations. The locally linear embedding is essentially an unsupervised method, and it cannot utilize the category information of the train samples. The traditional locally linear embedding method has defects in dealing with the classification problem, so the recognition accuracy is not satisfactory. In order to overcome this defects above, a supervised locally linear embedding method based on Fisher projection (FS-LLE) was chosen to reduce the feature dimension. The samples are projected by Fisher transformation first. Then, the projection coordinates are obtained, and projection distances are computed. The Euclidean distance is used to select the sample points' neighbors in the traditional locally linear embedding. Compared with the Euclidean distance, the Fisher projection distances can characterize the category attributes between different types of samples, so it is chosen to determine the neighborhood structure. In order to verify the effectiveness of this dimension reduction method, the experiment is designed as follows. The weed images are collected from the field, and the grayscale features are obtained. The influence of land background is excluded by super green characteristics at first, then the individual green plant region is selected by a morphological method. The gray scale data ensemble of each region is the feature whose dimension will be reduced. For comparison, dimension reduction was accomplished by PCA (principal component analysis), LLE (locally linear embedding), WLLE (weighted locally linear embedding) and FS-LLE (supervised locally linear embedding based on the Fisher projection), respectively. Through second visual dimension reduction results, it can be found clearly that the FS-LLE method achieves better low-dimensional data-clustering effects. This illustrates that the method proposed in this article finds the samples' intrinsic class features at the same time it reduces feature dimension. This virtue is more conducive to solve identification problems. At last the task of classification for recognition is fulfilled by the support vector machine. Further comparison and analysis of the identification results obtained by different dimension reduction methods, the average recognition rate of corn of this method reaches 97.2%, while the average recognition rates of PCA, LLE, and WLLE were 70.1%, 77.1% and 86.8%, respectively. In the same way, the average recognition rate of weed of this method reaches 77.8%, while the average recognition rates of PCA, LLE, and WLLE were 38.4%, 61.2% and 60.4%, respectively. Therefore, the method proposed by this article is a significant improvement over the other traditional methods. This result also shows that the method has certain advantages in solving the classification problem.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: D.

After surviving near extinction driven by DDT and other contaminants from the 1940s through the early 1970s, the cormorant has made an unprecedented comeback from mere dozens to a population in the millions, bringing the bird again into direct conflict with humans. Hated for its colonial nesting behavior; the changes it brings to landscapes; and especially its competition with commercial and sports fishers, fisheries, and fish farmers throughout the Great Lakes and Mississippi Delta regions, the cormorant continues to be persecuted by various means, including the shotgun. In The Double-Crested Cormorant, Dennis Wild brings together the biological, social, legal, and international aspects of the cormorant's world to give a complete and balanced view of one of the Great Lakes' and perhaps North America's most misunderstood species. In addition to taking a detailed look at the complex natural history of the cormorant, the book explores the implications of congressional acts and international treaties, the workings and philosophies of state and federal wildlife agencies, the unrelenting efforts of aquaculture and fishing interests to ""cull"" cormorant numbers to ""acceptable"" levels, and the reactions and visions of conservation groups. Wild examines both popular preconceptions about cormorants (what kinds of fish they eat and how much) and the effectiveness of ongoing efforts to control the cormorant population. Finally, the book delves into the question of climate and terrain changes, their consequences for cormorants, the new territories to which the birds must adapt, and the conflicts this species is likely to face going forward. ¬© by the University of Michigan 2012.

We analyzed data from 126 recovery strategies implemented under Canada's nascent (2002) Species at Risk Act (SARA) to determine how lead agency, Federal Court rulings, and the proportion of independent team members influenced identification of critical habitat. Only 17% of strategies led by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans included critical habitat, compared with 63% of strategies led by Environment Canada, indicating that aquatic species at risk are much less likely to have critical habitat identified. A 50% increase in recovery strategies that identified critical habitat following precedent-setting court judgments suggests that legal action by nongovernmental organizations played a key role in the evolution of recovery policy for species at risk in Canada. The proportion of independent scientists on a recovery team was statistically unrelated to identification of critical habitat at a national scale, but case studies indicate that independent team members may play an important role in ensuring compliance and transparency during recovery planning. ¬© 2013 Published by NRC Research Press.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 17; Correspondence Address: E.B.

The objective of this study was to compare systematically the relative sensitivity of amphibians and fish to chemicals. Acute and chronic toxicity data were obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) ECOTOX database and were supplemented with data from the scientific and regulatory literature. The overall outcome is that fish and amphibian toxicity data are highly correlated and that fish are more sensitive (both acute and chronic) than amphibians. In terms of acute sensitivity, amphibians were between 10- and 100-fold more sensitive than fish for only four of 55 chemicals and more than 100-fold more sensitive for only two chemicals. However, a detailed inspection of these cases showed a similar acute sensitivity of fish and amphibians. Chronic toxicity data for fish were available for 52 chemicals. Amphibians were between 10- and 100-fold more sensitive than fish for only two substances (carbaryl and dexamethasone) and greater than 100-fold more sensitive for only a single chemical (sodium perchlorate). The comparison for carbaryl was subsequently determined to be unreliable and that for sodium perchlorate is a potential artifact of the exposure medium. Only a substance such as dexamethasone, which interferes with a specific aspect of amphibian metamorphosis, might not be detected using fish tests. However, several other compounds known to influence amphibian metamorphosis were included in the analysis, and these did not affect amphibians disproportionately. These analyses suggest that additional amphibian testing is not necessary during chemical risk assessment. ¬© 2013 SETAC.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 75; Correspondence Address: P.

We monitored site use by waterbirds at Lake Chapala, the largest lake in Mexico and recently designated Ramsar site, to evaluate the potential influence of water hyacinth cover on species composition and aggregate measures of the waterbird community, including waterbird density, species richness, and Simpson's index of diversity. We examined the response of waterbirds to changes in percent water hyacinth cover at 22 independent sites around the lake during six study seasons from May 2006 to February 2008. We found little evidence to suggest that percent water hyacinth cover affected aggregate community measures; however, multivariate analysis of relative species composition suggested that water hyacinth cover corresponded with seasonal species composition (Canonical Correspondence r 0.66, P 0.007) when seasonal site cover averaged 17.7 ¬± 4.67 (winter 2007). Several migratory species were not observed during this season, which could suggest that some small-bodied migratory species avoided Lake Chapala during the winter of high water hyacinth cover. We suspect that observed changes in the waterbird community are in response to species-specific tolerances for water hyacinth and indirect abiotic and biotic effects of its presence (e.g., invertebrate and fish composition). Nomenclature: Glyphosate, water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms. Management Implications: Water hyacinth is among the most widespread aquatic invasive plants in the world. Yet despite its global recognition, our understanding of how nonnative ecosystems and animal communities, specifically waterbirds, respond to the establishment of this species is relatively weak, which hinders our ability to choose the best potential management strategy. The waterbird community comprises herbivores as well as secondary and tertiary consumers; therefore, changes in community composition and abundance can greatly affect food web structure and energy flows within an affected ecosystem. In addition to their ecological role, waterbirds are the source of cultural and economic values in many regions. A shift in waterbird community composition resulting from water hyacinth establishment has the potential to enhance or reduce socioeconomic values associated with freshwater ecosystems. By understanding how waterbirds respond to water hyacinth, field practitioners (e.g., researchers, managers, and decision-makers) will be better informed when developing research and management priorities. Our results suggest that water hyacinth cover had little effect on aggregate measures of the waterbird community at Lake Chapala, including waterbird density, species richness, and diversity (Simpson's index of diversity), but that some small-bodied, migratory species might avoid sites and/or entire ecosystems with water hyacinth. Although the decision to control water hyacinth and other invasive plants is surely based on a wide assortment of socioeconomic objectives and desired benefits (i.e., protection of municipal water supply), we believe that the ecological response to nonnative plants and potential control methods should be evaluated. Our results suggest a benign relationship between water hyacinth and waterbirds, with the potential exception of some small-bodied, migratory species. Understanding the waterbird response to water hyacinth provides critical pieces in the ecological and socioeconomic puzzle of invasive plant science and management and can help managers evaluate the benefits and costs of control more holistically. ¬© Weed Science Society of America.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: A.M.

Methods: The present analysis included 381 women enrolled in the Study of Women and Babies (SOWB) during 2010-2011, from eight South African villages in the Limpopo Province, South Africa. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) occurred in half of the villages. Questionnaires regarding various demographic and medical factors were administered and blood samples were obtained. We classified the women into three exposure groups by type of residence: unsprayed village (n = 175), IRS village in household with a low likelihood of DDT use (non-DDT IRS household, n = 106), IRS village in household with a high likelihood of DDT use (DDT IRS household, n = 100). We used multivariable models of natural log-transformed DDT plasma levels (in micrograms per liter) and DDE (in micrograms per liter) to identify predictors for each group. Results: Median levels of DDT and DDE among women in unsprayed villages were 0.3 [interquartile range (IQR): 0.1-0.9] and 1.7 (IQR: 0.7-5.5), respectively. Median levels of DDT and DDE among women in DDT IRS households were 2.6 (IQR: 1.1-6.6) and 8.5 (IQR: 4.7-18.0), respectively. In unsprayed villages, women with water piped to the yard, rather than a public tap, had 73% lower DDT (95% CI: -83, -57%) and 61% lower DDE (95% CI: -74, -40%) levels. In DDT IRS households, women who reported taking more than six actions to prepare their home before IRS (e.g., covering water and food) had 40% lower DDT levels (95% CI: -63, -0.3%) than women who took fewer than four actions. Conclusion: The predictors of DDT and DDE plasma levels identified in the present study may inform interventions aimed at decreasing exposure. Among households where DDT is likely to be used for IRS, education regarding home preparations may provide an interventional target.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 21; Correspondence Address: K.

A nine-year study of parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) from Pacific Canada indicates that adaptive changes in parasite management on salmon farms have yielded positive conservation outcomes. After four years of sea lice epizootics and wild salmon population decline, parasiticide application on salmon farms was adapted to the timing of wild salmon migrations. Winter treatment of farm fish with parasiticides, prior to the out-migration of wild juvenile salmon, has reduced epizootics of wild salmon without significantly increasing the annual number of treatments. Levels of parasites on wild juvenile salmon significantly influence the growth rate of affected salmon populations, suggesting that these changes in management have had positive outcomes for wild salmon populations. These adaptive changes have not occurred through formal adaptive management, but rather, through multi-stakeholder processes arising from a contentious scientific and public debate. Despite the apparent success of parasite control on salmon farms in the study region, there remain concerns about the long-term sustainability of this approach because of the unknown ecological effects of parasticides and the potential for parasite resistance to chemical treatments. ¬© 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 34; CODEN: ECAPE,10.1890/12-0519.1,Adaptive management;Aquaculture;Host-parasite;Lepeophtheirus salmonis;Migration;Pacific Canada;Parasiticide;Salmon;Sea lice;adaptation;adaptive management;aquaculture;crustacean;disease prevalence;growth rate;host-parasite interaction;juvenile;migration;parasitic disease;pesticide;physiological response;population decline;salmonid;sustainability;wild population,NA,NA,cessation of a salmon decline with control of parasites

These inconsistent results may stem from the fact that exposure typically occurs in the context of fish consumption, which is also associated with cardioprotective factors such as omega-3 fatty acids. Mechanistic information may help to understand whether MeHg represents a risk to cardiovascular health. MeHg is a pro-oxidant that inactivates protein sulfhydryls. These biochemical effects may diminish critical antioxidant defense mechanism(s) involved in protecting against atherosclerosis. One such defense mechanism is paraoxonase-1 (PON1), an enzyme present on high-density lipoproteins and that prevents the oxidation of blood lipids and their deposition in vascular endothelium. PON1 is potentially useful as a clinical biomarker of cardiovascular risk, as well as a critical enzyme in the detoxification of certain organophosphate oxons. MeHg and other metals are known to inhibit PON1 activity in vitro. MeHg is associated with lowered serum PON1 activity in a fish-eating population. The implications of lowering PON1 are evaluated by predicting the shift in PON1 population distribution induced by various doses of MeHg. An MeHg dose of 0.3 g/kg/d is estimated to decrease the population average PON1 level by 6.1% and to increase population risk of acute cardiovascular events by 9.7%. This evaluation provides a plausible mechanism for MeHg-induced cardiovascular risk and suggests means to quantify the risk. This case study exemplifies the use of upstream disease biomarkers to evaluate the additive effect of chemical toxicity with background disease processes in assessing human risk.

Methods: In 2006-2007, 111 French ophthalmologists prospectively enrolled 339 cases of POAG and 339 age-matched controls with OHT. After a clinical examination with assessment of ocular risk factors, the ophthalmologist filled, during face-to-face interview, a detailed questionnaire developed by nutritionists and epidemiologist on lifestyle and environmental risk factors, including socio-demographic variables, dietary habits related to omega-3 fatty acids intake, smoking and alcohol drinking and professional exposure to pesticides and other chemicals. Associations of POAG with risk factors were estimated using conditional logistic regression, with adjustment for age, gender and duration of disease. Results: In the final multivariate model, by comparison with OHT, POAG was significantly associated with more frequent use of pesticides during the professional life [OR = 2.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-6.78, p = 0.04] and with low consumption of fatty fish (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.10-4.17, p = 0.02) and walnuts (OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.18-3.47, p = 0.01). POAG was also associated with higher frequency of heavy smoking (40 pack-years or more, OR = 3.93, 95% CI: 1.12-13.80, p = 0.03) but not with moderate (20-40 pack-years) and light smoking (<20 pack-years). Conclusions: These exploratory observations suggest a protective effect of omega-3 fatty acids and a deleterious effect of heavy smoking and professional exposure to pesticides in POAG.

Recent developments in efficient computer-based video analyses have allowed testing pesticide effects on model species such as the zebrafish. However, these new techniques have not yet been applied to amphibians and directly to conservation issues. i.e., to assess toxicological risks on threatened species. We used video-tracking analyses to test a quantitative effect of an environmental contaminant on the locomotion of amphibian tadpoles (Rana temporaria) by taking into account cumulative effects. Because recent research has demonstrated effects of de-icing salts on survival and community structure, we used sodium chloride in our experimental design (25 replicates, 4 concentrations, 4 times) to test for an effect at the scale of behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations. Analysis of 372 1-h video-tracks (5 samples/s) showed a complex action of salts on behavioral patterns with a dose and cumulative response over time. Although no effects were found on mortality or growth, the highest salt concentrations reduced the speed and movement of tadpoles in comparison with control treatments. The reduced locomotor performance could have detrimental consequences in terms of tadpoles' responses to competition and predation and may be an indicator of the low concentration effect of the contaminant. On one hand, this study demonstrates the usefulness of examining behavior to address conservation issues and understand the complex action of environmental factors and, more particularly, pollutants on organisms. On the other hand, our results highlight the need of new computerized techniques to quantitatively analyze these patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Among others, the non-LEE encoded T3SS effector protein NleC of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a Zn-dependent metalloprotease and suppresses innate immune responses by directly targeting the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Many pathogenic bacteria release potent bacterial toxins of the A-B type, which-in contrast to the direct cytoplasmic injection of T3SS effector proteins-are released first into the environment. In this study, we found that NleC displays characteristics of bacterial A-B toxins, when applied to eukaryotic cells as a recombinant protein. Although lacking a B subunit, that typically mediates the uptake of toxins, recombinant NleC (rNleC) induces endocytosis via lipid rafts and follows the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. The conformation of rNleC is altered by low pH to facilitate its escape from acidified endosomes. This is reminiscent of the homologous A-B toxin AIP56 of the fish pathogen Photobacterium damselae piscicida (Phdp). The recombinant protease NleC is functional inside eukaryotic cells and cleaves p65 of the NF-kappa B pathway. Here, we describe the endocytic uptake mechanism of rNleC, characterize its intracellular trafficking and demonstrate that its specific activity of cleaving p65 requires activation of host cells e.g., by IL1 beta. Further, we propose an evolutionary link between some T3SS effector proteins and bacterial toxins from apparently unrelated bacteria. In summary, these properties might suggest rNleC as an interesting candidate for future applications as a potential therapeutic against immune disorders.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  88,10.3389/fcimb.2017.00119     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),T3SS effectors;NleC;A-B toxins;EPEC;endocytosis;NF-kappa B signaling;endosomal escape;CELL-PENETRATING PEPTIDES;III SECRETION SYSTEM;HOST INNATE IMMUNE;HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS;DAMSELAE SUBSP PISCICIDA;INTRACELLULAR TRAFFICKING;RETROGRADE TRANSPORT;CHOLERA-TOXIN;SHIGA TOXIN;SUBSTRATE RECOGNITION;Escherichia coli,NA,NA,t3ssindependent uptake of the shorttrip toxinrelated recombinant nlec effector of enteropathogenic <i>escherichia coli<i> leads to nfŒ∫b p65 cleavage

Water samples were taken in order to determine the river's physicochemical profile. An integrative approach was applied using a biomarker index.        The bioassay involved the use of laboratory culture adult animals, acclimatized in moderately hard water (MHW) and fed ad libitum. A semi-static 96 h bioassay was conducted and the experimental groups were as follows: [1] river water (Rg); [2] river water + 2 mg/L Cd (RgCd); [3] MHW + 2 mg/L Cadmium (Cd), positive metal control; [4] MHW + 5 mg/L Cydophosphamide (positive genotoxicity control-CP); [5] MWH, negative control (NC). At the end of the exposure time fishes were sectioned and the following biomarkers were determined: 1) condition factor rate (CF); 2) for the anterior section (A) (head): glutathione (GSH) and protein (Pr) content; 3) for the body midsection (M) (viscera): Pr, GSH, Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Blood samples were also taken from the fish specimens to estimate the frequency of micronuclei (MN) as well as other nuclear abnormalities (NA).        The physicochemical profile of the river water sample indicated high Copper concentrations. CAT and SOD activity and total Pr content did not show any significant changes. GST activity decreased in fish exposed to Rg, while GSH content decreased significantly for all treatments compared to controls in MHW. These results would seem to point to a reduction in cell defense capability as a result of the depletion antioxidants such as GSH. The NA frequency increased significantly in all treated groups while MN frequency was increased only in Cd and CP groups.        Using some the biomarkers measured, a biomarker index was estimated which revealed that fish exposed to Rg were 90% affected or highly affected, while those exposed to RgCd were 80% and Cd 68% affected or highly affected.

Spinosyn rhamnosyltransferase (SpnG) is a key biocatalyst with unique sequence identity and controls the biosynthetic maturation of spinosyn. The rhamnose is critical for the spinosyn insecticidal activity and cell wall biosynthesis of the spinosyn producer, Saccharopolyspora spinosa. In this study, we have functionally expressed and characterized SpnG and the three enzymes, Gdh, Epi, and Kre, responsible for dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis in S. spinosa by purified enzymes from Escherichia coli. Most notably, the substrate specificity of SpnG was thoroughly characterized by kinetic and inhibition experiments using various NDP sugar analogs made by an in situ combination of NDP-sugar-modifying enzymes. SpnG was found to exhibit striking substrate promiscuity, yielding corresponding glycosylated variants.

To defend host-generated oxidants, Salmonella encodes primary antioxidants and protein repair enzymes. Methionine (Met) residues are highly prone to oxidation and convert into methionine sulfoxide (Met-SO) which compromises protein functions and subsequently cellular survival. However, by reducing Met-SO to Met, methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) enhance cellular survival under stress conditions. Salmonella encodes five Msrs which are specific for particular Met-SO (free/protein bound), and 'R'/'S' types. Earlier studies assessed the effect of deletions of one or two msrs on the stress physiology of S. Typhimurium. We generated a pan msr gene deletion (Delta 5msr) strain in S. Typhimurium. The Delta 5msr mutant strain shows an initial lag in in vitro growth. However, the Delta 5msr mutant strain depicts very high sensitivity (p < 0.0001) to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), chloramine T (ChT) and superoxide-generating oxidant paraquat. Further, the Delta 5msr mutant strain shows high levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls, and protein aggregation. On the other side, the Delta 5msr mutant strain exhibits lower levels of free amines. Further, the Delta 5msr mutant strain is highly susceptible to neutrophils and shows defective fitness in the spleen and liver of mice. The results of the current study suggest that the deletions of all msrs render S.

American-Indian/Alaska-Native (AI/AN) children may have a disproportionate burden of stressors from their built and natural environments when compared to children from other races/ethnicities. Our objectives were to identify chemical and non-chemical stressors from AI/AN children's built and natural environments and evaluate their linkages with health and wellbeing outcomes from the peer reviewed literature. Library databases (e.g. PubMed) were searched to identify studies focused on these stressors. References were excluded if they: did not discuss AI/AN children or they were not the primary cohort; discussed tribes outside the United States (U.S.); were reviews or intervention studies; or did not discuss stressors from the built/natural environments. Out of 2539 references, 35 remained. Sample populations were predominantly (70%) in New York (NY) and Alaska (AK); 14 studies reported on the same cohort. Studies with matching stressors and outcomes were few, ruling out a quantitative review. Respiratory and developmental outcomes were the main outcomes evaluated. Primary nonchemical stressors were residential proximity to polluted landscapes, lack of indoor plumbing, and indoor use of wood for heating or cooking. The main chemical stressors were volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM 2.5), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p, p'-DDE, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), lead, and mercury. Our qualitative review was suggestive of a potential increase in respiratory illness from indoor wood use or no plumbing, which can be used as a guide to promote healthy environments for AI/AN children. We identified limited studies (< 40), demonstrating this population as understudied. Future studies need to consider: sample populations from other tribes in the U.S., stressors outside the household, other elements of the natural environment, and an evaluation of stressors from AI/AN children's total environment (built, natural, and social).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  58,10.1515/reveh-2018-0034     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Alaska Native;American Indian;built environment;children;natural environment;RESPIRATORY-TRACT INFECTION;WOOD-BURNING STOVES;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS;FISH CONSUMPTION;MOHAWK WOMEN;PCB CONCENTRATIONS;INDIAN-CHILDREN;BIRTH OUTCOMES;OPEN DUMPSITES;FARM INJURIES;Only Child;Indians, North American;Child",NA,NA,review of built and natural environment stressors impacting americanindianalaskanative children

However, the mechanism of alachlor-induced oxidative stress is poorly understood. We found that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide anions were increased only after long-term exposure to alachlor, suggesting that alachlor is not a pro-oxidant. It is likely that alachlor-induced oxidative stress may result from protein denaturation because alachlor rapidly induced an increased protein aggregation, leading to upregulation of SSA4 and HSP82 genes encoding heat shock proteins (Hsp) of Hsp70 and Hsp90 family, respectively. Although only SOD1 encoding Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), but not SOD2 encoding Mn-SOD, is essential for alachlor tolerance, both SODs play a crucial role in reducing alachlor-induced ROS. We found that, after alachlor exposure, glutathione production was inhibited while its utilization was increased, suggesting the role of glutathione in protecting cells against alachlor, which becomes more important when lacking Cu/Zn-SOD. Based on our results, it seems that alachlor primarily causes damages to cellular macromolecules such as proteins, leading to an induction of endogenous oxidative stress, of which intracellular antioxidant defense systems are required for elimination.

Initial tracer-dye, water-quality, potentiometric surface, and biologic data collection centered around Shelta Cave, the historic type locality in northwest Huntsville (now considered an extirpated population), and in caves, sinks, springs, and wells within the presumed recharge area for Bobcat Cave, the only known population location since 1975. Based on historical and collected data on the hydrologic characteristics of the present and extirpated population habitats, USFWS expanded the study area to include other aquifer systems and karst areas in north Alabama. Additional cave shrimp populations were discovered in three hydrologically connected caves in southeast Madison County. Geologic and hydrologic regimes differ between the three areas of known populations. Water quality and the presence of karstic ""windows"" to lower aquifer levels appear to be key to species survival and continued sustainability. The presence of residual pesticides, particularly termite treatment chemicals, in soils and ground water in and surrounding Shelta Cave indicate that water quality may be the primary factor in the extirpation of the Alabama cave shrimp and the severe reduction of other aquatic species in this ground-water system. Continued hydrologic and biologic monitoring of Bobcat Cave shows the presence of single, brief pollution events, but little indication of increasing water-quality degradation. The isolated location on Redstone Arsenal (RSA) and the restricted, anomalous, north-trending recharge area of Bobcat Cave may offer additional protection from environmental impacts. The continued sustainability of cave shrimp populations in the dynamic karst system in southeast Madison County is more at risk from environmental impacts, such as water-quality degradation, loss of habitat, and potential decrease in seasonal flows, due to rapid residential development and increased agro-economic activities (timber harvesting) in this area. Additional tracer-dye studies and modeling of the karst hydrology may be needed to make educated decisions about the future coexistence of increasing development and the present cave shrimp habitats in this area.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  22,,,NA,NA,characterizing potential environmental impacts to an endangered species habitat in karst waters

A 90 % of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed and 75 % of mineralization was achieved after the treatment of the mixture. Almost 92 % of the toxicity was eliminated making this technique a promising process to treat toxic mixtures of these pesticides.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  33,10.1007/s11270-016-2903-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Synergistic effect;UV/H2O2;Degradation pathways;Toxicity;Mineralization;SOLAR PHOTO-FENTON;PILOT-SCALE;EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN;WASTE;WATER;OXIDATION;FUNGICIDE;REMOVAL;TIO2;Pesticides,NA,NA,degradation of a toxic mixture of the pesticides carbofuran and iprodione by uvh<sub>2<sub>o<sub>2<sub> evaluation of parameters and implications of the degradation pathways on the synergistic effects

Acta,107,4,263-270,"NEUWINGER, HD",,English,,,"Fishing with the aid of plant toxins was formerly very common in tropical Africa. Today this easy method of fishing is still practised in remote areas. The method is simple: the poisonous ingredients are pounded and thrown into a pool or dammed-up sections of a small river. After a short time the fish begin to rise to the surface and can then readily be taken by hand. The fish can be eaten without health problems. The main active compounds are saponins, rotenoids and diterpene esters. Such biologically active plants are of great interest to scientists of various disciplines. Some of these plants provide important insecticides, many play an important part in traditional medicine and in preparation or arrow poisons.        258 fish-poisoning plants are presented, based on 25 years of field research by the author in tropical Africa and evaluations of herbarium notes. 10-20 per cent of the fishing poisons are probably still unknown. They are spread among 167 plant genera and 60 families. The evaluation shows a clear dominance of the Leguminosae (Caesalpiniaceae, Mimosaceae, Papilionaceae) in the hierarchy of the fish poisoning plants. It is also remarkable that a great proportion are in the Euphorbiaceae.

Various approaches were examined to produce affinity, mixed mode, and hydrophobic charge induction type adsorbents. In clean monocomponent systems affinity supports created by direct attachment of glucose or maltose to amine-terminated iron oxide particles could bind concanavalin A at levels of up to approximate to 280 mg g(-1) support with high affinity (approximate to 1 muM dissociation constants). However, the best performance was delivered by adsorbents featuring coupled tentacular dextran chains displaying a maximum binding capacity of 238 mg g(-1) and a dissociation constant of 0.13 muM. Adsorbents derivatized with mixed mode or hydrophobic charge induction ligands likewise demonstrated very high capacities for both concanavalin A and Lens culinaris agglutinin (greater than or equal to 250 mg g(-1)) with dissociation constants in the micromolar range, though neither of these systems showed any selectivity for lectins in leguminous extracts.        When the affinity supports were applied to carbohydrate containing legume extracts only the dextran-linked adsorbents supplied sufficient competition to dissolved sugars to selectively bind concanavalin A in an extract of jack beans. The dextran-linked supports were employed in a high-gradient magnetic fishing experiment, in which concanavalin A was purified to near homogeneity from a crude, unclarified extract of jack beans.

To evaluate the impact of available DNT studies on individual chemical risk assessments, the ways in which data from these studies are being used in pesticide risk assessment were investigated. In addition, the neurobehavioral and neuropathological parameters affected at the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for each study were evaluated to ascertain whether some types of endpoints were consistently more sensitive than others. As of December 2008, final OPP reviews of DNT studies for 72 pesticide chemicals were available; elimination of studies with major deficiencies resulted in a total of 69 that were included in this analysis. Of those studies, 15 had been used to determine the point of departure for one or more risk assessment scenarios, and an additional 13 were determined to have the potential for use as a point of departure for future risk assessments (selection is dependent upon review of the entire database available at the time of reassessment). Analysis of parameters affected at the study LOAELs indicated that no single parameter was consistently more sensitive than another. Early assessment time points (e.g., postnatal day (PND) 11/21) tended to be more sensitive than later time points (e.g., PND 60). These results demonstrate that data generated using the current guideline DNT study protocol are useful in providing points of departure for risk assessments. The results of these studies also affirm the importance of evaluating a spectrum of behavioral and neuropathological endpoints, in both young and adult animals, to improve the detection of the potential for a chemical to cause developmental neurotoxicity.

Growth performance and immune responses were evaluated after 85 days of feeding trial. Sole (IBW = 16.07 +/- 0.11 g) were fed six experimental diets, a control diet (CTRL, without the dietary probiotic supplementation), and five diets supplemented with probiotic bacteria: PB1 (Shewanella hafniensis), PB2 (Enterococcus raffinosus), PB3 (Shewanella hafniensis + Arthrobacter soli), PB4 (Pseudomonas protegens + Arthrobacter soli) and PB5 (Shewanella hafniensis + Arthrobacter soli + Enterococcus raffinosus). All bacteria were selected based on their in vitro antimicrobial activity. After the growth trial, fish were submitted to a stress factor (transport) and then each dietary group was divided in two additional groups: non-infected (placebo) and infected with Photobacteriutn damselae subsp. piscicida. Immune and antioxidant responses were evaluated at day 10 post-infection. In infection trial A, fish were infected on the same day of transport, whereas in trial B fish were infected after a 7-day recovery from the transport stress. At the end of the feeding trial, fish fed with PB2 and PB4 showed lower final body weight when compared with the other dietary groups. Respiratory burst activity and nitric oxide production were not affected by probiotic supplementation. Fish fed with PB5 presented lower peroxidase activity compared to CTRL. Lysozyme and alternative complement pathway activity (ACH50) showed no significant differences between treatments. The innate immune responses were significantly affected after handling stress and bacterial infection. In trial A, the ACH50 levels of infected fish were significantly lower than the placebo groups. On the other hand, in trial B fish infected with Pdp demonstrated higher ACH50 levels when compared to placebos. Peroxidase levels were strongly modulated by bacterial infection and handling stress. In trials A and B, infection had a clear downgrade effect in peroxidase levels. Lipid peroxidation, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase were altered by both bacterial infection and transport.

Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of prometryne (0.51, 8, and 80 mu g/l) for 14, 30, and 60 days. Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR), as well as levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) were assessed in brain, gill, intestine, liver, and muscle. After 14 days exposure, decreased GR activity in brain was observed for all prometryne-exposed groups compared with the controls. Changes were observed in SOD activity in brain and gill after 30 days in all exposure groups. Changes in CAT activity were observed only at the highest concentration (80 mu g/l) in liver and intestine after 60 days. The observed effects on carp antioxidant systems may be a defense against oxidative damage. The study demonstrated changes in antioxidant parameters and the importance of evaluating the potential long-term risk to fish of prometryne, at environmentally realistic concentrations (0.51 mu g/l).

This Regulation required the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 16 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 10 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force, which originally consisted of Dow AgroScience B. V. and BASF Agro B. V. BASF sold the business of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene to Kanesho Soil Treatment BVBA on 17 December 2003 and therefore was replaced in the Task Force. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 8 November 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.        A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 February 2006 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 12 May 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 72).        Following the Commission Decision of 20 September 2007 (2007/619/EC) 6 concerning the noninclusion of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicants, Dow AgroScience B. V. and Kanesho Soil Treatment BVBA made a resubmission application for the inclusion of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene in Annex I, in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20087. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report (European Commission, 2007) as follows:.        A finalised assessment of consumer exposure.        The environmental fate and ecotoxicology of the substance.        Lack of data on the persistency, toxicological behaviour, uptake from crops, accumulation, metabolic fate and residue level of certain polychlorinated impurities        and concerns were identified with regard to:.        The potential contamination of groundwater.        The consumer exposure.        The risk to birds, mammals and aquatic organisms.        Its possible impact on non-target organisms        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Spain, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene in the format of an Additional Report (Spain, 2009a). The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 15 April 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 20 April 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 25 May 2009. At the same time the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 2 July 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days.        The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS' evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific telephone conferences with Member State experts in September 2009.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in all areas.        The original conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a nematicide as proposed by the applicants. The application to bare soil comprises either introduction of the formulated product into the drip irrigation system ("" EF-1478"") or soil injection at 15-20 cm depth ("" XRM-5048"") to control nematodes in soil where tomatoes or peppers will be grown. The application rates are up to 283 kg (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene per hectare ("" EF-1478"") and up to 224 kg per hectare ("" XRM-5048""), respectively. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene can be used as nematicide, insecticide, fungicide and herbicide, depending on the dose rate used. In general, an application of (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene by soil injection and/or drip irrigation is followed by partial sterilisation of the soil. It should be noted that the applicants stated that only the use as a nematicide would be supported in the EU review programme. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative use as a nematicide.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation under the resubmission were the same as for the original submission, ` Telone EC Drip (EF-1478)', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Southern European countries, and ` Telone Injected (XRM-5048)' a liquid formulation (AL), registered under different trade names in the EU.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible.        (EZ)-1,3-dichloropopene is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised in the rat. The acute oral and dermal toxicity is high and the inhalatory toxicity is moderate, proposed classification and risk phrases are T; R24/25 "" Toxic in contact with and if swallowed"" and R20 "" Harmful by inhalation"". It is a skin irritant and sensitizer, proposed classification and risk phrases are R38 "" Irritant to skin"" and R43 "" May cause sensitization by skin contact"". According to medical data 1,3-dichloropopene should also be classified as irritant to eyes and to the respiratory system, proposed classification and risk phrases are R36/R37 "" Irritating to eyes and respiratory system"" and R65 "" May cause lung damage if swallowed"". The Technical Committee for Classification and Labelling in 2005 agreed not to classify 1,3-D as mutagenic or carcinogenic, unless epichlorhydrin (a known carcinogen) had been used as a stabiliser. The applicants confirmed that the current product is not stabilised with epichlorhydrin. No reproduction toxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. The metabolites (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol8 and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid9 are both toxic. Dependent on the identity on the polychlorinated impurities, it might be necessary to require new toxicological studies. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.025 mg/kg bw/day, with the use of the safety factor of 100. The systemic Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100. As inhalation exposure is the main route of exposure and all data from operator exposure are expressed as atmospheric concentration (mg/m3), an additional inhalatory human AOEC was assigned which is 0.45 mg/m3. The ARfD is 0.2 mg/kg bw, with the safety factor of 100 added. The operator and worker exposure during drip irrigation activities is below the AOEL with the use of PPE and RPE; the estimated exposure levels for a bystander at > 7 m from the site of application are below the AOEC, however at closer distances estimated exposure levels exceed the AOEC. During soil injection activities the operator, worker and bystander exposure estimates show levels below the AOEC (operator and worker wearing PPE and RPE).        The degradation and metabolism of 1,3-D has been studied comparatively in fruit (tomatoes and citrus), root vegetables (sugar beet), pulses and oilseeds (soybeans) following application of radiolabelled material to the soil surrounding the tree, or to the soil in which seeds were planted. Additional information from succeeding crop studies is given on leafy crops (lettuce) and cereals (wheat).        Even though a high amount of applied 1,3-D is expected to volatilise from soil, the results of the available studies indicate that 1,3-D is also absorbed into plants, translocated and degraded. Naturally occurring plant constituents contained the majority of radioactivity recovered in edible plant parts, indicating complete metabolism of 1,3-D. Consequently, no 1,3-D residues above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are expected to be present in primary or succeeding crops. This was confirmed by supervised residue trials data.        In the resubmission dossier of 2009 a number of additional residue trials were provided to allow some further clarification with regard to manufacturing process impurities that are applied to the soil in high amounts when 1,3-D is used at the notified application rate.        1,3-D and six impurities (1, 2, 3, 5b, 5c and 8a) were analysed. 1,3-D and its six studied impurities did not leave detectable residues in the crop.        However, even though potential chronic and acute dietary exposure to residues of 1,3-D per se from tomatoes and peppers is well below the ADI (< 10%) and ARfD (< 2%), respectively the consumer risk assessment cannot be considered as finalised in relation to 11 manufacturing process impurities. The consumer risk assessment is pending a conclusion on the fate and behaviour of these 11 identified impurities in the environment, and/or with regard to toxicological data on manufacturing process impurities in the updated specification in the section on mammalian toxicology.        (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene is a volatile liquid, so even though it is injected below the soil surface or applied via drip irrigation systems, the major route of dissipation from soil is volatilisation to the air. In aerobic laboratory soil studies it exhibited low to moderate persistence and formed the major (> 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid which exhibited very low to moderate persistence and the minor (< 10% AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited very low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 11-37% AR at 49-77 days. At these times unextracted soil residue accounted for 9-28% AR.        In laboratory soil batch adsorption studies (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene exhibited very high to high mobility. (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid exhibited very high soil mobility.        In a laboratory study on a natural sediment water system (25 degrees C) with dosing under the water surface, volatilisation was again the major route of dissipation of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene from the systems. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene exhibited low persistence and formed the minor (< 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation products (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid and (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 57% AR at 21 days. At this time unextracted sediment residues accounted for 14% AR. Acceptable surface aquatic system PEC are only available.        FOCUS groundwater 'tier I' modelling indicates that at the spatial scale usually assessed of the treated field, there is a very high potential for the contamination of groundwater by parent (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid. The results from an extensive targeted EU groundwater monitoring program are available. With the exception of the monitored areas in France, where critical details regarding the program are missing, this program indicates for the historical intensity of use of 1,3-D in the monitored areas, at the points of drinking water abstraction that were sampled, groundwater contamination by parent (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene > 0.1 mu g/L had not occurred. Contamination above this level by (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid had occurred but rarely (2 samples from different wells out of the 50 taken in the Spanish region of Caceres where the concentrations were 0.116 and 0.413 mu g/L). In all other monitored wells (92) (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid was < 0.1 mu g/L. It has been concluded that there is information missing that is needed to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment in relation to 11 manufacturing process impurities.        (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene volatilises from soil even though it is applied below the soil surface. The flux losses from the soil have been measured in field studies in the USA that have been assessed as being representative for EU conditions. Member State experts' and the EFSA considered sufficient information has been provided to conclude that the (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene that will reach the upper atmosphere will degrade relatively rapidly and that this compound and its potential atmospheric degradation products are unlikely to have an adverse effect on the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, as they will be relatively short lived in this environmental compartment. For 10 manufacturing process impurities, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) calculations, on the rate of photo-oxidative reactions with hydroxyl radicals in the upper atmosphere, indicate that these impurities could be subject to long range transport through the atmosphere.        Studies to address the data gaps identified in the EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 72 were provided for the resubmission. Confirmatory data on the compliance of the ecotoxicological test batches to the new specifications are still missing. The indoor use in glasshouse is defined as a permanent structure to which entry of birds and mammals is limited and hence the risk to birds and mammals for the indoor uses is regarded to be low. A high acute risk to earthworm-eating and insectivorous birds and mammals and a long-term risk to earthworm-eating and insectivorous mammals was identified for the outdoor uses. The risk was addressed in a refined risk assessment for herbivorous, insectivorous and earthworm-eating birds and mammals, based on worst case concentrations from residue studies in plants, insects and earthworms. All TER values for acute, short-term and long-term risk meet Annex VI triggers, indicating a low risk to birds and mammals from the intended outdoor use.        Available data indicated a similar level of aquatic toxicity for (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene and 3chloroallyl alcohol to fish and Daphnia which was higher that the toxicity of 3-chloroacrylic acid. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene was however less toxic to algae and Lemna than the two metabolites, which had a similar toxicity. Based on the acute endpoints both the active substance and the metabolites should be classified as very toxic to the aquatic environment. The EFSA Scientific Report (2006) concluded that the acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms from the indoor use via drip irrigation could be regarded as low without the need for risk mitigation measures. The risk associated with this use will therefore not be considered further. For the outdoor use the risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low based on CHAIN-2D CODE model exposure data including 3 m buffer zones for (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene, 3-chloroallyl alcohol and 3-chloroacrylic acid.        Extended laboratory studies on Folsomia candida, Hypoaspis aculeifer, Poecilus cupreus, Pardosa spp. and Aleochara bilineata are available but have several deficiencies (exposure method, late introduction of test species and lack of positive control product). In addition a field study was considered to inadequate (poor test design). A new field study from North Italy assessing the effect of telone II on arthropods and earthworms indicated no significant effects on arthropods. Transient effects on earthworms were observed, lasting less than 6 months post-treatment. Several shortcomings in the field study were however identified (e. g. use of other pesticides, low collection rate of collembolan and earthworms). Member state experts agreed that the new field study should only be used to refine the risk assessment for the intended use (tomatoes and soil injection) and only in case the statistical power of the field study could be confirmed.        A high acute risk to earthworms was observed. The risk may be addressed by the field study mentioned above. However, the statistical power of the study still needs to be confirmed. The applicant provided a supportive study on abundance and diversity of earthworms in South Europe. Field surveys in November and February indicated low number of earthworms in fields potential treated with soil fumigants.        The risk to non-target soil micro-organisms was assessed as low based on higher tier field studies. Buffer zones of 3 m were required to address the risk to non-target plants. It could not be excluded that 1,3-D might be harmful if the waste water goes to sewage treatment plants. A concern was raised that washing water from cleaning tools should not be disposed into surface water due to effects on activated sludge.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  0,10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1341     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),"(EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;nematicide;Pesticides;Risk Assessment",NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance <i>ez<i>13dichloropropene european food safety authority

Nevertheless, there are only few studies that assess the effects of these xenobiotics on amphibians. Clomazone is an herbicide widely used in rice fields, where amphibian species live. Thus, those species may be threatened by non-target exposure. However, nanoparticles are being developed to be used as a carrier system for the agrochemicals. Such nanoparticles release the herbicide in a modified way, and are considered to be more efficient and less harmful to the environment. The aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate the effect of clomazone in its free form and associated with nanoparticles, in the liver of bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) when submitted to acute exposure for 96 h. According to semi-quantitative analysis, there was an increase in the frequency of melanomacrophage centres, in the accumulation of eosinophils and in lipidosis in the liver of experimental groups exposed to clomazone in its free form and associated with nanoparticles in comparison with the control group, and the nanotoxicity of chitosan-alginate nanoparticles. The increase of melanomacrophage centres in all exposed groups was significant (P < 0.0001) in comparison to control group. Therefore, the results of this research have shown that exposure to sublethal doses of the herbicide and nanoparticles triggered hepatic responses. Moreover, these results provided important data about the effect of the clomazone herbicide and organic nanoparticles, which act as carriers of agrochemicals, on the bullfrog tadpole liver.

Yet, little information is known regarding its impact onmicroalgae. We investigated the uptake and toxicity of TPhP on two freshwater microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (CV) and Scenedesmus obliquus (SO) after exposure to 10 mu g/l-10 mg/l for 5 days. The presence of microalgae significantly enhanced TPhP degradation, with the final concentrations dropped to 5.5-35.1% of the original concentrations. Most of the medium TPhP were sorbed and transformed by microalgae in just one day. Growth of CV was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas growth of SO were only inhibited significantly at 10 mg/l TPhP exposure. Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics revealed concentration- and species-dependent metabolic responses. Exposure to TPhP in CV resulted in enhanced respiration (increase of fumarate and malate) and osmoregulation (increase of sucrose and myo-inositol), synthesis of membrane lipids (accumulation of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), decrease of lysoglycerolipids, fatty acids, and glyceryl-glucoside). Exposure to TPhP in SO resulted in enhanced osmoregulation (increase of valine, proline, and raffinose) and lipolysis (decrease of MGDG, accumulation of fatty acids, lysophospholipids, and glycerol phosphate). Although chlorophyll a and b contents did not change significantly, decrease of chlorophyll derivatives was observed in both CV and SO at high exposure concentrations. Further bioassays confirmed that CV exhibited enhanced membrane integrity and decreased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) possibly as a defense strategy, whereas SO showed disruption of membrane integrity and induction of ROS at 10 mg/l exposure. This study demonstrated the potential of microalgae to remove TPhP in water, and offered new insights for the risk assessment of TPhP on freshwater microalgae using metabolomics.

Despite importance, the function of CosR remains completely unknown mainly because of cell death caused by its knockout mutation. To overcome this technical limitation, in this study, antisense technology was used to investigate the regulatory function of CosR by modulating the level of CosR expression. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) was performed to identify the CosR regulon either by suppressing CosR expression with antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) or by overexpressing CosR in C. jejuni. According to the results of 2DGE, CosR regulated 32 proteins involved in various cellular processes. Notably, CosR negatively regulated a few key proteins of the oxidative stress response of C. jejuni, such as SodB, Dps, Rrc and LuxS, whereas CosR positively controlled AhpC. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that CosR directly bound to the promoter region of the oxidative stress genes. DNase I footprinting assays identified 21-bp CosR binding sequences in the sodB and ahpC promoters, suggesting CosR specifically recognizes and binds to the regulated genes. Interestingly, the level of CosR protein was significantly reduced by paraquat (a superoxide generator) but not by hydrogen peroxide. Consistent with the overall negative regulation of oxidative stress defense proteins by CosR, the CosR knockdown by antisense rendered C. jejuni more resistant to oxidative stress compared to the wild type.

All LC50 values of fluralaner to zebrafish were higher than 10 mg L-1 at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. To study the bioconcentration and elimination, the zebrafish were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of fluralaner (2.00 and 0.20 mg L-1) for 15 d and then held 6 d in clean water. The results showed medium BCF of fluralaner with values of 12.06 (48 h) and 21.34 (144 h) after exposure to 2.00 and 0.20 mg L-1 fluralaner, respectively. In the elimination process, a concentration of only 0.113 mg kg(-1) was found in zebrafish on the 6th day after removal to clean water. After exposure in 2.00 mg L-1 fluralaner, the enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GST, GSH-PX, CarE and content of MDA were measured. Only CAT and CarE activities were significantly regulated and the others stayed at a stable level compared to the control group. Meanwhile, transcriptional expression of CYP1C2, CYP1D1, CYP11A were significantly down-regulated at 12 h exposed to 2.00 mg L-1 of fluralaner. Except CYP1D1, others CYPs were up-regulated at different time during exposure periods.        Fluralaner and its formulated product (BRAVECTO (R)) are of low toxicity to zebrafish and are rapidly concentrated in zebrafish and eliminated after exposure in clean water. Antioxidant defense and metabolic systems were involved in the fluralaner-induced toxicity.

Herein, we have proposed a photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor based on two-dimensional (2D)/3D organic-inorganic heterojunction for the efficient detection of Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium). The heterojunction was established via the in situ growth of copper (II) selenide (CuSe) nanosheets around the photoactive triazine covalent-organic polymer (COP) nanospheres, which was synthesized using 2,4,6-Tris(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-Triazine (TAPT) and 2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetricarbaldehyde (Tp) as building blocks (denoted as TAPT-Tp-COP@CuSe). Integrating the features of TAPT-Tp-COP (such as large specific surface and pore size, multi-functionality, and rich defects) and CuSe (such as high photoabsorption ability, fast electron transfer and effective separation of the photo-generated charge carrier) not only can accelerate the photoelectric transformation efficiency, but also can promote the aptamer immobilization. Consequently, the constructed PEC aptasensor based on TAPT-Tp-COP@CuSe illustrated a low detection limit of 3.4 CFU mL-1 with a linear range from 1 x 101 to 1 x 105 CFU mL-1 toward S. typhimurium.

Using an 87-compound library provided by the National Toxicology Program, consisting of known and suspected neurotoxicants, including drugs, flame retardants, industrial chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and presumptive negative controls, we further evaluate the benefits and limitations of the system for medium-throughput screening, focusing on the technical aspects of the system. We show that, in the context of this library, planarians are the most sensitive to pesticides with 16/16 compounds causing toxicity and the least sensitive to PAHs, with only 5/17 causing toxicity. Furthermore, while none of the presumptive negative controls were bioactive in adult planarians, 2/5, acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid, were bioactive in regenerating worms. Notably, these compounds were previously reported as developmentally toxic in mammalian studies.

After I month in captivity the antioxidant enzymes activities in liver decreased in mullets. while for flounders the responses were not consistent because during the experimental period flounders did not ate and responses of antioxidant enzymes and oxidative damages were dependent on the fasting condition. The liver oxidative damages were evaluated by estimating oxidised lipids and proteins. Both species showed similar levels for these two parameters, The hepatic lipid peroxidation in flounder increased after 1 month in captivity, while in mullet an increase was observed only in summer and autumn. The oxidised protein content increased for both species after the depuration period.        This study reveals differences between species under oxidative stress when exposed to pollutants. In a clean evironment, the mullet's primary antioxidant defences decreased indicating that the animals living in Douro estuary were facing an oxidative stress. The data indicate that. namely in mullet, the presence of pollutants induce oxidative stress responses. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we identified four homologous AraC/XylS regulators, Rob, SoxS, PliA, and OpiA, from the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora Ea1189. Previous studies have shown that the regulators MarA, Rob, and SoxS from Escherichia coli mediate multiple-antibiotic resistance, primarily by upregulating the AcrAB-TolC efflux system. However, none of the four AraC/XylS regulators from E. amylovora was able to induce a multidrug resistance phenotype in the plant pathogen. Overexpression of rob led to a 2-fold increased expression of the acrA gene. However, the rob-overexpressing strain showed increased resistance to only a limited number of antibiotics. Furthermore, Rob was able to induce tolerance to organic solvents in E. amylovora by mechanisms other than efflux. We demonstrated that SoxS from E. amylovora is involved in superoxide resistance. A soxS-deficient mutant of Ea1189 was not able to grow on agar plates supplemented with the superoxide-generating agent paraquat. Furthermore, expression of soxS was induced by redox cycling agents. We identified two novel members of the AraC/XylS family in E. amylovora. PliA was highly upregulated during the early infection phase in apple rootstock and immature pear fruits. Multiple compounds were able to induce the expression of pliA, including apple leaf extracts, phenolic compounds, redox cycling agents, heavy metals, and decanoate.

In the current study, we have cloned a nitroreductase gene, Salmonella typhimurium nitroreductase A (snrA), from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA1535, and characterized the purified gene product. SnrA is 240 amino acids in length and shares 87% sequence identity to the Escherichia coli homolog, E. coli nitroreductase A (NfsA). SnrA is the major nitroreductase in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA1535 and catalyzes nitroreduction through a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism in a NADPH and flavine mononucleotide (FMN) dependent manner. SmA exhibits extremely low levels of FMN reductase activity but the nitroreductase activity of SmA is competitively inhibited by exogenously added FMN. Treatment of TA 1535 with paraquat resulted in induction of nitroreductase activity, suggesting that SnrA is a member of the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SoxRS regulon associated with cellular defense against oxidative damage. Examination of the microbial genomes databases shows that SmA homologs are widely distributed in the microbial world, being present in isolates of both Archea and Eubacteria. Southern hybridization and PCR failed to detect the snrA gene in the closely related S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA 1538. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains TA1535 and TA1538 and their derivatives are commonly used in mutagenicity testing.

The in vitro germination and growth of the propagules of the EUS pathogen, Aphanomyces invadans (=A. piscicida), were assessed in the presence of the head-kidney macrophages, serum, and serum heated to inactivate complement proteins, of three EUS-susceptible and one resistant fish species. The susceptible species were: striped snakehead (Channa striata), giant gourami (Osphronemus gouramy) and silver barb [Barbodes (= Puntius) gonionotus], and the resistant species was Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish of all species were acclimatised to either low temperature (20 degreesC +/- 1.6) at which EUS is known to occur, or to high temperature (32 degrees C +/- 5.0) at which EUS does not occur, except for giant gouramis which were only studied at low temperature. The respiratory burst of the macrophages was assessed in the presence of A. invadans or the stimulant phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and compared to that of controls. Anti-A. invadans antibody concentrations were assessed in all species except silver barbs. All assays were carried out at the same temperature, regardless of the temperature that the fish were kept at.        Macrophages of all species other than snakeheads inhibited fungal germination at both temperatures, though only silver barb and gourami macrophages could inhibit germling growth. PMA increased the respiratory burst in nearly all cases. The respiratory burst in the presence of A. invadans was consistently lower than that of controls, though the difference was only significant in the case of snakeheads. The respiratory burst of all macrophage treatments was higher at a low temperature. Except in the case of PMA-stimulated macrophages, regressions between respiratory burst and inhibitory action were only found in susceptible species, suggesting that the respiratory burst is important in those species, but is unable to prevent the proliferation of A. invadans.        Serum inhibited fungal germination in all cases other than low temperature tilapia, indicating that the EUS resistance of tilapia is not due to the serum. Inhibition of germling growth by serum only occurred in silver barbs and gourami. Heated serum did not inhibit germination in any case except that of high temperature snakehead, and in fact stimulated germination in the case of tilapia. Heating serum did not affect the growth inhibiting activity of silver barbs and gouramis, but it stimulated growth in some groups. At high temperatures snakeheads had high anti-A. invadans antibody concentrations, which may explain the inhibitory activity of their heated serum. A role for complement and antibodies in defence against A. invadans in susceptible species is suggested.

Public perception of seriousness of risk for themselves, and for other people was examined for different types of uncertainty, for each of five different food hazards. The results indicated that participants responded to the different types of uncertainty in a uniform way, suggesting that perception of risk associated with uncertainty is not affected by the 'type' of uncertainty. The results further indicated that the seriousness of risk, in the presence of statements of uncertainty, was perceived to be greater for pesticides and genetic modification compared to BSE, high fat diets and Salmonella. It was argued that this could be due to the perceptions of low personal control, and high societal responsibility to protect people and societal control over exposure to the potential risks of pesticides and genetic modification. Under circumstances where people feel they have little personal control over their exposure to a particular hazard, and those social institutions that are perceived to be in control of protecting the public indicate that there is uncertainty associated with risk estimates, the hazard may appear to be 'out of control', which is associated with a perception of serious risk.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  100     Total Times Cited:  112     Cited Reference Count:  33,10.1080/1366987032000088883     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),uncertainty;food hazards;public perception;communication;UNREALISTIC OPTIMISM;RISK INFORMATION;PERSONAL RISK;COMMUNICATION;INTERVENTIONS,NA,NA,public perception of scientific uncertainty in relation to food hazards

A cultural model is a simplified way of understanding a complex system, shared by members of a culture. Eighty-eight percent of respondents understood Pfiesteria using one of four previously existing cultural models: a disease in fish, a parasite in fish, a water pollutant, and a toxin or poison. These models are not used by marine biologists, who are more likely to refer to Pfiesteria taxonomically or, in its fish killing form, to call it a predator. Our survey shows that the cultural model a respondent holds is correlated significantly with his or her believed pathway of human harm (e.g., eating fish versus swimming) and is correlated significantly but weakly with his or her behavioral responses. We conclude that existing cultural models, as the public has applied them to Pfiesteria, have led people to avoid a range of coastal activities and seafoods, in virtually all cases unnecessarily. Cultural models appear to explain public reaction better than previously hypothesized factors such as inaccurate media coverage.

However, there are no studies that have directly evaluated pesticide levels and effects in oysters (Crassotrea gigas) cultured in Ebro's Bays. In this study pesticide levels in water, metal body burdens and up to 12 different biochemical markers were monitored in gills and digestive glands of oysters transplanted from May to June in 2008 and 2009. Biochemical responses evidenced clear differences in oysters from 2008 and 2009. Oysters transplanted in 2009 showed their antioxidant defenses unaffected from May to June and consequently increased levels of tissue damage measured as lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks and of mortality rates. Conversely oysters transplanted in 2008 increase their antioxidant defenses from May to June, had low levels of lipid peroxidation and DNA damage and low mortality rates. Some pesticides in water such as bentazone and propanil together with high temperatures and salinity levels were related with tissue damage in oyster transplanted in 2008 but the observed large differences between years indicate that abiotic factors alone could not explain the high mortalities observed in 2009. An analysis of recent reported studies pointed out in the direction that in addition to abiotic factors the use of oysters sensitive to diseases may explain the observed responses. ¬© 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 24; Correspondence Address: C.

Tritici) and powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) are two serious diseases that severely intimidated yield and grain quality of winter wheat around the world. Since the preferable habitat conditions of them are similar, there is a high possibility that both diseases occurred in field simultaneously. To facilitate a differentiation of control procedures (i.e. using different fungicide), the discrimination of yellow rust and powdery mildew is a necessity. As a fast and nondestructive technique in obtaining the plant status information in real time, remote sensing has been successfully applied in the monitoring of crop diseases in several cases. However, studies addressing the discrimination of different crop diseases are rare. The aim of the present work was to assess the capability of remote sensing in discriminating yellow rust and powdery mildew at leaf level. For each disease, a total of 30 leaf samples were collected for spectral measurement, including both infected and non-infected leaves. Prior to the analysis, the spectral data were undertaken a normalization, to minimize the spectral difference caused by the cultivars. The spectra of normal leaves were compared with that of both infected ones (yellow rust and powdery mildew) through an independent t-test. Within the bands that were significantly different between normal and diseased leaves, a further band selection was conducted to differentiate powdery mildew from yellow rust using the same independent t-test. Only those disease sensitive bands that have the discriminative power were retained. Their discriminative capability was examined by a fisher linear discrimination analysis (FLDA). It turned out that the discrimination model yielded satisfactory estimation of sample categories, with an overall accuracy over 0.9. Therefore, it is evident that the hyperspectral remote sensing is a promising way to discriminate yellow rust and powdery mildew. ¬© 2012 IEEE.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4; Conference name: 1st International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics, Agro-Geoinformatics 2012; Conference date: 2 August 2012 through 4 August 2012; Conference code: 93794",10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2012.6311599,fisher linear discrimination analysis;independent t-test;powdery mildew;winter wheat;yellow rust;Crops;Face recognition;Remote sensing;Fisher Linear Discrimination;Powdery mildew;Winter wheat;Yellow rust;Fungi;Discrimination (Psychology),NA,NA,discrimination of yellow rust and powdery mildew in wheat at leaf level using spectral signatures

Nevertheless, we report here that HD6 affords protection against invasion by enteric bacterial pathogens in vitro and in vivo. After stochastic binding to bacterial surface proteins, HD6 undergoes ordered self-assembly to form fibrils and nanonets that surround and entangle bacteria. This self-assembly mechanism occurs in vivo, requires histidine-27, and is consistent with x-ray crystallography data.

This review is restricted to human studies with at least 50 cases of ASD, having a valid comparison group, conducted within the past decade and focusing on maternal lifestyle or environmental chemicals.Results: Higher maternal intake of certain nutrients and supplements has been associated with reduction in ASD risk, with the strongest evidence for periconceptional folic acid supplements. Although many investigations have suggested no impact of maternal smoking and alcohol use on ASD, more rigorous exposure assessment is needed. A number of studies have demonstrated significant increases in ASD risk with estimated exposure to air pollution during the prenatal period, particularly for heavy metals and particulate matter. Little research has assessed other persistent and non-persistent organic pollutants in association with ASD specifically.Conclusions: More work is needed to examine fats, vitamins and other maternal nutrients, as well as endocrine-disrupting chemicals and pesticides, in association with ASD, given sound biological plausibility and evidence regarding other neurodevelopmental deficits. The field can be advanced by large-scale epidemiological studies, attention to critical aetiological windows and how these vary by exposure, and use of biomarkers and other means to understand underlying mechanisms. ¬© The Author 2014; all rights reserved.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 283; Correspondence Address: K.

While O. mossambicus are now not commonly used as an aquaculture species, the biological traits that made them a popular culture species including tolerance to wide ranging ecological conditions, generalist dietary requirements and rapid reproduction with maternal care have also made them a 'model' invader. Self-sustaining populations now exist in almost every region to which they have been imported. In Australia, since their introduction in the 1970s, O. mossambicus have become established in catchments along the east and west coasts and have the potential to colonise other adjacent drainages. It is thought that intentional translocations are likely to be the most significant factor in their spread in Australia.

Currently, there are major gaps in our understanding of the molecular interactions between S. homoeocarpa and creeping bentgrass. In this study, 454 sequencing technology was used in the de novo assembly of S. homoeocarpa and creeping bentgrass transcriptomes. Transcript sequence data obtained using Illumina's first generation sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) were mapped to the transcriptome assemblies to estimate transcript representation in different SBS libraries. SBS libraries included a S. homoeocarpa culture control, a creeping bentgrass uninoculated control, and a library for creeping bentgrass inoculated with S. homoeocarpa and incubated for 96 h. A Fisher's exact test was performed to determine transcripts that were significantly different during creeping bentgrass infection with S. homoeocarpa. Fungal transcripts of interest included glycosyl hydrolases, proteases, and ABC transporters. Of particular interest were the large number of glycosyl hydrolase transcripts that target a wide range of plant cell wall compounds, corroborating the suggested wide host range and saprophytic abilities of S. homoeocarpa. Several of the multidrug resistance ABC transporters may be important for resistance to both fungicides and plant defense compounds. Creeping bentgrass transcripts of interest included germins, ubiquitin transcripts involved in proteasome degradation, and cinnamoyl reductase, which is involved in lignin production. This analysis provides an extensive overview of the S. homoeocarpa-turfgrass pathosystem and provides a starting point for the characterization of potential virulence factors and host defense responses. In particular, determination of important host defense responses may assist in the development of highly resistant creeping bentgrass varieties. ¬© 2012 Orshinsky et al.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 36; Correspondence Address: A.

Among the systems, the chemical defense system is of special interest for the food industry. Some of these compounds are toxic to specific microorganisms, insects, birds, and mammals, but most of those are toxic to humans and can give rise to chronic or acute symptoms of poisoning. Though some of the compounds occur in very low concentrations, the compounds have a cumulative harmful effect if they constitute a part of the normal diet over a prolonged period. Besides, food materials might be contaminated by exogenous toxins. Intrinsic toxins and contaminants have been recognized as the major components that affect food safety. This chapter introduces the occurrence and properties of the most important toxicants in foods, including allergens, toxic glycosides, toxic amino acids, lectins, saponins, toxins in aquatic organisms, various antinutrients, heavy metals, pesticide residues, dioxins, veterinary and fish drug residues, benzopyrenes as well as heterocyclic amines.

In vitro studies confirmed that both technical toxaphene and degraded toxaphene inhibit gap junctional intercellular communication that correlates with the mechanistic potential to cause tumor promotion. In vivo rat studies established the NOAEL for degraded and technical toxaphene at the highest dose tested in the bioassay. Toxaphene residue intakes from European fishery products were estimated and compared to the provisional tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) from various regulatory agencies including Canada, the United States, and Germany. The estimated intake was also compared to a new calculated provisionalMATT pTDI. TheMATT pTDI is based on new toxicological information (in vivo rat studies) developed on a model for environmental toxaphene residues rather than technical toxaphene. A MATT pTDI (1.08mg total toxaphene for a person of 60 kg) for tumor promotion potency was adopted for use in Europe and is referred to here as the MATT pTDI. These new data result in a better estimate of safety and a higher TDI than previously used. Based on realistic fish consumption data and recent baseline concentration data of toxaphene in European fishery products, the toxaphene intake for the consumers of Germany, Ireland, Norway, and the Netherlands was estimated. For an average adult fish consumer, the average daily intake of toxaphene was estimated to be 1.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.2 Œºg for the consumers of Norway, Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands, respectively. The toxaphene intake of these average fish consumers was far below the MATT pTDI of 1.08 mg/60 kg bw. In conclusion, based on the most relevant toxicological studies and the most realistic estimates of fish consumption and recent concentrations of toxaphene in European fishery products, adverse health effects are unlikely for the average European consumer of fishery products. In no case is the MATT pTDI exceeded. ¬© 2011 SETAC.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: P.E.G.

The present study highlights trichlorofon-induced toxicity and the protective role of T2HCA in the liver, kidney, and brain of female Wistar rats. The rats were given a single dose of trichlorofon (150 mg / kg bw) and pre- and post-treatment T2HCA (50 mg / kg bw) for seven days. Trichlorofon enhanced oxidative stress in liver, kidney, and brain of the rats, which was evident from the elevation of lipid peroxidation (LPO). The reduced level of non-enzymatic antioxidant glutathione (GSH) also indicated the presence of an oxidative insult. The activity of enzymatic antioxidants like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-s-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was significantly decreased on trichlorfon administration. Pre and post treatment with T2HCA decreased the LPO level and increased SOD, CAT, GST, GR, GPx, and GSH in the brain, liver, and kidney.

Modulation of this resistance mechanism by chemical agents occurring in the environment could result in either higher or lower internal concentrations of toxic or endogenous compounds in cells. The aim of the present study was to explore and quantify the inhibition of the P-gp efflux pumps by several ubiquitous aquatic contaminants. The calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM) assay commonly used in pharmacological research was established with P-gp-overexpressing Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCKII-MDR1) in a 96-well plate, avoiding extra washing, centrifugation, and lysis steps. This calcein-AM-based P-gp cellular efflux pump inhibition assay (CEPIA) was used to study the inhibition by commonly occurring environmental contaminants. Among others, the compounds pentachlorophenol, perfluorooctane sulfonate, and perfluorooctanoate strongly inhibited the P-gp-mediated efflux of calcein-AM while the chloninated alkanes did not seem to interact with the transporter.

The agricultural frontier of Argentina is spreading out, and this phenomenon has involved a significant increase in the use of biocides. Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethylglycine, PMG) is the most widely used herbicide in this country. Particularly the application of formulated glyphosate increased from 70 million kg in 1999 to more than 210 million in 2011. Although this herbicide is considered as ""environmentally friendly"" with moderate persistence, the mobility and fate will be conditioned by the chemical and biological profile of the environment, and regarding that, several authors have determined environmentally relevant levels of glyphosate and its metabolites in surface water. The risk associated with the use of PMG, could be assessed by the evaluation of the impact on a non-target species: Cnesterodon decemmaculatus, a Neotropical endemic teleost, widely distributed in the region. Experimental results would indicate that glyphosate (active ingredient, analytical grade, acid form) does not present a high level of toxicity (LC50-96h > 100 mg.L-1) on C. decemmaculatus. However, the toxicity of one of the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation was found to be significantly higher (LC50-96h = 29 mg.L-1). These results are consistent with other evidences that indicate a remarkable increase in the toxicity of formulations regarding to the active ingredient in freshwater teleosts. Several scientists have focused their research on the identification of biomarkers of environmental stress in non-target species. These could be specific and early signals of the toxic-organism interaction. In this regard, the utility of morphological and biochemical parameters as quantitative bioindicators of xenobiotic exposure has been shown. Within this framework, we measured the impact of sublethal exposure of Cnesterodon decemmaculatus to PMG on antioxidant defenses (catalase activity) and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase activity). After acute exposure, PMG caused changes in the enzyme activities: an increase in the activity of catalase and an inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase activity. These results are the first report indicating that sublethal PMG affect these biomarkers in a native teleost species. ¬© 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Our previous studies have demonstrated the antibacterial property of piscine H2A variants against gram-negative bacteria Edwardsiella piscicida and Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae. In this study, we show the function and mechanism of piscine H2A in the negative regulation of RLR signaling pathway and host innate immune response against spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) infection. SVCV infection significantly inhibits the expression of histone H2A during an early stage of infection, but induces the expression of histone H2A during the late stage of infection such as at 48 and 72 hpi. Under normal physiological conditions, histone H2A is nuclear-localized. However, SVCV infection promotes the migration of histone H2A from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The in vivo studies revealed that histone H2A overexpression led to the increased expression of SVCV gene and decreased survival rate. The overexpression of histone H2A also significantly impaired the expression levels of those genes involved in RLR antiviral signaling pathway. Furthermore, histone H2A targeted TBK1 and IRF3 to promote their protein degradation via the lysosomal pathway and impair the formation of TBK1-IRF3 functional complex. Importantly, histone H2A completely abolished TBK1-mediated antiviral activity and enormously impaired the protein expression of IRF3, especially nuclear IRF3. Further analysis demonstrated that the inhibition of histone H2A nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking could relieve the protein degradation of TBK1 and IRF3, and blocked the negative regulation of histone H2A on the SVCV infection. Collectively, our results suggest that histone H2A nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking is essential for negative regulation of RLR signaling pathway and antiviral immune response in response to SVCV infection.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  41,10.3389/fimmu.2021.771277     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),histone H2A;nuclear;cytoplasmic trafficking;negative regulation;RLR signaling;SVCV infection;RIG-I;STIMULATED GENES;RECOGNITION;INTERFERON;RECEPTORS;IFN;CONTRIBUTE;CHROMATIN;VARIANTS;INJURY;Histones,NA,NA,histone h2a nuclearcytoplasmic trafficking is essential for negative regulation of antiviral immune response and lysosomal degradation of tbk1 and irf3

Although studies look into xenobiotic biotransformation by Tsukamurella isolates, the relevant enzymes remain uncharacterized. We investigated the arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzyme family, known for its role in the xenobiotic metabolism of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Xenobiotic sensitivity of Tsukamurella paurometabola type strain DSM 20162(T) was assessed, followed by cloning, recombinant expression and functional characterization of its single NAT homolog (TSUPD)NAT1. The bacterium appeared quite robust against chloroanilines, but more sensitive to 4-anisidine and 2-aminophenol. However, metabolic activity was not evident towards those compounds, presumably due to mechanisms protecting cells from xenobiotic entry. Of the pharmaceutical arylhydrazines tested, hydralazine was toxic, but the bacterium was less sensitive to isoniazid, a drug targeting mycolic acid biosynthesis in mycobacteria. Although (TSUPD)NAT1 protein has an atypical Cys-His-Glu (instead of the expected Cys-His-Asp) catalytic triad, it is enzymatically active, suggesting that this deviation is likely due to evolutionary adaptation potentially serving a different function. The protein was indeed found to use malonyl-CoA, instead of the archetypal acetyl-CoA, as its preferred donor substrate. Malonyl-CoA is important for microbial biosynthesis of fatty acids (including mycolic acids) and polyketide chains, and the corresponding enzymatic systems have common evolutionary histories, also linked to xenobiotic metabolism.

Two cultured isolates of Alexandrium, exhibiting markedly different PSP toxin compositions and specific toxicities, were used independently to determine the kinetics of toxin accumulation and loss, as well as the potential for biotransformation of individual PSP toxins in certain tissues. Clams readily ingested and absorbed a monospecific diet of the low toxicity A. tamarense isolate GtLI22. They also ingested cells of the high toxicity A. fundyense isolate GtCA29, but at a lower rate, and only when the diet was supplemented with a nontoxic diatom, Thalassiosira weissflogii. As natural populations of M. mercenaria rarely accumulate a substantial PSP toxin load, this suggests the existence of a toxin recognition mechanism. Maximum toxicities in clam tissues, attained within 2 wk of exposure to either toxic dinoflagellate, exceeded the regulatory harvest closure level (80-mu-g STXeq 100 g-1) by several orders of magnitude. Detoxification to levels acceptable for human consumption occurred within 3 to 6 wk. HPLC analyses revealed significant differences between the toxic profile of the dinoflagellates and that accumulated in various clam tissues. Clams toxified with isolate GtLI22, a strain rich in low potency C-toxins, showed: (1) de novo appearance of STX, (2) significant reduction in the proportion of C-toxins, and (3) reciprocal increase in the proportion of the gonyautoxins GTX2+3. Significant relative enrichment in STX also occurred in tissues of clams fed upon GtCA29, an isolate rich in the more potent carbamate toxins.

Throughout most of its range it has not been well studied, and in southern China very little is known of its biology. The goal of the present study was to provide scientific information needed for the long-term conservation and management of the population that occurs in Hong-Kong waters. From September 1997 to November 1998, 38,105 km of systematic line transect surveys were conducted throughout marine waters of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and adjacent waters to provide data on distribution and abundance. Photo-identification of individual dolphins allowed for examination of movement patterns, home ranges, and social organization. Collection of stranded dolphin carcasses and detailed neeropsies provided information on causes of death as well as samples for life history studies, such as feeding habits, growth and reproduction, ecotoxicology, and stock structure.        The dolphin population appears to be centered around the Pearl River Estuary, and Hong Kong waters represent the eastern portion of the range, which extends far into mainland Chinese waters (Lingding Bay) and covers at least 1,800 km(2). Within Hong Kong, dolphins only occur in western waters around Lantau Island. The area north of Lantau Island is heavily used throughout the year and represents by far the most important habitat in Hong Kong. Line transect analyses indicate that between 88 (spring) and 145 (summer) dolphins occur in Hong Kong. Based on 27,6000 photographs taken, 213 individual dolphins were identified. The total size of the Pearl River breeding population is unknown, but is estimated to consist of at least 1,028 dolphins, based on line transect analysis. An apparent decline in the number of dolphins in the North Lantau area over the period from 1996-1998 was not statistically significant. Individual dolphins have overlapping home ranges of about 30-400 km(2) in different sections of the population's overall range. Groups of dolphins in Hong Kong number up to 23 animals, with an average group size of 3.8 +/- s.d. 3.63 animals. There is no significant seasonal variation in group size, but groups feeding behind pair trawl fishing vessels (mean = 8.3 +/- s.d. 7.84) are significantly larger than those in Hong Kong. Groups are very fluid and change composition frequently, with association indices ranging from 0-0.333. Behavioral patterns are similar to those of other coastal dolphins, but Hong Kong hump-backed dolphins only rarely ride bow waves. Following pair trawlers represents an important feeding strategy for some individuals. Construction work on an airport fuel facility in the dolphins' main habitat appears to have caused some disturbance (indicated by increased swimming speeds) and possibly temporary evacuation of the surrounding area.        There is a great deal of developmental variation in the color pattern of southern Chinese hump-backed dolphins, with a general lightening from newborn to adult stages. Males appear to retain more spots in adulthood than females. Length at birth appears to be about 100 cm, and postnatal development is characterized by rapid growth in the first year and a levelling-off of the growth curve after reaching adulthood. Asymptotic length is reached at around 243 cm. Length and weight are related exponentially, with the maximum weight about 250 kg. Calving occurs throughout the year, but most young are born from January through August, with a peak in spring/summer. Scant evidence suggests that sexual maturity in females is reached at about 9-10 years of age. Dolphins feed mainly on several demersal and pelagic fish species that are often associated with estuaries. There is a lack of evidence for long-distance movements (on the order of hundreds of linear kilometers), and this presumably results in isolation of groups around major Chinese river mouths. Thus it appears that there may be at least 8 separate populations of hump-backed dolphins along the coast of southern China. The Pearl River Estuary, including Hong Kong, is apparently inhabited by one of these populations, although preliminary genetic work has shown only equivocal evidence of population separation from dolphins in the Xiamen area. Human-related causes of mortality include entanglement in fishing nets and vessel collisions. Some environmental contaminants (especially the heavy metal mercury and the pesticide DDT) were found in high levels in some dolphins, and preliminary evidence suggests that these may be affecting the health of the animals.        A series of recommendations for management and for further research have been made to aid in the conservation of these animals. Principles for the conservation of wild living resources should be followed, and information from both the natural and social sciences are needed for proper management. Research and long-term monitoring of the population must continue for management strategies to be evaluated and refined. Overall, the population of hump-backed dolphins that occurs in Hong Kong waters appears to be viable and should be able to survive with appropriate conservation efforts.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  177     Total Times Cited:  223     Cited Reference Count:  141,,abundance;behavior;conservation status;distribution;Hong Kong;human interactions;IndoPacific hump-backed dolphin;life history;mortality;reproduction;social organization;Sousa chinensis;BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS;TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS;MARINE MAMMALS;PERSISTENT ORGANOCHLORINES;SOUSA-CHINENSIS;SMALL CETACEANS;COASTAL WATERS;BELUGA WHALES;SOUTH-AFRICA;EAST COAST;Back,NA,NA,population biology of the indopacific humpbacked dolphin in hong kong waters
rayyan-1227193458,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance penconazole,2008,10,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,10,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Penconazole is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on penconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 19 June 2007. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 1 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July-August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on cucurbits and grapes. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Topas 10 EC"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues of penconazole in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of penconazole. A data gap was identified for a confirmatory method for surface water. It is noted that the residue definition for soil and water is provisional.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. It is noted however, that further validation data are required for the impurity method and that there is no supported technical specification.        The toxicological studies on the metabolism of penconazole have shown an extensive oral absorption, a wide distribution in the body and an excretion mainly via urine. According to the results of acute oral toxicity testing, the agreed classification was Xn, R22 Harmful if swallowed. The main target organ in short term toxicity studies was the liver, and the dog was the most sensitive species. No genotoxic potential was observed during in vitro or in vivo tests, and no carcinogenicity was observed in rats or mice after long term exposure. In the reproductive toxicity studies, an increased incidence of dystocia was considered as an effect already observed with other triazoles, and to be forwarded to EChA for a decision upon classification (R62?- ""Possible risk of impaired fertility""). Developmental effects were observed in the teratogenicity studies, and the classification Reprotoxic Category 3 R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child was proposed by the experts. Several plant metabolites were considered to be of the same or lower toxicity than penconazole. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) were both 0.03 mg/kg bw/day based on the combined 90-day/1- year dog study. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.5 mg/kg bw based on early bodyweight changes in the rabbit developmental study. These reference values were all derived with the use of a safety factor of 100. The dermal absorption values were 5% for the dilution and 1% for the concentrate. The exposure estimates in different scenarios (field or greenhouse use) were all below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment.        The metabolism of penconazole was tested in grapes, tomatoes and apples where triazole and phenyl labelled compound was applied. The meeting of experts considered that the grape data were not acceptable and they were not considered further. The apple and tomato data were acceptable and showed the same metabolic profile. The main metabolism route is oxidation at the 1, 2 and 3 positions on the alkyl chain. The triazole moiety metabolites are an issue for all the triazole fungicides and will be dealt with in a separate exercise. For completeness, a general data gap was identified for this issue which has been used in other triazole conclusions. No phenyl-ring-only metabolites were seen. The significant residues at harvest consisted of CGA 132465(2), CGA 190503(3), CGA 127841(4) and their glucoside conjugates as well as penconazole. It was agreed that the provisional residue definition for risk assessment (fruit crops only) should be penconazole and free and conjugated CGA 132465, CGA 190503 and CGA 127841 expressed as penconazole.        The residue definition for monitoring is penconazole with a conversion factor of 6 between monitoring and risk assessment residue definitions. The residue trial data set was complete for grapes but a data gap for outdoor cucurbits in the North of Europe was identified. The stability of residues was demonstrated in freezer storage for a period of 16 months. Appropriate processing data are available. Two rotational crop metabolism studies conducted at exaggerated rates showed that no significant residue would be expected in rotational crops. No livestock metabolism studies were supplied or required, as according to current guidance the representative crops under consideration are not fed to animals.        The chronic risk assessment showed a maximum intake of 2.9 % of the ADI for the French diet using the EFSA model. For the acute risk the highest intake was 13 % of the ARID from the consumption of table grapes for the German diet using the EFSA model. The proposed MRLs are 0.2 mg/kg for grapes and 0.1 mg/kg for cucurbits.        In soil under aerobic conditions penconazole exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolites CGA 179944(5) (accounting for up to 18.9% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence and CGA 71019(6) (accounting for up to 38.6% of AR) which also exhibited low persistence. Mineralisation of both the phenyl and triazole rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 65 and 27 % of AR respectively after 546 and 364 days. The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 22 and 47 % of AR respectively after 364 and 336 days. A data gap was identified for the identification/characterisation of the unknown radioactivity Ul found in the aerobic soil degradation up to 17.3% of the applied radioactivity.        Penconazole is strongly adsorbed to soils and is unlikely to leach in soil. Column leaching studies have confirmed this, demonstrating that the parent compound is only recovered from the upper layers of the columns. Metabolite CGA 179944 exhibits very high mobility in soil and CGA 71019 exhibits very high to medium mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of penconazole or that of its soil metabolites was pH dependent.        Penconazole does not degrade significantly via either hydrolysis or photolysis. The metabolites CGA 179944 and CGA 71019 were shown to be stable to hydrolysis under environmentally relevant conditions. The fate of penconazole in the aquatic environment therefore, will be principally determined by adsorption to the sediments and slow degradation therein. The terminal metabolite, carbon dioxide was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 4.6-8.4% of AR at 678-706 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 18-19 % of AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for penconazole and metabolites CGA 179944 and CGA 71019 at steps 1-2. Additional FOCUSsw calculations for penconazole confirmed that the maximum Step 3 PECs are 85% (water) and 70% (sediment) lower than the Step 2 derived values.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by penconazole, CGA 71019 and CGA 179944 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low for the intended uses covering only neutral and alkaline soil conditions. In addition, an assessment of the potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses on vines with highest rates and numbers of applications for some FOCUS scenarios is not available. For unknown Ul, a data gap was identified for a groundwater exposure assessment. A second modelling with FOCUS PEARL model is also necessary. It was concluded that penconazole is unlikely to be subject to long range atmospheric transport as a consequence of its likely indirect photooxidation intermediated transformation (half life estimated at 15.9 hours).        The representative uses of penconazole are applications to cucurbits and grapes. The first tier risk assessment indicated that a low risk is expected to birds and mammals. TERs for earthworm eating birds and mammals meet the Annex VI trigger value of 5. The risk to birds and mammals from intake of contaminated drinking water from surface water or puddles was considered to be low.        The meeting agreed with the use of the toxicity data for the triazole metabolites from the report from PRAPeR 13 for the ecotoxicology and from the report from PRAPeR 14 for the mammalian endpoint.        The penconazole avian and mammalian databases were reviewed for effects indicative of potential endocrine activity. There are no relevant mediated effects below the threshold established by the current endpoints for the mammals. The expert meeting PRAPeR 48 agrees that some uncertainties remain on potential delayed reproductive effects on birds since these effects are not covered on the basis of the currently stated data requirements of Council Directive 91/414/EEC. More information should be requested at MS level. Based on the information available penconazole is proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms.        The first tier risk assessment indicated a low long term risk to fish and also a low acute risk to aquatic invertebrates, algae and sediment dwelling organisms. However, tier I risk assessment also indicated that there is a high acute risk to fish and a high long term risk to aquatic invertebrates and aquatic plants. The Annex VI triggers for acute and long term risk are met with the PECsw from FOCUS Step 2. The higher tier risk assessment indicated a low risk for all aquatic organisms, except for the long term risk to aquatic invertebrates. However, with FOCUS Step 3 PECsw the TER value was above the Annex VI trigger values. The applicant and the RMS proposed that an appropriate FSDT study was required to address the potential endocrine-mediated effect in DMI fungicides since the FSDT will cover the sensitive time windows with respect to effect triggering and effect manifestation. The member state experts agreed with this proposal and also noted that member states should have the opportunity to ask for an appropriate test to address the endocrine effects.        The BCF of 320 was derived from a study with bluegill sunfish (Lepomis machrochirus). The first tier risk assessment for metabolites indicated a low acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms for both metabolites CGA 71019 and CGA 179944.        Penconazole is of low toxicity to bees. Hazard Quotients (HQ) for oral and contact exposure were determined to be below the trigger values indicating a low risk for bees.        The risk to non-target arthropods was assessed as high for the in-field areas, however a potential for recolonisation from the off field areas had been demonstrated.        The acute and chronic TER values for penconazole and for both metabolites CGA 71019 and CGA 179944 were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating that the risk to earthworms is low.        Penconazole and the metabolite CGA 71019 were tested with Folsomia candida, and the active substance was tested for effects in a litter bag study. In conclusion, the risk of penconazole and the metabolite CGA 71019 to other non-target macro-organisms was considered to be low.        The results of the assessment of ""Topas 10 EC"" as well as the soil metabolites CGA 71019 and CGA 179944 indicate no adverse impact on soil non target organisms.        In a preliminary screening test ""Topas 10 EC"" had only a slight effect (< 50 % effect) on seedling emergence and vegetative vigour in 3 monocotyledons and 3 dicotyledons at rates up to 30 g a.s./ha. EFSA notes that the dose used in the screening test, 30 g a.s./ha, has not covered the higher proposed intended uses of 50 g a.s./ha.        No inhibitory effects of penconazole to respiration rates of activated sludge were observed up to 100 mg /L.

During infection, AIP56 spreads systemically and depletes phagocytes by postapoptotic secondary necrosis, impairing the host phagocytic defense and contributing to the genesis of infection-associated necrotic lesions. Here we show that mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDM) intoxicated by AIP56 undergo NF-kappa B p65 depletion and apoptosis. Similarly to what was reported for sea bass phagocytes, intoxication of mBMDM involves interaction of AIP56 C-terminal region with cell surface components, suggesting the existence of a conserved receptor. Biochemical approaches and confocal microscopy revealed that AIP56 undergoes clathrin-dependent endocytosis, reaches early endosomes, and follows the recycling pathway. Translocation of AIP56 into the cytosol requires endosome acidification, and an acidic pulse triggers translocation of cell surface-bound AIP56 into the cytosol. Accordingly, at acidic pH, AIP56 becomes more hydrophobic, interacting with artificial lipid bilayer membranes. Altogether, these data indicate that AIP56 is a short-trip toxin that reaches the cytosol using an acidic-pH-dependent mechanism, probably from early endosomes. Usually, for short-trip AB toxins, a minor pool reaches the cytosol by translocating from endosomes, whereas the rest is routed to lysosomes for degradation. Here we demonstrate that part of endocytosed AIP56 is recycled back and released extracellularly through a mechanism requiring phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity but independent of endosome acidification. So far, we have been unable to detect biological activity of recycled AIP56, thereby bringing into question its biological relevance as well as the importance of the recycling pathway.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  93,10.1128/IAI.02623-14     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),SEABREAM SPARUS-AURATA;BOTULINUM C2 TOXIN;DIPHTHERIA-TOXIN;EXTRACELLULAR PRODUCTS;ENDOCYTIC PATHWAY;MOUSE MACROPHAGES;CELL PENETRATION;MEMBRANE;DYNAMIN;RICIN,NA,NA,intracellular trafficking of aip56 an nfŒ∫bcleaving toxin from <i>photobacterium damselae<i> subsp <i>piscicida<i>

PBDE concentrations in organisms from Bohai Bay (Sigma PBDEs: 0.15-32.8 ng/g lipid weight) were low compared with other marine organisms worldwide, and BDE-47 was the predominant compound in most samples, followed by BDE-28, BDE-99/BDE-100, and BDE-119.

It was found that most of the identified characteristics and concerns were unique to specific food hazards, though some were shared. The findings were supported in a validation study using a more representative sample of the public.

Rev.,9,4,525-535,"Vale, P",,English,,"INRB L IPIMAR, P-1449006 Lisbon, Portugal","Scientific study of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSTs) started in the early XXth century. In the 1920s it was understood the link between the toxicity observed in mussels with certain microalgae species. The poison was eventually purified from the clam Saxidomus giganteus, taking its name from it: saxitoxin (STX). Along the 1970s and 1980s it was understood that other STX analogues existed, both in dinoflagellates and bivalves. These were grouped into three major occurring families: the carbamate, N-sulfocarbamoyl and decarbamoyl, depending on the variation of the side chain of the tetrahydropurine core. The deoxydecarbamoyl family was additionally recognised in the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum. Chemical research into these STX analogues was conducted worldwide during the 1990s mainly by HPLC with pre- or post-column oxidation and fluorescence detection. Implementation of fluorescence detection with spectral capabilities and mass spectrometry detection during the 2000s led to the recognition of new analogues. Metabolites originated by single or double hydroxylation at C11 position were found in mussels, and later suspected in other bivalves. Designated M1-M4, these present very low fluorescence, and can only be studied resorting to HILIC-MS. Three hydroxybenzoate analogues were characterised as an important toxin fraction of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum, and named GC1-GC3. Later, many more analogues were suspected: the corresponding N1-hydroxyl variants of GC1-GC3 (GC4-GC6), di-hydroxybenzoate variants (GC1a-GC6a), and sulphate-benzoate variants (GC1b-GC6b). In bivalves, carbamoylase activity renders these analogues into decarbamoyl analogues. Other compounds with PST-like characteristics have been detected in bivalves from Angola, Argentina and Vietnam. Today, the range of naturally occurring STX derivatives, both in marine and freshwater environments, accounts to more than fifty structural variants. This poses a problem for carrying out food safety analysis based solely in chemical methods. Fortunately, most modifications to the side chain of the tetrahydropurine core result in diminished toxicity.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  34     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.1007/s11101-010-9196-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Saxitoxin;Hydroxybenzoate;M toxin;PSP;Gymnodinium catenatum;Bivalves;PARALYTIC SHELLFISH TOXINS;DINOFLAGELLATE GYMNODINIUM-CATENATUM;ALEXANDRIUM-MINUTUM DINOPHYCEAE;SINGLE-LABORATORY VALIDATION;POISONING TOXINS;LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY;FLUORESCENCE DETECTION;MASS-SPECTROMETRY;TRANSFORMING ENZYME;SODIUM-CHANNEL;Biotransformation;Military Personnel,NA,NA,new saxitoxin analogues in the marine environment developments in toxin chemistry detection and biotransformation during the 2000s

Traditional methods for detection of fungicide resistance are time-consuming, which are routinely based on tedious operation, reliance on expensive equipment, and specially trained people. Therefore, it is important to establish efficient methods for field detection of benzimidazole resistance in V. carpophila to make suitable management strategies and ensure food safety. Based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with CRISPR/Cas12a, a rapid one-pot assay ORCas12a-BRVc (one-pot RPA-CRISPR/Cas12 platform) was established for the detection of benzimidazole resistance in V. carpophila. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay enabled one-pot detection by adding components at the bottom and wall of the tube separately, solving the problems of aerosol contamination and decreased sensitivity caused by competing DNA substrates between Cas12a cleavage and RPA amplification. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay could accomplish the detection with a minimum of 7.82 x 10(3) fg mu L-1 V. carpophila genomic DNA in 45 min at 37 degrees C. Meanwhile, this assay showed excellent specificity due to the specific recognition ability of the Cas12a-crRNA complex. Further, we combined a method that could rapidly extract DNA from V. carpophila within 2 min with the ORCas12a-BRVc to achieve more rapid and simple detection of V. carpophila with benzimidazole resistance in fields. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay has the advantages of simplicity, rapidity, high sensitivity, high specificity, and ease of operation without the need for precision instruments and the need to isolate and culture pathogens. This assay is the first application of the one-pot platform based on the combination of RPA and CRISPR/Cas12a in fungicide resistance detection and can be used for monitoring of resistant populations in fields, providing guidance on making suitable management strategies for peach scab.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  39,10.1021/acs.jafc.2c06549,fungicide resistance;one-pot detection;MBC fungicides;Venturia carpophila;RPA;CRISPR/Cas12a;MEDIATED ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION;BETA-TUBULIN GENE;BOTRYTIS-CINEREA;CARBENDAZIM;CHINA;DNA;SENSITIVITY;FUNGICIDES;MUTATIONS;Benzimidazoles,NA,NA,onepot assay for rapid detection of benzimidazole resistance in <i>venturia carpophila<i> by combining rpa and crisprcas12a

The results indicated that RCTLR9 cDNA contains 3141 bp. It encodes 1047 amino acids containing 16 typical structures of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) including an LRRTYP, LRRCT and a motif involved in PAMP binding was identified at position 240-253 amino acid. Broad expression of RCTLR9 was found in larval, juvenile and adult stages irrespective of the tissues. In larval stage, RCTLR9 mRNA expression decreased at 5 d and then increased at 10 dph. At juvenile stage cobia, the expression was significantly high (p < 0.05) in spleen and intestine compared to gill, kidney, liver and skin. However, at adult stage, the significant high expression was found in gill and intestine. Cobia challenged with P. damselae subsp. piscicida showed significant increase in RCTLR9 expression at 24 h post challenge in intestine, spleen and liver, while in kidney the expression was peak at 12 h and later it decreased at 24 h. The highest expression was 40 fold increase in spleen and the lowest expression was similar to 3.6 fold increase in liver. Cobia stimulated with CpG oligonucleotides showed that the induction of these genes was CpG ODN type and time dependent. In spleen and liver, CpG ODNs 1668 and 2006 injected group showed high expression of RCTLR9, IL-1 beta, chemokine CC compared to other groups.

They affect enantioseparations in ways that are not understood for the lack of systematic studies, which makes the scale-up of preparative separations difficult to predict. Once a column has been exposed to these modifiers, the selectivity of certain pairs of enantiomers may change, for the better or the worse. Numerous molecules that are affected by this phenomenon are listed in the literature. We selected five of them, the selectivity of which changes as more acidic or basic solutions are percolated through the column. The selectivity of ketoprofen, 4-chlorophenylalanine methyl and ethyl esters improves as a solution of Ethanesulfonic Acid is percolated through the column. The selectivity of Propranolol HCl and Trdger's base increases as a solution of diisopropylamine is percolated through the column. Each one of these five compounds is inversely affected by the percolation of the opposite acid/base solution. We used trans-Stilbene Oxide (tso) as a ""standard"" to determine the columns stability because no Memory Effect is observed for it (its retention, enantioselectivity, and resolution remain constant). Karl Fisher titrations showed that only slight changes in the water content of the mobile phase occurred, and that a unique water to polymer moiety ratio is important. Analytical studies of the stationary phase suggest that slow protonation/deprotonation of water attached to the carbamate moiety may be responsible for the acid/base Memory Effect. Finally, we showed that the Memory Effect can be minimized by percolating through the column a sufficiently concentrated solution of the appropriate acid or base. Thus, columns that were unreliable for method development, due to the Memory Effect, can now be used. As a result, the need to store several CHIRALPAK AD columns, specific for each condition of the Memory Effect, is eliminated. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

rayyan-1227193469,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triazoxide Issued on 30 September 2008,2009,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Triazoxide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triazoxide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 25 June 2007. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and to the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprises seed treatment in barley against several agriculturally important diseases. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached endpoints. The specification for the technical material as a whole should currently be regarded as provisional (September 2008).        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Raxil S FS 040"", a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) containing 20 g/L triazoxide and 20 g/L tebuconazole.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant and animal origin, soil and water, however for air, a method validated to LOQ of 0.6 mu g a.s./m(3) is required.        With regard to its toxicological properties, triazoxide was rapidly and extensively absorbed but only partly bioavailable (50%) to the target organ (blood system) due to its biokinetic properties. After single exposure, it was shown to be toxic after oral or inhalative administration, but was not irritant or skin sensitizer. Consequently, the proposed classification for acute toxicity was T, R23/25 Toxic by inhalation and if swallowed.        After repeated oral or inhalative administration, the critical effect was the induction of haemolytic anaemia, with secondary effects in the spleen, liver and kidneys. The possible classification with Xn; R48/22 or T; R48/25 (Harmful or Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed) could not be agreed by the experts, but the classification T, R48/23 Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure through inhalation was proposed. Triazoxide did not show any genotoxic or carcinogenic properties in the available studies. No specific adverse effects on fertility were observed in the multi-generation rat study, but the classification R64 May cause harm to breastfed babies was proposed based on reduced pup survival during lactation, that could be expected to result from the presence of triazoxide in milk. No developmental toxicity or teratogenic activity was observed in rats and rabbits.        The agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI) was 0.00005 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year rat study and using a safety factor of 100, increased by an additional safety factor of 10. This was justified by the use of a lowest observed adverse effect level, the shallow dose-response in the study and the absence of mechanistic information. The agreed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.001 mg/kg bw/ day based on the 90-day rat study, using a safety factor of 100 and a correction for bioavailability (50%). The agreed acute reference dose (ARfD) was 0.015 mg/kg bw based on the 4-week rat study and applying a safety factor of 100.        The agreed dermal absorption values to be used in the risk assessment were 2.4% for the concentrate and 2% for the contaminated grain dust. The operator exposure estimate during the seed treatment was above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but realistic field studies showed an exposure level up to 21% of the AOEL. Similarly, the exposure estimates for the worker loading and sowing treated seed was above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but below the AOEL with a field study (26%).        With regard to consumer exposure assessment, the nature and magnitude of residues in plant and animal commodities could not be sufficiently clarified by the submitted data on triazoxide applied as a seed treatment to barley.        Taking into account the toxicological profile of triazoxide and its metabolites, the meeting of experts in residues agreed on data gaps with regard to the nature of residues in the plant. No final residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment could therefore be agreed. In the submitted residue trials no residues of triazoxide were found above the LOQ of 0.05 mg/kg in grain and straw. However, it was agreed that the analytical method used in these trials was not validated at a sufficiently low LOQ to ensure that an exceedance of the ADI could be definitively excluded, and therefore new trials with a lower LOQ were required. Assuming residues of triazoxide were present in barley grain at the LOQ level of 0.05 mg/kg, the ADI was exceeded for one Member State diet in the EFSA PRAPeR model. The potential for residues being present in food of animal origin due to carry-over from treated straw has not been addressed, since no data on livestock was submitted due to residues being below the LOQ of 0.05 mg/kg in grain and straw in residue trials. However, given the very low ADI of triazoxide and its metabolites, and given the presence of total residues of 0.04 mg/kg in straw, the experts had concerns that transfer of toxicologically relevant residues from straw into livestock matrices may occur, even though at very low levels. An indicative exposure assessment, using the default residue value of 0.01 mg/kg for milk, showed that the ADI would be significantly exceeded for a number of European national and regional diets, and therefore further consideration of the issue of residues in animal products is required.        No concerns were identified with regard to residues in rotational crops, provided rotated cereals will be addressed with the required new data for the primary cereal crop.        In conclusion, the available metabolism and residue data are not considered appropriate to conduct a robust consumer exposure and risk assessment due to the uncertainties identified with regard to the nature of residues in plant commodities, and with regard to possible transfer of residues in animal products, and the need for a lower LOQ of the analytical method for the relevant analytes in studies on the magnitude of residues.        Triazoxide may be considered to be high to very high persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DT50 (lab (biphasic kinetic, overall)) = 208 - 278 days). Degradation of triazoxide proceeds either through reduction to desoxy-triazoxide (M01)(2), or through production of triazoxide-amine (M02)(3). Assessment based on the decline from the peak observed indicate that M01 was moderate persistent in soil (DissT(50) (lab) = 32.4 - 56.7 days), and M02 could be considered high to very high persistent (decline M02 DissT(50 field) = 239 - 447 days; excluding UK field trial where no decline is observed). A kinetic assessment of laboratory data allowed the applicant to derive kinetic half-lives for M01, that are associated with a formation fraction of 1. Unextracted residues amounted up to a maximum of 29.8 % AR after 120 days (end of the study). Mineralization was practically negligible in the four soils tested.        Photolysis slightly enhances degradation of triazoxide in soil, but it is not expected to contribute significantly to its environmental dissipation.        Field studies are available, with some of them including measurements of the soil metabolites. Kinetic analysis of the field data presented by the applicant was discussed by the meeting of experts. The kinetic analysis was not fully accepted, and the need of considering formation fractions of 1 for further modelling based on this analysis was agreed. Analysis of the data based on the decline of M02 has been performed by the RMS, and the resulting half-lives (decline M02 DissT(50) (field) = 239 - 447 days; excluding UK field trial where no decline is observed) may be used in conjunction with the maximum observed of 18.7 % for exposure risk assessment. PECs soil presented in the DAR were calculated by the RMS for triazoxide and its soil major metabolites following standard procedures. Updated PECs soil with parameters agreed by the meeting of experts are reported in addendum 2 and do not result in a change of the risk assessment already performed.        According to the available studies, triazoxide may be considered as low to medium mobile in soil (K-foc = 245 - 1743 mL/g), desoxy-triazoxide (M01) may be considered slightly mobile (K-foc = 2053 4148 mL/g), and triazoxide-amine (M02) may be considered low to medium mobile (K-foc = 385.6 - 1709.0 mL/g). The RMS noted the narrow range of pH and the ionisable character of the metabolite triazoxide-amine (M02). Whereas a large margin of safety is considered to exist for the representative use proposed, further data could be needed if other uses at significant higher application rates are applied for in the future.        Triazoxide was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, practically stable at pH 7, and readily hydrolysed at pH 9 (DT50 = 6.6 days). The main hydrolysis metabolite was triazoxide-oxone (M04)(4). Triazoxide is rapidly photolysed in water (DT50 = 24.4 hours equivalent to 3.5 natural solar days at 33 degrees N). An additional study indicates that photolysis half-life of triazoxide in water is expected to range from 1.7 to 9.7 days depending on the season and the latitude (30 - 50 degrees N).        No ready biodegradability study is available, and therefore triazoxide is considered not readily biodegradable.        In aquatic water / sediment systems, triazoxide dissipated rapidly from water to sediment phase, and broke down to form the metabolites M01 and triazoxide-desoxyamino (M05)(5). Unextractable residues in the sediment amounted up to 55.7 % AR in the sediment after 91 days). Mineralization was negligible in both systems. The limited sampling regime of these experiments prevents the calculation of reliable kinetic parameters. However, a simple non-linear kinetic analysis was presented by the applicant to derive dissipation and degradation rates of triazoxide and desoxy-triazoxide in the water sediment systems. This kinetic analysis was only partially validated by the RMS (only whole system results for the Lienden system were confirmed). For the IJzendoorn system, no reliable whole system half-lives for the parent compound and M01 were obtained due to poor fit. Worst-case whole system half-lives of 4.3 days and 323 days were estimated for triazoxide and triazoxide-desoxy, respectively, based on results of Lienden system.        Input parameters to be used for FOCUS PECSW were discussed and agreed in the meeting of experts. After the meeting, the RMS has presented an addendum with new FOCUS SW (Step 1 and Step 2) for metabolite M01 and M02 following the approach agreed by the meeting. However, the new PECs calculated do not alter the outcome of the risk assessment already presented by the RMS in the DAR. Three different approaches based on FOCUS GW to calculate PEC GW were presented in the DAR. The meeting of experts agreed on the approach presented under B.8.6.d for the parent compound, but disagreed with the formation fractions assumed for metabolites M01 and M02, for which a formation fraction of 1 had to be used. After the meeting the RMS presented a new groundwater assessment based on FOCUS PEARL v.3.3.3, and the input parameters agreed by the meeting of experts. Neither the parent compound, nor its major soil metabolites (M01 and M02) exceeded the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L when the EU representative use (cereals seed treatment, 6 g a.s./ha) is simulated. However, due to the low ADI determined for this substance, 10% of the ADI would be reached for adults, toddlers and bottle fed infants, if residue levels of 0.05 mu g/L, 0.017 mu g/L and 0.011 mu g/L, respectively, of each component (triazoxide, M01 and M02) were present in the water. These levels were not exceeded in any of the scenarios simulated for the representative use in cereal seeds. Nevertheless, reliability and predictive capacity of FOCUS GW models is expected to be lower in this low range of concentrations. Triazoxide is not expected to significantly volatilize or to be subject to long range transport in air.        The first-tier short-term TER values for granivorous birds were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating a low risk. The margin of safety (TER=23.5) was considered to cover the uncertainty related to the derivation of a short-term toxicity endpoint, due to food avoidance (endpoint based on consumption in group where there was 30% mortality). Further refinements were required to address the acute and long-term risk to birds. Based on Yellowhammer as focal species, the acute TER value was calculated to be 9.1. Yellowhammer would have to consume 159 (including a 10-fold uncertainty factor) seeds on an acute time scale to breach the Annex VI trigger. This number of seeds would cover approximately 3.45 m(2) of a field, and the number of seeds would cover 90% of the daily food requirement of a Yellowhammer. Furthermore, worst case field studies indicated that Yellowhammer could consume 1/3 of the critical number of seeds in one feeding event. Given these facts, in addition to the indication of food avoidance behaviour detected in the short-term dietary study, it was concluded that the risk to granivorous birds from consumption of treated seeds could be considered to be low on an acute time scale. The conclusion was supported by an additional assessment for a fast feeding granivorous bird, like the woodpigeon. In order to reach the LD50, woodpigeons would have to consume 2940 seeds (includes a 10-fold uncertainty factor). A long-term risk assessment on reproductive birds was considered relevant for the spring use of triazoxide as seed treatment (the autumn use may also be reproductively relevant for birds in some southern Member States). A refined long-term TER of 2.23 was calculated based on residue decline data for triazoxide in barley seed on soil surface. Further refinements were needed to address the long-term risk to granivorous birds from spring use.        The tier 1 acute risk assessment for granivorous mammals was found to be low. Further refinements were required to identify a low long-term risk to granivorous mammals. Refinements were based on wood mouse as focal species and on use of measured residue data (see birds above), resulting in a TER value of 0.64. Further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to granivorous mammals. Risk assessment of secondary poisoning and consumption of contaminated drinking water was considered not relevant.        Triazoxide is proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute risk to aquatic organisms was assessed to be low. Further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to fish. The risk to sediment-dwellers from the metabolite M01, M02 and M05 was assessed as low.        The acute risk to earthworms was considered to be low. The long-term risk to earthworms needs further refinements to fully address the potential toxicity of residues in the soil matrix. As for other soil non-target macro-organisms, the risk to springtails was low for all potential soil residues, but it still remains to address the potential risk to soil litter degrading processes from triazoxide and the soil metabolites M01 and M02.        The risk to bees and non-target arthropods was assessed to be low, as was the risk to soil non-target micro-organisms, biological methods of sewage treatment and non-target plants.

rayyan-1227193470,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triazoxide European Food Safety Authority,2011,3,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,9,3,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"EFSA, Parma, Italy","Triazoxide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triazoxide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 25 June 2007. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR to the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG, and on 5 November 2007 to the Member States for consultation. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 30 September 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 193).        Following the Commission Decision of 30 November 2009 (2009/860/ EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of triazoxide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Bayer CropScience AG made a resubmission application for the inclusion of triazoxide in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/216/08 - rev. 0) as follows:        the information available was insufficient to satisfy the requirements set out in Annex II and Annex III of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to:        the available metabolism and residue data were not considered appropriate to conduct a robust consumer risk assessment due to the uncertainties identified with regard to the nature of residues in plant commodities and the possible transfer of residues in animal products        the long-term risk for granivorous bird        the long-term risk for granivorous mammals        the long-term risk to fish        the long-term risk to earthworms        and concerns were identified with regard to:        the consumer exposure        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the United Kingdom, being the designated RMS in the resubmission procedure, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 10 June 2010.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 16 June 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 30 July 2010.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focussed peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on triazoxide.        The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide as proposed by the applicant, which comprise seed treatment in barley against several agriculturally important diseases. The conclusions of the resubmission were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        Data gaps were identified in the section on identity and analytical methods. The specification for the technical material should currently be regarded as provisional.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Raxil S FS 040', a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS), containing 20 g/L triazoxide and 20 g/L tebuconazole.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant origin, soil and water, however for air a method validated to a LOQ of 0.3 mu g a.s./m(3) was identified as a data gap.        With regard to its toxicological properties, triazoxide was rapidly and extensively absorbed, but only partly bioavailable (50 %) to the target organ (blood system) due to its biokinetic properties. After single exposure it was shown to be toxic after oral or inhalative administration, but was not irritant or skin sensitizer. Consequently, the proposed classification for acute toxicity was T, R23/25 'Toxic by inhalation and if swallowed'.        After repeated oral or inhalative administration, the critical effect was the induction of haemolytic anaemia, with secondary effects in the spleen, liver, kidneys and bone marrow. The possible classification with Xn; R48/22 or T; R48/25 ('Harmful or Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed') could not be agreed by the experts, but the classification T, R48/23 'Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure through inhalation' was proposed. Triazoxide did not show genotoxic or carcinogenic properties in the available studies.        No specific adverse effects on fertility were observed in the multi-generation rat study, but the classification R64 'May cause harm to breastfed babies' was proposed based on reduced pup survival during lactation that could be expected to result from the presence of triazoxide in milk. No developmental toxicity or teratogenic activity was observed in rats or rabbits.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 2-year rat study and using a safety factor of 100, increased by an additional safety factor of 3. This was justified by the use of a lowest observed adverse effect level, the steep dose-response in the study and the absence of mechanistic information. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 90-day rat study, using a safety factor of 100 and a correction for bioavailability (50 %). The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.015 mg/kg bw, based on the 4-week rat study and applying a safety factor of 100.        The dermal absorption values to be used in the risk assessment are 2.4 % for the concentrate and 2 % for the contaminated grain dust. The operator exposure estimates during the seed treatment are above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but realistic field studies show an exposure level up to 21 % of the AOEL with the use of coverall and gloves. Similarly, the exposure estimates for the worker loading and sowing treated seed are above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but below the AOEL considering a field study (26 %), with the use of long-sleeved shirt and long trousers. Bystander exposure is not expected to exceed the exposure of workers involved in loading/sowing treated seed (i.e. 26 % of the AOEL).        Based on the new metabolism study conducted on barley with seeds treated at dose rates of 3 and 30 g a.s./100 kg seeds (N and 10N studies when compared to the critical GAP), the residue was defined as triazoxide alone for monitoring and as sum of triazoxide, desoxy-triazoxide (M01) and triazoxideamino (M02) for risk assessment. A conversion factor of 6 was proposed for risk assessment derived from the metabolism study, taking into account the respective percentage at which each compound was detected in straw.        A new residue data set was submitted where samples were analysed using an analytical method achieving a LOQ of 0.001 mg/kg, and the MRL for barley grain was proposed at the LOQ value. Such an unusually low value was proposed, given the low ADI agreed for the parent compound. The residue data are supported by the storage stability study showing triazoxide residues to be stable up to 2 years when stored frozen at -18 degrees C. Processing studies were not submitted and are not required. The available data are sufficient to conclude that significant residues are not expected to be present in rotational crops.        Estimated intakes by animals were calculated to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM. A goat metabolism study was however provided in order to confirm that transfer of residues in animal matrices is not expected at levels that could be of concern for the consumers. Since the total radioactive residues (TRRs) in goat matrices were shown to be below 0.0005 mg/kg when expressed on a 1N rate basis, the setting of a residue definition and proposing MRLs for animal matrices were considered not necessary.        No chronic or acute risks were identified for the consumers, with the TMDI being less that 4 % of the ADI and the IESTI less that 0.1 % of the ARfD when calculations are performed using the EFSA PRIMo model, the proposed MRL of 0.001 mg/kg for barley, and the conversion factor of 6.        Triazoxide may be considered to be highly to very highly persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DT50 (lab) ((biphasic kinetic, overall)) = 208 - 278 days). The degradation of triazoxide proceeds either through reduction to M01, or through production of M02. The assessment based on the decline from the peak observed indicated that metabolite M01 was moderately persistent in soil (DissT(50) (lab) = 32.4 - 56.7 days), and metabolite M02 could be considered highly persistent (decline M02 DissT(50 field) = 239 - 313 days; excluding the UK field trial where no decline is observed).        Unextracted residues amounted to a maximum of 29.8 % AR after 120 days (end of the study). Mineralization was practically negligible in the four soils tested.        Photolysis slightly enhances degradation of triazoxide in soil, but it is not expected to contribute significantly to its environmental dissipation.        According to the available studies, triazoxide may be considered as low to medium mobile in soil (K-foc = 245 - 1743 mL / g), metabolite M01 may be considered slightly mobile (K-foc = 2053 - 4148 mL / g), and metabolite M02 may be considered low to medium mobile (K-foc = 385.6 - 1709.0 mL / g). The narrow range of pH and the ionisable character of the metabolite M02 were noted. Whereas a large margin of safety is considered to exist for the representative use, further data could be needed if other uses at significantly higher application rates are applied for in the future.        Triazoxide was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, practically stable at pH 7, and readily hydrolysed at pH 9 (DT50 = 6.6 days). The main hydrolysis metabolite was M04. Triazoxide is rapidly photolysed in water (DT50 = 24.4 hours equivalent to 3.5 natural solar days at 33 degrees N). An additional study indicated that the photolysis half-life of triazoxide in water is expected to range from 1.7 to 9.7 days, depending on the season and the latitude (30 - 50 degrees N).        No ready biodegradability study is available and therefore triazoxide is considered not readily biodegradable.        In aquatic water / sediment systems, triazoxide dissipated rapidly from water to sediment phase, and broke down to form the metabolites M01 and M05. Unextractable residues in the sediment amounted up to 55.7 % AR in the sediment after 91 days). Mineralization was negligible in both systems. The limited sampling regime of these experiments prevents the calculation of reliable kinetic parameters. However, a simple non-linear kinetic analysis was presented by the applicant to derive dissipation and degradation rates of triazoxide and metabolite M01 in the water sediment systems. This kinetic analysis was only partially validated (only whole system results for the Lienden system were confirmed). For the IJzendoorn system, no reliable whole system half-lives for the parent compound and metabolite M01 were obtained due to poor fit. Worst-case whole system half-lives of 4.3 days and 323 days were estimated for triazoxide and metabolite M01, respectively, based on results of the Lienden system.        The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments (Predicted environmental concentrations (PEC)) were carried out for triazoxide as well as the metabolites M01, M02 and M05 using the FOCUS step 1, step 2 and step 3 approach. For the metabolites M01 and M05 the available step 1 and step 2 values are relied on for the risk assessment. Detailed information about model parameterisation is provided in the list of end points in Appendix A.        The necessary groundwater exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using FOCUS scenarios and the models PEARL 3.3.3 and PELMO 3.3.2 for the active substance triazoxide and the metabolites M01 and M02. To assess the risk associated with preferential transport through structured soils the Chateaudun scenarios were also simulated using the MACRO model. Detailed information about model parameterisation is provided in the list of end points in Appendix A. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses for these compounds above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations represented by all relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        Triazoxide is not expected to significantly volatilize or to be subject to long-range transport in air.        The first-tier short-term TER values for granivorous birds were above the Annex VI trigger values, indicating a low risk. The margin of safety (TER=23.5) was considered to cover the uncertainty related to the derivation of a short-term toxicity end point, due to food avoidance (end point based on consumption in group where there was 30 % mortality). Further refinements were required to address the acute and long-term risk to birds. Based on yellowhammer as focal species, the acute TER value was calculated to be 9.1. Yellowhammer would have to consume 159 (including a 10-fold uncertainty factor) seeds on an acute time scale to breach the Annex VI trigger. This number of seeds would cover approximately 3.45 m(2) of a field, and the number of seeds would cover 90 % of the daily food requirement of a yellowhammer. Furthermore, worst-case field studies indicated that yellowhammer could consume 1/3 of the critical number of seeds in one feeding event. Given these facts, in addition to the indication of food avoidance behaviour detected in the short-term dietary study, it was concluded that the risk to granivorous birds from consumption of treated seeds could be considered to be low on an acute timescale. The conclusion was supported by an additional assessment for a fast-feeding granivorous bird like the woodpigeon. A long-term risk assessment on reproductive birds was considered relevant for the spring use of triazoxide as a seed treatment. A refined long-term TER of 2.23 was calculated based on residue decline data for triazoxide in barley seed on soil surface. Further refinements were needed to address the long-term risk to granivorous birds from the spring use. Following the initial risk assessment, further data and refinements were considered during the resubmission. Four species were identified as focal species (skylark, chaffinch, woodpigeon and yellowhammer) in the Additional Report. Further information was provided supporting the proportion of the food obtained in the treated area (PT) for each focal species as well as the proportion of food types obtained from the treated crop (PD). The refined TER values were above the Annex VI trigger values for all representative focal species, therefore the long-term risk to granivorous birds for both the use in autumn and spring sown barley was assessed as low.        The tier 1 acute risk assessment for granivorous mammals was found to be low. Further refinements were required with regard to the long-term risk assessment for granivorous mammals. The refinements in the original review were based on wood mouse as focal species and on use of measured residue data, however they were considered as not satisfactory and further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to granivorous mammals. During the resubmission application further data were provided to refine the risk assessment. However, the higher tier risk assessment gave a TERlt below the Annex VI trigger value, indicating a potential high long-term risk. Therefore, the long-term risk assessment to granivorous mammals needs further refinements and a data gap remains. The issue has been indicated as a critical area of concern.        Risk assessment of secondary poisoning and consumption of contaminated water was considered not relevant.        Triazoxide is proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute and chronic risk to aquatic organisms was considered to be low. Furthermore, the risk to sediment-dwelling organisms from the metabolites M01, M02 and M05 was considered as low.        The acute risk to earthworms was considered to be low. The long-term risk from triazoxide and the soil metabolites M01 and M02 to earthworms was considered as low. Concerning other soil non-target macro-organisms, the risk to springtails was considered low for all potential soil residues. In addition, the potential risk from triazoxide and its metabolites to soil litter degradation processes was assessed as low.        The risk to bees and non-target arthropods was assessed to be low, as was the risk to soil non-target micro-organisms, biological methods of sewage treatment, and non-target plants.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  19,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2018     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Triazoxide;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;fungicide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triazoxide european food safety authority

Secondly, LC exposure resulted in excessively damaged mitochondrial and mtROS, diminished mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, which could be improved by MA. Thirdly, MA upregulated the levels of mitophagy-related regulatory factors (Beclin1, LC3, ATG5, Tom20 and Lamp2) induced by LC. Importantly, MA decreased the levels of pyroptosis-related genes treated with LC, including NLRP3, Cas-4, GSDMD and active Cas-1. Further study indicated that LC treatment caused excessive miRNA-194-5p and reduced levels of FoxO1, PINK1 and Parkin, which was inhibited by MA treatment. Overall, we concluded that MA could enhance damaged mitochondrial elimination by promoting the miRNA-194-5p-FoxO1-PINK1/Parkinmitophagy in lymphocytes, which reduced mtROS accumulation and alleviated pyroptosis.

Integrated analysis of biochemical, histopathological and genetic parameters in fish exposed to Malathion insecticide provide information on the toxicity mechanisms of this pesticide, which is classified as a probable carcinogen for humans. The present study assessed the biological responses of Colossoma macropomum after exposure to Malathion. We started determining the lethal concentration, which is the concentration capable of killing 50% of the subjects in an acute toxicity test (LC50-96 h), which was 15.77 +/- 3.30 mgL(-1). The fish were, then, exposed to Malathion during 96 h at a sublethal concentration, 7.30 mgL(-1). Overall, we observed an increased activity of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes, which reduced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species after 96 h exposure, as well as kept constant the mitochondrial respiration, Acetylcholinesterase activity and DNA damage. However, fish exposed to insecticide presented severe gill histopathological damage and increased expression of proto-oncogene ras. Taken together, the results suggest that, after four days of exposure to the Malathion, C. macropomum efficiently activates its defense mechanisms, suggesting that the basal response mechanisms are responsive. On the other hand, histopathologic damages evidenced the adverse effects of Malathion on fish, since it promoted gill necrosis and increased the expression of ras oncogene that is directly related to tumorigenesis events.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111340     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Insecticide;Antioxidant;Oxidative damage;Carcinogenesis;Malathion;CARPIO PROTECTIVE ROLE;DNA-DAMAGE;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES;HERMAPHRODITIC FISH;RAS ONCOGENE;R-RAS;EXPRESSION;GENE;GILLS,NA,NA,severe damages caused by malathion exposure in <i>colossoma macropomum<i>

After 28 d of CYP exposure, the levels of Immunoglobulin M (IgM), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) after treatment with 1.5 mu g/L CYP. Moreover, an induction of inflammatory cytokine transcripts (tnfa, il-6, il-8, and il-12) was observed (p < 0.05) after treatment with 1.5 mu g/L CYP.

This work aimed to evaluate acute and chronic toxic effects of benzoylurea pesticide (lufenuron) on biological parameters of Colossoma macropomum (Tambaqui). In the acute test, juveniles of Tambaqui were divided into control group and five experimental groups with exposure from 0.1 to 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron for 96 h. Animals were also submitted to chronic toxicity test for four months in concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/L of lufenuron, the concentration used in the treatment of ectoparasites in fish and 50% of LC50 96 h, respectively. The presence of hemorrhages was observed in eyes, fins and operculum of fish exposed to 0.7 and 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron. Histological analysis showed changes in the morphology of fish gills submitted to acute toxicity test, as lamellar aneurysm and blood congestion inside lamellae. Lufenuron promoted damage in fish retina as in ability to respond to stimuli in photo-receptors and in ON-bipolar cells in acute test. In chronic test, blood glucose analysis and morphometric parameters showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). In general, Tambaqui exhibited behaviors associated with stress when exposed to lufenuron. Thus, lufenuron showed several toxic effects in relation to biological parameters in Tambaqui.

rayyan-1227193483,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Tetraconazole,2008,10,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,10,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Tetraconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tetraconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 5 February 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant ISAGRO S.p.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March- April 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June - July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Eminent 40 ME"", a micro-emulsion (ME) containing 40 g/L tetraconazole.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor tetraconazole residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin, soil and water; however additional ILV and confirmatory methods are required. There is no acceptable monitoring method for air.        Mammalian toxicology of tetraconazole has been assessed in a series of tests. It is absorbed rapidly orally to an extent of about 80%. It is widely distributed in the body. It does not accumulate and is excreted rapidly and completely. It is extensively metabolised. Tetraconazole is of moderate acute toxicity by the oral and of low toxicity by the dermal and inhalation route. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant and has no skin sensitising properties. A classification as Xn; R22 ""Harmful; Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed. In several short-term dietary studies liver and kidneys were the target organs of toxicity (the lowest NOAEL of 2.95 mg/kg bw/d was found in dogs). Tetraconazole is not genotoxic. In a chronic rat study liver effects and at higher doses also effects on bones and incisors (fluorosis) and thyroid tumours were seen. In a carcinogenicity study with mice liver tumours were observed. Neither the thyroid tumours in rats nor the liver tumours in mice were considered relevant for human risk assessment. In a two-generation study dystocia and prolonged gestation periods were observed in dams and classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R62 ""Harmful; Possible risk of impaired fertility"" was proposed. In a developmental study with rats extra ribs, hydrourether and hydronephrosis occurred in the pups and classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R63 ""Harmful; Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was set at 0.004 mg/kg bw/d, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was fixed at 0.03 mg/kg bw/d and the ARfD was set at of 0.05 mg/kg bw. Using the worst case scenario of all suggested uses for preparation EMINENT 40 ME (tractor mounted/trailed boom sprayer; hydraulic nozzles on sugar beet and wheat) the calculated exposures were 305.13% and 48.17% and 51.26% and 39.56% with and without PPE (personal protective equipment) respectively of the AOEL in the UK POEM and in the German model. Estimated maximum exposure using worst case scenarios amount to 5.5% of the AOEL for bystanders and to 28% of the AOEL for re-entry workers.        The metabolism of tetraconazole in plants was investigated upon foliar application to wheat, sugar beet and grapes and in carrots, lettuce and wheat planted as succeeding crops. Based on the studies a residue definition including tetraconazole and the triazole derivative metabolites (triazole alanine, triazole acetic acid) has been provisionally established. A final plant residue definition for risk assessment is pending the clarification on the toxicological properties of metabolite triazole hydroxypropionic acid. This metabolite had not been identified in metabolism studies with other triazole pesticide compounds assessed in the peer review.        The nature of the residue is not altered by processing. From processing studies transfer factors to juice, wine and dry apple pomace could be derived.        A sufficient number of supervised residue trials are only available to cover the representative uses in wheat and sugar beets in all Europe and hence MRLs can be proposed for these crops. The representative uses in grapes and apples were initially not supported by residue trials matching the notified GAP criteria. Trials submitted during the peer review process could not be considered in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007.        Uptake of soil residues by rotational crops is not expected to lead to residues of tetraconazole per se above the LOQ. In contrast, a significant uptake of triazole derivative metabolites is expected, but the available field studies were not considered sufficient to address residues in following crops. Hence a data gap for a new field rotational crop study has been set.        Feed commodities may represent a significant source of exposure to tetraconazole residues for animals. Metabolism studies in lactating goats and laying hens are available, and based on the metabolic pattern in animal tissues a residue definition was proposed. However, due to data gaps the livestock dietary intake estimates cannot be finalised and thus appropriate MRLs for animal products can currently not be proposed.        The consumer risk assessment for the notified representative uses can currently not be finalised. Excluding the uses on apples and grapes and only considering residues of tetraconazole alone, the RMS has submitted a provisional and none-peer reviewed chronic and acute consumer risk assessment indicating consumer exposure being below the toxicological reference values for tetraconazole. A robust conclusion on the consumer risk will only be possible when the identified data gaps are addressed and sufficient data and information regarding the assessment of triazole derivative metabolites in primary crops, rotational crops, and products of animal origin is available.        Degradation of tetraconazole in soil under dark aerobic laboratory conditions was negligible. Photolysis of tetraconazole in soil was negligible.        Degradation of tetraconazole was also investigated in three soils under aerobic outdoor conditions, exposed to sunlight. The applicant attributed degradation to a combined effect of photochemical and microbial degradation. RMS considered the reliability of the study doubtful since no clear mechanism may explain degradation. The experts considered that further experiments investigating effect of higher temperatures in dark under controlled moisture conditions and indirect aqueous photochemical studies could help to understand the mechanism of degradation prevailing in the environment.        Therefore, a data gap was identified for these additional studies.        Dissipation of tetraconazole under field conditions was investigated in five sites (4 in Germany and 1 Northern Italy). In the five soils dissipation followed biphasic behaviour. Tetraconazole was high to very high persistent during the second phase. The meeting of experts agreed that the field half lives cannot be used in FOCUS modelling with the current lack of understanding of the mechanism causing loss. For PEC soil the meeting of experts agreed that the longest second phase field DT50 of 1688 d should be used. Potential accumulation of tetraconazole may not be excluded since about 20 40 % AR remains as tetraconazole one year after application. Assuming yearly application and tillage, EFSA calculated a plateau background concentration over the 20 cm horizon after 36 years and peak concentration after last application. Tetraconazole is low mobile in acidic soils. Adsorption / desorption of potential metabolites M 14360-acid and TAA were investigated in different studies. Metabolite M 14360-acid may be considered high to very high mobile in soil and TAA very high mobile in soil. Potential metabolite M 14360-alcohol may be considered very high mobile in soil.        A two years lysimeter study with two soil monoliths was performed in Switzerland. Product containing labelled tetraconazole was applied the first year. No product was applied the second year. Residue leachate concentrations observed were 0.53 0.54 mu g / L and 0.27 mu g / L parent equivalents for the first and second year respectively. The two major fractions were M11 (47 % - 66 % of radioactivity in the leachate; corresponding to 0.11 - 0.18 1.1 mu g/L) and M10 (15 - 21 % of the radioactivity in the leachate; corresponding to 0.03 - 0.08 1.1 mu g/L). A data gap was identified for the characterization of tetraconazole lysimeter metabolites M10 and Mll and to address its potential for ground water contamination.        Tetraconazole is stable to hydrolysis and is not expected to be degraded by photolysis in water. Tetraconazole is not readily biodegradable.        A dissipation study of tetraconzole in two water/sediment systems under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C is available. Degradation only occurs in the sediment by formation of non extractable residue. Virtually no degradation product was observed. Mineralization was negligible over the duration of the study (100 d). Tetraconazole was very high persistent in both systems (DT50 whole system = 310 372 d). New PEC SW values calculated according FOCUS SW and FOCUS kinetics were presented in the Addendum 1 to the DAR. These PECSW are based on FOCUS SW Step 2 and were agreed by the meeting of experts. However, some MSs may require Step 3 calculations. With respect to PECSED a data gap to address the potential accumulation of tetraconazole in the sediment was identified.        FOCUS GW calculations presented for the parent compound in Addendum 2 were agreed by the meeting of experts. None of the uses and scenarios simulated resulted in 80th percentile annual average leachate concentration above the trigger of 0.1 mu g / L. For the metabolites the meeting of experts did not agree on the calculations presented. Lysimeter metabolite Mll exceed 0.1 mu g parent eq / L the year of application and the subsequent year. Lysimeter metabolite M10 reach concentrations slightly below the trigger (0.08 mu g parent eq / L) the year of application; since the substance has been applied only one season, it may not be excluded that this metabolite also exceeds the trigger of 0.1 mu g parent eq / L when tetraconazole is applied in successive seasons. On basis of the vapour pressure (1.8 10(-4) Pa) and the water solubility (196 mg /L) a Henry's Law constant of 3.6 . 10(-4) Pa m(3) mol(-1) was calculated. Half life in the troposphere due to photochemical reaction with OH. radicals was calculated to be of 1.16 d.        The acute risk assessment to insectivorous birds in orchards and sugar beets indicated a low risk, where as the acute risk to insectivorous birds in cereals and herbivorous birds in sugar beets was assessed to be high and calls for further refinements. The short-term risk to birds from all intended uses was considered to be low, whereas the long-term risk to birds from all intended uses was found to be high. A refined long-term risk assessment for birds for all intended uses was required, taking into account the recommendations from the expert meeting. Only the long-term risk assessment to mammals was provided in the DAR, as the acute toxicity endpoint for mammals was found not to be valid by RMS. However, the mammalian toxicity experts agreed that the acute study was valid, and EFSA subsequently calculated acute TER values for mammals The risk was found to be low for all uses. The long-term risk assessment to mammals indicated a low risk to insectivorous mammals from use in cereals and a high risk to herbivorous mammals from uses in sugar beets, grapes and apples.        Refinements were required to address the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals for uses in sugar beets, grapes and apples. The risk assessment for secondary poisoning indicated a low risk to fish eating birds and mammals and earthworm-eating mammals. The risk to earthworm-eating birds was found to be high and further refinements were required. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was considered to be low for birds and mammals. A data gap to address the risk for potential endocrine effects on birds was identified.        Tetraconazole is very toxic to aquatic organisms. However, acute and chronic TER values were far above the Annex VI trigger for all organisms included in the aquatic risk assessment, based on FOCUSsw Step 2 South European calculation for the worst case sugar beet application. A data gap was identified for the applicant to address the potential risk of endocrine disrupting effects in fish.        Standard glass plate tests were provided for Aphidius rhopalosiphi, Typhlodromus pyri, Crysoperla carnea and Poecilus cupreus. No effects were found in the two latter species. The study with T pyri was considered insufficient to address the risk due to high escape rates during the study. Even though in-field and off-field HQ indicated at low risk to A. rhopalosiphi, reproductive effects above 50% were derived in extended laboratory study with A. rhopalosiphi at exposure rates comparable to infield uses. Aged residue studies, however, indicated that the effects on mortality and reproduction never exceeded 50% even at day 0 of ageing. Field studies covering all intended uses indicated a low risk to T pyri. The expert meeting agreed to require an extended lab study (with fresh residues) with T pyri to conduct an off-field risk assessment in order to see if the off-field risk to mites/spiders will be addressed also for species with longer reproductive cycles than T pyri (i.e. species with lower capacity to re-colonise the in-field area).        The formulation Eminent 125 EW had no significant effect on organic matter decomposition over a six months period in a litter bag test with worst a case application rate        The risk from tetraconazole to bees, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.        As uncertainties remains for potential soil metabolites, no final conclusion can be drawn for the risk from metabolites to aquatic organisms, earthworms, soil non-target micro- and macro organisms.

The unwitting casualties of this battle are the millions of birds, fish, and other wildlife that have been killed, and the hundreds of protected species put at risk of extinction. This battle has intensified in recent years, as environmental organizations have sued the United States Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") for its continued failure to comply with the Endangered Species Act (""ESA""). In response, EPA has invoked numerous legal and regulatory strategies, becoming further entrenched in its position of non-compliance. EPA's reluctance to conform to the ESA is due in part to its institutional bias in favor of registering pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (""FIFRA""), and its generic bureaucratic inertia. A significant cause of the non-compliance, however, is the catch-22 in which EPA finds itself due to inherent conflicts between FIFRA and the ESA.        This Article begins by describing the extent of the harm to wildlife, including threatened and endangered species, caused by current pesticide usage and EPA's failure to comply with wildlife protection laws. After providing an overview of the major federal species protection statutes, this Article chronicles the historic tension between those statutes, discussing the resulting litigation, EPA's regulatory actions and inaction, and the legislative response. The picture that emerges is one of unresolved crisis and massive noncompliance with federal mandates. The Article then turns to examine the sources of tension between the statutes: their conflicting goals, standards, geographic and temporal focuses, and risk reduction methods. Based on this exposition of the fundamental tensions, the Article concludes by suggesting legislative reforms intended to eliminate or at least alleviate the conflict and to reconcile the goals of wildlife protection and availability of socially useful pesticides.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  31,,BIRD TREATY ACT;Pesticides,NA,NA,the killing fields reducing the casualties in the battle between us species protection law and us pesticide law

A sublethal fenthion concentration (0.45 mg/L) was applied for 24, 48, and 96 In together with injection with BSO or NAC; following treatment, recovery periods for 24, 48, and 96 h were allowed. Total glutathione (tGSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), lipid peroxidation, protein level, and GSH-related enzyme activities were analyzed by using spectrophotometric methods. Fenthion in applied concentration did not change GSH levels, but increased GSSG levels. BSO application in fenthion exposure caused a depletion in GSH, while increasing the GSSG levels. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx; EC 1.11.1.9) specific activity increased in fenthion-applied groups at 24-h treatment. gamma-Glutamylcysteinyl synthetase (gamma-GCS; EC 6.3.2.2) was not detected in the brain.

The 24 It LC50 of neem leaf extract for juveniles P lineatus was estimated as 4.8 g L-1; the fish were then exposed for 24 h to 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 g L-1 or only clean water (control). Plasma glucose levels were higher in fish exposed to 2.5 g L-1 and 5.0 g L-1 neem extract, relative to control, indicating a typical stress response. Neem extract did not interfere with the osmoregulating capacity of the fish, as their plasma sodium, chloride, total protein and osmolarity did not change. The presence of the biopesticide interfered with the antioxidant defense system of P. lineatus, as there was a decrease in liver catalase activity at all neem concentrations and the detoxifying enzyme glutathione-S-transferase was activated in fish exposed to 5.0 g L-1. Fish exposed to all neem extract concentrations exhibited damaged gill and kidney tissue.

rayyan-1227193488,"Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance 1,3-dichloropropene",2006,6,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,6,,ESFA,,English,,,"1,3-Dichloropropene is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on 1,3-dichloropropene in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 16 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 10 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force originally consisted of Dow AgroScience B. V. and BASF Agro B. V. BASF sold the business of 1,3-dichloropropene to Kanesho Soil Treatment BVBA on 17 December 2003 and therefore was replaced in the Task Force. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 8 November 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as nematicide as proposed by the applicants. The application to bare soil comprise either introduction of the formulated product into the drip irrigation system (""EF-1478"") or soil injection at 15-20 cm depth (""XRM-5048"") to control nematodes in soil where tomatoes or peppers will be grew. The application rates are up to 283 kg 1,3-dichloropropene per hectare (""EF-1478"") and up to 224 kg per hectare (""XRM-5048""), respectively. 1,3-dichloropropene can be used as nematicide, insecticide, fungicide and herbicide, depending on the dose rate used. In general, an application of 1,3-dichloropropene by soil injection and/or drip irrigation is followed by partial sterilisation of the soil. It should be noted that the applicants stated that only the use as nematicide will be supported in the EU review programme.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Telone EC Drip"" (""EF-1478""), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Greece, Italy and Spain and ""Telone Injected"" (""XRM-5048"") registered under different trade names in some Member States of the EU. The formulation ""Telone Injected"" (""XRM-5048"") is coded as "" any other liquid"" (AL).        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        The toxicological risk assessment (and reference values) is considered to be inconclusive due to uncertainties in relation to the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. 1,3-dichloropopene is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised in the rat. The acute oral and dermal toxicity is high and the inhalatory toxicity is moderate, proposed classification and risk phrases are T; R24/25 ""Toxic by dermal exposure and if swallowed"" and R20 "" Harmful by inhalation"". It is a skin irritant and sensitizer, proposed classification and risk phrases are R38 ""Irritant to skin"" and R43 ""May cause sensitization by skin contact"". According to medical data 1,3-dichloropopene should be classified as irritant to eyes too and to the respiratory system, proposed classification and risk phrases are R36/R37 "" Irritating to eyes and respiratory system"".        The weight of evidence indicates that 1,3-dichloropropene is an in vivo genotoxic agent for somatic cells, acting directly or after activation by cytochrome P450, and glutathione protects against the genotoxicity. The classification of Mutagenic Category 3, R68 is proposed.        1,3-dichloropropene induced benign tumours in the liver of rats and in both urinary bladder epithelium and lung of mice. In addition, one hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in rats. However, the mechanism of action for tumour formation has not been yet identified. Although, results indicate that 1,3-dichloropopene can be mutagenic, the relevance of these results to mammalian tumour formation is uncertain owing to the high concentrations or doses used. The issue was to be forwarded to the PPR panel. The classification as possible human carcinogenic Category 3, R40? is highlighted. No reproduction toxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. The metabolites 3chloroallyl alcohol and 3-chloroacrylic acid are both toxic.        Dependent on the identity on the polychlorinated imp, it might be necessary to require new toxicological studies.        According to medical data, 1,3-dichloropropene should be classified as irritating to eyes (R36) and to irritating to respiratory system (R37). Furthermore, it is proposed to classify as R65 "" Harmful, may cause lung damage if swallowed"" due observed the adverse effects,        The provisional Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) ADI is 0.0125 mg/kg bw/day, with the use of the safety factor of 200. The additional safety factor of 2 was added in order to have at least 1000 between the ADI and the dose level where tumours are evident. The provisional systemic Acceptable Operator Level (AOEL) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100.        As inhalation exposure is the main route of exposition and all data from operator exposure are expressed as atmospheric concentration (mg/m(3)), an additional inhalatory human AOEC was assigned which is 0.066 ppm, equivalent to 0.30 mg/m(3) however should be considered as provisional. The ARfD is 0.2 mg/kg bw, with the safety factor of 100 added.        The 1,3-dichloropropene is applied to bare soil and consisted of two scenarios. The estimations are based on field measurements. However, the estimated operator exposure should be considered only as indicative due to the uncertainties in relation to the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. For both uses drip irrigation and soil injection, PPE (gloves and coverall) and RPE (respiratory mask with filter for organic vapours) is needed in order not to exceed the AOEL (16% and 38%, respectively). The exposure for workers and bystanders should be negligible.        The degradation and metabolism of 1,3-D has been studied comparatively in fruit (tomatoes and citrus), root vegetables (sugar beets), and pulses and oilseeds (soybeans) following application of radio labelled material to the soil surrounding the tree or to the soil in which seeds were planted. Additional information from succeeding crop studies is given on leafy crops (lettuce) and cereals (wheat).        Even though a high amount of applied 1,3-D is expected to volatilise from soil, the results of the available studies indicate that 1,3-D is also absorbed into plants, translocated and degraded. Naturally occurring plant constituents contained the majority of radioactivity recovered in edible plant parts, indicating complete metabolism of 1,3-D. Consequently, no 1,3-D residues above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are expected to be present in primary or succeeding crops. This was confirmed by supervised residue trials data.        However, it is stressed that the available studies don't provide any information regarding the residue behaviour of the chlorinated impurities present in the technical material that are added to soil at a high level (up to ca 6 kg/ha) when applying 1,3-D at the intended rate. There is no information on possible persistency, uptake, accumulation or metabolic fate and residue level of those chlorinated impurities, whether of known or unknown type, and moreover data on their toxicological properties are not available. This lack of data gives rise to concern in respect of consumer safety, even though potential chronic and acute dietary exposure to residues of 1,3 D per se from tomatoes and peppers is well below (< 1%) the ADI and ARfD, respectively.        1,3-dichloropropene is a volatile liquid, so even though it is injected below the soil surface or applied via drip irrigation systems, the major route of dissipation from soil is volatilisation to the air. In aerobic laboratory soil studies it exhibited low to moderate persistence and formed the major (> 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid which exhibited very low to moderate persistence and the minor (< 10% AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited very low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 11-37% AR at 49-77 days. At these times unextracted soil residue accounted for 9-28% AR.        In laboratory soil batch adsorption studies 1,3-dichloropropene exhibited very high to high mobility. (EZ)-3-chloroaryl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid exhibited very high soil mobility.        In a laboratory study on a natural sediment water system (25 degrees C) with dosing under the water surface, volatilisation was again the major route of dissipation of 1,3-dichloropropene from the systems. 1,3dichloropropene exhibited low persistence and formed the minor (< 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation products (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid and (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 57% AR at 21 days. At this time unextracted sediment residues accounted for 14% AR. Acceptable surface aquatic system PEC are only available for the drip irrigation application in glasshouses. There is a data gap for acceptable concentration estimates from the outdoor uses, where the exposure from the drainage and runoff routes of entry need to be appropriately assessed. Member State experts' considered that potential deposition from the air to surface water should also be considered by the notifier when providing aquatic PEC from the outdoor uses notified.        FOCUS groundwater tier I' modelling indicates that at the spatial scale usually assessed of the treated field, there is a very high potential for the contamination of groundwater by parent (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid. The results from an extensive targeted EU groundwater monitoring program are available. However data requirements for further information regarding aspects of this monitoring have been identified. These identified deficiencies should be addressed before this monitoring work is used for regulatory decision making.        1,3-dichloropropene volatilises from soil even though it is applied below the soil surface. The flux losses from the soil have been measured in field studies in the USA. There is a data gap identified to provide information that these measured flux losses under American geoclimatic conditions are also pertinent to EU geoclimatic conditions. Member State experts' and the EFSA considered sufficient information has been provided to conclude that the 1,3-dichloropropene that will reach the upper atmosphere will degrade relatively rapidly and that this compound and its potential atmospheric degradation products are unlikely to have an adverse effect on the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, as they will be relatively short lived in this environmental compartment.        Bridging studies are needed if new impurities are identified in the new five batch analysis which are not covered by the batches tested in the section on ecotoxicology. As the relevance of the impurity 1,2-dichloropropane was not discussed during the peer review process, the EFSA proposes the applicant to addresses the ecotoxicological relevance of this impurity. The levels of 1,2dichloropropane in the ecotoxicological studies must be confirmed if considered relevant.        The indoor use in glasshouse is defined as a permanent structure to which entry of birds and mammals is limited and hence the risk to birds and mammals for the indoor uses is regarded to be low. A high acute risk to earthworm eating and insectivorous birds and mammals and a long term risk to earthworm eating and insectivorous mammals is identified for the outdoor uses. Data to address these risks is still awaited. No long term toxicity study with birds is available. A residue study on plants is awaited to assess the risk to herbivorous birds and mammals. The risk to birds and mammals for the outdoor uses can only be concluded once the outstanding data requirements become available. The EPCO expert's meeting set a data requirement for the applicant to submit the endpoints for algae based on biomass. Once these become available the risk assessment needs to be revised based on the lowest endpoint. Algae and Lemna gibba are more sensitive to the metabolites (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid than to the parent compound. Long term studies with the metabolite (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid on fish and Daphnia magna are requested as this metabolite has been identified and requires further consideration based on potential levels in ground and surface water. The acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms from the indoor use via drip irrigation can be regarded as low without the need for risk mitigation measures. The risk to aquatic organisms from the direct soil injection method of application indoors and outdoors, can only be concluded once the PEC in surface water become available (see 4.2.1 and 5.2). Given the high application rate (up to 224 kg a. s./ha) and aquatic endpoints below 1 mg a. s./L risk mitigation measures might become necessary. The risk for bioconcentration in fish for 1,3-dichloropropene and metabolites (EZ)-3chloroallyl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid is considered to be low.        An inhalation study with bees and a calculation of relevant PEC values to conduct the risk assessment for the inhalation toxicity to bees is requested as the active substance can be found in the air even at distances of 800 m from the treated field.        Observed effects 1 day after treatment (DAT) were below 30% for H. aculeifer, P. cupreus, A. bilineata and Pardosa spp. 1 DAT 78% effect on mortality was observed for F. candida. No adverse effects of Telone II treated soil were observed when F. candida was introduced 22 days after treatment of the soil. Given the observed effects on Folsomia candida the rapporteur Member State asked the applicant to further address the risk to non-target arthropods for the outdoor uses.        A high acute risk to earthworms was observed. The announced new field study in UK potato fields is still awaited to address several comments which were raised on the existing earthworm field study. The long term risk to earthworm from exposure to 7 day old treated soil can be regarded as low. The acute and long term risk to earthworms exposed to freshly treated soil can only be concluded once the outstanding field data become available. The rapporteur Member State considers that this data gap only applies to the outdoor uses.        Effects from 40.23% to 96.9% on soil microbial respiration and nitrogen transformation were observed on day 90 at the end of the study while the test soils were incubated with fresh untreated soil on day 49. A field study to address this concern was discussed at the EPCO experts' meeting and the meeting identified the need for a new field study to address this risk which should also cover the concern for the effects from the soil metabolites. The rapporteur Member State considers that this data gap only applies to the outdoor uses.        Regarding the indoor uses, the EFSA would like to point out that earthworms, soil micro-organisms, F. candida and other soil non-target arthropods are likely to come into contact with 1,3dichloropropene as the product is applied to full soil. This could affect the function of the soil indoors.        A potential risk to non-target plants was identified. The EPCO Expert's meeting decided that the risk should be more quantified and TER values at a few metres from the field should be calculated. The risk to non-target plants can only be concluded once this risk assessment becomes available. It cannot be excluded that 1,3-D might be harmful if the waste water goes to sewage treatment plants.

Each of these studies is a longitudinal prospective study, in which women were recruited during pregnancy and the children are being followed for at least several years after birth. The study from which the largest body of data has been published to date is being performed in the Netherlands, in which exposure to PCBs and related compounds is through the general food supply. Mother-infant pairs were recruited in two cities. Half of the infants were bottle-fed and half breast-fed in each city. Four PCB congeners (118, 138, 153, 180) were assessed in maternal and cord plasma, breast milk, and plasma of the child at 3.5 years. TEQ in breast milk was calculated based on PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs. Various measures of in utero exposure were associated with suboptimal neurological status during infancy, whereas maternal plasma PCB concentration was associated with cognitive deficits (Kaufman scores) at 3.5 years of age. The child's concurrent plasma PCB levels and maternal PCB plasma levels independently predicted performance on various aspects of a vigilance task, and maternal and cord plasma levels predicted impairment of complex play behavior. Poor scores on behavioral ratings were associated with concurrent blood PCB concentrations in the child. A study in Oswego in Lake Ontario fish eaters includes mothers who never ate Great Lakes fish and mothers who consumed greater than 40 PCB-equivalent pounds of Lake Ontario fish over their lifetime. Sixty-eight PCB congeners were measured in cord blood. Suboptimal neurological status during infancy was associated with maternal fish consumption and highly chlorinated cord PCB levels, whereas deficits in short-term memory at 6 months and 1 year of age were associated with total chlorinated cord PCB levels. In a study in Germany of 171 mother-infant pairs, PCB congeners 138, 153, and 180 were measured in cord plasma and milk 2 weeks after birth; both measures are considered markers of in utero exposure. Suboptimal neurological status during infancy, decrements in Bayley scores at 30 months and Kaufman scores at 42 months were associated with PCBs in milk but not cord plasma. These studies, combined with data from previous studies, reveal a consistent relationship between PCB exposure and suboptimal neurological status during infancy, and cognitive deficits associated with in utero exposure. Data from the Dutch study revealed effects on other behavioral domains associated with concurrent (postnatal) exposure. Although it is not possible to identify specific congeners or groups of congeners that may be responsible for the neurotoxic effects observed in these studies, the TEQ approach was not particularly predictive for neurotoxic outcomes.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  44,10.1080/20018091094853     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),PCBs;dioxins;behavioral deficits;developmental effects;in utero exposure;cognitive deficits;longitudinal prospective studies;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS PCBS;PRENATAL EXPOSURE;DICHLORODIPHENYL DICHLOROETHENE;MATERNAL CONSUMPTION;RECOGNITION MEMORY;HUMAN-MILK;CHILDREN;IMPAIRMENT;CONGENERS;INFANTS,NA,NA,relationship between measures of exposure to pcbsdioxins and behavioral effects in recent developmental studies

Our group has previously demonstrated that eSBU, purified from seeds, has antifungal properties against phytopathogenic fungi, entomotoxicity against Dysdercus peruvianus, the ability to induce blood platelet aggregation, and these properties are independent of its enzymatic activity. Here we describe the biological properties of apo-uSBU fused to glutathione Stransferase (GST) produced in Escherichia cod. Removal of GST affected apo-uSBU stability. We performed a Response Surface Methodology to optimize GST-uSBU production to 5 mg per liter and then bioassays were carried out. The recombinant protein exhibited inhibitory effects on filamentous fungi and affected fungal secondary metabolism. Candida albicans and C tropicalis were also susceptible to GST-uSBU and formed pseudo-hyphae. The fusion protein was toxic against Rhodnius prolixus, with the toxicity being accompanied by in vivo and in vitro hemocyte aggregation. Rabbit platelet also aggregated in the presence of GST-uSBU. Thus, uSBU displayed similar biological properties as previously described for eSBU even when fused to GST, reinforcing the proposed role of ureases in plant defense. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Direct risks of transgenics include escape and introgression of transgenes into wild populations; weedy invasion by transgenic organisms; toxicity orpathogenicity of engineered organisms and their products; and human error in the field testing and tracking of transgenic organisms. Indirect risks include environmental effects of increased herbicide use; the danger that engineered organisms may aid the development of bioweapons; the likelihood that gene patenting will lead to the privatization of natural resources; and the diversion of support from less glamorous forms of conservation. Formal risk assessments are commonly used to evaluate transgenic procedures, but our incomplete understanding of both ecosystem processes and the action of transgenes renders most of these assessments scientifically and socially unjustified. Nevertheless, a few, low-risk applications of transgenics may be possible: for example, ""super-sterile"" ornamental cultivars. Vertebrate cloning poses little risk to the environment, but it can consume scarce conservation resources, and its chances of success in preserving species seem poor To date, the conservation benefits of transgenics and vertebrate cloning remain entirely theoretical, but many of the risks are known and documented.

Widespread marine pollution such as oil spills, persistent organic pollutants, metals, and ocean plastic pollution has been linked to concerning changes in the ecophysiology and health of Galapagos species. Simultaneously, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are reshaping the composition and structure of endemic and native Galapagos pelagic communities. In this novel review, we discuss the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and their associated ecotoxicological implications for Galapagos species in the face of climate change stressors. We emphasize the importance of considering fishing pressure and marine pollution, in combination with climate-change impacts, when assessing the evolutionary fitness of species inhabiting the Galapagos. For example, the survival of endemic marine iguanas has been negatively affected by organic hydrocarbons introduced via oil spills, and endangered Galapagos sea lions exhibit detectable concentrations of DDT, triggering potential feminization effects and compromising the species' survival. During periods of ocean warming (El Nino events) when endemic species undergo nutritional stress, climate change may increase the vulnerability of these species to the impacts of pollutants, resulting in the species reaching its population tipping point. Marine plastics are emerging as a deleterious and widespread threat to endemic species. The Galapagos is treasured for its historical significance and its unparalleled living laboratory and display of evolutionary processes; however, this unique and iconic paradise will remain in jeopardy until multidisciplinary and comprehensive preventative management plans are put in place to mitigate and eliminate the effects of anthropogenic stressors facing the islands today. We present a critical analysis and synthesis of anthropogenic stressors with some progress from local and international institutional efforts and call to action more precautionary measures along with new management philosophies focused on understanding the processes of change through research to champion the conservation of the Galapagos.

The objective of this study is to determine if integrins are expressed on sea urchin eggs. The alphaB and betaC subunits were cloned using the homology polymerase chain reaction. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were developed against bacterially expressed fragments of the extracellular domains of the betaC subunit and the alphaB subunit. As well, a monoclonal antibody was developed against a synthesized peptide corresponding to part of the cytoplasmic domain of betaC. Analysis of biotinylated egg cortex extracts immunoprecipitated with either anti-betaC or anti-alphaB yields bands of 130 and 225 kDa. Immunoblots confirm that betaC is part of the complex immunoprecipitated with anti-alphaB. Confocal immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy show that betaC is present on the surface of the unfertilized egg at the tips of microvilli and in cortical granules. During the cortical reaction, immunoreactivity with antibodies to the extracellular domains of betaC and alphaB disappears from the egg surface, and microvillar casts on the fertilization envelope become immunoreactive. With antibodies to the cytoplasmic domain of betaC, immunoreactivity is lost from the surface of the egg, but the fertilization envelope does not immediately become immunoreactive. In immunoblots of egg cortex there are immunoreactive bands of the predicted sizes for alphaB and betaC. However, in fertilization envelopes, a second band that is slightly lower in molecular weight is also present. Eggs fertilized in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor have elongated microvilli that remain bound to the elevating fertilization envelope and immunoreactive to anti-betaC antibodies. Eggs fertilized in the presence of an ovoperoxidase inhibitor, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, have a patchy distribution of betaC immunoreactivity in fertilization envelopes. Together, these data suggest that alphaB betaC integrins are expressed on the surface of unfertilized eggs and, during the cortical reaction, the extracellular domains are cleaved by proteases and cross-linked into the fertilization envelope by ovoperoxidase. The alphaB betaC integrin receptors may have several potential functions prior to their removal at fertilization, including attachment of the vitelline envelope to the egg surface and anchoring the cortical cytoskeleton.

This communication reports the use of the mathematical simulation model SliDESim to investigate how best to administer cypermethrin bath treatments on Scottish salmon (Salmon salar L) farms to control the challenge from lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) during a two-year production cycle. It was found that these topical treatments are most effective when administered in pairs approximately six weeks apart. Timing of treatment is critical and depends on the number of treatments administered over the production cycle. For 4, 5 or 6 treatments during a two-year production cycle. SLiDESim indicated that the first pair of treatments is best initiated in autumn of the first year of production with the second pair starting between 13 and 18 weeks later. This strategy can produce considerable gains in the predicted reduction of sea lice levels when compared with those historically observed when using cypermethrin on Scottish farms. The effects of altered efficacy were also explored using the model and indicate that even a moderate reduction in treatment efficacy can have considerable impacts on lice control over a production cycle. The SLiDESim computer model provides a framework to explore the more efficient use of veterinary treatments for the control of sea lice on salmon farms.

Their complex lifecycle, involving freshwater spawning, juveniles (ammocoetes) that remain in freshwater for up to eight years, and adults migrating to sea before returning to reproduce, means native populations in Europe are threatened by multiple stressors, especially migration blockages and habitat loss. This has resulted in population declines across their European range, despite their ecological, evolutionary, and economic significance. Information on their population demography and long-term patterns are also scarce, with focus primarily on their ammocoete freshwater phase. This is inhibiting the development of biological reference points for utilization in population monitoring programs. In the Great Lakes of North America, however, P. marinus is invasive and the high damage caused to commercial fisheries resulted in their populations being controlled through a long-term, multi-method and integrated research and management approach over the last 40 years, with the development and application of a range of novel methods. Successful knowledge transfer to Europe could therefore facilitate the monitoring of threatened populations and develop new conservation actions, including modifying migration blockages to facilitate passage, implementing adult trapping programs, and applying pheromone treatments to manipulate adult movements and behaviors. This reveals the potential utility of using invasive fish populations to inform conservation practices in native ranges, and how pheromone research could further enhance fish conservation and monitoring.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  141,10.1080/23308249.2016.1233166     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Pheromone;trapping;invasion;fish passage;native;non-native;JUVENILE ATLANTIC SALMON;LAMPETRA-PLANERI BLOCH;GREAT-LAKES;CLIMATE-CHANGE;ORGANOCHLORINE CONTAMINANTS;PHEROMONE COMMUNICATION;MIGRATORY PHEROMONE;SPAWNING MIGRATION;REGULATED RIVERS;PACIFIC LAMPREY;Petromyzon,NA,NA,sea lamprey <i>petromyzon marinus<i> biology and management across their native and invasive ranges promoting conservation by knowledge transfer

Electrophysiological recordings from the antennules showed that neural activities in the crayfish antennules were still present 2 h after exposure to diazinon, although at decreased rates. In addition, responses to hydrodynamic stimuli indicated that the mechanosensitivity of crayfish antennules was reduced after exposure to concentrations of as low as 0.5 mg/L. The reduction in mechanosensitivity was larger and more rapid in the lateral flagellum than the medial flagellum. Observations from dye experiments showed that ambient water was more readily absorbed at the lateral flagellum than the medial flagellum probably because of differences in the setal structures of the 2 flagella.

This communication reports the use of the mathematical simulation model SLiDESim to investigate how best to administer cypermethrin bath treatments on Scottish salmon (Salmon salar L.) farms to control the challenge from lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) during a two-year production cycle. It was found that these topical treatments are most effective when administered in pairs approximately six weeks apart. Timing of treatment is critical and depends on the number of treatments administered over the production cycle. For 4, 5 or 6 treatments during a two-year production cycle, SLiDESim indicated that the first pair of treatments is best initiated in autumn of the first year of production with the second pair starting between 13 and 18. weeks later. This strategy can produce considerable gains in the predicted reduction of sea lice levels when compared with those historically observed when using cypermethrin on Scottish farms. The effects of altered efficacy were also explored using the model and indicate that even a moderate reduction in treatment efficacy can have considerable impacts on lice control over a production cycle.

According to the influence coefficient and sensitivity coefficient, manufacturing, construction and the tertiary sectors played a dominant role in promoting economic growth in this area. Furthermore, mining, water-electricity-gas production and supply, construction sectors were highly sensitive to the economic growth.

Risk-benefit assessments of fish consumption have frequently focused on methylmercury and omega-3 fatty acids, not persistent pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls, and none have evaluated Great Lakes fish consumption. Objectives: The risks and benefits of fish consumption have been established primarily for marine fish. Here, we examine whether sufficient data are available to evaluate the risks and benefits of eating freshwater fish from the Great Lakes. Methods: We used a scoping review to integrate information from multiple state, provincial, and federal agency sources regarding the contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and fish consumers, consumption rates and fish consumption advisories, and health effects of contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids. Data synthesis: Great Lakes fish contain persistent contaminants-many of which have documented adverse health effects -that accumulate in humans consuming them. In contrast, data are sparse on omega-3 fatty acids in the fish and their consumers. Moreover, few studies have documented the social and cultural benefits of Great Lakes fish consumption, particularly for subsistence fishers and native communities. At this time, federal and state/provincial governments provide fish consumption advisories based solely on risk. Conclusions: Our knowledge of Great Lakes fish has critical gaps, particularly regarding the benefits of consumption. A risk-benefit analysis requires more information than is currently available on the concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and their absorption by fish eaters in addition to more information on the social, cultural, and health consequences of changes in the amount of fish consumed.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 102; Correspondence Address: M.

The questions that concern us are the following: how can one minimize energy consumption in the chemical industry and reduce waste formation in chemical reactions, and can we transform this industry from one based primarily on petroleum to one that utilizes renewable feedstocks? In this chapter we will see how this ‚Äúgreening‚Äù of this major industrial and energy sector will require the use of catalysis and development of new catalysts. Synopsis Thomas Jefferson stated that ‚Äúthe earth belongs in usufruct to the living.‚Äù This premise is the basis of present recognition that, if the natural capacity of planet Earth to deal with pollution and waste is exceeded, then our lifestyle will become unsustainable. In this context, it is difficult to imagine life in the twenty-first century without accounting for the role the chemical industry plays in our modern society. For example, in the transportation sector, the most obvious aspect is the production of efficient fuels from petroleum, but one also should consider catalytic converters that reduce toxic emissions, and engineering polymers and plastics that reduce vehicle weight and therefore reduce fuel consumption. In daily consumer life we use chemicals in products such as paints, DVDs, synthetic carpets, refrigerants, packaging, inks and toners, liquid-crystal displays, and synthetic fibers. Pesticides and fertilizers are needed in order to increase agricultural productivity and pharmaceuticals to keep us healthy. In this chapter we will try to understand the aspects involved in the sustainability of the chemical industry. We will describe how to measure and control environmental performance and then define what we mean by green processing in the chemical industry, specifying green process metrics, introducing key concepts such as atom economy, E-factors, and effective mass yields. With these concepts together with the evaluation raw material costs, waste treatment, and unit processes needed for production of a chemical one can appreciate the ‚Äúgreenness‚Äù of a chemical process. The second part of this chapter will describe the role catalysis has in chemical transformations and how catalysis is used to reduce energy consumption and waste formation, together leading to increased sustainability. Examples will be given for a spectrum of applications ranging over oil refining, ammonia production, manufacture of important chemical intermediates and materials, and use of catalysis for the production of commodity chemicals. Finally, we will discuss the role catalysis may play in the replacement of fossil-fuel feedstocks with renewable ones, and how catalysis may contribute to our search for solar fuels. ¬© Materials Research Society 2012.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0,10.1017/CBO9780511718786.045,Automobile manufacture;Catalysis;Catalytic converters;Chemical compounds;Chemical industry;Chemical reactions;Earth (planet);Environmental management;Feedstocks;Fossil fuels;Fuels;Indicators (chemical);Industrial chemicals;Liquid crystal displays;Manufacture;Petroleum industry;Petroleum transportation;Productivity;Sustainable development;Waste treatment;Agricultural productivity;Chemical intermediates;Chemical transformations;Environmental performance;Environmental sustainability;Reduce energy consumption;Renewable feedstocks;Transportation sector;Energy utilization,NA,NA,green processing catalysis

DESIGN: Early developmental stages of fish, from embryo to larvae, were exposed to terbuthylazine at concentrations of 0.9, 160, 520, and 820 Œºg L-1, and metribuzin at concentrations of 0.9, 4, 14, and 32 mg L-1 for 30 days and compared to the non-treated control group. For assessment of free radical defence the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured; the lipid peroxidation (TBARS) level was determined as a marker of free radical damage. RESULTS: Terbuthylazine had no significant effect (p>0.05) at any tested concentrations on GST activity. Terbuthylazine caused an increase (p<0.05) in GR activity at the concentration of 520 Œºg L-1. We found a non-significant (p>0.05) effect of terbuthylazine exposure on TBARS level. In metribuzin treated groups, the activity of GST was increased (p<0.05) in all experimental groups, with the highest at the concentration of 32 mg L-1. GR activity was increased in the 0.9, 4, and 14 mg L-1 groups and the TBARS levels were the highest in the 0.9 mg L-1 group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that terbuthylazine and metribuzin induced oxidative stress in embryo-larval stages of common carp. Increased activities of biotransformation enzymes or antioxidant defence enzymes were markers of free radical attack.

The authors compared these drugs with regard to their efficacy and tolerability in the initial monotherapy for epilepsy. Methods: A randomised, open-label, controlled, parallel group, multicenter trial was conducted to test the superiority of the LEV arm over the LTG arm. The primary endpoint was the rate of seizure-free patients in the first 6 weeks (two-sided Fisher's exact test, Œ±=0.05, intent-to-treat set). Furthermore, efficacy, tolerability and quality of life were evaluated. The authors included 409 patients aged ‚â•12 years with newly diagnosed focal or generalised epilepsy defined by either two or more unprovoked seizures or one first seizure with high risk for recurrence. Patients were titrated to 2000 mg/day of LEV or 200 mg/day of LTG reached on day 22 or 71, respectively. Two dose adjustments by 500/50 mg were allowed. Results: The proportions of seizure-free patients were 67.5% (LEV) versus 64.0% (LTG) 6 weeks after randomisation (p=0.47), and 45.2% (LEV) versus 47.8% (LTG) during the whole treatment period of 26 weeks. The HR (LEV vs LTG) for seizure-free time was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.22). Adverse events occurred in 74.5% (LEV) versus 70.6% (LTG) of the patients (p=0.38).

Two runs each reactor were carried out at operating conditions VL=4.22L, Q=1-1.5vvm, T=22¬∞C. The culture broth apparent viscosity changed from 2 to 12mPas determining global changes in both hydrodynamics (expressed as the dimensionless Reynolds number, Re) and oxygen transfer conditions (expressed as the kLa coefficient). Such changes were 170<Re<3080; 1.9<kLa (10-2s-1)<3.5 for R1 experiments, and 400<Re<10,060; 1.9<kLa (10-2s-1)<3.5, for R2 experiments. Infective juvenile stage (IJ) concentrations of 250,000/mL were achieved in R2 experiments whereas notably lower ones were obtained in R1 experiments (110,000IJ/mL, approximately). The hydrodynamic conditions in both riser and downcomer sections of R2 experiments involved higher inertial forces than the corresponding ones to R1 runs, implying values of (ReR2/ReR1)riser from 2.3 to 3.3 and (ReR2/ReR1)downcomer from 1.8 to 2.5. These results suggest that higher inertial forces would promote the mating process among the vigorous adult nematodes of the first generation, probably due to encourage female-male encounters in response to a better mixing of the culture broth. Further, the nematode reproduction appeared to be greatly influenced by the reactor geometry. ¬© 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: N.

The extract was tested against four strains of mycobacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium smegmatis) using BACTEC Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 system and the proportional method. Standard procedures were used to determine the zones of inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations (MBCs/MFCs) for Candida albicans, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The extract showed activity against some mycobacteria strains, especially M. tuberculosis. It also showed strong antimicrobial activity (zones of inhibition were between 9.00 and 14.10 mm) against C. albicans, Sa. typhi, and St. aureus. The extract gave a better zone of inhibition against C. albicans than fluconazole whose zone of inhibition was 13.00 mm. The MICs and MBCs for C. albicans and Sa. typhi were good. The crude extracts were also analyzed for the presence of phytochemicals. Phytochemical screening indicated that the extract most abundantly contained tannins, saponins, and flavonoids. The data suggest that the methanolic leaves extract of E. abysinnica could be a rich source of antimicrobial agents, especially antifungals. The results further show that there is some merit in the use of the plant in alternative medical practices.

Compensation for fisheries decline, creation of new jobs and source of financial windfall are the most important benefits. However, similar to most of the human food-production activities, aquaculture raised several issues related to the environmental welfare and consumer safety. An effort to record the aquaculture-environment and -human safety interactions with regard to the Mediterranean mariculture, is attempted herein. We focused on this geographical area due to its individualities in both the hydrological and physicochemical characteristics and the forms of aquaculture activities. The cage farming of euryhaline marine fish species and more recently of bluefin tuna and mollusk farming are the dominating aquaculture activities. The impacts of these activities to the environment, through wastes offloads, introduction of alien species, genetic interactions, disease transfer, release of chemicals, use of wild recourses, alterations of coastal habitats and disturbance of wildlife, are analytically considered. Also the consumer safety issues related to the farming are assessed, including generation of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, contaminants transferred to humans though food chain and other hazards from consumption of aquacultured items. Within these, the major literature findings are critically examined and suggestions for scientific areas that need further development are made. The major tasks for future aquaculture development in this region are: (i) to ensure sustainability and (ii) to balance the risks to public or environmental health with the substantial economical benefits. In regard with monitoring, tools must be created or adapted to predict the environmental costs and estimate consumer impact. At a canonistic and legal basis, the establishment of appropriate legal guidelines and common policies from all countries involved should be mandatory. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 158; Correspondence Address: G.

The aim of this study was to determine factors that influence the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in three rural communities of C√¥te d'Ivoire, two of which benefited from recent interventions. Methods. The study was carried out in 957 households in three villages (Bozi, N'Dakonankro and Yoho) located in central C√¥te d'Ivoire. Indicators of socioeconomic position (SEP), malaria knowledge and practice, placing special emphasis on LLINs, were investigated during a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Principal component analysis was used to calculate the SEP of households by means of a list of household assets ownership. The concentration index was used to assess the direction of the association between SEP and a given variable. To compare groups or means, Fisher's exact test, 2 and Kruskal-Wallis test were used, as appropriate. Results: Significant differences were found between SEP and reported malaria symptoms, such as fever or hot body, convulsion, anaemia and jaundice (yellow eyes). Individuals from the least poor group cited more often the use of bed nets and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) compared to poorer groups. The mean number of individuals reporting the use of bed nets and LLINs was different between groups with different educational level. Moreover, the mean number of LLINs in a household was influenced by the presence of children below five years of age. Conclusion: The study not only confirmed that education and SEP play important roles in the prevention and control of malaria and promotion of health in general, but pointed at the basic essential knowledge and the key behavioural elements that should guide education and learning processes among the poorer segments of the population. In turn, such knowledge may change behaviour and lead to an increased utilization of LLINs. ¬© 2011 Ouattara et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: B.G.

Proteins were identified using LC-MS/MS and identities were examined relative to brain function in the context of changing steroid hormone levels. There was little overlap between sexes in proteins exhibiting differential expression. Proteins with known roles in metabolism, learning, neuroprotection, and calcium regulation were determined to be differentially regulated. Relationships between identified proteins were also examined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and females were shown to exhibit enrichment of several metabolic pathways. We used differentially expressed proteins to establish a putative classifier consisting of three proteins that was able to discriminate prochloraz-exposed from control females.

Methods and results: The antifungal activity of 21 different AMPs and CPPs was investigated by microdilution assay and plate counting to determine the number of colony forming units. Five CPPs and one AMP showed fungicidal activity at submicromolar concentrations. Importantly, no membrane damage on human keratinocytes was detected after peptide treatment. Conclusions: Several CPPs, while being nontoxic to mammalian cells, possess growth inhibitory activity on the very stringent yeast M. sympodialis. Significance and impact of study: Our findings that five CPPs and one AMP that are harmless towards mammalian cells act as antifungal agents against M. sympodialis opens up the possibility to use these in the treatment for AE, SE and dandruff.

Due to its extensive use, it has been widely detected in aquatic ecosystems representing a potential threat to non-target organisms, including fish. Despite the negative impact of this commercial formulation in fish, as described in literature, the scarcity of studies assessing its genotoxicity and underlying mechanisms is evident. Therefore, as a novel approach, this study evaluated the genotoxic potential of Roundup¬Æ to blood cells of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) following short-term (1 and 3 days) exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations (58 and 116 Œºg/l), addressing also the possible association with oxidative stress. Thus, comet and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) assays were adopted, as genotoxic end points, reflecting different types of genetic damage. The pro-oxidant state was assessed through enzymatic (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase) and non-enzymatic (total glutathione content) antioxidants, as well as by lipid peroxidation (LPO) measurements. The Roundup¬Æ potential to induce DNA strand breaks for both concentrations was demonstrated by the comet assay. The induction of chromosome breakage and/or segregational abnormalities was also demonstrated through the ENA assay, though only after 3-day exposure to both tested concentrations. In addition, the two genotoxic indicators were positively correlated. Antioxidant defences were unresponsive to Roundup¬Æ. LPO levels increased only for the high concentration after the first day of exposure, indicating that oxidative stress caused by this agrochemical in blood was not severe. Overall results suggested that both DNA damaging effects induced by Roundup¬Æ are not directly related with an increased pro-oxidant state. Moreover, it was demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations of Roundup¬Æ can pose a health risk for fish populations. ¬© The Author 2010.

Codling moth control is currently achieved using pheromone dispensers (handapplied or puffers) supplemented with reduced-risk insecticides as determined by monitoring. The reduction in the use of organophosphate insecticides has resulted in the decrease of pear psylla, Cacopsylla pyricola, and twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, populations through increased activity of beneficial insects. This has led to reductions in pesticide use specific to these two pests. During the transition period, two secondary pests, pear rust mite, Epitrimerus pyri, and oblique-banded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana, caused significant damage. By developing monitoring techniques and treatment thresholds these two pests are now controlled with appropriately timed insecticides. Pear sawfly, Caliroa cerasi, lygus bug, Lygus hesperus, and Western spotted cucumber beetle, Diabrotica undecimpunctata, are very sporadic secondary pests that occasionally need to be controlled with welltimed insecticides. Katydids, previously not considered a pest on pears, were observed feeding on maturing fruit in North Coast orchards. The Mediterranean katydid, Phaneroptera nana, an exotic species present in California since 1940s, was found to be responsible for the feeding damage. This species overwinters as eggs on vines and the nymphs migrate to the edge of pear orchards as the fruit ripens. Presently the secondary pests of major concern, for which studies are still ongoing, are Western boxelder bug, Boisea rubrolineata and consperse stink bug, Euschistus conspersus. Western boxelder bug is also a pest at the edge of orchards adjacent to the riparian corridor where this insect overwinters. Damage from consperse stink bug can be observed throughout the orchard.

Tests of acute toxicity were conducted using 10 fish for each separate concentration and for the control group. The results were subjected to probit analysis to determine the 96h LC50 values. The 96h LC50 values of MP and CPF to P. reticulata were 8.48ppm/L (5.98-10.89) and 0.176ppm/L (0.313-0.224) respectively. In addition, behavioral changes at each concentration were observed for the individual fish. Fish were exposed for 96h to different sublethal concentrations of MP and CPF (1/4 LC50, 1/8 LC50 and 1/10 LC50) and their oxidative stress-induction potential was estimated in brain, liver and gills of fish. MDA content is induced in all tissues but maximum rise was observed in gills (161% and 153% for MP and CPF respectively). With regard to antioxidant defense system (ADS), GSH level decreased in the brain, liver and gills of tissues of MP treated fishes (22%, 6% and 13% respectively) and showed increase in brain and gills CPF treated (23% and 21% respectively).

In conjunction with refuges of non-Bt host plants, fitness costs can delay the evolution of resistance. Furthermore, fitness costs often vary with ecological conditions, suggesting that agricultural landscapes can be manipulated to magnify fitness costs and thereby prolong the efficacy of Bt crops. In the current study, we tested the effects of four species of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) on the magnitude and dominance of fitness costs of resistance to Bt toxin CrylAc in pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). For more than a decade, field populations of pink bollworm in the United States have remained susceptible to Bt cotton Gossypium hirsutum L. producing CrylAc; however, we used laboratory strains that had a mixture of susceptible and resistant individuals. In laboratory experiments, dominant fitness costs were imposed by the nematode Steinernema riobrave Cabanillas, Poinar, and Raulston but no fitness costs were imposed by Steinernema carpocapsae Weiser, Steinernema sp. (ML18 strain), or Heterorhabditis sonorensis Stock, Rivera-Orduo, and Flores-Lara. In computer simulations, evolution of resistance to CrylAc by pink bollworm was substantially delayed by treating some non-Bt cotton refuge fields with nematodes that imposed a dominant fitness cost, similar to the cost observed in laboratory experiments with S. riobrave. Based on the results here and in related studies, we conclude that entomopathogenic nematodes could bolster insect resistance management, but the success of this approach will depend on selecting the appropriate species of nematode and environment, as fitness costs were magnified by only two of five species evaluated and also depended on environmental factors. ¬© 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: A.

Water withdrawal from their tributaries is one and in many cases main reason for that. Since prehistoric times, the size and shape of the Aral Sea changed depending on the amount of water arriving at the lake. The Aral Sea system is in equilibrium when the amount of water flowing in equals the amount of water evaporating over the year. During the 1950s, the government of the former USSR decided to increase the areas used for agriculture in the river valleys of the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya. To this end, water was and still is deviated from the rivers by thousands of open trenches being unsealed and leading to a massive loss of water by evaporation and seepage. In consequence, less water was and is arriving at the Aral Sea and its size is shrinking dramatically. Especially on its eastern shoreline even a small decrease in the water level leads to the exposition of large areas of former sea bottom because the lake is very shallow. Cities like Aralsk and Munyak formally located directly on the seaside are now completely surrounded by the steppe far away from the water. Although the shrinking of the Aral Sea was an economic disaster for the population living on the coast, the population in the river valleys increased significantly. Today, the major part of Uzbekistan's population is working in this area, and in Kazakhstan there are also millions of people depending on the irrigation water taken from the tributaries of the Aral Sea. The area around the Aral Sea was declared to be a ‚Äòzone of ecological disaster,‚Äô and small subsidies are (still) paid to its inhabitants. Most of the former fishermen moved away to other lakes. In consequence of the brakedown of the economic background the social structure in the population changed completely and people are suffering from unemployment and the lack of any economic perspective. However, studies performed up to now could not prove the assumption that the health of the local population impaired because of environmental pollutants having their origin in the river valleys of the Aral Seas tributaries. There is no doubt that the health of inhabitants of the area is severely affected by the environmental conditions, but not by single contaminants. People living in the Syr Darya valley and, most probably, in the Amu Darya valley suffer much more from pesticide pollution than those living in the former shoreline area of the Aral Sea. Owing to the use of certain pesticides, high concentrations of dioxins and dibenzofurans have been detected in their bodies. Water is a valuable resource and probably the most important economic factor in the countries of Central Asia. The problems of the Aral Sea cannot be solved in the short term. The problems are a result of economic decisions made in the 1950s within a different political context on the basis of a Soviet Union-wide organized economy. Now that small countries are struggling for survival of their local economies, there is, at least in the non-oil producing countries, not enough economic power for a rapid change. However, the area of the Aral Sea will enlarge with an increasing amount of water left over in the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya, even if the Aral Sea probably will not regain its former size during the next generation. ¬© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Two studies showed inverse associations between PCBs and IQ in cohorts of children whose mothers consumed Great Lakes fish contaminated with PCBs and other organochlorines (Jacobson & Jacobson 1996; Stewart et al. 2008). Another study from the general US population, where women were exposed to background levels of PCBs, showed no association between PCBs and IQ (Gray et al. 2005). The current report examines two potential sources of inconsistency across studies: 1) confounding with non-PCB organochlorines [Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and Mirex]; and 2) the presence of negative confounding (i.e., suppressor variables). The former could confound PCBs and lead to spurious associations (Type I errors), while the latter could suppress PCB associations and obscure true associations (Type II errors). These issues were explored through the analysis of associations between placental levels of organochlorines and IQ in children at 9 and 11. years of age in the Oswego study. Neither DDE nor mirex was related to lower IQ at either age; PCBs predicted lower IQ at both ages; and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) appeared as a significant predictor of IQ at the 11-year assessment. However, analysis of the IQ data set as a whole showed that both PCBs and HCB predicted lower IQ in a generally independent fashion. There was, however, overlap in the variance in some cases, and the pattern of findings between the two was remarkably similar. These results may provide some evidence for the potential involvement of non-PCB organochlorines in the Oswego study. To explore negative confounding, we analyzed the relationships between PCB exposure and demographic variables as well as the unadjusted and adjusted relationships between PCB and IQ. Results revealed that placental PCB levels were associated with older mothers who were more educated and came from higher socioeconomic strata. Due to this fact, unadjusted relationships between PCBs and IQ appeared null or slightly positive. After control for confounders, several significant negative associations between PCBs and IQ were revealed. These data might suggest that inadequate control for confounders in PCB studies, where negative confounding is present, may bias results toward the null (Type II error) rather than spurious associations (Type I error). This pattern of confounding with PCB exposure in the Oswego study also has implications for the assessment of risk. The most highly exposed children came from families with somewhat higher socioeconomic status, and tended to score in the average to above-average range, well above IQ scores that are considered ""at risk."" Further, such children were exposed prenatally to PCBs through maternal consumption of PCB-contaminated Great Lakes fish in the early 1990s, when PCB levels were higher than today. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: P.W.

Although human-made, these chemicals are not completely alien to living systems. A large number of natural organohalogens, part of the secondary metabolism, are involved in chemical trophic interactions. Surprisingly, the relationship between organisms' trophic position and synthetic organohalogen biotransformation capability has not been investigated. We studied the case for polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDE), a group of flame-retardants of widespread use in the recent years, in aquatic food webs from remote mountain lakes. These relatively simple ecosystems only receive pollution by atmospheric transport. A large predominance of the PBDE congener currently in use in Europe, BDE-209, largely dominated the PBDE composition of the basal resources of the food web. In contrast, primary consumers (herbivores and detritivores) showed a low proportion of BDE-209, and dominance of several less brominated congeners (e.g. BDE-100, BDE47). Secondary consumers (predators) showed large biomagnification of BDE-209 compare to other congeners. Finally, top predator fish characterized by low total PBDE concentrations. Examination of the bromine stable isotopic composition indicates that primary consumers showed higher PBDE biotransformation capability than secondary consumers. We suggest that the evolutionary response of primary consumers to feeding deterrents would have pre-adapted them for PBDE biotransformation. The observed few exceptions, some insect taxa, can be interpreted in the light of the trophic history of the evolutionary lineage of the organisms. Bromine isotopic composition in fish indicates that low PBDE values are due to not only biotransformation but also to some other process likely related to transport. Our finding illustrates that organohalogen compounds may strongly disturb ecosystems even at low concentrations, since the species lacking or having scarce biotransformation capability may be selectively more exposed to these halogenated hydrophobic semi-volatile organic pollutants due to their high bioaccumulation potential.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  63,10.1371/journal.pone.0041829     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS;RANGE ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT;BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS;HIGH-MOUNTAIN LAKES;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS;DECABROMODIPHENYL ETHER;ORGANOCHLORINE COMPOUNDS;HERBIVORE INTERACTIONS;MARINE WORMS;BIOTRANSFORMATION;Food,NA,NA,pollutant dehalogenation capability may depend on the trophic evolutionary history of the organism pbdes in freshwater food webs

In separate trials with larvae of A. irradians, C. virginica, and M. mercenaria, an aggressive predatory response of three strains of algal- and fish-fed P. shumwayae was observed (exception, algal-fed strain 1024C). Larval mortality resulted primarily from damage inflicted by physical attack of the flagellated cells, and secondarily from Pfiesteria toxin, as demonstrated in larval C virginica exposed to P shumwayae with versus without direct physical contact. Survival of adult shellfish and grazing activity depended upon the species and the cell density, strain, and nutritional history of P. shumwayae. No mortality of the four shellfish species was noted after 24 h of exposure to algal- or fish-fed P. shumwayae (strains 1024C, 1048C, and CCMP2089) in separate trials at <= 5 x 10(3) cells ml(-1), whereas higher densities of fish-fed, but not algal-fed, populations (> 7-8 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)) induced low (<= 15%) but significant mortality. Adults of all four shellfish species sustained > 90% mortality when exposed to fish-fed strain 270A1 (8 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)). In contrast, adult M. mercenaria and P viridis exposed to a similar density of fish-fed strain 2172C sustained < 15% mortality, and there was no mortality of A. irradians and C. virginica exposed to that strain. In mouse bioassays with tissue homogenates (adductor muscle, mantle, and whole animals) of A. irradians and M. mercenaria that had been exposed to R shumwayae (three strains, separate trials), mice experienced several minutes of disorientation followed by recovery. Mice injected with tissue extracts from control animals fed cryptomonads showed no response. Grazing rates of adult shellfish on P. shumwayae (mean cell length +/- 1 standard error [S.E.], 9 +/- 1 mu m) generally were significantly lower when fed fish-fed (toxic) populations than when fed populations that previously had been maintained on algal prey, and grazing rates were highest with the nontoxic cryptomonad, Storeatula major (cell length 7 +/- 1 mu m). Abundant cysts of P. shumwayae were found in fecal strands of all shellfish species tested, and <= 45% of the feces produced viable flagellated cells when placed into favorable culture conditions. These findings were supported by a field study wherein fecal strands collected from field-collected adult shellfish (C virginica, M. mercenaria, and ribbed mussels, Geukensia demissa) were confirmed to contain cysts of P. shumwayae, and these cysts produced fish-killing flagellated populations in standardized fish bioassays. Thus, predatory feeding by flagellated cells of R shumwayae can adversely affect survival of larval bivalve molluscs, and grazing can be depressed when adult shellfish are fed P. shumwayae. The data suggest that R shumwayae could affect recruitment of larval shellfish in estuaries and aquaculture facilities; shellfish can be adversely affected via reduced filtration rates; and adult shellfish may be vectors of toxic P shumwayae when shellfish are transported from one geographic location to another.

Antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9), glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2), superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6)), redox status of glutathione and lipid peroxidation were measured at first in the gills and the digestive glands of mussels after exposure to copper (30 mu g l(-1)) or/and thiram (100 mu g l(-1)) for 3 days. The effects of a complex industrial effluent on the antioxidant system were investigated afterwards in a held study: encaged mussels were placed in a river upstream and downstream from a pollution source consisting of the effluent of a cokery for 1 week. These studies demonstrated that in both experimental exposures, the most sensitive parameters were selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity (SeGPx), reduced glutathione levels (GSH) and especially glutathione reductase activity (GRd) which significantly decreased. Decreases in SeGPX and GRd activities were more pronounced in the gills under coexposure to copper and thiram, with 74% and 78% of reduced activity, respectively (P < 0.01); reduction of GSH levels was 50% in this case. In the field study, the activities could be reduced by 35% and 72% in the gills for SeGPx and GRd, respectively; reduction of GSH levels could reach 45%. In contrast, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities remained generally constant in all the treatment groups compared with controls. Lipid peroxidation, as expressed by malonaldehyde content measured by HPLC, was slightly enhanced in experiment with copper+thiram and this increase (from 1.8 to 2.8 fold) was concomitant with a depletion of antioxidant defences. The responses of antioxidant parameters were overall greater in the gills than in the digestive glands of exposed mussels. These results suggest that among antioxidant defence systems, SeGPx, GSH levels and particularly GRd, could represent biomarkers of interest for the estimation of the effects of environmental contamination on freshwater invertebrates.

Here, Pseudoalteromonas piscicida WCPW15003 as a probiotic effectively antagonized dominant pathogenic V. harveyi in a mariculture, with a growth-of-inhibition ratio of 6.3 h(-1). The antagonistic activities of cells and intracellular components of WCPW15003 made a greater contribution to the antagonistic process than did extracellular metabolites and caused the dominance of WCPW15003 during the antagonistic process in vitro. WCPW15003 was safe for the pearl gentian grouper (female Epinephelus fuscoguttatus x male Epinephelus lanceolatus) and, as a consequence of the antagonistic effect on V. harveyi, protected the fish from an immune response in vivo. A comprehensive combined proteomics and metabolomics analysis of antagonistic WCPW15003 and pathogenic V. harveyi in a coculture compared to a monoculture was performed to investigate the antagonistic molecular mechanisms. The results showed that during the antagonistic process, WCPW15003 in a coculture had significantly downregulated metabolic pathways for histidine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism, and upregulated glycerophospholipid metabolism, leading to a competitive advantage against the cooccurring species, V. harveyi. This defined a mechanism by which multi-costimulatory pathways drove P. piscicida WCPW15003 against V. harveyi.        IMPORTANCE V. harveyi as a dominant pathogen has become a major hazard in mariculture development and seafood safety, and biocontrol of this pathogen using antagonistic probiotic agents is a long-standing biological challenge. P. piscicida WCPW15003 has promise as a novel, safe, and effective bioagent for specifically inhibiting dominant pathogenic V. harveyi and protects mariculture animals from infection by this pathogen by moderating the host immune response, which is heavily driven by multi-costimulatory pathways in a coculture of WCPW15003 and V. harveyi. This work identified a direction for comprehensively elucidating the molecular mechanism of WCPW15003 antagonism against the dominant pathogen in mariculture using modern molecular biology techniques and provided deep insights into the advantages and potential of this antagonistic probiotic against V. harveyi for the construction of an environmentally friendly, recirculating mariculture system.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  45,10.1128/spectrum.02444-22,pathogenic Vibrio harveyi;antagonistic bacteria;immune response;proteomic combined metabolomic analysis;costimulatory pathway;recirculating-mariculture system;PSEUDOMONAS-PUTIDA;IDENTIFICATION;BACTERIA;GROWTH;DISEASE;SHRIMP;LARVAE;FISH;SPP.;Proteomics;Proteome,NA,NA,multicostimulatory pathways drive the antagonistic <i>pseudoalteromonas piscicida<i> against the dominant pathogenic <i>vibrio harveyi<i> in mariculture insights from proteomics and metabolomics

This review deals chiefly with the FAD-dependent, biosynthetic enzymes which readily catalyze the formation of acetohydroxybutyrate from pyruvate and 2-oxobutyrate, as well as of acetolactate from two molecules of pyruvate (the ALS/AHAS group). These enzymes are generally susceptible to inhibition by one or more of the branched-chain amino acids which are ultimate products of the acetohydroxyacids, as well as by several classes of herbicides (sulfonylureas, imidazolinones and others). Some ALS/AHASs also catalyze the (non-physiological) oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, leading to peracetic acid; the possible relationship of this process to oxygen toxicity is considered. The bacterial ALS/AHAS which have been well characterized consist of catalytic subunits (around 60 kDa) and smaller regulatory subunits in an alpha(2)beta(2) structure. In the case of Escherichia coli isozyme III, assembly and dissociation of the holoenzyme has been studied. The quaternary structure of the eukaryotic enzymes is less clear and in plants and yeast only catalytic polypeptides (homologous to those of bacteria) have been clearly identified. The presence of regulatory polypeptides in these organisms cannot be ruled out, however, and genes which encode putative ALS/AHAS regulatory subunits have been identified in some cases. A consensus sequence can be constructed from the 21 sequences which have been shown experimentally to represent ALS/AHAS catalytic polypeptides. Many other sequences fit this consensus, but some genes identified as putative 'acetolactate synthase genes' are almost certainly not ALS/AHAS. The solution of the crystal structures of several thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes which are homologous to ALS/AHAS, together with the availability of many amino acid sequences for the latter enzymes, has made it possible for two laboratories to propose similar, reasonable models for a dimer of catalytic subunits of an ALS/AHAS. A number of characteristics of these enzymes can now be better understood on the basis of such models: the nature of the herbicide binding site, the structural role of FAD and the binding of ThDP-Mg2+. The models are also guides for experimental testing of ideas concerning structure-function relationships in these enzymes, e.g. the nature of the substrate recognition site. Among the important remaining questions is how the enzyme suppresses alternative reactions of the intrinsically reactive hydroxyethyl ThDP enamine formed by the decarboxylation of the first substrate molecule and specifically promotes its condensation with 2-oxobutyrate or pyruvate. 0 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Gharb district and particularly the Sebou river basin are among the most heavily polluted regions in Morocco.        Oued Sebou collecting basin is 40,000 km(2), situated in north-western Morocco. Its water flows from the north-western slopes of the Middle Atlas range to the Atlantic Ocean. Its tributaries collect waters from the Rif range (Oued Ouerrha) and from central Morocco (Oued Beht). It is the main purveyor of water of the Gharb plain, a major agricultural region in Morocco, where fertilizers and pesticides are widely used. Along its banks, various industries (paper mills, sugar plants, tanneries, food industries, wool mills, chemical plants, etc.) have settled and contribute to the development of large towns which are not equipped with facilities for the treatment of either industrial or domestic waters. It is a real example of water pollution in a developing country.        In order to assess the actual water quality of lower Sebou and to monitor both the effect of the release of pollutants and the influence of other factors, a wide pluridisciplinary research program on the biological, ecotoxicological and microbiological situation is in progress. Eleven stations have been selected: one on Oued Ouerrha (S1), one on Oued Beht (S6), one on Oued R'dom (S5) and eight on Oued Sebou, distributed along about 230 km (Fig. 1). The following paper reports on the physico-chemical quality of surface waters of lower Sebou, submitted to domestic, agricultural and industrial pollution and to tidal movements. Samples were analyzed for 17 parameters following AFNOR norms; 5 were determined on site (temperature, oxygen, pH, conductivity and salt content) while the others (DBO, DCO, MES, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, Cl-, SO42-, PO42-, Ca2+, total hardness and alkalinity) were determined in the laboratory.        Temperature does not vary significantly between different stations. Suspended matters levels were mainly dependent on hydrologic sequences of the rivers (low or high waters) and showed a wide range of seasonal changes. Because of decantation, the levels decreased from upstream to downstream, but after Kenitra, they increased again, because of solid wastes from the town and of a strong bottom tidal flow that pulls out deposited solid matter.        Organic pollution is severe. Means of BOD5 vary from 19 to 76 mg/L and of COD from 39 to 180 mg/L. They can reach 135 mg/L for BOD5 and 834 mg/L for COD. The worst situation is found downstream to Sidi Allal Tazi sugar plant. For dissolved oxygen, the lowest levels were found downstream to the town of Sidi Slimane (22%) and to Sidi Allal Tazi sugar plant (38%).        Ammonium was mostly low (0-0.09 mg/L) while at downstream stations (8, 9, 10, 11) there was a small increase, as well as at S6 (downstream to Sidi Slimane town). The presence of ammonium nitrogen is usually considered as figuring an uncompleted degradation of organic matter (Rodier, 1984). Nitrites followed the variations of ammonium. Nitrates showed a wide range of variations, possibly because of strong turbulence enhancing locally the oxygenation.        In order to determine which were the main parameters that drove the ecosystem dynamics, a main components analysis was performed on the matrix given by the results of 8 campaigns at 11 sampling stations. The results are given in Table 1 and Fig. 5. It appears that tidal movements, and thus salt levels, are main factors upstream to Kenitra and downstream to Sidi Allal Tazi. The tidal phenomenon has been specifically studied (Fig. 5D and E). The confrontation of fresh and sea water in the Sebou mouth gives birth to a physical stopper which prevents polluted water from reaching the ocean and thus slows the improvement of water quality.        Oued Sebou gives a good example under Mediterranean weather conditions of a severe pollution due to hydrochemical conditions strongly influenced by municipal and industrial wastes. Most of the physico-chemical parameters are higher than the values given by Nisbet and Verneaux (1970). Moreover, downstream, tidal influence contributes to further damage water quality. Efforts should be made to reduce toxic substances release in the Gharb plain.

Thus, monitoring chemical concentrations in biota are widely and increasingly used for assessing the chemical status of aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, various scientific and regulatory aspects of bioaccumulation in aquatic systems and the relevant critical issues are discussed. Monitoring chemical concentrations in biota can be used for compliance checking with regulatory directives, for identification of chemical sources or event-related environmental risk assessment. Assessing bioaccumulation in the field is challenging since many factors have to be considered that can affect the accumulation of a chemical in an organism. Passive sampling can complement biota monitoring since samplers with standardised partition properties can be used over a wide temporal and geographical range. Bioaccumulation is also assessed for regulation of chemicals of environmental concern whereby mainly data from laboratory studies on fish bioaccumulation are used. Field data can, however, provide additional important information for regulators. Strategies for bioaccumulation assessment still need to be harmonised for different regulations and groups of chemicals. To create awareness for critical issues and to mutually benefit from technical expertise and scientific findings, communication between risk assessment and monitoring communities needs to be improved. Scientists can support the establishment of new monitoring programs for bioaccumulation, e.g. in the frame of the amended European Environmental Quality Standard Directive.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  48     Total Times Cited:  52     Cited Reference Count:  55,10.1186/s12302-014-0036-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS;TROPHIC MAGNIFICATION FACTORS;PASSIVE SAMPLING DEVICES;DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA;PRIORITY SUBSTANCES;PESTICIDES;BIPHENYLS;MERCURY;METALS;TRENDS,NA,NA,bioaccumulation in aquatic systems methodological approaches monitoring and assessment

rayyan-1227193568,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance tri-allate Issued on 26 September 2008,2009,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Tri-allate is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tri-allate in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 August 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Gowan Comercio Internacional e Servicos. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July - August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide in barley and wheat for the control of wild oat, black-grass and meadow-grass as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached endpoints.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Avadex 15G' ('Mon 7966'), a granule (GR) containing 150 g/kg tri-allate.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor residues given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant origin and in environmental matrices, however a data gap was set for a monitoring method for residues in food of animal origin.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, tri-allate was rapidly but incompletely absorbed after oral administration. It was evenly distributed and extensively metabolised, showing no potential for accumulation. According to the precautionary principle, classification of tri-allate as Xn, R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" was proposed, however acute dermal and inhalation toxicity were low. Tri-allate was not a skin or eye irritant; classification with risk phrase R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" was proposed according to the results of a Magnusson & Kligman test.        Decreased body weight and clinical signs of neurotoxicity were the most common effects found in rats, dogs and hamsters upon short-term administration. Reversible anaemia and liver toxicity were also found in these species, while the liver was the main target organ in mice. Upon long-term exposure, reduced body weight and liver toxicity were still evident, but no potential for carcinogenicity was observed in rat, mouse or hamster.        Although some in vitro tests (mainly Ames tests and a Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay) gave positive results, based on the weight of evidence, tri- allate was considered to have no genotoxic potential in vivo.        Reproduction toxicity studies reflected the same kind of effects in parents, as in short-term studies. In the two generation study, reduced pregnancy rate was associated with parental toxicity and in the developmental study in rat; decreased foetal weight and retarded ossification were linked to maternal toxicity. In rabbit an apparent increase in the incidence of fused sternebrae was observed without maternal toxicity, this finding gave rise to an intense debate by the experts, but considering the low severity of the effect, the meeting agreed not to propose a classification related to developmental toxicity for tri-allate.        No sign indicative of delayed neurotoxicity was found in acute and short-term neurotoxicity studies in hen. Clear signs of neurobehavioural toxicity were seen in an acute and a short-term neurotoxicity studies in rat. No inhibition of cholinesterase activity was detected, but a special investigation showed a strong correlation between the presence of axonal degeneration in the brain and CNS-like behavioural effects caused by tri- allate leading to a proposal for classification with Xn, R48/22 ""Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"".        A data package of studies was provided on the metabolite TCPSA(2), a major metabolite in plant and the environment, leading to the conclusion that TCPSA is not relevant for groundwater and that the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of tri-allate covers the toxicity of the metabolite.        The ADI of tri-allate was 0.025 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year rat study and applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.032 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day neurotoxicity study in rat, a safety factor of 100 and a correction factor for low oral absorption of 50 %; and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.6 mg/kg bw based on the acute neurotoxicity study in rat and applying a safety factor of 100. Dermal absorption was 12 % for the concentrate and in-use spray dilution, based on an in vivo study in monkeys. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation 'Avadex 15G', at a maximum dose rate of 2.25 kg tri-allate/ha was below the AOEL according to selected data from the Pesticide Handler's Exposure Database (PHED), considering the use of gloves during loading and application of the granules. Worker exposure was not considered relevant for the representative use of tri-allate. Estimated bystander and residential exposure resulting from the use of 'Avadex 15G' was below the AOEL.        Metabolism studies of tri-allate labelled in the allyl position were considered in the DAR which showed that residues consisted primarily of metabolites TCPSA, M14(3) and M15(4). A provisional residue definition for risk assessment of tri-allate, TCPSA and the glycoside conjugates (M14 and M15) expressed as tri-allate was proposed by the residues expert meeting. The residue definition proposed in the DAR did not include the glycoside conjugates. In addition, the expert meeting concluded the metabolism could not be finalised because there is a data gap for a wheat study of tri-allate labelled in the diisopropylamine moiety. The meeting identified this data gap to address a concern about the potential formation of nitrosamines from the diisopropylamine moiety in plants. It should be noted that in wheat grain, total metabolites were 0.008 mg/kg (5.10 % of TRR).        In radio-labelled rotational crop studies the residue was made up of tri-allate and TCPSA but it was questioned why M14 and M15 were not looked for. In addition, it was considered that, on the basis of the residue levels in radish roots (at 30 days after application) in these studies, a data gap should be identified for field studies. The primary crop residue trials data in wheat and barley presented analysis for tri-allate and TCPSA. No accurate conversion factor is available to enable levels of glycoside conjugates to be accounted for.        Residues were seen to be stable in frozen storage for up to 56 months. The need for processing studies is not currently triggered. Intakes by livestock triggered the need for animal metabolism data for ruminants. A goat metabolism study showed the majority of radioactivity was incorporated into natural compounds. The only possible compounds of significance were tri-allate and TCPSA, and the feeding studies confirmed this.        The risk assessment could not be finalised because of the inclusion of 'glycoside conjugates' in the residue definition. Additionally, the theoretical concern over the formation of nitrosamines has resulted in a data gap for a wheat metabolism study. On this basis no maximum residue levels (MRL) were proposed by the expert meeting.        The risk assessment can not be finalised because of the rotational crop issue amongst others.        Only studies with tri-allate labelled in the allylic position are available in the fate and behaviour section. The need for addressing the metabolites that may result from the diisopropylamine moiety was identified during the peer review and discussed in the PRAPeR meeting. The applicant provided a position paper to clarify this issue. This position paper made use of public scientific literature to select the input parameters for modelling and as part of the consideration for estimating the formation of nitrosamines potentially produced by water treatment. These scientific papers had not been previously submitted in the dossier. In view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to the EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. However the meeting considered that the issue needs to be addressed and therefore identified a data gap to address the potential formation of diisopropylamine(5) in soil and contamination of ground water.        Tri-allate exhibited moderate to medium persistence in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DissT(50) = 35 - 61 d); however these rates may only be considered as dissipation rates since volatilization contributed to a great extent to the losses observed. Data were reanalyzed by the applicant with ModelMaker (V.4.0.) to separate the degradation and volatilization processes. The calculated degradation rates were in the range of DT50 = 38.4 - 75.2 d.        Of the six or seven minor metabolites identified, only TCPSA (max. 3.74 % AR by HPLC and max. 7.38 % AR by TLC) was fully characterized and further addressed for environmental risk assessment. TCPSA exhibited low to moderate persistence under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C in soil.        Volatiles collected in the organic traps (max. 16.17 % AR after 120 d) of the aerobic degradation experiments were not characterized but were assumed to be tri-allate. Unextractable radioactivity amounted to max. 25.3 % AR at the end of the study (120 days after treatment). Radioactivity found in the ethanolamine trap (max. 21.2 % AR after 120 d) was assumed to be CO2. The need for further identification of potentially volatile tri-allate soil metabolites and the characterization of soil metabolites found in the available study had been identified during the peer review. The majority of experts agreed with the rapporteur Member State that it is reasonable to assume that the non-characterised radioactivity in the volatile traps is the active substance. The EU risk assessment of the representative use proposed could therefore be acceptably concluded without further regard to the characterisation of the volatiles. However some experts considered that it is necessary to confirm the complete route of degradation for national risk assessments and therefore a data gap was identified for a study to investigate the aerobic degradation in soil including identification of residues in volatile organic traps and adequate identification of soil metabolites.        Tri-allate was very highly persistent in soil under anaerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. Photolysis in soil of tri-allate is almost negligible when compared with aerobic degradation. A field dissipation study with trials at four different United Kingdom sites is available. Tri-allate exhibited low to high persistence in these trials. The rapporteur Member State assessed the studies as scientifically valid and representative of Northern European conditions. However they proposed using data obtained from laboratory degradation studies for environmental modelling for EU risk assessment due to the potential effect of volatilization on the results of these trials. The DT90's observed in some of the field dissipation studies were above 1 yr and triggered the need to assess potential of accumulation of tri-allate in soil. PEC in soil and accumulation of tri-allate in soil were estimated on the basis of the worst case field half-life of 205 d. For TCPSA the PEC in soil was estimated on basis of the maximum observed in the laboratory studies determined by TLC. Tri-allate may be considered immobile to slightly mobile in soil according the available study. Metabolite TCPSA may be considered very highly mobile in soil according to the available study.        Tri-allate was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4 and 7 at 50 degrees C, however it hydrolyses under alkaline conditions. The half-life at 25 degrees C in the aqueous pH 9 solution was 52 d. Aqueous photolysis is not expected to contribute to the environmental degradation of tri-allate on basis of the lack of UV absorption at wavelengths above 290 nm. Biodegradability studies available show that tri-allate is not readily biodegradable.        In the water sediment systems, tri-allate dissipated relatively rapidly from water by partition to the sediment and volatilization. Half-lives of tri-allate in the whole system are 52.8 - 62.0 d. No major metabolites were identified either in the water or in the sediment phases. Mineralization and unextractable residues in the sediment are practically negligible (CO2 = 1.51 - 4.35 % AR; unextractable in sediment = 2.77 - 3.26 % AR).        PECSW/SED were calculated for tri-allate and its soil metabolite TCPSA on the basis of the FOCUS SW scheme and models for the scenarios relevant to cereals in Northern EU (D1-D5, R1). Since the product is a granular formulation, the applicant proposed spray drift values for the granules based on a specific study. The approach was considered acceptable by the rapporteur Member State and reported as Step 3 calculations. Additional FOCUS Step 4 calculations included spray drift mitigation by buffer zones and run off mitigation by vegetative buffer strips. The method used to implement runoff mitigation is not agreed in the latest FOCUS Landscape and mitigation guidance document and therefore the rapporteur Member State recalculated the Step 4 FOCUS SW without run off mitigation.        Potential ground water contamination by tri-allate and its soil metabolite TCPSA was addressed by modelling calculations with FOCUS PELMO 3.3.2. The rapporteur Member State calculations resulted in 80th percentile annual average concentrations in the leachate at 1 m depth below 0.001 mu g/L for tri-allate and in the range of 0.76 - 15.42 mu g/L for metabolite TCPSA. The metabolite TCPSA has a clear potential to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L in ground water and requires assessment of its toxicological and ecotoxicological relevance including consumers risk assessment. Relevance of TCPSA was assessed during the peer review following the step-wise procedure set out in the guidance document for relevance of metabolites in ground water (see sections 2.8, 3.3 and 5.2). Tri-allate is a volatile organic compound and studies available indicate that tri-allate displays significant volatilisation from soil surfaces. However on the basis of the atmospheric half-life calculated (DT50 = 3.8 h), it is considered unlikely that tri-allate may be subjected to long-range transport.        The first tier risk assessment for direct consumption of granules results in values above the trigger values, indicating low acute, short-term and long-term risk for small seed-eating birds and mammals. The risk to grazing birds and mammals from consumption of residues of tri-allate in the young cereal shoots was estimated using the residues data presented in the DAR. The acute, short-term and long-term TER estimated for birds and the acute and long-term TER values estimated for mammals were above the Annex VI trigger values, indicating a low risk for birds and mammals.        Potential for bioaccumulation was considered since tri-allate has a log P-ow of 4.06. The first tier TER values estimated for earthworm-eating birds was above the Annex VI trigger value, however the TER value for earthworm-eating mammals was below the Annex VI trigger value. After a refinement process the risk to earthworm-eating mammals was considered as low. The first tier TER values for fish-eating birds and mammals were 7 and 1.9, respectively, indicating a low risk for fish-eating birds. A potential high risk for fish-eating mammals was identified. A data gap was identified by the EFSA after the PRAPeR 48 meeting to ask to the applicant to submit a new refinement of the potential high risk for fish-eating mammals.        Based on the available studies, tri-allate was considered very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute and chronic TER values based on the used of PECSW from FOCUS step 4 with a 10 m non spray buffer zone were above the Annex VI trigger values. Risk mitigation measures similar to 10 m non spray buffer zone are needed in Member States. The risk of the TCPSA metabolite for aquatic organisms is low.        Since tri-allate has a log P-ow of 4.06 the potential for bioconcentration should be considered. The BCF = 1400 was derived from a study with Lepomis macrochirus. The EFSA noted after the meeting that tri-allate has a BCF > 1000 and a field soil DT90 > 100 days. For these reasons the EFSA identified a data gap to assess the potential for biomagnification of tri-allate through aquatic food chains.        A low acute risk was identified for earthworms. The long-term risk to earthworms needs further refinement. It is proposed by the rapporteur Member State in the DAR that further information is required on the long-term risk to earthworms. Further information is required to fully address the potential risk of tri-allate to other non-target macro-organisms. A data gap was proposed for the submission of a litter bag study.        Risk mitigation such as an in-field no spray buffer zone of 10 m was considered necessary for the non-target plants.        The risk was considered to be low to bees, non-target arthropods, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment.

The crude extract was tested against various bacterial and fungal pathogens, and its protein content and profile were analyzed. Purification steps, including gel filtration chromatography, were employed to isolate the most active fraction (peak IV), which was further identified via liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. The results revealed varying degrees of antimicrobial activity of the crude extract against different bacterial and fungal strains, with Leclercia adecarboxylata, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis showing the highest susceptibility. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated the existence of multiple low molecular weight protein bands in the crude extract, while fraction IV obtained from gel filtration chromatography exhibited the strongest antimicrobial activity. Peak IV displayed a range of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values against the tested pathogens, spanning from 0.038 to 4.960 mg/mL. Further investigation identified the purified peptide derived from peak IV as G-type lysozyme 2, characterized by a molecular weight of 21 kDa. These findings shed light on the existence of a highly effective antimicrobial peptide, G-type lysozyme 2, within the mucus of Cyprinus carpio.

Sequences of MCSF have been identified in multiple teleost species, however, the functional investigations of MCSF were documented in only a few species. In this study, we examined the biological activity and the immunomodulatory property of a MCSF homologue, PoMCSF, from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Structural analysis showed that PoMCSF possesses conserved structural characteristics of MCSF proteins, including a signal peptide, a CSF-1 domain, and a transmembrane region closed to the C-terminal. Under normal physiological condition, PoMCSF expression distributes in all the examined tissues, the highest three tissues are blood, muscle, and head kidney. When infected by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and viral pathogen, the PoMCSF expression patterns vary with different types of microbial pathogens infection and different immune tissues. In vitro experiment showed recombinant PoMCSF promoted the activity of macrophage. In vivo experiment indicated that PoMCSF overexpression boosted the defensive ability of flounder against Edwardsiella piscicida, a severe fish pathogen that infects multiple species of economically important fish, and regulated the expression of multiple immune-related genes. To explore the relationship between PoMCSF and its receptor PoMCSFR, anti-PoMCSFR antibody was prepared and PoMCSFR knockdown was conducted. The neutralization assay showed that when PoMCSFR was neutralized by its antibody, the role of PoMCSF on host defense against E. piscicida was weakened. Knockdown of PoMCSFR impaired the phagocytic capacity of macrophages.

It induces neurotoxicity by inhibiting acetyl cholinesterase enzyme and elevating oxidative stress. Curcumin, dietary polyphenol, well known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which could elicit protective effect against monocrotophos induced neurobehavioural abnormalities. Therefore this study is aimed to investigate ameliorative effect of curcumin loaded Nanoparticles on monocrotophos induced neurotoxicity.        Curcumin loaded PLGA nanoformulation was prepared using nanoprecipitation technique and was characterized using zeta sizer, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. For in-vivo study, 30 male rats were utilized. Exposure of monocrotophos was done at 2 mg/kg (p.o.) for 28 days. Curcumin bulk and cucurmin loaded Nanoparticles were administered with or without monocrotophos. Effect of monocrotophos exposure on behavioural changes was assessed by analysing spontaneous locomotor activity, motor coordination in rotarod WA and contextual fear memory in passive shock avoidance paradigm. Effect on biochemical alteration in blood and brain were estimated.        The average particle size of Curcumin loaded Nanoparticles was 114.9 nm and in-vitro release study suggested suitable release of Curcumin in simulated intestinal fluid. Results of in-vivo study indicated, monocrotophos exposure caused a significant increase in reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and intracellular free calcium levels along with altered behavioural abnormalities in locomotor activity, motor coordination, learning and memory. Decline in antioxidant defence level might suggest reduced host defence response. Treatment with curcumin alone did not significantly reversed monocrotophos induced neurotoxicity in rats. Whilst, treatment with curcumin loaded nanoparticles significantly reduced monocrotophos induced behavioural and biochemical alteration in rat brain.        The outcome of the present study suggested improved efficacy of curcumin loaded nanoparticles, possibly via its enhanced bioavailability.

These sources of contamination are numerous and include herbicides, which represent a large group of toxic chemicals. Quinclorac, an herbicide widely applied in agriculture, induces oxidative stress due to free radical generation and changes in the antioxidant defense system. The aim of this study was to assess if dietary diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)(2) has a protective effect in tissues of fish species Cyprinus carpio exposed to the quinclorac herbicide. The fish were fed with either a standard or a diet containing 3.0 mg/Kg of diphenyl diselenide for 60 d. After were exposed to 1 mg/L of Facet (quinclorac commercial formulation) for 192 h. At the end of the experimental period, parameters as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels (TBARS), protein carbonyl, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), nonprotein thiols (NPSH) and ascorbic acid in the liver, gills, brain and muscle were evaluated in Cyprinus carpio. In fish exposed to quinclorac and feeding with standard diet TBARS levels increased in liver and gills. However, SOD activity decreases in liver whereas no alterations were observed in catalase activity in this tissue. Quinclorac also decrease GST activity in liver and brain, NPSH in brain and muscle and ascorbic acid in muscle. Concerning protein carbonyl exposed to herbicide the fish did not show any alterations. The diphenyl diselenide supplemented diet reversed these effects, preventing increases in TBARS levels in liver and gills. CST activity was recovered to control values in liver. NPSH levels in brain and muscle increased remain near to control values. These results indicated that dietary diphenyl diselenide protects tissues against quinclorac induced oxidative stress ameliorating the antioxidant properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

DESIGN: Early developmental stages of fish, from embryo to larvae, were exposed to terbuthylazine at concentrations of 0.9, 160, 520, and 820 mu g L-1, and metribuzin at concentrations of 0.9, 4, 14, and 32 mg L-1 for 30 days and compared to the non-treated control group. For assessment of free radical defence the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured; the lipid peroxidation (TBARS) level was determined as a marker of free radical damage.        RESULTS: Terbuthylazine had no significant effect (p>0.05) at any tested concentrations on GST activity. Terbuthylazine caused an increase (p<0.05) in GR activity at the concentration of 520 mu g L-1. We found a non-significant (p>0.05) effect of terbuthylazine exposure on TBARS level.        In metribuzin treated groups, the activity of GST was increased (p<0.05) in all experimental groups, with the highest at the concentration of 32 mg L-1. GR activity was increased in the 0.9, 4, and 14 mg L-1 groups and the TBARS levels were the highest in the 0.9 mg L-1 group.        CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that terbuthylazine and metribuzin induced oxidative stress in embryo-larval stages of common carp. Increased activities of biotransformation enzymes or antioxidant defence enzymes were markers of free radical attack.

In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by Ireland, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of fluquinconazole in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC.        Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of fluquinconazole in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant BASF Aktiengesellschaft made a resubmission application for the inclusion of fluquinconazole in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR and during the PRAPeR expert meetings.        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Ireland being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 13 April 2010.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 26 April 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 9 June 2010.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on fluquinconazole.        The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use of fluquinconazole as a fungicide on wheat, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative use can be found in Appendix A to this report.        A data gap was identified in the section analytical methods.        A conclusion on whether the batches used in the key toxicological studies cover the technical specification cannot be drawn from the available information, leading to a critical area of concern and a data gap. Further data gaps were identified on the relevance of the impurities present in the technical specification and for toxicological information on the triazole derivative plant metabolites (1,2,4-triazole, triazolyl alanine and triazolyl acetic acid).        The consumer exposure assessment was not finalised. Data gaps are identified in the residue section to provide fluquinconazole supervised residue trials on wheat for southern Europe to complete the residue database and to address the contribution of the potential residues of metabolite dione in rotational crops and also the contribution of the Triazole Derivate Metabolites (TDMs) present in primary crops, processed products, rotational crops and ruminant matrices to the overall consumer exposure.        The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative use assessed. The potential for groundwater contamination above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L from this use was assessed as low for fluquinconazole and its breakdown product 1,2,4-triazole. For the relevant breakdown product dione, contamination of groundwater might be expected in vulnerable situations as represented by the Hamburg, Kremsmanster, Okehampton and Piacenza FOCUS scenarios (FOCUS annual average recharge concentrations leaving the top 1m soil layer were estimated to be 0.283 to 0.615 mu g/L). Concentrations of this breakdown product were < 0.1 mu g/L at the remaining 5 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Fluquinconazole that enters the atmosphere by the formation of aerosols at the time of spraying may be subject to long range atmospheric transport to remote areas, as it has an atmospheric half-life estimated at longer than 2 days.        The acute risk to insectivorous mammals (i. e. wood mouse) needs to be further addressed. A high long-term risk to insectivorous and herbivorous birds and mammals was indicated for the representative use, therefore a data gap and a critical area of concern was identified. A low risk to aquatic organisms was assessed. The potential for endocrine disruptive effects on fish were considered calculating the TER based on the ELS endpoint with an assessment factor of 50. However, a data gap was identified to submit the finalised FFLC study. The risk was considered low for bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil-macro and micro-organisms, non-target plants and methods for sewage treatment plants.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  15,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2096     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Fluquinconazole;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;fungicide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fluquinconazole
rayyan-1227193589,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bromuconazole European Food Safety Authority,2010,8,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,8,8,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"European Food Safety Author, Parma, Italy","Bromuconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bromuconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 14 November 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 5 May 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience (later Sumitomo Chemical Agro Europe SAS). Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed during a written procedure in February - March 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in July and October 2007.        A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 26 March 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 136).        Following the Commission Decision of 3 November 2008 (2008/832/EC)4 concerning the non-inclusion of bromuconazole in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Sumitomo Chemical Agro Europe S.A. made a resubmission application for the inclusion of bromuconazole in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(5). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report (SANCO/120/08) as follows:        the potential for contamination of surface water and groundwater;        the high toxicity to aquatic organisms.        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Belgium, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on bromuconazole in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 8 October 2009.        In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 20 October 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 7 December 2009.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the area of ecotoxicology and to deliver its conclusions on bromuconazole.        The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a fungicide on wheat. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the same representative use. Full details of the representative use can be found in Appendix A to this report.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, Granit 200 SC."", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC).        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of bromuconazole. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        In mammals, bromuconazole oral LD50 is 328 mg/kg bw (classification as, harmful if swallowed. (Xn; R22), proposed). The acute toxicity by the dermal and inhalation routes is low (LD50>2000 mg/kg bw and LC50 > 5 mg/L). Bromuconazole is neither a skin nor an eye irritant. It is not a skin sensitiser. In repeated dose toxicity studies, the liver is the target organ. In subchronic tests, the dog is the most sensitive species, with an overall relevant NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kg bw/day, whereas in rat the NOAEL is 13.8 mg/kg bw/day. In genotoxicity testing there was some indication of weak clastogenicity in vitro, however there was no indication of positive results in vivo, neither in the micronucleus assay nor in the UDS assay. Overall, bromuconazole was considered devoid of genotoxic potential.        The relevant NOAEL for long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity in rat is 0.88 mg/kg bw/day: treatment-related neoplastic lesions in rodents occurred at high doses: hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinomas in rats and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. In both rats and mice, the tumours were likely caused by liver toxicity and subsequent cell renewal. Overall, it was agreed that bromuconazole does not have carcinogenic potential relevant to humans. Bromuconazole did not show any reproductive toxicity potential: parental and foetal toxicity NOAELs were established at 1.3 mg/kg bw/day, while the reproductive NOAEL was established at 141 mg/kg bw/day. As for developmental toxicity, in the rat the relevant maternal NOAEL is 70 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the developmental NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day, based on a dose-dependent increase of placental weight and ossification delays or supernumerary bones in a number of skeletal structures. It was agreed to propose classification Cat 3, Xn; R63,, May cause harm to unborn child.. The ADI of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day was set based on the relevant long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity NOAEL of 0.88 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study, applying a safety factor (SF) of 100. For the ARfD, the value is based on the developmental NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day from the rat study, with a SF of 100, leading to an ARfD of 0.1 mg/kg bw. The AOEL of 0.025 mg/kg bw/day was set on basis of the NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day dog study (applying a standard SF of 100). The operator exposure assessment showed exposure levels below the AOEL (15.6%) according to the German model with the use of gloves during mixing/loading and application, and coveralls and sturdy footwear during application. The estimated exposure for re-entry activities (scouting) is 4.5% of the AOEL. The bystander exposure is estimated to be 1.6% of the AOEL.        The metabolism of bromuconazole was investigated in wheat. Additional metabolism data were submitted for the category of fruit crops. A metabolic pathway could be established in cereals. At harvest, bromuconazole was still a major part of the terminal residue in cereal matrices, and identified metabolites were individually below 10% of the total residue. However, there was an indication of preferential metabolism of one bromuconazole diastereomer (LS 850647), as a significant shift in the ratio of diastereomers was found in the residues determined in the mature cereal crop when compared to the ratio in the initially applied bromuconazole. Whether the ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer was subject to any shift was not investigated. In rotational crops studies there was uptake of residues from soil into succeeding cereal, oilseed, root and leafy crops. Upon analysis of the residues the two bromuconazole diastereomers were identified as major residue, and similar to the primary cereal metabolism their ratio had been shifted compared to the one in the bromuconazole applied to the soil. No information is available on the ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer.        The submitted livestock metabolism data in ruminants and poultry allows to establish a metabolic pathway, and suggests that no residues in food of animal origin above the limit of quantification are expected when cereals treated according to the cGAP are used in livestock diet. The data imply that there might be preferential metabolism of one diastereomer also in livestock animals. The ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer was not investigated. As plant and livestock residue data indicate that from the representative use no significant consumer exposure to bromuconazole residues is expected, the observed shift of the isomer ratio in the terminal residue is currently not a concern with regard to consumer safety. This may have to be reconsidered when authorisation of uses is sought that lead to consumer exposure to bromuconazole residues above the limit of quantification. The meeting of experts noted that all studies were performed using phenyl-labelled bromuconazole only, and thus the fate of the triazole moiety of the molecule was not investigated. The experts agreed that, based on the available data and information, cleavage of the molecule cannot be excluded and further investigation of the triazole moiety of the molecule is required to address consumer exposure to potential metabolites originating from molecule breakdown, as e.g. triazole derivative metabolites. Until then, the plant and animal residue definition is provisional. Triazole derivative metabolites are considered of concern due to their toxicological profile. In the absence of data investigating the fate of the triazole moiety of the bromuconzole molecule and the magnitude of potentially occurring metabolites originating from the triazole moiety, the consumer exposure cannot be assessed and consequently the consumer risk assessment is not finalised. As a breakdown of the bromuconazole molecule leading to the occurrence of metabolites relevant to consumer safety cannot be excluded, the issue is regarded as a critical area of concern.        In soil under aerobic conditions bromuconazole exhibits moderate to very high persistence forming several minor (< 10% AR) metabolites. Mineralisation was limited accounting for only 1-4.4% AR after 100-120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 5-17.6 % AR after 100-120 days. A laboratory soil photolysis study indicated that photolysis may contribute to the degradation of bromuconazole at the soil surface. As a consequence, the experts agreed that the available field dissipation rates did not represent biodegradation that can be used as input to FOCUS modelling. However, following the resubmission application, field degradation rates normalised to FOCUS reference conditions that excluded photolysis losses were estimated. These estimates are considered appropriate for use as input to FOCUS modelling. Bromuconazole exhibits medium to low mobility in soil. Bromuconazole is essentially stable to hydrolysis, and photolysis is not expected to be a significant process in the breakdown of bromuconazole in natural aquatic systems. In dark natural sediment water systems bromuconazole partitioned from the water column to sediment where it exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 0.9 % AR at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a sink but represented maximum 15% AR at study end. Satisfactory FOCUS surface water exposure estimates were available for use in the EU level aquatic risk assessment, with spray drift and run-off mitigation being accounted for in step 4 calculations. The potential for groundwater contamination resulting from the representative use assessed, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic conditions represented by all 9 pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        Bromuconazole belongs to the group of triazole fungicides that are suspected to have potential endocrine disrupting properties. No information was provided to address this point with regard to the potential effects on birds and fish, and a data gap was identified. No new information on this point was provided in the Additional Report and the data gap remains.        The TER values for herbivorous birds were all above the Annex VI triggers, indicating a low risk for herbivorous birds. Also for insectivorous birds the TER values for acute and short-term exposure were well above the trigger, however the long-term TER was below the trigger of 5, indicating a potential high long-term risk. In the Additional Report higher tier studies (mainly from open literature) were presented to select the focal species and to determine the proportion of different food types (PD) of the focal species. Two different approaches were used to refine the risk assessment. The first approach included the selection of representative focal species, and estimations of PD for these species. The second approach was to include the decline of residues in insects (f(twa) = 0.53) in the first-tier long-term risk assessment. The TERlt values based on the PD refinements, and those based on the use of ftwa of decline of residues in insects, were all above the Annex VI trigger values. Therefore the long-term risk to insectivorous birds was assessed as low. The risk to earthworm- and fish-eating birds was assessed as low.        The acute TERs for herbivorous and insectivorous mammals were above the Annex VI trigger of 10 (including refinement of residues in plant material), however the long-term TERs were below the Annex VI trigger, indicating a high risk. The choice of the long-term end point was discussed again in the experts. meeting (PRAPeR 75), and it was agreed that the NOAEL for mammals of 13.8 mg as/kg bw/d is the relevant ecotoxicological end point. TER calculations for insectivorous mammals based on this NOAEL are provided in the DAR and in the Additional Report and were above the Annex VI trigger value, indicating a low long-term risk for insectivorous mammals. In the resubmission, a higher tier risk assessment for herbivorous mammals was based on the rabbit as focal species in late cereal growth stages. The higher tier risk assessment for herbivorous mammals was discussed in the experts. meeting (PRAPeR 75), and it was concluded that the available information is not sufficient to address the potential high long-term risk for herbivorous mammals. The risk to earthworm- and fish-eating mammals was assessed as low.        Bromuconazole is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The applicant provided a bridging study with the new formulation SCAE0307 and Daphnia magna. The formulation SCAE0307 is less toxic than the previously assessed formulation EXP 10064-B, and has a toxicity comparable to that of the active substance. Member States experts at PRAPeR 75 agreed that the end points for the active substance should be used in the risk assessment. A low long-term risk was identified from the FOCUS step3 PECsw values in the D3 ditch, D4 pond, D4 stream, D5 pond, D5 stream, D6 pond, R1 pond and R1 stream scenarios. However, a potential high long-term risk was indicated for aquatic invertebrates from the FOCUS step3 PECsw values for the D1 ditch, D1 stream, D2 ditch, D2 stream, R3 stream and R4 stream scenarios, and further refinement was needed. The TERs were re-calculated with a 10m no-spray buffer zone for the drainage scenarios and a 10m no-spray buffer zone including a vegetated filter strip to mitigate the run-off. The long-term TER values were above 10 in 2 full FOCUS run-off scenarios (R3 stream and R4 stream). However, the TER values estimated with the drainage scenarios D1 ditch, D1 stream, D2 ditch, D2 stream were below the Annex VI trigger values even with a 10m no-spray buffer zone. Overall, taking into account the FOCUS step 3 and 4 scenarios, it can be concluded that the risk of bromuconazole to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for more than the half of the scenarios.        The risk assessment for non-target arthropods was not in accordance with the ESCORT II scheme. The standard glass plate tests suggest that there will be some adverse effects on sensitive non-target arthropods. Extended laboratory studies gave an indication that the risk to non-target arthropods is low. Concerns were raised with regard to the comparability of the different formulations used in the studies with non-target arthropods. EFSA agrees to the assessment of the RMS that the formulations are sufficiently similar to conclude on the risk to non-target arthropods for the representative use. The applicant informed that a different formulation than Granit will be marketed. It is suggested that a risk assessment for this formulation is conducted at Member State level after the decision on Annex I inclusion.        The formulation Granit had no significant effect on organic matter decomposition over a six months period in a litter bag test at an application rate of 180 g a.s./ha and 500 g a.s./ha. The soil concentration was calculated in the DAR as 0.67 mg a.s./ha. This concentration covers the plateau maximum PECsoil of 0.232 mg a.s./kg soil (2 x 0.200 kg a.s./ha). In conclusion, the risk of bromuconazole to non-target macro-organisms was assessed as low.        Effects of > 25% on nitrogen transformation were observed at an application rate of 400 g a.s./ha (0.53 mg a.s./kg soil). This concentration covers the plateau maximum PECsoil of 0.232 mg a.s./kg soil (2 x 0.200 kg a.s./ha). The risk of bromuconazole to soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed as low.        The risk to bees, earthworms, non-target plants, and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  9,10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1704     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Bromuconazole;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;fungicide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bromuconazole european food safety authority

Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2006 and January 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with Member States in April 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on rice for the control of Echinochloa crus-galli, sedges and broad leaf weeds as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ` penoxsulam DE-638' (GF-657), an oil dispersion (OD) containing 20.4 g/l of penoxsulam.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant origin and for environmental matrices.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, penoxsulam was rapidly and almost completely absorbed upon oral administration. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation. Excretion was rapid, but dose and sex dependent as excretion was primarily observed via faeces in males and primarily excreted in urine in females. Penoxsulam was bio-transformed to a large number of metabolites; however the majority of the radioactivity was eliminated as unchanged parent compound. Plant and environmental metabolites BST4 and BSTCA5 were not identified in the rat metabolism studies. Toxicological information was lacking on the metabolite BSTCA to conclude on its relevance as a plant metabolite, moreover, it cannot be ruled out that BSTCA is also relevant according to the guidance document on the relevance of metabolites in groundwater.        The acute toxicity of penoxsulam was low by the oral, dermal and inhalation route; slight skin and eye irritation were observed, but no potential for skin sensitisation. The dog was found to be the most sensitive species with the kidneys as the main target organ; the overall short-term NOAEL in dogs was 18 mg/kg bw/day. Long-term toxicity reflected the same target organ observed in the short-term studies: the liver in mice and the kidneys in rats. The relevant long-term NOAEL was the dose level of 5 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study. No potential for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed. No effect was seen on the reproductive performance and parameters; no developmental effect was observed either in rats. In rabbits, a slight increase in resorption rate parameters was associated with maternal toxicity, evidenced by gastro-intestinal upset and decreased body weight gain during the middle gestation.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of penoxsulam was 0.05 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL from the 2-year rat study and applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.18 mg/kg bw/day based on the short-term dog studies and a safety factor of 100, no correction factor was needed to account for enteral resorption; no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 10% for both the concentrate and in-use spray dilution of the representative formulation. The level of operator exposure for a maximum application rate of 0.04 kg penoxsulam/ha in rice was below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) according to both the German7 and the UK POEM8 models. Worker and bystander exposure were considered negligible.        A metabolism study in rice demonstrated that following foliar application of penoxsulam the total residues decreased rapidly to insignificant levels present at harvest of the crop. Therefore, the residue definition in rice grain was proposed as penoxsulam by default.        In supervised residue trials penoxsulam was found to be always below the Limit of Quantification of 0.01 mg/kg in rice grain, while in rice straw residues ranged up to 0.08 mg/kg. Consequently, an MRL for grain was proposed at 0.01 mg/kg, which is the lowest validated level of the analytical method. For straw an MRL is not required.        Rice may be grown in monoculture but also in rotation with other crops. A submitted confined crop rotation study showed that after a plant back interval of 90 days low residues could still be found in some crops. Other plant back intervals were not investigated. Moreover, a metabolite BSTCA, identified at significant levels in rotated crops, was neither found in primary crop metabolism nor in rat metabolism. The toxicological relevance of this metabolite for consumer risk assessment could not be addressed. As rotation practices in Member States seem to differ and the submitted data on rotational crops were limited, a final conclusion on the relevance of residues in rotated crops other than cereals could not be reached. Hence the experts agreed that further elaboration on the issue is required. A data requirement for further rotational crop data is proposed.        If only the scenarios of rice grown in monoculture and of rice rotated with other cereals are considered it can be concluded that exposure to livestock is not expected to be significant. Under these conditions, on the basis of the submitted animal metabolism studies, residues in food of animal origin are expected to occur at extremely low levels that would not be appropriate for monitoring. The experts therefore agreed that, for the time being, it would not be necessary to propose a residue definition and MRLs for food of animal origin. However, it should be noted that the assessment is not finalised with regard to potential livestock exposure to residues in rotational crops other than cereals.        Consumer exposure to residues of penoxsulam in rice grain is insignificant and thus in a chronic risk assessment intakes were well below to ADI. No acute assessment was conducted as an ARfD was not allocated. However, the consumer risk assessment cannot be finalised with regard to residues of metabolite BSTCA since a lack of sufficient occurrence data and toxicological data was identified. As BSTCA may also occur in drinking water derived from ground water at a level > 0.1 mu g/L, total consumer exposure to BSTCA has to be assessed in order to conclude on the consumer risk assessment.        Based on the available environmental fate and behaviour studies in soil and 2 field studies in rice paddies, penoxsulam and the breakdown products 5-OH-penoxsulam (max 40.5% applied radioactivity (AR) in soil) and BSTCA (max 53% AR in soil), were concluded as requiring environmental exposure assessments. In a sterilised laboratory aqueous photolysis study TPSA, 2amino-TP and 5-OH-2-amino-TP12 were major metabolites but it was concluded that these did not need to be assessed, as though sought, they were not detected in relevant field studies in rice paddies. Penoxsulam and 5-OH-penoxsulam were characterised as exhibiting moderate persistence in soil with BSTCA exhibiting medium to high persistence. Additionally in aerobic natural sediment water systems the metabolites PCA-5-OH and OH-BSTCA were formed at up to 16% AR (sum of both compounds) in sediment, so exposure assessments were necessary for these metabolites and are available.        In the aerobic laboratory incubations mineralisation of both the phenyl and the 2-triazolopyrimidine rings to carbon dioxide was low accounting for only 0.3-2.4 % AR after 99 to 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 10-16 % AR in aerobic soil (same radiolabels) after 120 days and 21-58 % AR in aerobic natural sediment water studies after 99 days. Penoxsulam was characterised as exhibiting high to medium mobility, 5-OH-penoxsulam high mobility and BSTCA very high to medium mobility. Further details are necessary regarding a refined higher tier surface water exposure assessment that included definitions of novel scenarios, not prescribed by EU MED-Rice (2003) guidance15. It can be concluded that the potential for penoxsulam or its metabolite 5-OH-penoxsulam to contaminate vulnerable groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L from the applied for intended uses is low. For the metabolite BSTCA the potential to contaminate vulnerable groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is low in situations represented by the MED-Rice clay scenario. However in situations represented by the MED-Rice sand scenario, BSTCA may be present in vulnerable groundwater at > 0. 1 mu g/L (calculations indicate concentrations up to 0.23 mu g/L). Therefore a non-relevance assessment for BSTCA was triggered.        In the risk assessment for birds, species representing insectivorous birds (wren), omnivorous birds eating large aquatic insects (mallard), omnivorous birds eating aquatic plants (mallard), large herbivorous birds (geese) and piscivorous birds (heron) were considered. All TER values were well above the relevant Annex VI trigger indicating a low risk to birds from the use of penoxsulam in rice paddies. Water vole (small herbivorous mammal), water shrew (eating aquatic invertebrates) and otter (eating fish and amphibians) were selected as focal species for the "" in-field"" risk assessment for mammals. The lowest TER obtained was 25 for the long-term risk to water vole. Since this was above the relevant Annex VI trigger a low risk was concluded. For both birds and mammals the exposure from intake of contaminated paddy water was included in the estimation of the daily dose by simply adding the drinking water dose to the dietary dose. The log P-ow for penoxsulam is <3 and also the surface water metabolites were considered to have a log P-ow<3, hence the potential for bioaccumulation and secondary poisoning was considered as low.        Penoxsulam was classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The first tier risk assessment for algae and aquatic plants, based on PECsw in the ""off-field"" area, gave TERs of 46 and 2.9, respectively. An assessment was provided for fish and aquatic invertebrates in paddy water. No assessment was provided for algae or higher plants in paddy water, considering the herbicidal activity of penoxsulam.        The lowest acute TER value was 202, which was obtained for Daphnia using the EC50 for the formulation. The lowest long-term TER was 83. It was concluded that the first tier risk to aquatic plants in the ""off-field"" area was high. Refinements based on a higher tier study with Lemna were not accepted in the peer review, and the risk to aquatic plants remains to be addressed. The risk to aquatic organisms from metabolites was addressed, as was the risk from bioaccumulation (log P-ow<3). The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil micro-organisms and non-target plants was assessed as low.

rayyan-1227193591,Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance trifluralin,2009,8,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,8,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Trifluralin is one of the 52 substances of the second stage covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on trifluralin in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 11 July 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 24 July 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier, the European Union Trifluralin Taskforce comprising of Agan Chemical Manufacturers Ltd. and Dintec Agroquimica Produtos Quimicos Lda. at the time of finalisation of the conclusion. Subsequently, the comments received were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 15 January 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April, May and June 2004 (round 1-2 of the EPCO expert meetings).        A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 10 February 2005 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 14 March 2005 (EFSA Scientific Report (2005) 28)        Following the Commission Decision of 20 September 2007 (2007/629/EC) 4 concerning the non-inclusion of trifluralin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant, the European Union Trifluralin Taskforce made a resubmission application for the inclusion of trifluralin in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the European Commission review report as follows:        the high toxicity to aquatic organisms, in particular fish        the high potential for bioaccumulation        the high persistence in soil        the potential for long- range transport via air        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Greece, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on trifluralin in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 19 January 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 22 January 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 3 March 2009. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 24 April 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days.        The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS' evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific meetings and a telephone conference with Member State experts in May 2009.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been reissued to update the risk assessment in the areas of residues, environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology.        The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprised spraying to bare soil to control grass and broad-leaved weeds in oilseed rape, sunflower, cotton and winter cereals at application rate up to 1.2 kg trifluralin per hectare. The use on winter cereals was no longer supported in the resubmission application, and therefore the conclusion has only been updated in relation to the risk assessment for the representative uses presented in the Additional Report, i.e. use only on oilseed rape, sunflower and cotton at an application rate of up to 1.2 kg trifluralin per hectare. The risk assessment presented for winter cereals has not been updated.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'EF-1521' ('Treflan'), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe. For the uses on oilseed rape, sunflower and cotton, incorporation into soil takes place after the application. Trifluralin can be used only as a pre-sowing/pre-emergence herbicide.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, trifluralin is extensively and rapidly metabolised. Within 48 hours, 82 % is absorbed and more than 90 % is excreted within 168 hours mainly via bile. It has a low acute toxicity, but displayed sensitising properties and should be labelled with Xi; R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". The relevant oral no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the short-term studies was 2.4 mg/kg bw/day in the 1-year dog study, based on increased liver weight and some minor changes in the chemistry. The dermal and inhalation toxicity after subchronic exposure was low.        Regarding genotoxic properties of trifluralin it was concluded that trifluralin induces weak clastogenic and aneugenic effects in a number of in vivo and in vitro studies, but this was not confirmed in a more reliable micronucleus test. Trifluralin induced neoplastic changes and carcinogenic effects such as Leydig cell tumours, thyroid tumours, urinary bladder tumours and renal carcinoma in rats. Since no NOAEL could be established, the lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 30 mg/kg bw/day in the rat is assigned as the most relevant effect level. The following risk phrase is proposed Xn; R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"".        There were no direct effects on reproductive performance or fertility observed, and the relevant NOAEL for reproduction was set to 4.5-5.8 mg/kg bw/day in the rat based on haematological changes, decreased maternal body weight during gestation and decreased offspring growth and survival, respectively. Trifluralin did not induce teratogenic or fetotoxic effects at non-maternally toxic doses. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 50 mg/kg bw/day in the rabbit based on decreased foetal weight, post implantation losses and reduced body weight, food consumption, respectively.        The proposed acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the LOAEL in the rat carcinogenicity study with a margin of safety between LOAEL and ADI of 2000, since the ADI is based on a LOAEL value instead of a NOAEL value and that at this dose level tumour formation was evident.        The proposed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.026 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL in the 90-day mechanistic study in rats using a safety factor of 100. No correction for oral absorption is required.        No acute reference dose (ArfD) is allocated.        The outcome of the risk assessment for the plant protection product 'EF-1521' ('Treflan'), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 480 g trifluralin/L showed that the estimated operator exposure levels (according to German model) were below the AOEL only if personal protective equipment (PPE) are used both during mixing/loading (gloves) and application (gloves and coverall). The calculated exposure levels for bystanders were also below the established AOEL. The value of dermal absorption is 10 % for the concentrate and the diluted formulation. There was no need for estimating the worker exposure, since trifluralin is a pre-emergence herbicide applied directly to soil.        The metabolism of trifluralin was investigated in cereals (maize) and oilseed crops (rapeseed, soybean and cotton). In maize, trifluralin was extensively metabolised and residues were shown to consist of numerous compounds, with few being identified due to their low levels.        The uptake was also limited in rapeseed with low radioactive residues at harvest. No parent trifluralin was detected in mature seeds and mature plant samples; the major compound identified (ca 35% of the total radioactive residue) was the metabolite TR-145, mainly as conjugate. However, and considering its absolute low level, the PRAPeR 70 meeting of experts on residues agreed not to include this metabolite in the residue definitions. Finally, it was concluded that the residue definitions for risk assessment and monitoring initially proposed by the EPCO 05 meeting of experts for cereals and limited to the parent trifluralin only, are also applicable to the oilseed crops.        No residues of trifluralin above the limit of quantification (LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg) were detected in any of the grain samples collected in the supervised trials conducted on rapeseed, sunflower and cotton according to the critical GAP in Northern and Southern Europe.        Processing studies were not submitted and were considered not necessary. Livestock studies were not assessed in the framework of the resubmission since no significant residues are expected in oilseed commodities at harvest.        The chronic dietary exposure assessment for consumers based on the EFSA PRIMo rev2 and the proposed maximum residue limits (MRLs) of 0.01* mg/kg for rapeseed, sunflower and cotton leads to estimated intakes less than 0.1% of the proposed ADI for all the European diets included in the model. No ARfD was allocated, thus, no acute risk calculation was performed for trifluralin.        In aerobic conditions degradation of trifluralin in soil did not lead to any major metabolite. Under flooded anaerobic conditions a major metabolite TR-46 is formed. Furthermore, metabolite TR-14 was formed at amounts above 5 % at the end of the study in all three anaerobic soils tested. Due to its potential degradation under aerobic conditions, TR-4 may be addressed by Member States where anaerobic conditions are envisaged to be relevant. Whereas not discussed in particular during the peer review, it is EFSA's opinion that the same conclusion may be reached for metabolite TR-14.        Under aerobic laboratory conditions trifluralin is medium to highly persistent with half- lives between 81 to 356 days at 22 degrees C. The degradation under anaerobic conditions was faster than under aerobic conditions. Data indicate that trifluralin is strongly adsorbed to soil and could be classified as immobile. Trifluralin is hydrolytically stable under environmentally relevant conditions. Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of trifluralin producing metabolites TR-67 and TR-158. Trifluralin is not readily biodegradable. During the peer review, it was agreed that worst case DT50 = 13 days should be employed for the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion, and that a DT50 = 2 days could be used to refine the risk assessment when appropriate. Due to the potential contribution of photolysis to the dissipation of trifluralin in water, the fate and behaviour in the environment EPCO 02 expert meeting confirmed the need of a water sediment study, conducted in the presence of light, that could be used by Member States to refine the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion. In the resubmission dossier new PEC SW/SED values based on step 3 and step 4 FOCUS SW were provided for trifluralin. In spite of the drawbacks of the calculations available, the PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts concluded that the maximum PECSW and PECSED at step 3 would result from a loading to the water body driven by drift, and a reliable risk assessment would be obtained if this maximum value is used for the risk assessment. However, if information on the pattern of exposure at step 3 or step 4 calculations are needed for the assessment, then the calculations available would be not acceptable and/or would be insufficient to finalize the risk assessment. The PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts identified a data gap for FOCUS SW calculations that provide the information needed to finalize the EU risk assessment. Neither trifluralin nor its anaerobic metabolite TR-4 are expected to contaminate ground water at levels above 0.1 mu g/L under the proposed conditions of use.        Trifluralin was designated as a ""priority substance"" under the water framework directive9 but has not been identified as a "" priority hazardous substance"". However, trifluralin was added to the OSPAR (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North- East Atlantic) List of Chemicals for Priority action in 2002, because it is considered to be a 'PBT' substance fulfilling the criteria for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity.        Because of its high volatility, the occurrence of trifluralin in air and transport through air is possible. However, photochemical half-life in air is estimated to be short. A data gap was identified by the PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts for the monitoring data in the Arctic regions reported by Canadian researchers and quoted in the report: 'Trifluralin dossier prepared in support of a proposal of trifluralin to be considered as a candidate for inclusion in the Annex I to the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants (LRTAP Protocol on POPs)'. European Commission, DG, Environment, Brussels, July 2007.        The risk to insectivorous and fish-eating birds and mammals, bees, ground-dwelling arthropods, soil micro-organisms and earthworms is low with respect to trifluralin and the metabolites as far as investigated.        In the original peer review high risks were identified for aquatic organisms, in particular the chronic risk for fish, which requires consideration of appropriate risk mitigation measures. Using the initial predicted environmental concentrations (PEC's) together with the no observed effect level (NOEC) of 0.3 mu g/L leads to a toxicity exposure ratio (TER)-value of 0.38 when a bufferzone of 15 metres is taken into account, which is below the Annex VI trigger value of 10 (without detailed calculations, a bufferzone of 50 m should lead to a TERvalue of approximately 1). Further data were considered necessary to address this risk and enable conclusions on the risk assessment to be drawn.        For the resubmission, a new 35-day static early-life-stage (ELS) study was conducted with fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) in a water-sediment system. In addition to the standard observations (i.e. growth and survival), skeletal irregularity was also analysed. The agreed end point from this study was the NOEC of 3.2 mu g a.s./L. However, since no data on the exposure pattern were available, it was not possible to conclude on the final fish chronic end point to be used for the risk assessment. Therefore, the chronic risk assessment for fish could not be finalised.        Based on the data gap identified at the PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts on environmental fate and behaviour (see section 4.2.1), a data gap was identified to provide a chronic risk assessment for fish based on the most relevant end point and on step 3 and step 4 PECsw values.        The EPCO 08 expert meeting (section ecotoxicology, June 2004) considered the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals as low, based on the TER value reflecting the soil accumulation plateau. EFSA would like to highlight that the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals should be considered further at Member State level when the product is applied after this plateau value is reached. EFSA initially proposed that a new litterbag study should be made available in which the tested dose rate reflects the concentration in the soil after a single application when the accumulation plateau has been reached, as the study which is available at present was performed at a lower dose rate. This data requirement was not discussed in an EPCO expert meeting. No new litterbag study was provided with the resubmission dossier. However, the PRAPeR 68 meeting of experts considered this study no longer necessary. The data gap was therefore not confirmed.        The risk to non-target plants could not be calculated with the appropriate end point (median emergence rate (ER50) value) as this value is not reported in the DAR. Based on a conservative no observed effect concentration (NOEC), the risk to non-target plants can be certainly regarded as low if a bufferzone of 5 metres is taken into account.        Regulation (EC) No 850/2004(10) of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC11 entered into force when the initial peer review of trifluralin was in an advanced stage. For this reason, the original EFSA conclusion finalised on 14 March 2005 (EFSA Scientific Report (2005) 28) did not specifically assess trifluralin against the criteria set in the paragraph 1 of Annex D of the Stockholm Convention(12). In the framework of the resubmission procedure, it was identified that EFSA should compare the agreed end points against the criteria set in the Stockholm Convention. The result of this assessment is presented under the section Conclusions and Recommendations. EFSA acknowledges that the assessment presented in this conclusion only considers a limited range of representative uses on the basis of the information provided by the notifier in the application dossier and the Member States during the peer review. Therefore, other information may need to be considered by the Commission and the Member States when assessing trifluralin with respect to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004.

Fish were exposed to sub-lethal and nominal concentration of fenthion after intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 or 400 mg/kg NAC. Brain tissues were then dissected and homogenized to analyse GSH, GSSG, TBARS, and protein contents. Enzymes that constitute the first line antioxidant defence, namely SOD and CAT, GSH-related enzymes, GR and GST, together with AChE activities were also determined spectrophotometrically. Fenthion did not cause any alteration in SOD and CAT activities while increasing GSH content, GSH/GSSG ratio and GST specific enzyme activity and decreasing GSSG, TBARS, and protein contents. Although, the highest induction in SOD and GST enzymes activities and the highest increase in GSH content were observed in the 0.5 mg/kg NAC-injected fish, their protein contents showed a decrease. 400 mg/kg NAC impeded the activation of the GST enzyme and a higher decrease in lipid peroxidation was observed. Fish were also protected against protein depletion by the higher dose NAC application. AChE activity was not influenced by fenthion exposure. Xenobiotic and GSH transporters may cause mild oxidative stress conditions in brain. Cellular redox status could trigger a series of reactions that result in an increase in SOD activity and a decrease in protein content. Based on the present results, it was suggested that the usefulness of NAC against fenthion depends on applied dose and tissue characteristics. Species-specifity and concentration selection should be taken into consideration in studies dealing with anticholinesterases. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

rayyan-1227193593,Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance myclobutanil (Question No EFSA-Q-2009-00606) Issued on 4 June 2009,2009,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Myclobutanil is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.(2) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on myclobutanil in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 4 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 29 March 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October - November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 14 November 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises air assisted broadcast spraying to table and wine grapes and apples in the fruit development stage, against powdery mildew, black rot and scab, in Northern and Southern Europe, up to a maximum 4 applications at a maximum individual application rate per spray of 48 g a.s./ha on grapes, and 90 g a.s./ha on apples, with an interval of 10 days between applications.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, 'Systhane 20 EW', an emulsion, oil in water (EW) containing 200 g/L myclobutanil.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method.        In mammals, myclobutanil LD50 is 1600 mg/kg bw ( classification as R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed). It is not toxic via dermal and inhalation routes (LD50 >2000 mg/kg bw and LC50>5.1 mg/L). Myclobutanil is not a skin irritant or a skin sensitiser. The European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) classified myclobutanil with R36 (""Irritating to eyes""). The primary target organ following exposure to myclobutanil is the liver. Myclobutanil induces liver enlargement accompanied by slight induction of biotransformation enzymes (in rats and mice). An overall subchronic NOAEL of 100 ppm was proposed (3.09 mg/kg bw/day). Myclobutanil does not show any genotoxic potential. In long-term studies in rat, the target organ appeared to be the testes (bilateral testicular atrophy and aspermatogenesis). The relevant NOAEL for long-term toxicity is 2.5 mg/kg bw/day from the rat study. Myclobutanil did not show any carcinogenic potential. In a two-generation rat study, myclobutanil, at a dietary concentration of 1000 ppm (80 mg/kg bw/day) produced reduced parental body weight and liver effects and decreased weight gain in pups during lactation; at slight parental toxic doses the number of females delivering litters was reduced and the incidence of stillborn pups increased. The relevant parental, offspring and reproductive NOAEL is 16 mg/kg bw/day. Myclobutanil is already classified as Repr. Cat 3, R63 (""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child""). The relevant parental NOAEL is 94 mg/kg bw/day, while the relevant developmental NOAEL is 31 mg/kg bw/day. No indication of any other neurological effects was found in the toxicological studies. The proposed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is based on the relevant NOAEL from the long-term rat study, applying a safety factor of 100, giving an ADI of 0.025 mg/kg bw/day. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.03 mg/kg bw/day was agreed to be based on the overall NOAEL (90-day and 1-year in dog) of 3.09 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100. The rat developmental toxicity study was considered as the most appropriate to use for setting the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD). An NOAEL of 31.3 mg/kg bw/day was established due to embryotoxic effects (altered viability index). Based on this NOAEL and an assessment factor of 100 the proposed ARfD is 0.31 mg/kg bw. There is a 300-fold margin between the proposed ARfD and the LOAEL for developmental effects in the rat developmental toxicity study. The operator, worker and bystander exposure estimates showed levels below the AOEL even when no PPE is worn (German model).        The metabolism of myclobutanil was investigated in grapes, apples (representative uses) and additionally in wheat. In grapes and apples at harvest, the major components of the residue were myclobutanil and its metabolite RH-9090(3) in free and conjugated form. A metabolic cleavage of the myclobutanil molecule which would generate triazole derivative metabolites was - in contrast to the wheat study - not observed in apples and grapes. Based on the available plant metabolism data for the categories fruit and cereals it was concluded that the metabolism is not comparable amongst different crop groups. As for the representative uses, however, it was agreed that the relevant residue for the category fruit crops should be defined as myclobutanil and its metabolite RH-9090 (free and conjugated). A sufficient number of residue trials in apples and grapes are available; however, there is still evidence required that the submitted trials cover the proposed residue definition. In processing studies it was investigated how the residue levels of myclobutanil and metabolite RH-9090 change when apples and grapes are processed to juice, wine, puree etc. However, a study investigating the effects of processing on the nature of the residues was identified as necessary since under processing conditions significant amounts of one or more degradation products, initially not present in the raw commodities, could be generated.        The investigation of residues in rotational and succeeding crops was considered not relevant since both apples and grapes are perennial crops that are usually not grown in rotation with other crops. However it was highlighted that in the long term the issue of potential uptake of triazole derivative metabolites could become relevant and should be followed up separately as this concern is not specific to the active substance myclobutanil alone but common to a number of triazole pesticides.        Since significant exposure of livestock to residues in feed may occur, a metabolism study in ruminants was triggered. The majority of the experts agreed that the level of identification was insufficient in the available study and thus a robust residue definition for food of animal origin could not be concluded on. Consequently, the relevance of the available feeding study for the assessment and likely necessary MRL proposals for food of animal origin can only be decided on when a residue definition has been concluded.        As a consequence of the identified data gaps, the consumer risk assessment with regard to the notified representative uses on apples and grapes cannot be finalised. Moreover, the risk assessment with regard to the two isomers of myclobutanil was not addressed.        It is noted that in addition to exposure from residues in food, the consumer could be exposed to residues of myclobutanil butyric acid, 4 a potential metabolite from ground water used as drinking water, but currently an assessment of the relevance of the metabolite and consequently of consumer risk is not available. An additional exposure to myclobutanil residues from groundwater used as drinking water can also not be excluded.        In soil under aerobic conditions myclobutanil exhibits high to very high persistence, forming the minor soil metabolite myclobutanil butyric acid (accounting for a maximum of 6% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of both the chlorophenyl and triazole rings to carbon dioxide was limited and accounted for only 0.2 to 1.7% AR after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 4 to 16% AR after 120 days. Myclobutanil exhibits medium to low mobility in soil, myclobutanil butyric acid exhibits very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either myclobutanil or myclobutanil butyric acid was affected significantly by differing soil pH. Data on degradation in soil under anaerobic conditions are not available and it was considered they will be necessary to support the applied for use on apples in some territories of the EU.        In dark natural sediment water systems myclobutanil partitioned from the water column to sediment where it exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 0.3% AR at 105 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a sink but represented only 4.3 to 9.8% AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for myclobutanil at steps 3 and 4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        On the basis of the available reliable information, it cannot be excluded that for the applied for intended uses, groundwater exposure by myclobutanil above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, will not occur over a wide range of European geoclimatic conditions. In addition for the metabolite myclobutanil butyric acid, groundwater exposure above the parametric drinking water limit might be expected and it cannot be excluded that concentrations > 0.75 mu g/L (a key assessment trigger from the groundwater metabolite relevance guidance document) may occur. A groundwater metabolite non relevance assessment is therefore necessary for myclobutanil butyric acid but this assessment is not available.        The risk to birds and mammals was assessed as low except the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals from the use in apple orchards. A refined risk assessment applying interception factors of 65% and 70% resulted in a TER of 5.18 which is above the Annex VI trigger of 5. The risk of secondary poisoning from uptake of contaminated earthworms was assessed as low. A data gap was identified in the experts. meeting for the submission of a risk assessment for fish-eating birds and mammals since it was not possible to exclude that the logP(ow) of myclobunatil is >3. Myclobutanil is very toxic to aquatic invertebrates. The TERs based on FOCUS step 3 PECsw were above the Annex VI triggers for the representative use on grapes. For the use in apple orchards risk mitigation measures such as a no-spray buffer zone of 14 metres is required to achieve TERs above the Annex VI triggers. The assessment of the logPow value was inconclusive. In the expert meeting a data gap for a bioconcentration study with fish was identified since four applications are foreseen and chronic and repeated exposure of fish is expected. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. It was identified that the risk assessment did not address the potential for different myclobutanil isomer ratios to be present in the environment.

The fungicide vinclozolin acts as an anti-androgen and is known to affect affiliative behaviors in rodents, fish and amphibians. To investigate the possible effects of exposure to EDCs on reproductive behavior in a wild population of songbirds, we examined the effects of vinclozolin in wild-caught Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis). For this and many other temperate songbird species, testosterone has powerful activational effects on affiliative behaviors in adulthood. We hypothesized that vinclozolin would affect male behaviors associated with female preference. Male juncos received daily oral gavage for 10 weeks with 2 mM vinclozolin in vehicle or vehicle alone. Juncos were photostimulated (16L:8D) to induce breeding behavior. Each pair of a treated and non-treated male was presented to an estrogen-primed female to assess female preference. Seven of eight females exhibited a strong preference for a male exposed to vinclozolin over a control male (p = 0.01). The only significant difference in measured male behaviors was increased beak wiping in controls (p = 0.006) and there was no difference in gonad size or brain weight (p > 0.05 for each). Our data suggest that estrogen-primed female juncos prefer to associate with male juncos exposed to this anti-androgen. This finding demonstrates that environmentally occurring anti-androgens can affect the social behavior of this species. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that vinclozolin has effects on the social behavior of songbirds. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on paraffin oil (CAS 8042-47-5) in accordance with the provisions of Article 21(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 30 April 2008. The peer review was initiated on 30 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier W. Neudorff GmbH KG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide for use on pome fruit, stone fruit, berry fruits (except strawberry), grapes and ornamentals. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of endpoints.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation were 'Promanal Neu', an oil in water emulsion (EW).        Methods of analysis for food items are currently not required see sections 3. For environmental matrices methods are not required for groundwater and air, for surface water a method is required for alkanes (chain lengths up to C-30). For soil it is not concluded if a method is required or not, see sections 4 and 5.        Sufficient internationally accepted methods e.g. ASTM, ISO are available to characterise the technical material and formulated product. However, at this time the technical specification is not accepted and there is no supporting batch data. Data gaps have been identified for autoflammability, flash point and a shelf-life study.        During the mammalian toxicology meeting, as no technical specification was agreed by the meeting on physical and chemical properties, concerns were raised over relevant impurities generally associated with these compounds. The specification, as proposed by the notifier, could be accepted on toxicological grounds if its high purity is confirmed by the section on physical and chemical properties. However, while this is not demonstrated, paraffin oils have to be classified as T ""Toxic"", carcinogenic category 2, R45 ""May cause cancer"". On this basis, no toxicological studies were required, no ADI, AOEL or ARfD were proposed and no risk assessment of operator, worker and bystander exposure could be conducted as the experts considered that these specifications were not acceptable from the toxicological point of view.        It was noted however that if highly purified paraffin oils were considered (i.e. no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the active substance), then no toxicological concern would be raised for consumers, operators, workers and bystanders. Sources of mineral oil are laxatives in pharmacology or oils are used in food technology as release agents, for lubrication purposes, or as a substitute for fat. Paraffin oils are chemically inert substances, especially the straight chain (n) alkanes and, on ingestion, most of the mineral oil (about 98 % depending on the length of the C-chain) remains unabsorbed and is rapidly excreted, mostly unchanged, via faeces.        Paraffin oil has a low toxicity profile. No toxicological study was submitted, except an acute inhalation toxicity study in the rat. The experts agreed that no acute, short-term, long-term, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity studies would be required, provided that no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the substance. Paraffin oils are not considered to be genotoxic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic or toxic to the reproduction. Also, in line with the low toxicity of paraffin oils (of high purity), no ADI, AOEL or ARfD would be proposed, nor considered necessary, and no risk assessment for operators, workers and bystanders would be required.        The list of endpoint on mammalian toxicology has been filled in considering that the technical material does not contain unacceptable levels of relevant impurities.        No information on potential levels of residues in food or feed items were presented in the DAR.        A consumer risk assessment has not been performed due to the possible high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. If these compounds are present then it would result in a toxicological classification that would mean that these compounds could not be registered as Plant Protection Products. The risk to consumers can therefore not be finalised.        In soil under aerobic conditions this paraffin oil mixture exhibits moderate to medium persistence in terms of the time taken for carbon tetrachloride extracted alkanes to be mineralised. The alkanes in the mixture are classed as immobile in soil on the basis of QSAR estimates, and adsorption is not pH dependent. In a 55 cm deep microcosm study this paraffin oil mixture formed a layer at the water surface (spray application made), where it dissipated rapidly exhibiting low persistence in water. Sediment concentrations were not measured. The mechanism of the dissipation was not identified. Surface water exposure assessments are available using the SWASH drift calculator tool. A data gap is identified regarding the potential for water body associated sediment to be exposed, and information on degradation/dissipation potential of this paraffin oil mixture in sediment. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by alkanes up to C-30 above, the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        Based on the available data, paraffin oil was proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. EFSA re-calculated the TERs after the expert meeting, with the new PECsw and included the values in the final list of endpoints. A high potential acute and chronic risk was identified for Daphnia magna for all the intended uses. Risk mitigation measures were applied to refine the risk in the grapevine and ornamental uses. However, even using the widest no-spray buffer zones (25m for streams and ditches for the pome fruit and grapevine uses and 30m for stream and ditches for the use on ornamentals), the acute and chronic TERs for Daphnia did not meet the Annex VI trigger values for all the intended uses, except for the acute TERs estimated for the grapevine use when a 25m no-spray buffer zone was applied. Further information is necessary to address the risk to aquatic invertebrates for all of the intended uses. The TERs for fish and alga exceeded the Annex VI trigger value based on the use of a 20m no-spray buffer zone for the pome fruit use. However, the TERs estimated for fish and alga were above the Annex VI trigger values without the use of no-spray buffer zones. The risk for fish and algae was assessed to be low for the grapevine and ornamental uses. However, mitigation measures equivalent to 20m are necessary to refine the risk for fish and alga with respect to the pome fruit use. The available information did not allow the risk to sediment dwelling organisms to be assessed.        The experts meeting agreed that, in absence of data, mitigation measures should be taken to avoid exposure to bees.        Herbicidal effects of the formulation ""Promanal Neu"" on vegetative vigour were investigated in tests with six plant species. The lowest ER50 value was observed for Allium cepa ER50 > 17.64 kg a.s./ha for vegetative vigour. The TERs were 4.8 and 5.4 for post-emergence treatments based on PECs from spray drift at 3m and 5m no-spray buffer zones, respectively.        There was no valid study evaluated in the DAR to assess the effects of paraffin oil on soil non-target macro-organisms. A data gap for information to address this issue was identified.        The risk to birds and mammals, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target microorganisms and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low.

This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on zeta-cypermethrin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 10 July 2006. The peer review was initiated on 6 October 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant FMC Chemical sprl. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in October 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Fury 10 EW (NP Free)"", an emulsion, oil in water (EW) containing 100 g/L (96.9 g/kg) zeta-cypermethrin.        The technical specification for the active substance was based on pilot scale production and was only partially accepted by the PRAPeR meeting of experts (May 2008).        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant and animal origin, environmental matrices and body fluids and tissues.        As for mammalian toxicology, the dossier submitted contained studies on both zeta-cypermethrin and cypermethrin. Considering the ratio of the most potent isomers between zeta-cypermethrin and cypermethrin and focusing on neurotoxicity (difference using the NOAELs and LOAELs of rat studies), a factor of 2 could be established showing that zeta-cypermethrin is more toxic than cypermethrin. When orally administered, zeta-cypermethrin is toxic (proposed to be classified T, R25 ""toxic if swallowed""). It is harmful for inhalation (Xn, R20). No toxic effects were observed after dermal exposure. It is not irritating to eyes or skin but is a skin sensitizer in a Buehler test (Xi, R43 - ""irritant; may cause sensitisation by skin contact""). Neurotoxicity is the target effect of zeta-cypermethrin for short term exposures. The relevant NOAEL of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day is from the 2-year feeding study in dogs. The classification as R48/22 (""danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure, if swallowed"") was proposed based on mortality in several studies. Overall, it was concluded that zeta-cypermethrin is neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic under experimental conditions (carcinogenicity was tested with cypermethrin). The relevant long term toxicity and carcinogenicity NOAEL of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day is from the 2-year rat study. The relevant parental and offspring NOAEL in multigeneration studies is 5.9 mg/kg bw/day, while the reproductive NOAEL is 22 mg/kg bw/day. Zeta-cypermethrin was negative for developmental toxicity when tested in rats. The relevant maternal NOAEL in rat and rabbit are 12.5 and >= 120 mg/kg bw/day, respectively; the relevant developmental NOAEL are 35 mg/kg bw/day in rat, and >= 120 mg/kg bw/day in rabbit. Zeta-cypermethrin is a neurotoxic agent (acute and subchronic NOAELs 10 mg/kg bw and 5 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, based on the overall cypermethrin NOAEL for dogs of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day and a 100-fold safety factor with an additional factor of 2 for the higher toxicity of zeta-cypermethrin vs. cypermethrin. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.125 mg/kg bw based on the developmental toxicity study in rats supported by the acute neurotoxicity with zeta-cypermethrin, applying a safety factor (SF) of 100. An acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) of 0.02 mg/kg bw/day was based on the overall cypermethrin NOAEL for dogs of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day using a 100-fold safety factor with an additional factor of 2 for the higher toxicity of zeta-cypermethrin and correcting for 50% oral absorption. The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).        In order to support the uses of zeta-cypermethrin the applicant submitted plant metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin. Several groups of plants were investigated; root crops (sugar beet), cereals (maize), pulses/oilseeds (cotton), fruit crops (apples) and leafy crops (lettuce). The major degradation pathway of cypermethrin starts with the cleavage of the parent molecule to yield cis/trans DCVA(2) and the mPBAldehyde(3), this latter metabolite being further oxidised or reduced to the corresponding mPBAcid(4) or mPBAlcohol(5) followed by conjugations. In most of the plant matrices investigated, unchanged cypermethrin was the predominant residue accounting for more than c.a. 50% of the TRR. The meeting discussed whether the plant metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin were relevant for zeta-cypermethrin and if a preferential metabolism may be suspected for some isomers with a special impact on toxicology. A bridging study on maize detailing the respective metabolism of both cypermethrin and zeta-cypermethrin was provided by the applicant, however, in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. However, and taking into account the no residue situation resulting from the intended uses on cereals, maize and peas, the meeting was of the opinion that the possible isomeric conversion from less to more toxic isomers would not be significant and concluded that a residue definition can be proposed based on the metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin. Finally, it was concluded that a global residue definition has to be proposed in order to take into account the various mixtures of cypermethrin isomers available on the market. Thus, for plants, the residue for monitoring and risk assessment was defined as ""cypermethrin, including other mixtures of constituent isomers (sum of isomers)"".        Numerous supervised residue trials performed with zeta-cypermethrin were submitted to propose MRLs. Nevertheless, some of them were rejected since growth stages at application were not in compliance with the critical GAP and/or analytical methods were not sufficiently validated. Finally, MRLs were defined for wheat, triticale and pea without pods and, awaiting the evaluation of additional data provided by the applicant that were not considered during the meeting with regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, provisional MRLs were proposed for maize, barley, oat, pea with pods and pulses. No degradation of residues was observed for zeta-cypermethrin in different plant- and animal matrices when stored under frozen conditions for up to 18 months. Some instability was observed at some time points for the metabolites mPBAcid and cis-DCVA in some animal matrices, but globally, the results were considered acceptable. No processing studies were provided since no significant residues were observed in any commodities supporting the representative uses. However, the EFSA noted that the cypermethrin hydrolysis breakdown product, mPBAldehyde, was found in a tomato processing study, and this compound is suspected of endocrine activity. This concern was considered to be not relevant for the intended uses supported in the DAR but the meeting noted that this point has to be re-considered if additional uses are envisaged.        Lactating cow and laying hen metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin were evaluated. The major route of degradation consisted of the hydrolysis of ester linkage to generate the cis and trans DCVA moiety and the mPBAldehyde that undergoes further oxidation and/or reduction to the corresponding acid (mPBAcid) or alcohol (mPBAlcohol) and their hydroxy products. The metabolism of the cyclopropyl moiety was considered as insufficiently investigated in the ruminant metabolism study as in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the additional data from literature presented in the addendum of May 2008, could not be considered in the peer review. This point remains open and has to be reconsidered. Nevertheless, and taking into account the complete metabolic pathway in poultry, and the data from the rat metabolism study indicating a similar pathway, the meeting of experts concluded that there was enough evidence to propose the residue for monitoring and risk assessment for animal products as ""cypermethrin, including other mixtures of constituent isomers (sum of isomers)"".        Considering the potential livestock exposure to zeta-cypermethrin residues through consumption of treated feed items (maize, cereals, pea and pulses), feeding studies indicate that no measurable residues may be present above the LOQ in the different animal-products and the MRLs for animal commodities were proposed at LOQ values. Considering the representative uses and the toxicological endpoints set for zeta-cypermethrin, no chronic or acute concerns were observed, the theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) being less than 2% of the ADI and the maximum national estimated short term intake (NESTI) less than 1% of ARfD. In addition, the meeting concluded on the need for a global risk assessment taking into account the other sources of exposure resulting from the uses of all other cyprermethrin isomer mixtures available on the market and their respective toxicological reference values.        In soil under aerobic conditions zeta-cypermethrin exhibits low to medium persistence forming the soil metabolites DCVA6 (accounting for up to 24% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low persistence and mPBAcid (accounting for up to 8.4 % AR in the available guideline study or 29.5% AR in a study with limited sampling intervals) which also exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation of both the cyclopropyl- and benzyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 25-27% AR after 91 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 12-26 % AR after 91 days. Isomers of cypermethrin are immobile in soil, DCVA exhibits very high mobility in soil and mPBAcid exhibits high to medium mobility. There was no indication that the soil adsorption of isomers of cypermethrin was pH dependent. There was no clear evidence that the soil adsorption of DCVA or mPBAcid was pH dependant. A data gap was identified for a satisfactory aerobic soil laboratory route of degradation study dosed with zeta-cypermethrin, which is necessary to ensure thatall potential soil metabolites that might reach levels that trigger a groundwater exposure assessment have been identified. The available route of degradation study that used cypermethrin as the test substance was considered insufficient to address the presence of zeta-cypermethrin metabolites at the 5% AR trigger for leaching assessment level as prescribed in agreed EU guidance.        In dark natural sediment water systems zeta-cypermethrin partitioned rapidly from water to sediment where it degraded exhibiting low persistence to the metabolites mPBAcid and DCVA, which were present predominantly in the water phase where they exhibited medium to high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 22 % AR (cyclopropyl label) and 58% AR (phenyl label) at 99 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a significant sink representing 16-27 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for component isomers of the active substance at step 1. Step 3 and 4 calculations are also available (but only for surface water and not sediment), with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. However, these calculations did not adhere to the FOCUS surface water guidance, so a data gap is identified for more appropriate calculations, therefore only relatively crude estimates of surface water exposure are available for the aquatic risk assessment. For the metabolites mPBAcid and DCVA appropriate FOCUS step 1 exposure assessments were agreed by the peer review. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by component isomers of the active substance, mPBAcid and trans-DCVA above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However the groundwater exposure assessment for metabolites cannot be finalised until the data gap identified for a satisfactory soil route of degradation study is filled.        The risk to mammals and the acute and short-term risk to birds were assessed as low but a potential high long-term risk to insectivorous birds cannot be excluded for all representative uses evaluated. A data gap was identified for further refinement of the risk assessment for insectivorous birds. Zeta-cypermethrin is very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The aquatic risk assessment was based on preliminary FOCUS step 4 PECsw values which included a 20m no-spray buffer zone. The acute TERs for fish exceeded the Annex VI trigger of 100 in all scenarios for the use in cereals and in all scenarios except R3 and R4 for the use in peas. However no full scenario resulted in a TER of >100 for the use in maize and the long-term TERs were significantly below the Annex VI trigger of 10 in all scenarios even with a no-spray buffer zone of 20m. A data gap was identified for further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment. Two mesocosm studies with zeta-cypermethrin were submitted by the applicant, however, in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. The risk to aquatic organisms from the metabolites cis-DCVA, trans-DCVA and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (mPBAcid) was assessed as low. Zeta-cypermethrin is very toxic to bees. A potential high risk was indicated in the first-tier risk assessment. The mortality of adult bees was increased in higher tier tests during the first 1-4 days after treatment. No impact on bee brood development was observed but it was noted that no reserves were accumulated in the bee hives. This observation may be explained by the repellent effect of zeta-cypermethrin. The experts considered the risk to bees as low for the use in cereals which are considered as not attractive for bees. Risk mitigation measures such as no application during flowering were proposed for the use in peas. The higher tier studies did not cover the application rate in maize and a data gap was identified to address the risk to bees further. A high in-field risk to non-target arthropods was indicated from the standard laboratory and the extended laboratory tests. The applied doses in the field tests were too low for the representative uses and a data gap was identified to address further the in-field and the off-field risk to non-target arthropods for all representative uses. Although formally not triggered, the experts considered it necessary to address the risk to soil dwelling mites and collembola because of the potential high risk to arthropods. It was suggested that investigation of soil dwelling mites and collembola should be included in a field study with non-target arthropods. The study on effects on respiration of activated sewage sludge was assessed as not valid. A new study was submitted by the applicant but in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review.        The risk to earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants was assessed as low.

rayyan-1227193598,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Sulcotrione,2008,10,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,10,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Sulcotrione is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on sulcotrione in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 9 August 2006. The peer review was initiated on 15 September 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded to by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March April 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a herbicide on maize. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Mikado"", a suspension concentrate (SC).        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. It is noted that the residue definitions for soil and water are not yet finalised. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Data gaps have been identified for the specification, and for a new method of analysis for sulcotrione in air.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, sulcotrione was rapidly and completely absorbed and excreted after oral administration. It was poorly distributed into tissues and organs, and metabolism was limited. The acute toxicity of sulcotrione was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route. It did not present eye or skin irritation properties; however, it was proposed to classify the active substance with risk phrase R43 ""may cause sensitisation by skin contact"" as a high rate of sensitisation was observed in a Magnusson & Kligman test. Sulcotrione is a 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitor, a key enzyme of the tyrosine catabolic pathway, resulting in increased 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate, the proximal tyrosine metabolite and increased blood tyrosine concentration. Male rats were recognised as being more sensitive to sulcotrione and primary effects in short term and long term studies were characterized by corneal lesions and increased liver and kidney weights associated with histopathological findings. Corneal lesions have been shown to be irrelevant for human risk assessment, but liver and mainly kidney effects were considered as sulcotrione-mediated effects (opposed to tyrosinaemia-related effects) and relevant for human risk assessment. The relevant NOAEL for short term exposure was the dose level of 3.3 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat study, while after long term exposure, only a LOAEL could be determined, at 0.04 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study.        Inconsistent results were obtained from genotoxicity studies, some positive in vitro tests were obtained as well as one out of three in vivo micronucleus assays. Higher relevance was given to a negative in vivo UDS assay and it was concluded, based on the weight of evidence, that sulcotrione had no genotoxic potential in vivo. No potential for carcinogenicity was found either.        Reproduction toxicity studies reflected the same effects in parents, but abnormalities of the urinary tract were increased in pups of both generations, not observed in the first parental animals, and on this basis, a classification with Xn, R63 ""possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The relevant NOAEL (parental) was the dose level of 0.06 mg/kg bw/day, while offspring's NOAEL was 0.6 mg/kg bw/day, no effect on the reproduction or fertility was observed. No developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits when sulcotrione was administered by oral gavage and no neurotoxicity was attributed to sulcotrione administration.        A data package of studies was provided on the metabolite CMBA(2), a significant metabolite in plant and the environment, but found only in traces in mammalian metabolism. CMBA was found to be severely irritant to eyes, where it is predominantly formed, at least in the rat, but it did not cause tyrosinaemia and showed to be less toxic than the parent compound. An ADI of 0.2 mg/kg bw/day was set for the metabolite and no relevance was attributed when found in groundwater, even above the threshold value of 0.1 mu g/L.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of sulcotrione was 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure (AOEL) was 0.0006 mg/kg bw/day and no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 0.1 % for the concentrate formulation and 0.5 % for the in-use spray dilution, based on an in vitro dermal penetration study through human epidermis. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation Mikado, at a maximum dose rate of 0.45kg sulcotrione/ha exceeded the AOEL according to the UK POEM, even when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was considered; according to the German model, estimated exposure was below the AOEL if PPE as gloves during mixing/loading and application, and coverall and sturdy footwear during application were worn. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with sulcotrione was below the AOEL, even when no PPE was considered. Bystander's exposure was low compared to the AOEL value.        The metabolism of sulcotrione in maize was investigated after post emergence application reflecting the representative use supported by the applicant. The metabolic degradation of sulcotrione is essentially focused to the cyclohexanedione ring and the formation of CMBA. CMBA was the only significant metabolite formed and only occurs at significant levels in the forage. The meeting of experts PRAPeR 45 agreed that it should be included in the residue definition for risk assessment. However, the animal metabolism study where CMBA was dosed showed that no significant residues will occur. Therefore the risk assessment would not have changed except that the ADI has been lowered. Revised TMDI calculations showed intakes at 31 % of the ADI. As CMBA is a significant but non relevant metabolite in ground water at a level above 0.75 p.g/L a consumer risk assessment is required. The risk assessment for CMBA gives a highest intake of <0.2 % of the ADI for CMBA. An acute risk assessment was not necessary as no ARM has been set.        In soil under aerobic conditions sulcotrione exhibits moderate to medium persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 2.5-73.8 % applied radioactivity (AR) after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting up to 26.5 % AR after 120 days. The major metabolite CMBA was detected in soil at maximum level of 60% AR. Sulcotrione and CMBA exhibit very high mobility in soil. Adsorption of sulcotrione is not only determined by the organic carbon content of the soil but at least also by the pH value, which itself correlated to the organic carbon content. There was no evidence of a correlation of adsorption with soil pH. In dark natural sediment water systems sulcotrione degraded exhibiting moderate persistence in the whole system forming the metabolite CMBA (max. 42.2% AR in water and max. 18.6% AR in sediment). The final products of degradation in water-sediment systems were carbon dioxide and bound residues (max 6 and 9% AR after 100 days). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for sulcotrione at steps 1-3. For the metabolite CMBA appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by sulcotrione above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low for geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. CMBA concentrations (80th percentile annual average concentration at 1 m) are in the range of 0.015 1.462 mu g/L. The concentration of 0.1 mu g/L is exceeded in 6 out of 8 European FOCUS scenarios parameterised for maize and for Hamburg and Okehampton scenarios the estimated PECgw are > 0.75 mu g/L. The toxicological assessment was able to conclude that CMBA is not relevant regarding groundwater at the expected concentrations.        As the fate and behaviour of sulcotrione in the environment was investigated using phenyl-labelled sulcotrione only, the peer review process identified a data gap for an aerobic soil degradation study and for a water-sediment study performed with cyclohexanedione-labelled sulcotrione or for evidence to demonstrate that potential metabolites containing the cyclohexanedione ring are labile. Sulcotrione is not expected to be transferred to the atmospheric compartment and potential for long range transport may be considered negligible.        The first tier acute and short-term TERs for birds and the acute TERs for mammals were above the Annex VI trigger of 10. The first-tier long-term TERs were below the trigger of 5 indicating a potential high long-term risk. The refined risk assessment for medium herbivorous birds resulted in TERs >5 based on residue decline. The experts rejected the suggested PT refinements for insectivorous birds since they were not sufficiently supported by data. A data gap was identified in the expert meeting for the applicant to provide a new refined long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds. A new study was submitted by the applicant and a refined risk assessment based on this study was included by the RMS in the not peer-reviewed addendum 3 from May 2008. The long-term risk to mammals was refined by using residue decline data and the new (higher) long-term endpoint agreed in the experts meeting. Based on the agreed refinements (without PT refinement) the long-term TERs were above the trigger of 5 indicating a low long-term risk to mammals. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water and the risk from the major plant metabolite CMBA to birds and mammals were assessed as low.        Sulcotrione is of low acute toxicity to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The lowest endpoint was observed for aquatic plants. The TERs for all groups of aquatic organisms were greater than the Annex VI triggers of 100 and 10 except for Lemna gibba. One (R4 stream) out of seven FOCUS step 3 scenarios resulted in a TER <10 for Lemna gibba. Risk mitigation measures are required under environmental conditions represented by scenario R4. The metabolite CMBA is of low toxicity to aquatic organisms including Lemna gibba. The Annex VI triggers were exceeded with FOCUS step2 PECsw values.        The risk to the standard non-target arthropod indicator species Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri was assessed as low. Additional species were tested and no effects of >50% were observed in tests with Poecilus cupreus and Aleochara bilineata. Effects of >50% were observed in tests with Coccinella septempunctata and Pardosa sp at the suggested application rate of 450g sulcotrione/ha. The risk to C. septempunctata was assessed as low in higher tier (extended laboratory) studies. Several extended laboratory studies were conducted with Pardosa sp. After 42 days of ageing the residues still led to a statistically significantly increased mortality. No increased mortality was observed after 56 days of ageing of residues. Although the effects were <50% it is uncertain if recolonisation would occur in a real field situation due to the long persistence of effects. No further information was made available to demonstrate recovery/recolonisation of spiders in the in-field area. The LR50 for Pardosa sp. was calculated as 10.34g a.s./ha which is below the calculated off-field exposure rate of 12.47g a.s./ha indicating a potential high risk for spiders in the off-field area. It was agreed by the experts that risk mitigation measures comparable to a 5m in-field no-spray buffer zone should be applied to ensure that recolonisation of the in-field area is possible from unaffected off field areas. A potential high risk was identified for non-target plants in the off-field area. Risk mitigation measures comparable to a no-spray buffer zone of 10m is recommended. The risk to bees, earthworms, soil non-target macro- and micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low for the representative use in maize.

In other cases, the membrane itself is the major site of action for AAMPs as in the case of cyclotides, which permeabilize membranes via pore formation, and human Œ≤-defensins, which induce the disintegration of membranes via carpet-type mechanisms prior to action against intracellular targets.

Several studies demonstrate that these pollutants may interfere with chemoreception of aquatic animals. Many aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates depend on chemical senses for their survival and reproduction. In fish and crustaceans, olfactory and taste receptors are exposed directly to the pollutants and their function can be disturbed. This can result in behavioral changes or lack of proper behaviors. Anthropogenic compounds can have detrimental effects on reproduction and survival of aquatic organisms. Relatively little is known about the effects of pollutants on crustacean chemoreception and behavior, but studies on fish might help elucidate the problems faced by crustaceans. This chapter gives examples of pollutant effects on pheromone detection in fish in connection with reproductive behavior, shoaling and dominance interactions, fright responses and effects on detection of food odors and foraging. Results from crustacean studies are compared to the examples given from fish studies. Various studies have shown that pesticides of different kinds affect the function of fish olfactory receptor cells. Crustaceans may face similar problems with less sensitive chemo-receptor cells. This will be especially problematic with compounds designed to combat insects and arthropods that are closely related to crustaceans. Many insecticides have direct effects on the nervous system and this will disturb chemoreception and behavior. Heavy metal ions are also problematic as they can be transported by chemosensory neurons into the brain and affect its normal functions. Crustaceans play important roles in aquatic ecosystems as well as in human food industry. Therefore, it is urgent to increase the knowledge about the effects of pollutants on crustacean chemoreception and behavior, especially compounds with direct effects on the nervous system that will affect the normal behavior and signal perception, disturbing social communication and reproduction. Such effects are serious for an individual as its growth and ability to compete and reproduce will be suppressed. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

The manipulation was carried out during 2004-2006, with a main effort to remove large cannibal pike (>65 cm), and the cascading impacts on the major fish community were evaluated. The main fish species in Lake √Örungen are roach (Rutilus rutilus), perch (Perca fluviatilis), pike, and rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) with some additional fish species in low numbers. The main assumptions behind the removal of large pike were to obtain (i) increased number of small pike and large perch due to reduced cannibalism and predation pressure; (ii) reduced abundance of roach and small perch due to increased number of piscivores, i.e., small pike and large perch, and (iii) reduced levels of pollutants in the remaining fish community by increased growth rates and changes in diet. The recruitment success of pike after removal of large pike was evaluated by the Petersen mark-recapture method. The habitat utilization of the major fish species was studied based on gillnet catch data. The trophic position of different fish species was determined based on both gut content analyses and analyses of stable isotopes of nitrogen ( 15N/14N=Œ¥15N) and carbon ( 13C/12C=Œ¥13C). Important biological factors influencing the dynamics of mercury and organic pollutants through the fish community in the lake were identified as well. The estimated numbers of small pike (45-64.9 cm, mostly age class 3+) significantly increased in 2005-2006, after the experimental removal of the large pike in 2004 and 2005, and thus assumed to be a cannibal-driven response. The dominant prey fish of pike was roach, both in terms of numbers and biomass. The relative abundance of piscivores increased and as a consequence the relative abundance of small roach declined in 2005-2006. A marked shift in habitat utilization of roach and perch was recorded after the manipulation of the pike population. The gut content analysis was in agreement with the food web analysis based on the stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon in 2005-2006. Pike (exclusively piscivores) and perch (feeding mainly on zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish) occupied the top trophic positions in Lake √Örungen, with pike at the highest position. Roach and rudd occupied lower trophic positions, with rudd at the lowest. Although there was segregation in diet between roach and perch, the increased importance of zooplankton in their diet during the summer 2006 may indicate an increased abundance of zooplankton. Mercury content in fish muscle increased with size and weight (bioaccumulation), as well as with an increased position in the food web (biomagnification), with pike having the highest concentrations. Growth rate of pike in age classes 1-3 increased in 2005, probably due to the lower predation risk, and thereby a more extensive use of the most favorable pike habitats. The faster growth rate might have played a role for a significant decrease in total mercury concentrations, probably as a result of growth biodilution (~50% reduction between same size groups of pike). None of the fish analyzed in 2005 had a mercury concentration which would have exceeded the FAO/WHO provisional tolerable weekly intake value (1.6 Œºg kg-1), whereas the mercury concentration in only four analyzed pike in 2003 would have exceeded the recommended limit. The metabolite pp'DDT formed the main part (88%) of the total concentrations of the DDTs (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) in fish liver. Both Œ£DDT and Œ£PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls) were significantly higher in pike compared to perch and roach, whereas HCB (hexachlorobenzene) and HCE (heptachlor epoxide) were detected mainly in pike. In pike, males had significantly higher concentrations of all organochlorine compounds compared to females. Such a sex-dependent differentiation in the concentrations of organochlorine compounds may be attributed to physiological differences, for example, a higher elimination of the lipophilic pollutants in roe during spawning by female pike and higher growth rate of female pike. The lower levels of organochlorines in pike and perch in 2005 compared to analyses performed in 2004 might be an effect of the biomanipulation of Lake √Örungen as well. Therefore, selective exploitation of a large top predator fish, e.g., large pike, may serve as a tool to reduce the concentrations of mercury and organochlorine compounds in the remaining fish community. To obtain a sustained positive effect both on the trophic status of the lake and on the pollutant levels in the fishes, as obtained by the manipulation of the large pike in 2004-2006, a high fishing pressure on the large pike has to be persistent and carried out annually. ¬© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: C.M.

Biogenic amine transporters regulate neurotransmission by removing neurotransmitters from synapses and extracellular fluid. Despite evolutionary divergence, teleost fish and mammalian transporter proteins appear similar, particularly at active binding sites. However, it is not clear if the similarities extend to functional responses, reuptake-inhibiting drugs, or involvement in delayed neurotoxic responses to pesticide exposures. Under certain exposure conditions, alterations in expression and function of these transporters may be more sensitive biomarkers of pesticide exposure or neurodegenerative disease risk than acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavioral assays targeting associative responses such as anxiety are useful as pharmacological and toxicological screens, or for studying modulation of behavior by central neurotransmitter systems. In novel environments, zebrafish go to tank bottoms and dark backgrounds, a stereotypical behavior (attributed to predator anxiety) forming the basis of the novel light/dark aquatic plus maze characterized in this chapter. Such behavioral paradigms are an essential component to establish zebrafish as pharmacological and toxicological research models. Herein adult zebrafish are exposed to reuptake inhibitors and representative organochloride, organophosphate, or pyrethroid pesticides at 1 Œºg day-1 for 21 days, tested for anxious response in the light/dark plus maze, then assayed for dopamine and serotonin transporter density by radioligand binding. Exposures to these compounds variably affect dopamine and serotonin transporter density and alter behavior in the maze as compared to controls. ¬© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4,10.1007/978-1-60761-922-2_8,acetylcholinesterase inhibition;amine transporters;DAT;Dopamine;expression regulation;light-dark plus-maze;mammalian homology;monoamine systems;norepinephrine;Parkinson's disease;pesticide;serotonin;SERT;toxicology;transporter mechanisms;Danio rerio;Mammalia;Teleostei;acetylcholinesterase;chlorpyrifos;dieldrin;dopamine transporter;dopamine uptake inhibitor;permethrin;serotonin transporter;serotonin uptake inhibitor;sertraline;vanoxerine;animal behavior;animal experiment;animal tissue;anxiety;controlled study;drug exposure;environment;female;male;maze test;neurotoxicity;nonhuman;priority journal;review;zebra fish;Pesticides;Amines;Amination,NA,NA,zebrafish biogenic amine transporters and behavior in novel environments targets of reuptake inhibitors and pesticide action as tools for neurotoxicology research

An adaptive response was probably produced since at day 15 no modifications in the CAT activity and increased GR activity were observed. In addition, a decrease in MDA content with the highest concentration of carbofuran used was found after 30 days of exposure.

Changes in the functional balance of neurotransmitters have been implicated in the failure of central nervous system function. In addition, abnormalities in neurotransmitter production or functioning can be induced by several toxicological compounds, many of which are found in the environment. The zebrafish has been increasingly used as an animal model for biomedical research, primarily due to its genetic tractability and ease of maintenance. These features make this species a versatile tool for pre-clinical drug discovery and toxicological investigations. Here, we present a review regarding the role of different excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems in zebrafish, such as dopaminergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic, purinergic, histaminergic, nitrergic, glutamatergic, glycinergic, and GABAergic systems, and emphasizing their features as pharmacological and toxicological targets. The increase in the global knowledge of neurotransmitter systems in zebrafish and the elucidation of their pharmacological and toxicological aspects may lead to new strategies and appropriate research priorities to offer insights for biomedical and environmental research. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 164; Correspondence Address: C.D.

It serves as an example of how regulations, developed to protect people and the environment from long-term effects of pesticides, are applied in practice. The risk assessment process for noncancer endpoints involves four steps--hazard identification, dose-response assessments, exposure estimates, and risk characterization. In the dose-response analysis, the lowest dose that does not cause an effect (NOEL) is identified for all endosulfan exposure durations. In the process of pesticide registration, studies submitted by the registrant are required under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) guidelines. DPR is required to rely on FIFRA guideline studies for pesticide toxicity evaluations; however, these studies are rarely published in the open literature and subsequently are not available to the public. An advantage to FIFRA guideline studies is that they provide essential details that are often lacking in open literature studies. There is ample evidence that endosulfan can be acutely poisonous to humans through accidental and intentional exposure as documented in California. Endosulfan is highly toxic to wildlife such as fish, which are killed as a result of endosulfan discharge into rivers, as well as application to wetlands at recommended rates. Endosulfan has been considered by some to be a persistent organic pollutant throughout the world because it has been detected in Europe in lakes in the Alps, Pyrenees, and Caledonian Mountains. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The studies in the last two decades of the 19th century and in the early 1900s focussed on the germicidal action of soaps, which had been used for cleaning by mankind for thousands of years. The first study indicating that soaps are toxic to bacteria was published in 1881 by Robert Koch who observed an inhibiting effect of potassium soap on the growth of anthrax bacilli. His work was followed by a number of studies on the germicidal action of different commercial soaps under a variety of conditions to determine their potential as general disinfectants. The results of these studies were somewhat conflicting, but cholera and diphtheria bacilli were found to be easily killed by most soaps, whereas typhoid bacilli and particularly coli bacteria and staphylococci were resistant. The conflicting results were thought to be caused by a difference in the composition of the commercial soaps used by the various investigators. After 1910, the studies therefore focussed on purified fatty acids and their potassium and sodium salts, i.e. the main components of commercial soaps, in the hope to determine whether or not a soap could be used as a disinfectant for a certain bacterium. These studies confirmed that free alkali were not the active ingredients in soaps but rather the neutral salts of fatty acids. The studies also showed that lipids and proteins, such as serum albumin, inhibited the germicidal action of soaps. This was of practical importance, for example for disinfection of bacteria in bodily fluids. In later studies, mostly after 1930, the diverse actions of fatty acids and their alkali salts were emphasized. These actions ranged from stimulation or inhibition of bacterial growth, depending on the bacterium and the concentration of fatty acids, to killing of the bacterium. Inhibition of sporulation of aerobic bacteria or spore germination of anaerobic bacteria was also observed. The difference between bacteriostatic and bactericidal actions was emphasized and a number of studies were carried out in the period from 1911 to the late 1940s to determine the nature of bacterial killing by fatty acids and soaps. In a number of studies, beginning as early as 1905, lipid extracts from leukocytes and lymphoid tissues, and particularly from inflammatory foci, were found to be bactericidal, suggesting a possible role of lipids in host defense against bacteria and in recovery from infection. This led to studies of a possible application for bactericidal fatty acids and their salts in cleaning of infected wounds and for use in wet dressings for wounds and abscesses. In the 1920s and 1930s there was a considerable interest in the therapeutic treatment of chaulmoogra oil for leprosy and of unsaturated fatty acids from cod liver oil for tuberculosis. With the advent of antibiotics in the 1940s and 1950s the interest in fatty acids and other lipids as antibacterial agents decreased greatly, at least temporarily, whereas there was a new interest in their effect on viruses in the 1960s. ¬© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Treatment was continued for 14. days, and at the end of this period, blood and tissue (liver, kidney, and gill) samples were collected. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were determined in blood and tissues for measurement of oxidant-antioxidant status. A significant elevation in the level of MDA, as an index of lipid peroxidation, and reductions in antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px) and low molecular weight antioxidant (GSH) levels were observed in DM-exposed fish. Treatment with lycopene attenuated the DM-induced oxidative stress by significantly decreasing the levels of MDA. In addition, lycopene significantly increased the SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities and the level of GSH.

Box 90 - STN, Canada","According to the FAO, the intensification of the livestock sector contributes to climate change, air pollution, soil and water degradation, and biodiversity depletion. The agricultural sector dependency on fossil fuels and energy intensive fertilizers contributes to the decrease of fuel reserves and additional anthropogenic GHG emissions. These environmental and energy concerns are leading to a renewed interest in environmental biotechnologies that can produce renewable energy, minimize environmental impact and add value to livestock operations' by-products. This paper describes the potential contribution of on-farm biogas production in reducing GHG emissions from livestock operation, either via the production of renewable energy to substitute fossil fuel, via the reduction of fugitive GHG emissions from stored manure and land-applied manures and via the reduction in chemical fertilizer needs for forages and cash crop productions. This paper describes the potential contribution of on-farm biogas production in reducing GHG emissions from livestock operation, either via the production of renewable energy to substitute fossil fuel, via the reduction of fugitive GHG emissions from stored manure and land-applied manures and via the reduction in chemical fertilizer needs for forages and cash crop productions. Anaerobic digestion biotechnologies produce biogas at average rates of 0.3, 0.25 and 0.48 L g-1 VS from swine, bovine and poultry slurries respectively. The biogas produced is of high quality with a methane concentration ranging between 60 and 80%. AD treatments can be an acceptable solution to the management of phosphorous surplus by precipitating up to 25% of the phosphorous in batch or semi-batch operated bioreactors and by additionally precipitating and concentrating up to 70% of the bioreactor effluent's phosphorous at the bottom of the long term storage. These effluents are more balanced to meet the crop needs thus reducing the need for supplementary chemical nitrogen fertilizers. Both the recovery of green energy and the reduced needs for chemical fertilizers will substantially decrease the carbon footprint of livestock food products. On-farm biogas production contributes to achieve more sustainable livestock operations by substantially reducing other environmental impacts related to manure management. It reduces the risk of water pollution associated with animal manure slurries (eutrophication) by removing 80 to 90% of the soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD). In addition, some AD processes are effective in eliminating populations of zoonotic pathogens and parasites present in livestock manures. AD also improves cohabitation in rural regions by reducing odour emissions by 70 to 95%. The reduction in odour allows more frequent and better timing for land applications of manure. Both the timing of application and the improve nutrients balance have the potential to improve nutrients uptake by the crops and minimize nutrient loss to the environment.

Box 90, Lennoxville STN, Canada"", ""Faculty of Agriculture and Agri-Food Sciences, Department of animal sciences, Universit√© Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada""]","Over the last three decades, the potential role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on health and disease has been a worldwide center of attention. In the western typical diet, the omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio is at least 10 to 1, likely due to the high prevalence of vegetable oils (such as soybean oil, corn oil and sunflower oil) rich in omega-6 fatty acid. Since excessive amounts of omega-6 fatty acids contribute to rising incidence of many chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and whereas increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake cause a protective effect, a more balanced omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio is recommended (omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio between 1 to 1 and 3 to 1). A good natural source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid is seafood and particularly fish oil. Fish and marine products contain two major omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids - eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaemoic acid (DHA) - both of which appear to be beneficial for cardiovascular prevention, immune function, inflammatory response, infant development and mental health. Fish oils may also improve female fertility (ovulatory processes, premature birth and lactation). Although there is a large amount of information available on fish oil, omega-3 fatty acid supplement and their pleiotropic beneficial effects on global health, it is sometimes misleading and not always support by scientific findings, in particular in the case of male reproductive health. Therefore, this review considers the role played by fish oils supplement in male fertility, with large references to human and various animal models (pig, horse, cattle, fowl, rabbit and sheep). Many of the male fertility problems can be related to oligospermia (a low sperm count) or a poor sperm quality (cell with abnormal shape or low motility). In the management of male fertility, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids like others nutrients (vitamins, minerals, zinc, etc.) play a key role in reproductive health. Sperm cells require highly polyunsaturated fatty acids, in particular a high proportion of DHA to provide optimal cell membrane fluidity essential to sperm motility and fertilization success (acrosomal reaction and oocyte penetration). Some studies have suggested that subfertility could be related to the low DHA sperm content. As reported in human, in pig, and several others animal models, fish oil diet can alter significantly sperm fatty acid composition by increasing DHA and EPA content and modify omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio. Some studies have underlined the potential benefit of fish oil supplement on sperm count. However this effect is more controversial since a diet rich in energy or in proteins also increase sperm production. In fact, dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can affect male fertility directly by modifying sperm membrane composition but also indirectly through various mechanisms: prostaglandin synthesis, steroid metabolism and gene expression. In parallel to the benefit of consuming fish oil is the concern about potential harmful effects on male reproductive health. Because of his high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, sperm cells have a strong oxidative potential. In normal conditions, there is a balance between the generation of oxidants and antioxidant defense mechanisms. Dietary fish oil can induce an additional oxidative stress to the cell which is detrimental for sperm membrane fluidity and DNA integrity. In fact, it is suggested that any fish oil supplementation should be accompanied by antioxidants like vitamins E and C.There is also evidence that adding omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid to the diet can influence prostaglandin synthesis which could have an effect on testosterone secretion. Because chemicals such as PCB, pesticides, and sex hormones are fat-soluble, fish and fish oil can also be a dietary source of contaminants that may have deleterious effect on male reproduction. In conclusion, dietary fish oil may help to improve male fertility by increasing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in sperm cells and would be most beneficial with sperm of initial poor quality. However, a particular attention must be taken in regard to antioxidant supplementation. ¬© 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

After normalizing the data to reduce or eliminate the influence of varying illuminance, stepwise forward variable selection was employed to select the proper band sets and fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed to discriminate crop and weeds. For the case of considering each species as a different class, classification accuracy reached 85% with eight selected bands while for the case of considering overall weed species as a class, classification accuracy was higher than 91% with seven selected bands. In order to develop a low-cost device and system in future, all combinations of two and three bands were evaluated to find the best combinations. The result showed that the best three bands can achieve a performance of 89% comparable to the performance achieved by five bands selected using stepwise selection.

Objectives: To assess the current serum concentrations of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis. p-chlorophenylethylene p,p'-DDE, the main DDT breakdown product, and of PCBs in women from two French administrative areas Ille-et-Vilaine and C√îte dOr. To identify determinants of the current serum levels among individual characteristics related to intake, metabolism, and excretion of organochlorines. Methods: We measured serum p,p'-DDE and PCB levels in 1055 general population women who were recruited in 2005-2007 to serve as controls in a case-control study on breast cancer. Associations between organochlorine levels and age, current body mass index BMI, BMI change during the last 10 years, dietary habits, breastfeeding history, residence area and education were assessed in multivariate analyses. Results: Median concentrations of p,p'-DDE and total PCBs were 85 and 240. ng/g lipid, respectively. Based on multivariate analyses, the main predictors of high p,p'-DDE levels included age and frequent consumption of saltwater fish in women below 50 years, and high BMI in older women. Total PCB levels increased markedly with age. Among older women, other important predictors of high PCB levels included frequent consumption of saltwater fish and low BMI. Our results are also suggestive of an inverse association between PCB levels and BMI gain during the last ten years. Women in C√îte d Or had significantly higher PCB levels than women in Ille-et-Vilaine. Conclusion: The patterns of associations between determinants and serum organochlorine concentrations suggest that human PCB contamination is still ongoing in France.

A series of focus groups comprised of gardeners, fishers, hunters, and boaters was convened in Oregon, USA. Findings indicate six belief barriers to changing leisure behaviors. These are the attitudes that: (1) behaviors, such as using pesticides, may be worse for the environment than invasive species; and (2) the fight against invasive species is a losing battle. Also, the norm beliefs that: (3) invasive species management is a low priority for many institutions; and (4) the general public does not know and does not care about invasive species. Finally, the behavioral control beliefs that: (5) one does not know enough about invasive species preventive behaviors to be effective; and (6) recommended preventive behaviors are too difficult to perform. Understanding the beliefs that inhibit behavior changes can help inform the creation of effective campaigns to engage stakeholders in finding solutions to halt the spread of invasive species, as well as provide a foundation on which to build additional research.

However, the sustainability of such agricultural systems driven by the high external inputs is now being questioned in terms of their sustainability. It is now understood that strategic objectives for agricultural development of a country, especially a developing economy, are to sustain the increases in agricultural production and productivity through an ecosystem approach. Sustainability mainly relates to the efficient and effective use of natural resources, which has become a mandatory for governments, donors, practitioners, and a generalized concern in international spheres during the past three decades.A sustainable agriculture system will incorporate novel technologies or practices that will improve farmer productivity without major negative impacts on the environment and have a positive effect on natural, social, and human capital. In the Sri Lankan context, the development strategy maintained immediately after independence focused on import substitution industries and development of the agriculture sector. Achieving selfsufficiency in rice production has been considered the priority of successive governments during the past six decades to ensure food security, generate employment, and eliminate poverty. The agro-ecosystems of the country, which include crop cultivation, animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry, collectively provide almost all the food and other needs of the inhabitants. As a result of disintegration owing to structural, technological, and institutional, changes brought about by modem development, the village agroecosystem has become de-stabilized. This has led to over-dependence on external inputs and hence, self-sustainability of the village agro-ecosystem has ceased to exist except in some remote areas. Social, economic, and environmental sustainability are the three pillars of the sustainability framework for agriculture and food production. The current high-input-oriented conventional practice of agriculture lacks principles of sustenance where the nutrient balances have become negative for many systems, more marginal lands being cultivated, communal grazing lands have diminished, livestock become more dependent on crop land forages, etc. The development of new and innovative management strategies is thus a need to harness the maximum benefits of integrated systems. In this regard, the organic methods of food production, while significantly contributing to maintain the equilibrium in the ecosystems, can contribute substantially to feed the current and future human population on the current agricultural land base. Strategic mechanism to promote sustainability management of agricultural systems is required at all levels, with a cognizance from deep-rooted customs and traditions and the time-tested agricultural practices. Development of self-confidence, self-motivation, and empowerment of the farming community would overcome the over-dependence on external suppliers and supplies and would sustain the agricultural development of the country. A new development strategy encouraging pro-poor investments is hence a requirement by review of policies, understanding the suitability and availability of land resources, investing in research, and producing integrated development plans, in order to increase the productivity and profitability of environmentally sustainable practices. ¬© 2012 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Pollutants in water and sediments include heavy metals, aromatic hydrocarbons, and organochlorine pesticides. Activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as Na +/K +-adenosine triphosphatase (Na +/K +-ATPase) activity, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were evaluated in the livers of the fish Goodea atripinnis after 96 h of exposure to water collected in March and June 2005 from three sites: Y (limnetic zone), L (Lerma tributary), and C (la Cinta tributary). Physical and chemical parameters of the lake water were also analyzed. Increases in CAT activity and LPO levels at all three sites were detected compared with control fish (P < 0.05), while GPx and SOD activities decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Na +/K +-ATPase activities were similar to the control in fish exposed to limnetic water from both March and June but were higher than control at the two tributary sites in March (P < 0.05); fish exposed to water from the Lerma tributary in June exhibited lower Na +/K +-ATPase than the control (P < 0.05). During March, CAT and Na +/K +-ATPase activities were increasing more than in June in Y and L, respectively, while in June, SOD and GPx were depleted more than March in L and Y and L, respectively. Despite the antioxidant defenses of the fish liver, exposure to all water samples from Lake Yuriria exerted alterations in hepatic LPO levels, antioxidant enzymes, and Na +/K +-ATPase activities that could substantially impair the mechanisms of fish defenses against oxidative stress. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 46; Correspondence Address: L.

rayyan-1227193650,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance epoxiconazole,2008,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Epoxiconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on epoxiconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 28 April 2005. The peer review was initiated on 7 October 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF as identified by the rapporteur Member State. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in July - September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007 (in all sections) and in May 2007 (only ecotox).        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place in a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on cereals and sugar beet. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Opus"", a suspension concentrate (SC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of epoxiconazole.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. It has been identified that more information is necessary to enable the impact of potential different isomer ratios on the risk assessments to be better characterised        Mammalian toxicology of epoxiconazole was assessed in a row of tests. Epoxiconazole is absorbed rapidly but only to a limited extent (about 50%) after oral administration in rats. It is widely distributed in the body and although epoxiconazole has no potential for accumulation its elimination is slow. The substance is mainly excreted via faeces (about 78%) and urine (about 17%). Metabolism is rapid and extensive. At least 47 different metabolites have been identified in the rat. The active substance is of low acute toxicity by the oral, dermal and inhalation route. It is neither irritant to the skin nor to the eyes and has no skin sensitising potential.        The liver has been identified as the main target of toxicity in repeated dose tests with rats, mice and dogs. Epoxiconazole does not have genotoxic potential in vitro and in vivo. In a 24-months study in rats liver toxicity was observed and additionally ovary- and adrenal gland tumours were seen. In a 18 month carcinogenicity study in mice a treatment related increase in liver tumours has been observed based on which a classification of epoxiconazole as Xn; Care. Cat. 3 R40 ""Harmful; Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" was proposed. Based on the effects on reproduction seen in a two generation study in rats (dystocia, impaired fertility, prolonged gestation and vaginal haemorrhages) it was concluded to propose a classification with Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R62 ""Harmful; Possible risk of impaired fertility"". Based on developmental effects such as increases in number of resorptions, skeletal variations and malformations observed in relevant studies in rats and rabbits also a classification with Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R 63 ""Harmful; Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. Results from new in vitro studies and a new developmental study in rats confirm that epoxiconazole has endocrine disrupting properties but do not merit changing relevant NOAELs or revising the proposed classification according to an evaluation by the rapporteur Member State.        However, these new data have not been peer reviewed.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.008 mg/kg bw/d derived from an 18-month carcinogenicity study in mice applying a safety factor of 100. An acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.023 mg/kg bw has been derived based on the effects observed in two generation reproduction study in rats applying a safety factor of 100. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) of 0.008 mg/kg bw/d was derived from a subchronic dog study applying a safety factor of 100. In consideration of a dermal absorption of 50% both for the concentrate and the diluted preparation (the default value agreed upon by the majority of experts at PRAPeR 19, March 2007) the exposure estimates for operators were 39% and 700% of the AOEL when wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) with the German model and the UK POEM respectively. When no PPE is worn the values rise to 991% and 4918% respectively. Exposures for re-entry workers were amounted to 55.8% (without PPE) and 2.8% (with PPE) of the systemic AOEL respectively. Exposure of bystanders was estimated to amount to 3.75% of the systemic AOEL.        The metabolism of epoxiconazole in plants after foliar application is limited. Accordingly the proposed residue definition for monitoring is restricted to the parent compound. Indications are present that the accumulation of triazole metabolites in cereal grains is limited but due to some inadequacies in the design of the wheat metabolism study a firm conclusion on this is not possible.        A sufficient amount of supervised residue trials are available and MRL can be proposed covering the representative uses in cereals and sugar beets in both Northern and Southern European regions. The nature of the residue is not altered by processing. Processing data show that residues are preferably transferred to the bran fraction during the milling process and that no residue above the limit of quantification (LOQ) is expected to be present in beer from the brewing process.        Uptake of soil residues by rotational crops is not expected to lead to epoxiconazole residues above the LOQ. In contrast, a significant uptake of triazole metabolites (triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid) has been demonstrated at least for cereals.        Feed commodities from cereals and sugar beets may represent a significant source of exposure to epoxiconazole residues for animals Livestock metabolism studies in lactating goats and laying hens are available and based on the metabolic pattern in animal tissues the residue definition for monitoring can be restricted to the parent compound. Feeding studies in dairy cows are available and appropriate MRLs for animal products can be proposed.        For the time being the residue definition in plant and animal products for risk assessment is restricted to the parent compound. Inclusion of triazole derivative metabolites in this definition will need to be considered at a later stage.        These compounds (mainly triazole, triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid) which are common metabolites of all triazole fungicides have been recognized as hazards given their impact on reproduction. Toxicological reference values have been agreed by the PRAPeR expert meeting 14 on toxicology in January 2007.        Chronic and acute consumer exposures assessments have been carried out for parent compound only and were found to be well below the respective toxicological trigger values of epoxiconazole. Therefore provisionally no risk for the consumer has been identified under restriction of an uncertainty related to the isomer ratio consumer is actually exposed to. A robust conclusion on the risk will be possible when information on the actual level of triazole derivative metabolites in primary crops, rotational crops, and products of animal origin will be available. It must be noted that this lack of data is a generic issue and concerns all active substances of the triazole chemical class when their degradation pathway in primary crops, soil and livestock involves a cleavage of the triazole ring.        Sufficient data were available to demonstrate that in soil epoxiconazole exhibits medium to very high persistence. The available laboratory studies did not identify any major (> 10% AR) soil metabolites. One metabolite appearing in minor (max. 6.6% AR after 175 days) amounts is 1,2,4-triazole. Other possible degradation products after separation of the aromatic rings are simple monohalogenated acids. Metabolite 1,2,4-triazole is rapidly degraded by soil micro-organisms and it has low persistence, with a reported laboratory mean half-life of 8 days. In anaerobic soils, the first step in degradation is cleavage of the oxirane ring resulting in the formation of the alcohol, which is readilydehydrated to the alkene BF 480 entriazole (max. 8.6% AR after 120 days). Epoxiconazole is quite stable at soil surfaces under the influence of light.        Epoxiconazole is slightly to moderately adsorbed to soil and the leaching potential is low. Lysimeter studies were not triggered and FOCUS PEC groundwater calculations revealed no risk for groundwater contamination for the active substance or 1,2,4-triazole. A plateau concentration in soil of 0.167 mg/kg for epoxiconazole was calculated based on field accumulation studies.        Epoxiconazole and 1,2,4-triazole are hydrolytically stable at pH 5, 7 and 9. They are also stable under the influence of light in aqueous buffer solutions. However, in a sensitized photolysis study with natural water, epoxiconazole degraded with a half life of 52 days.        After a rapid sorption of the parent compound to the sediment, the predominant metabolite in both investigated water/sediment systems was BF 480-entriazole, being almost exclusively detected in the sediment phase (max. 32.3% AR after 59 days). Once in the sediment, BF 480-entriazole degrades with first order DT50 of 32-65 days. Besides CO2, no further degradation products of epoxiconazole were detected in significant amounts in both test systems during the incubation period. The calculated first order half lives of epoxiconazole for the total systems were 68 and 172 days. Some uncertainties were found in the assessment of the accumulation potential of BF 480-entriazole in sediment.        The volatilization experiments showed that epoxiconazole exhibits a very low average volatilization rate from plant and soil surfaces. It is not a relevant pathway for dissipation. If it however reached the troposphere it would be degraded with a half life of 4 days indicating a potential for long range atmospheric transport. After the experts' meeting the rapporteur Member State re-estimated a half-life of 1.83 days, but the calculation is not peer reviewed.        The first tier TER values indicated a potential high long-term risk to birds and mammals Measured residues were accepted in the expert meeting to refine the RUD values for herbivorous birds and mammals and to set the multiple application factor (MAF) to 1 provided that the residue studies were conducted with an application interval equal or lower than the interval of 21 days as suggested GAP. Whether it is sufficiently justified to use a MAF of 1 although intervals between applications were above 21 days for about half of the residues studies needs to be evaluated further at Member State level. The DT50 refinement for residue decline in plants was also discussed and it is suggested to use the geometric mean value of 14.5 days based on the available residue data. The suggested refinements of PT and PD used in the long-term risk assessment for birds were not sufficiently supported by data and therefore rejected in the meeting of experts. A data gap was identified for further refinement of the long-term risk assessment for birds.        The hare (Lepus europaeus), common vole (Microtus arvalis) and wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) were chosen as focal species to refine the long-term risk assessment for herbivorous mammals. The experts agreed to use the hare and the wood mouse as focal species in the refined risk assessment as suggested in addendum 2. The proposed PT value of 0.3 for hare was not accepted by the meeting since it was not based on radio-tracking data. It was considered not appropriate to derive an exact PT value from the submitted information. However the TER is >5 even without PT refinement and hence the risk to medium herbivorous mammals is considered as low. The suggested PT refinement for wood mouse was not agreed. The experts concluded that the submitted information is not sufficient to derive a robust quantitative PT refinement. The use of interception factors for residues on arthropods was also rejected. The suggested PD refinement was accepted. The resulting long-term TER of 3.9 is below the trigger of 5 indicating the need for further refinement of the risk assessment. A new long-term risk assessment for wood mouse was submitted by the applicant and assessed by the rapporteur Member State in addendum 4(not peer-reviewed).The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low as well as the risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water.        Algae and Lemna gibba were the most sensitive tested organisms. In order to detect long-term effects on fish a 28 d prolonged toxicity test, an early life stage test and three full life cycle tests were performed in order to investigate potential endocrine effects. A new test with Lemna gibba was perfumed and evaluated in addendum 2. The experts agreed to the assessment of the rapporteur Member State. The endpoint (7d EbC(50) = 0.0043 mg a.s./L) derived from standard test conditions should be used in the risk assessment. The endpoint derived from the test system with sediment present was considered as not being of direct use in the risk assessment since epoxiconazole partitions rapidly to the sediment and thus reducing the exposure of free floating Lemna fronds. The TERs were above the trigger of 10 in only 2 FOCUS step3 part scenarios (D4 pond, D5 pond) out of 9. No full FOCUS step 3 scenario resulted in TERs above the trigger. The available full life cycle studies with fish were discussed in the expert meeting. It was agreed that the latest study where fish were exposed to a single peak of epoxiconazole could be used in the risk assessment. The experts agreed that a NOEC of 0.03 mg a.s./L can be used in the risk assessment. The effect observed on male vitellogenin levels (NOEC = 0.012 mg a.s./L) was considered as not relevant since it did not affect the reproductive performance of the tested animals The long-term TERs for fish were above the trigger of 10 for all 9 FOCUS part scenarios as well as the TERs calculated with time weighted PECsw and the lower long-term endpoint for fish (NOEC of 0.01 mg a.s./L) which was based on effects on growth in one of the fish full life cycle tests conducted under flow-through conditions. Epoxiconazole was of similar toxicity to algae when formulated but was significantly more toxic to fish. The acute TERs for fish were above the trigger of 100 in the FOCUS step3 part scenarios D4 (pond) and D5 (pond). In the part scenario D4 (stream) a TER of 99 was calculated which is close to the trigger of 100. Taking into consideration that part of the active substance reach the surface water via drainage and run-off and thus not as the intact formulation the rapporteur Member State concludes that the acute risk to fish from the formulation BAS 480 13 F to fish is addressed for the full FOCUS scenario D4 (pond and stream). EFSA agrees to the opinion of the rapporteur Member State. The risk of bioaccumulation (BCF = 70) was assessed as low. The metabolites 1,2,4-triazole and BF480-entriazole were less toxic to aquatic organisms and the risk posed to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for the representative uses in cereals. The TERs for sediment dwellers was calculated as 5.3 and 40.3 (depending on the test system from which the endpoint was derived). Overall it is concluded that the aquatic risk assessment needs further refinement and/or risk mitigation such as no-spray buffer zones.        The acute risk of epoxiconazole to earthworms is low but the first tier long term TER values were below the Annex VI trigger of 5. Field studies were conducted to assess the effects of continued use of epoxiconazole on earthworm populations in treated fields and also a terrestrial model ecosystemstudy. The presented studies had some limitations but the long-term risk to earthworms and soil dwelling arthropods was sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated if all the available information is considered together        The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.

We previously reported an antibacterial protein in the skin secretion of the rockfish, Sebastes schlegeli, which showed selective antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. This study aimed to isolate and structurally and functionally characterize this protein. The antibacterial protein, termed SSAP ( S. schlegeli antibacterial protein), was purified to homogeneity by lectin affinity column chromatography, anion-exchange HPLC and hydroxyapatite HPLC. It was found to be a glycoprotein containing N-linked glycochains and FAD. Its molecular mass was estimated to be 120 kDa by gel filtration HPLC and 53 kDa by SDS/PAGE, suggesting that it is a homodimer. On the basis of the partial amino-acid sequence determined, a full-length cDNA of 2037 bp including an ORF of 1662 bp that encodes 554 amino-acid residues was cloned by 3 ' RACE, 5 ' RACE and RT-PCR. A blast search showed that a mature protein (496 residues) is homologous to L-amino acid oxidase (LAO) family proteins. SSAP was determined to have LAO activity by the H2O2-generation assay and substrate specificity for only L-Lys with a K-m of 0.19 mM. It showed potent antibacterial activity against fish pathogens such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida and Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida. The antibacterial activity was completely lost on the addition of catalase, confirming that H2O2 is responsible for the growth inhibition. This study identifies SSAP as a new member of the LAO family and reveals LAO involvement in the innate immunity of fish skin.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  66     Total Times Cited:  73     Cited Reference Count:  39,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2006.05570.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antibacterial protein;innate immunity;L-amino acid oxidase;rockfish Sebastes schlegeli;skin mucus;APOPTOSIS-INDUCING PROTEIN;ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE;RAINBOW-TROUT;PLATELET-AGGREGATION;SNAKE-VENOM;HISTONE H2A;PURIFICATION;FISH;SECRETIONS;GRAMMISTINS,NA,NA,identification of an antibacterial protein as lamino acid oxidase in the skin mucus of rockfish <i>sebastes schlegeli<i>
rayyan-1227193655,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance benfuracarb finalised: 28 July 2006,2006,9,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,9,,EFSA,,English,,,"Benfuracarb is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on benfuracarb in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 2 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 17 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Otsuka Chemical Co., Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 7 March 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises incorporation into soil (pre-plantation) to control soil and foliar insects, where brassica will be grown. Benfuracarb can be used as insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process only the use as insecticide was evaluated. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Oncol 8.6G"", a granule (GR), registered in France and Spain.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food of plant origin and surface water.        Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Benfuracarb is rapidly and nearly completed absorbed reaching in the rat. The main metabolite of benfuracarb is carbofuran (approximately 30%). The acute inhalatory toxicity is high, whereas the oral toxicity moderate. The toxicity via dermal route was low. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant nor a skin sensitizer, proposed risk phrases are: T, R23 ""Toxic by inhalation"" and R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" The critical effects are cholinesterase inhibition. Effects on reproduction parameters were observed such as, decreased male fertility, number of live pups and pup weight was decreased, even the entire second generation was lost The appropriate classification for reproduction toxicity could not be agreed and the question should be forwarded to ECB, R62 is high lighted. ECB has concluded R62 but not voted.        The main metabolite of benfuracarb is the active ingredient carbofuran which is more toxic than benfuracarb. The relevant impurity 1,2 dichloroethane, is classified as toxic, Carcinogenic Category 2 (T; R45).        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100.        The default value of 100% was agreed on for the granular formulation Oncol 8.6 G as no studies were provided. The estimated operator exposure according to the US PHED model is below (86%) the AOEL only if personal protective equipment as well as respiratory equipment is used.        The metabolism, distribution and residue behaviour of benfuracarb was investigated in various crops with different methods of application and at different timings. Based on studies involving a foliar treatment or stem injection a metabolic pathway of benfuracarb in directly treated plants could be established. Currently, benfuracarb, carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran were considered the relevant residues to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. Whether this will be fully applicable to all crops and regardless the mode of application still needs to be confirmed by further data, since the available data on soil applied uses didnt sufficiently identify potentially relevant metabolites for the supported brassica uses. Moreover a need to address residues of carbofuran in succeeding crops following application of benfuracarb was identified.        Based on the currently proposed residue definition, supervised residue trials in cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage indicated that no residues above the respective LOQ are anticipated, however the validity of the results needs to be confirmed by further data. Moreover the residue trial database for brassicas needs to be completed.        With the current knowledge and limited data available and with the provisionally agreed toxicological reference values for carbofuran it is only possible to asses consumer risk preliminary.        Consumer risk has been separately assessed by the rapporteur Member State for benfuracarb residues and for carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran residues. The estimated chronic dietary intake of benfuracarb and its metabolites carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran was found to be below the ADI of benfuracarb and carbofuran, respectively. A potential acute exposure concern noted for adults and toddlers (up to 370% of carbofuran ARfD) consuming head and flowering brassicas, is primarily caused by the limited sensitivity of the analytical methods applied in the residue trials. In the acute and chronic consumer risk assessment the possible intake of carbofuran through drinking water derived from groundwater was not considered although a significant contribution to the acute and chronic exposure might be expected.        Benfuracarb is rapidly degraded in soil under laboratory dark aerobic conditions yielding carbofuran (maximum 84.6 % AR after 2 d) as major metabolite. This metabolite is low to moderate persistent in soil according the studies presented in the benfuracarb dossier, but may be high persistent according some studies presented by a different applicant in the carbofuran dossier. Relevance of carbofuran data for the assessment of benfuracarb may need further consideration.        Other minor metabolites were detected (maximum sum of them: 34.9 % AR after 0.24 d) that individually did not reached the 10 % AR. Mineralization was high at the end of the study (CO2 = 27.7 % AR - 66.6 % AR). Amount of unextractable residues reached a maximum = 74.1 % at the end of the study in one of the soils.        Experts meeting agreed that 3-ketocarbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran (minor carbofuran metabolites containing the carbamate moiety) need to be addressed, as potential benfuracarb soil metabolites, for ground water contamination.        The applicant was required to address the degradation of benfuracarb in alkaline soils. A position paper and a new study are available but are still neither evaluated nor peer reviewed.        No soil photolysis study has been provided for benfuracarb. Carbofuran is photolytically stable on soil surface, according the data available in carbofuran dossier.        Degradation of carbofuran seems to be very dependent of the temperature. The rapporteur Member State informed that the applicant had submitted a position paper and a new study to address the degradation of carbofuran at low temperatures but these reports have still not been evaluated and peer reviewed.        Worst case laboratory half lives were used to calculate PEC soil of benfuracarb. Data from a different applicant in carbosulfan dossier show that field worst case half life for carbofuran is 71.9 d in EU sites. Therefore, carbofuran PECs soil were calculated by the rapporteur Member State with this half life. According the conclusion for carbofuran, reliability of this value needs to be further assessed and confirmed.        It was estimated, by the HPLC method, that benfuracarb may be classified as immobile in soil (K-oc = 9100 mL / g). Carbofuran may be classified as very high mobile compound (K-oc = 17 - 28 mL / g). No data is available with respect the adsorption desorption properties of minor relevant soil metabolites 3-OH-carbofuran and 3-keto-carbofuran.        A lysimeter study is available where two different lysimeters are investigated. Benfuracarb was found at maximum amounts of 0.25 mu g / L and carbofuran at maximum amounts of 0.16 mu g / L. A new lysimeter study was required by the rapporteur Member State in the DAR. The meeting of MS experts agreed that the new FOCUS GW modelling required can substitute the requirement for a new lysimeter at this stage.        Hydrolysis of benfuracarb is pH dependent with half lives between less than half hour (pH 4) and 26.9 d (pH 9). In the natural water experiment (pH approximate to 7-8) photolysis seems not to contribute significantly to the aqueous degradation of benfuracarb. However, irradiation seems to enhance the degradation of the metabolite carbofuran to carbofuran-7-phenol.        Benfuracarb is not readily biodegradable.        A study with two water sediment systems is available. Both systems are in the alkaline range (pH (water) 7.8-8.4). Main compounds found in the water phase are benfuracarb and carbofuran (maximum = 58.26 % AR after 2d). Main compounds found in the sediment phase are carbofuran (maximum = 25.31 % after 14 d) and carbofuran-7-phenol (maximum = 13.6 %). The cumulative amounts of CO2 at the end of the study accounted for 13.6 % AR and 16.7 % AR. Most of the radioactivity was present as bounded residue to the sediment by the end of the study (73.8 % AR = 75.9 % AR).        Benfuracarb dissipates rapidly in water phase with a half life between 6 h to 15 h. Main dissipation process is transformation to carbofuran. Carbofuran dissipates from water phase with half life between 8.2 d to 27.2 d. Main dissipation process is partitioning into sediment. Whole system and sediment phase half lives had not been calculated. A report with the estimation of the whole system half life is available but not evaluated and peer reviewed. Also the half life in the sediment for carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol needs to be assessed.        In the carbofuran dossier, dissipation of carbofuran in the water sediment was investigated in two studies with a total of three systems. In an acidic system carbofuran degraded in the whole system with a half life of approximately 41 d. In the neutral or alkaline systems carbofuran dissipated from the water phase with half lives of 5.3-6.9 d and degraded in the whole system with half lives of 7.8 - 11.6 d. These experiments seem to indicate that the degradation of carbofuran may be pH dependent in water sediment systems.        PECSW of carbofuran has been calculated for a limited number of FOCUS sw scenarios. Calculation of PECSW, for parent benfuracarb and PECSED for benfuracarb, carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol, need to be performed. Updated FOCUS PECSW / (SED) are available but have still not been evaluated and peer reviewed.        PEC gw have been calculated for benfuracarb and carbofuran. Annual average 80th percentiles of benfuracarb were < 0.001 mu g / L for all calculated scenarios (7 cabbage spring, 5 cabbage summer). Carbofuran exceed the 0.1 mu g / L trigger in 4 of the 7 spring scenarios and in three of the five summer scenarios. In one of the summer scenarios (Hamburg) an 80th percentile annual average of 1.212 mu g / L was reached. The applicant was required to address the potential for ground water contamination by the metabolite 3-keto carbofuran. New calculations to address potential groundwater contamination by metabolites 3-OH-carbofuran, carbofuran-7-phenol and 3-keto-carbofuran are available but neither evaluated nor peer reviewed. However, it is noted that these calculations do not take into consideration the longer half lives observed for carbofuran from the data of the second carbofuran applicant.        Concentrations of benfuracarb in the air compartment are expected to be negligible, due to short persistence in the atmosphere.        An addendum to the fate and behaviour chapter has been provided the 18th of May 2006. The information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability. Studies or reports presumably submitted by the applicant are not adequately referenced.        Substantial data requirements to address the risk to birds and mammals from uptake of granules, ingestion of treated seedlings and contaminated earthworms were identified by the rapporteur Member State. Further studies were submitted by the applicant. The aquatic risk assessment based on PECsw from drainage resulted in a high acute and chronic risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates in 2 out of 3 scenarios. Based on the peer-reviewed data a high risk to aquatic organisms cannot be excluded. However the new data need to be evaluated before drawing a final conclusion on the risk to aquatic organisms. The risk to bees from exposure to residues in cabbage was assessed as low since cabbage has no flower in the production crop. The potential risk to bees from residues in flowering weeds should be assessed at Member State level taking into account the agricultural practice (management of weeds in cabbage fields). Data requirements were identified in the DAR to address the risk to ground dwelling arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and other non-target organisms. New data/information was submitted by the applicant. An addendum to the chapter on ecotoxicology has been provided on the 18th of May 2006. When reported, the information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability.        The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative use.

This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on carbosulfan in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 11 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 17 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant FMC Chemical sprl. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises incorporation into soil (at drilling) to control soil insects, where maize and sugar beet will be grew. The application rate is 0.75 kg carbosulfan per hectare. Carbosulfan can be used as insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process only the use as insecticide was evaluated.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Marshal 10G"", a granule (GR), registered in some Member States of the EU.        It should be noted that the applicant no longer supports the second formulation, presented in the dossier and DAR (""Marshal 25CS""). Consequently the uses on citrus and cotton are no longer supported.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food of plant origin, soil and water.        Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Carbosulfan is toxic if swallowed and should be classified as T, R25 ""Toxic if swallowed"". It is of low toxicity via dermal route and toxic via inhalation (classification as T, R23 is proposed).        Carbosulfan is not a skin or eye irritant but is a skin sensitiser and should be classified R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". Carbosulfan gave negative results in in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests and did not show any carcinogenic potential. Nevertheless, the level of impurities in batches used for toxicological studies remains a concern. In the three-generation rat study, the relevant maternal and reproductive NOAEL was 1.2 mg/kg bw/day. In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, the relevant maternal and developmental NOAEL was 2 mg/kg bw/d. Carbosulfan displayed no potential for induced delayed neurotoxicity. The provisional reference values are as follows: ADI and ARfD are 0.01 mg/kg bw/day; AOEL is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day. The risk assessment for operators has to be considered as inconclusive until the AOEL is confirmed. However, it can be assumed that bystander and worker exposure is likely to be negligible under the supported conditions of use.        The metabolism, distribution and residue behaviour of carbosulfan was investigated in various crops with different methods of application. Based on these studies the metabolic pathway of carbosulfan in plants can be considered as sufficiently investigated. At the time being, carbosulfan, carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran were considered the relevant residues to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. However, the metabolite dibutylamine is still under discussion concerning its possible genotoxicity and ought to be therefore considered a potential candidate to include in the residue definition, too. Moreover a need to address residues of dibutylamine but also carbofuran and its metabolites in succeeding crops following application of carbosulfan was identified.        Based on the currently proposed residue definition, supervised residue trials in sugar beet and maize indicated that residues were low and mostly below the respective LOQ. However, the available residue trials have to be reconsidered for their validity and sufficiency. With regard to the metabolite dibuytlamine no residue data have been reported. Further residue data in cotton seed and citrus will be needed if foliar uses are reinstated in the future.        Since the assessment of plant residues still needs to be finalized and due to the lack of peer reviewed evaluation of relevant data and information it is not possible to conclude on whether or not significant residues may occur in edible animal matrices.        The consumer risk assessment should be considered as inconclusive due to the uncertainties caused by lacking data identified during the evaluation.        In soil under laboratory aerobic conditions, carbosulfan yields carbofuran (max. 48.7 % - 69.3 % AR after 7 d). Also 3-keto-carbofuran is produced in significant amounts (max. 5.3 % - 6.6 %) and needs to be further assessed as it contains the active carbamate moiety. The mineralization was very limited and bounded residues increased up to maximum of 90 % AR after 100 d. In a study performed with 14C-dibutylamine labelled carbosulfan, dibutylamine was found as a major aerobic soil metabolite.        No valid degradation study of carbosulfan in soil under anaerobic conditions is available. Also photolysis in soil was not investigated. Metabolite carbofuran was considered stable to photolysis in soil in its DAR.        Evaluation meeting agreed that a re-evaluation of the degradation kinetic in degradation studies had to be performed. Reassessment is available but has not been evaluated and peer reviewed. Therefore, end points for laboratory soil degradation of carbosulfan have not been established.        Summaries of some field dissipation studies in EU are available. Half life of carbosulfan in these trials ranges between 0.35 to 31.3 d and half life of carbofuran is between 1.3 to 71.9 d. EFSA notes that, in the context of the carbofuran discussion, the meeting of MS experts was not able to determine the reliability of these studies. A position paper is available (June 2005) but has still not been assessed and peer reviewed. PEC in soil were calculated in the DAR for carbosulfan and carbofuran based on the field worst case half lives and the representative uses in maize, sugar beet, citrus and cotton. Evaluation meeting agreed that half life and PEC soil of dibutylamine need to be determined. A position paper is already available but has not been evaluated and peer reviewed.        The rapporteur Member State concluded that the soil adsorption / desorption study is of limited quality. The meeting of MS experts agreed that the study was not valid and identified a data gap for a valid study for carbosulfan and dibutylamine. For the metabolite carbofuran an additional study (from a different notifier Dianica) is available in its dossier as active substance.        A lysimeter study is available. However, annual average concentrations and detailed characterization of the residue are missing. Evaluation meeting agreed that levels of dibutylamine need to be determined in the leachate samples and that the two new lysimeters performed with carbofuran should be submitted and assessed. These studies and a position paper are already available but have not been evaluated and peer reviewed.        Carbosulfan hydrolyses with half lives lower than 1 d at pH 5 and 7 and of 7 d at pH 9. Main products are carbofuran and dibutylamine. Carbofuran degrades to carbofuran-7-phenol.        Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of carbosulfan in water. Two regions of polar degradation products (66.7 % AR) were found but not characterized. Their environmental relevance is uncertain and was not examined by the meeting of MS experts since the study was still not evaluated. Carbosulfan is not readily biodegradable.        Carbosulfan was low persistent in aerobic water / sediment systems. Main metabolites formed were carbofuran (max. 34.7 % AR in water; max. 20.1 % AR in sediment) and carbofuran-7-phenol (max. 11.6 % AR in water; max. 3.21 % AR in sediment). A non characterized metabolite (Unknown 3) appears at levels above 10 % AR in the sediment of some systems (max. 20.11 % AR after 7 d). This compound has been tentatively identified as a structure that contains the carbamate moiety and may be expected to produce carbofuran when degraded. The amount of bound residues increased steadily up to 30.5 - 43.0 % AR at the end of the experiments (102 d).        No half lives are reported in carbosulfan DAR for metabolites carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol in the water / sediment systems. From water / sediment studies summarized in the carbofuran DAR, carbofuran degraded in the whole system with a first order half life of approximately 41 d. Available water sediment studies under alkaline conditions (from carbofuran applicant Dianica) show a faster degradation of carbofuran and the formation of carbofuran-7-phenol at high levels.        PECSW/SED were calculated by the applicant based on an ad hoc modelling exercise. Evaluation Meeting confirmed the rapporteur Member State data requirement for FOCUS SW PECSW/SED and agreed that PECSW for dibutylamine need to be calculated. FOCUS SW calculations and a position paper for dibutylamine are available but have not been evaluated and peer reviewed.        The applicant presented an estimation of the potential for ground water contamination based on the FOCUS GW scheme (PRZM). The rapporteur Member State considered that half life and Koc employed for carbofuran in the calculation were not justified and proposed a data requirement for new PECGW. This data requirement was confirmed by the Evaluation Meeting that additionally required calculation of PECGW for metabolite dibutylamine. New FOCUS GW calculations for carbofuran and a position paper for dibutylamine are available but have not been evaluated and peer reviewed. Additionally, experts meeting indicated that potential ground water contamination by soil metabolite 3-keto-carbofuran should be addressed.        It is not expected that neither carbosulfan nor its transformation product carbofuran (from data in carbofuran dossier) may contaminate the air compartment or be prone to long range transport through air.        An addendum to the fate and behaviour chapter has been provided on 18 May 2006. When reported, the information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability. Studies or reports presumably submitted by the applicant are not adequately referenced. Therefore studies submitted by the applicant after the DAR was submitted are considered neither evaluated nor peer-reviewed in this conclusion.        The first tier risk assessment based on generic species identified a potential risk to insectivorous birds in citrus and cotton, to medium herbivorous birds in cotton and to small herbivorous mammals in citrus from foliar application of carbosulfan. Only a small number of granules have to be ingested by a small bird to reach the acute LD50 or the LC50, hence the risk of ingestion of granules should be further addressed. The number of granules that have to be ingested by a small mammal to reach the LD50 is relatively high and since granules are not attractive to mammals the acute risk is considered to be low. Few granules are however needed to reach the NOAEL for mammals and the long-term risk needs to be further addressed. Also the risk from ingestion of treated seedlings, contaminated earthworms, fish and drinking water needs to be evaluated.        Carbosulfan and the metabolite carbofuran are classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. For citrus and cotton the risk assessment indicates acute and long-term risk to aquatic organisms even with 50 m buffer zones based on contamination by spray drift only. Based on available data for PECsw, a long-term risk is indicated for all representative uses evaluated from exposure to the metabolite carbofuran via drainage to surface water. The assessment needs to be refined based on FOCUS modelling of PECsw.        Carbosulfan is toxic to bees. For the representative uses in citrus and cotton the risk needs to be further addressed by semi-field or field tests. Since sugar beet crop is not flowering the risk from the use in sugar beet is considered low. The risk to bees from exposure to carbosulfan/carbofuran in nectar and pollen following granular application was not assessed due to non evaluated data on oral toxicity for carbofuran. Laboratory studies confirm that carbosulfan is toxic to arthropods. Further semi-field or field studies are required to evaluate the risk. The risk to earthworms from the use of MARCHAL 25 CS is considered as low. For the granular formulation further clarification is needed on whether the field study with MARCHAL 25 CS can be used for the assessment. No evaluation of the risk to soil micro-organisms and non-target plants is available. For biological methods of sewage treatment the risk is considered to be low.

rayyan-1227193657,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance cadusafos,2006,5,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,5,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Cadusafos is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on cadusafos in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 1 June 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant FMC Chemical. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative as insecticide and nematicide comprise the application by spraying or via the drip irrigation system to control a range of soil insects and nematodes in bananas and potatoes at application rates of up to 6 kg cadusafos per hectare. In case of potatoes incorporation into soil takes place after the application. Cadusafos can be used as insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated that only the use in bananas will be supported in the EU review process.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Ruby 200 CS"", a capsule suspension (CS). Preparations containing cadusafos are registered in Cyprus, France, Greece and Spain.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition only for soil, water and air, i.e. cadusafos in soil, water and air. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Insufficient data are available for the determination of cadusafos in the technical material and in the representative formulation to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        The absorption of cadusafos is extensive and rapid, the excretion is mainly via urine, without evidence of body accumulation. The acute oral toxicity is high, and the acute inhalation and dermal toxicity are very high. The proposed classification is T+, R26/27 ""Very toxic by inhalation and in contact with skin""; T, R25 ""Toxic if swallowed"". The main effect after short term oral administration is the decrease of cholinesterase activities in all species. Cadusafos has no genotoxic potential and is not considered to be carcinogenic. In the two-generation rat study, there was no effect on reproductive performance or fertility, and in the rat and rabbit teratology studies, no evidence of teratogenic effects in the absence of maternal toxicity. Supplementary studies were performed due to the introduction of a new impurity in the technical material. The acute and subchronic oral tests revealed no difference in toxicity. The Ames test was negative.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.0007 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.003 mg/kg bw/day. The comparison of the oral and dermal LD50 values results in a dermal absorption value of 100%. The operator exposure estimates are based solely on one specific and restricted representative use in bananas, with automatic drip irrigation, work rate of 1 ha/day, application rate of 6 kg a.s./ha, and assuming that the microcapsules in the formulation do not release cadusafos until they are diluted for application. The results are below the AOEL according to the currently used models which do not apply properly to this particular scenario. Worker and bystander exposures are expected to be very low due to the mode of application by drip irrigation.        The metabolism of cadusafos has been investigated on several crops after soil application. The representative use on potatoes can be considered as adequately covered by these data and the residue definition for this use can be cadusafos only, for both monitoring and risk assessment. The available residue trials in potatoes for Southern Europe are however not sufficient to draw a robust conclusion on the residue levels consumers may be exposed to. The available data suggest that residues are below 0.01 mg/kg, but results from trials in Northern Europe indicate that the currently available data may underestimate the actual situation. Further supervised residue trials should be carried out.        For the representative use on bananas, although 2 metabolism studies for this crop were submitted, the data are not sufficient to propose a residue definition. This is due to major deficiencies in the studies, making it impossible to evaluate the possible presence of degradation products still exhibiting the anticholinesterase activity of the parent compound. Therefore a new metabolism study in bananas is needed as well as residue trials carried out according to the representative use pattern. The compounds to be analysed in the residue trials should be determined on the basis of the results of the metabolism study.        The situation for rotational crops has not been addressed by the notifier, although the soil persistence of the compound exceeds the trigger value for conducting uptake and metabolism studies in succeeding crops. Therefore these studies should be requested.        Based on the current knowledge of the residue situation in potatoes, the exposure of livestock is very low and metabolism studies in domestic animals do not need to be carried out. Only preliminary acute and chronic exposure assessments could be conducted for the use on potatoes, but these assessments need to be re-examined on the basis of complete and robust data. No MRLs can be proposed at this stage.        The available data demonstrate that in soil cadusafos degrades to the minor (<10% applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone. Mineralisation of the butyl-2-C-14 radiolabel accounted for 43-71% AR after 90-120 days incubation at 25(circle)C. The values for residues not extracted by acetonitrile / water were 25-32% AR after 90-120 days. In soil cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and methyl-2-butyl sulfone exhibited low persistence.        In guideline batch soil adsorption studies cadusafos exhibited medium mobility. There was no evidence of pH dependant adsorption. Data on the adsorption of methyl-2-butyl sulfone were not available. As this metabolite accounted for > 5% AR at 2 consecutive sampling points in a soil route of degradation study, information on its mobility in soil is required to complete the groundwater exposure assessment for this metabolite.        In sediment water systems cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and produced no major metabolites. It dissipated by partitioning to sediment, volatilising and mineralising to CO2 (butyl-2-C-14 radiolabel accounted for 12-18% AR after 100 days incubation at 20(circle)C). Residues not extracted from sediment by acetonitrile/water accounted for only 6-8% AR at 100 days.        The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on bananas (application via drip irrigation) just in Tenerife indicated that surface water exposure and consequently sediment exposure would be negligible. This conclusion is specific to this use in Tenerife and should not be applied to bananas grown elsewhere. The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on potatoes is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route of entry to surface water for initial PEC in aquatic systems. However MS would need to carry out a surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessments from the runoff and drainage routes of exposure at the national level, as the available EU level assessment does not cover these situations.        The available FOCUS groundwater modelling for potatoes and the specifically parameterised scenario for bananas in Tenerife for parent cadusafos has not been carried out with appropriate soil DT50 or Henry's law parameters. The potential for groundwater contamination is therefore currently unclear. New groundwater modelling is therefore required for cadusafos. A groundwater leaching assessment for the soil metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone is triggered. It is not available.        Cadusafos is moderately volatile and volatilisation will contribute to dissipation from soil and water. However cadusafos is not expected to be subject to long range transport via the upper atmosphere due to a relatively rapid calculated photochemical oxidative degradation rate with hydroxyl radicals.        In the first tier assessment an acute and long-term risk was identified for insectivorous birds. A risk was also identified for earthworm-eating birds and mammals as well as for fish-eating birds and mammals for the use in potatoes. Since the use in potatoes was withdrawn by the applicant the refinements of the risk to birds and mammals from this use was not further considered. For the use in banana plantations a conclusion on the risk to birds and mammals can not be reached at this stage. The risk needs to be further addressed based on species that occur in banana plantations and their associated diets.        Cadusafos is very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The assessment indicates a high risk. However, for the specific use in banana plantations in Tenerife the risk to aquatic organisms is considered low based on negligible contamination of surface water.        The toxicity to bees is high, but since for the proposed uses application will be to bare soil the risk is considered low. No in-field exposure of leaf dwelling non-target arthropods is expected from the evaluated uses. The available test with Poecilius cupreus was conducted at an application rate which is lower than the proposed. An ongoing study with Aleochara bilineata should be submitted for the use in banana due to the perceived low sensitivity of P. cupreus. For the application of cadusafos by drip-irrigation to banana plants no off-field exposure is expected.        A high acute and long-term risk was identified for earthworms. The ongoing field study conducted in United Kingdom should be submitted and the relevance for the proposed uses should be addressed. It should be noted that the application rate in this study is 4.5 kg cadusafos per hectare, which is below the proposed application rate for the intended uses. A study with Collembola and mites is required to address the risk to other soil macro-organisms. The risk to soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment plants is low. For the drip irrigation use in banana no off-crop exposure is expected and hence the risk to non-target plants is considered low.

rayyan-1227193659,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance metconazole finalised: 13 January 2006,2006,2,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,2,,EFSA,,English,,,"Metconazole is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on metconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 27 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 16 April 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April - Mai 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control foliar and ear diseases in cereals and oilseed rape at application rate up to 90 g metconazole per hectare. Metconazole can be used only as fungicide.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Caramba 60 SL"", a soluble concentrate (SL), registered in some EU Member States.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food and soil can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of metconazole.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        The acute oral toxicity of metconazole is moderate (a classification Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed). Metconazole is of low acute dermal and inhalatory toxicity. It is not a skin or eye irritant or a skin sensitiser. The relevant NOAEL for short term toxicity is 6.4 mg/kg bw/day. Adrenals, liver and spleen were detected as target organs. Overall, metconazole is not genotoxic. The NOAEL for chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity is 4.4 mg/kg bw/day. It was considered that the compound was unlikely to be classified as a carcinogenic substance. The NOAELs for parental, reproduction and offspring toxicity are 8 mg/kg bw/day; based on the absence of effect on fertility in the rat 2-generation study (only modification of fertility parameters at maternotoxic doses). Both compounds are embryo- and foetotoxic at doses also producing maternal toxicity in rat developmental toxicity studies. Therefore, classification as Repro Cat. 3 (Xn; R63) was agreed on. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Levels (AOEL) are 0.01 mg/kg bw/day based on an overall NOAEL of 4 mg/kg bw/d with a safety factor of 400 (the increased SF is due to teratogenic effects).        Operator exposure is below the AOEL when PPE is worn. The exposure during re-entry activities and for bystanders is negligible.        In the plant metabolism studies conducted in wheat and oilseed rape, metconazole, triazolyl alanine and triazolyl acetic acid were identified as the major components of the total residues in the edible plant parts of the tested crops. Triazolyl alanine is a common metabolite of triazole fungicides, and its toxicological profile was considered as sufficiently investigated. The residue of concern in cereals and oilseed crops is therefore metconazole only. The enrichment of edible plant parts of succeeding crops with metconazole was not sufficient to reach quantifiable levels, when metconazole is used according cGAP. A complete residue trials data base on wheat, rye, triticale and oilseed rape was provided for Northern and Southern Europe and allowed MRL proposals. For barley uses in Southern Europe additional trial data need to be submitted to confirm the compliance with currently proposed MRL based on Northern European trials. Due to low consumer exposure industrial or household processing studies are not required.        Since significant residues occur in potential feed stuff, metabolism studies have been submitted in lactating goats and laying hens. In lactating goats, metconazole undergoes an extensive metabolisation, but was still detected in edible goat matrices bar kidney. All the metabolites found in goat tissues have been recovered in the rat. In a non peer reviewed addendum (December 2005) RMS concluded that representative uses do not give rise to significant residues in animal products and MRLs do not need to be proposed.        In contrast, estimates of possibly occurring residues levels in animal matrices done by EFSA indicated that relevant residue levels might be expected in ruminant liver. According to current guidelines a feeding study with ruminants would be required and MRLs for food of animal origin (i.e. ruminant liver) need to be proposed. In laying hens, the metabolic profile was not further investigated and no such data is currently required since the intake by poultry is not significant with regard to the representative uses.        The dietary risk assessment performed for different consumer groups indicates that there are no chronic and acute concerns related to dietary exposure resulting from the representative uses.        Sufficient data were available to demonstrate that in soil metconazole exhibits medium to high persistence based on northern and southern European field studies where applications were made in May and June. Consequently the available laboratory studies did not identify any major (>10% of applied radioactivity (AR)) soil metabolites. Mineralization of the 3,5-triazole-14C radiolabel accounted for 10.3% AR in dark aerobic laboratory soil studies after 91 days. The formation of unextracted residues in the soil organic carbon was the significant sink (accounting for 12-28% AR at 91-112 days). Metconazole exhibited low mobility in soil (based on evidence from laboratory soil batch adsorption studies) There was no evidence that adsorption changed with variation in soil pH.        In natural sediment water systems (dark laboratory studies) metconazole dissipated from the water relatively rapidly by partitioning to sediment. Once in the sediment degradation was slow with metconazole exhibiting high to very high persistence. The 3,5-triazole-C-14-label, did not mineralize to CO2 at all. Formation of unextracted sediment radioactivity (11-19%AR at 100 days) and the formation of up to 6 resolved minor (<= 9% AR) metabolites (5 identified) accounted for the slow loss of metconazole in these static experimental systems. It is a concern, that from the acceptable standard guideline studies required and provided, in terms of accounting for the route of breakdown and completing the material balance of metconazole, it is only possible to conclude that metconazole is persistent in the sediment of aquatic systems (there was no evidence that the metabolites formed were mineralised, the only sink identified was unextracted sediment radioactivity). Based on the available data, photolysis is not expected to be a significant process in the breakdown of metconazole in natural aquatic systems.        The environmental exposure assessments available are sufficient to complete the necessary EU level estimates of Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) for the representative uses applied for, for annex 1 listing. Because of the persistence of metconazole in soil and aquatic sediment it was necessary for exposure assessments to take into account the potential accumulation of metconazole in these environmental matrices from potential use in consecutive years. Member States must also do this when assessing potential uses of metconazole at the national level. Member States also need to carry out aquatic exposure and risk assessments from the drainage and runoff routes of exposure to surface water as these routes of entry have not been considered in the EU level assessments available.        FOCUS groundwater modelling indicated a low potential for groundwater contamination in vulnerable situations over a wide range of geoclimatic conditions across the EU for the uses assessed in this conclusion. (At all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios annual average leachate concentrations of metconazole leaving the top 1m soil layer were predicted to be below the parametric legal drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L).        The acute and short-term risk to birds and the acute risk to mammals are low from the representative uses. The first tier TER values indicated a high long-term risk for insectivorous and herbivorous birds (TER of 2.3 to 3.1) and a high long-term risk to herbivorous mammals. The EPCO experts meeting identified the requirement for further information to justify the choice of the focal species and data on more species to refine the long term risk to insectivorous birds. The experts meeting agreed to the refinement of long-term exposure based on residue data in cereals. The long-term risk to herbivorous birds was shown to be low for both representative uses. However, further refinement steps are necessary to address the risk to small herbivorous mammals for the representative use in cereals (TER of 2.9). The acute and the long term risk to mammals from the representative use in oilseed rape are considered to be low.        The risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning from uptake of contaminated earthworms was discussed at the experts meeting. It was agreed that the TER calculations should be based on the plateau PECsoil plus one application. The resulting TER values for birds and mammals of 10.5 and 5.3 are above the Annex VI trigger of 5 indicating a low risk from the representative uses. The risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated drinking water was calculated by EFSA according to Sanco/4145/2000 in an addendum. The first tier TER values indicated a high short-term and long term risk to birds and a high long-term risk to mammals. A refined risk assessment for the uptake of contaminated drinking water is required for the intended uses in cereals and oilseed rape.        The acute risk to aquatic organisms is low. The long-term risk to fish and daphnids is high and risk mitigation measures such as buffer zones up to 15 m are required.        The Annex VI trigger values were not met for NTA in a first tier testing. The higher tier tests showed that the risk to non-target arthropods is low.        A field litter bag study has been performed at an application rate equivalent to the supported GAP. No effects were observed in the study after 3 months and after 6 months of exposure. As some drawbacks have been identified in the study, the experts meeting set a data requirement to submit a new litter bag study available to the applicant. The evaluation of this new study would allow completing the risk assessment.        The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants is considered to be low for the representative uses.

In conjunction with refuges of non-Bt host plants, fitness costs can delay the evolution of resistance. Furthermore, fitness costs often vary with ecological conditions, suggesting that agricultural landscapes can be manipulated to magnify fitness costs and thereby prolong the efficacy of Bt crops. In the current study, we tested the effects of four species of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) on the magnitude and dominance of fitness costs of resistance to Bt toxin Cry1Ac in pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). For more than a decade, field populations of pink bollworm in the United States have remained susceptible to Bt cotton Gossypium hirsutum L. producing Cry1Ac; however, we used laboratory strains that had a mixture of susceptible and resistant individuals. In laboratory experiments, dominant fitness costs were imposed by the nematode Steinernema riobrave Cabanillas, Poinar, and Raulston but no fitness costs were imposed by Steinernema carpocapsae Weiser, Steinernema sp. (ML18 strain), or Heterorhabditis sonorensis Stock, Rivera-Orduno, and Flores-Lara. In computer simulations, evolution of resistance to Cry1Ac by pink bollworm was substantially delayed by treating some non-Bt cotton refuge fields with nematodes that imposed a dominant fitness cost, similar to the cost observed in laboratory experiments with S. riobrave. Based on the results here and in related studies, we conclude that entomopathogenic nematodes could bolster insect resistance management, but the success of this approach will depend on selecting the appropriate species of nematode and environment, as fitness costs were magnified by only two of five species evaluated and also depended on environmental factors.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  67,10.1603/EC10087     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ecological negative cross-resistance;Pectinophora gossypiella;resistance management;simulation modeling;Steinernema riobrave;PECTINOPHORA-GOSSYPIELLA SAUNDERS;ENTOMOPATHOGENIC NEMATODES;BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL;INSECT RESISTANCE;TRANSGENIC CROPS;BT RESISTANCE;HOST-PLANT;EVOLUTION;LEPIDOPTERA;GELECHIIDAE,NA,NA,effects of four nematode species on fitness costs of pink bollworm resistance to <i>bacillus thuringiensis<i> toxin cry1ac

The key emphasis was placed on the variants of the swarm intelligence algorithms, namely the artificial bee colony (ABC), genetic algorithm, flower pollination algorithm (FPA), particle swarm, the ant colony, firefly algorithm, artificial fish swarm, and Krill herd algorithm because they had been widely employed in the agricultural sector. There was a broad consensus among scholars that certain BIAs' variants were more effective than others. For example, the Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm and genetic algorithm were best suited for farm machinery path optimization and pest detection, among other applications. On the contrary, the particle swarm algorithm was useful in determining the plant evapotranspiration rates, which predicted the water requirements and optimization of the irrigation process. Despite the promising applications, the adoption of hyper-heuristic algorithms in agriculture remained low. No universal algorithm could perform multiple functions in farms; different algorithms were designed to perform specific functions. Secondary concerns relate to data integrity and cyber security, considering the history of cyber-attacks on smart farms. Despite the concerns, the benefits associated with the BIAs outweighed the risks. On average, farmers can save 647-1866 L on fuel which is equivalent to US$734-851, with the use of GPS-guided systems.

During 3 years of sampling, biomarkers at all levels of biological organisation from the molecular to the ecosystem level were applied and tested on 742 individual fish of body lengths between 18 and 25 cm. At the ecosystem level, the fish were taken as a habitat for the parasite assemblage. The hypothesis was that changes in the environment might lead to changes in the species diversity of parasites and in the infection intensity of single species, as well as between heteroxenic and monoxenic parasite species (H/M ratio). At the molecular level, activity of the CYP1A-dependent monooxygenase ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) was used as a biomarker of exposure. At the subcellular level, the integrity of lysosomal membranes in hepatocytes was taken as an indicator of non-specific acute and chronic toxic effects. Both biomarkers are recommended by the ICES Advisory Committee on the Marine Environment for the application in biological effects monitoring programmes. In addition, neutral lipid content in the liver was used as a marker for pathologically induced fat accumulation. In the same individual fish, a new method for the measurement of macrophage aggregate activity in the liver was tested for its application and reliability in reflecting immunosuppression.

As an indicator species, the mean abundance of Trichodina sp. reflected best the pollution gradient observed with highest infection intensity at the most polluted location. Species diversity was significantly higher in fish caught near the reference site and significantly lower in fish from the polluted Elbe estuary. The use of the heteroxenous/monoxenous species ratio as a marker was not useful at the locations investigated because of the dominance of heteroxenous species at all habitats. Since EROD activity and macrophage aggregate activity were dependent on sex and maturity of female flounder, only male fish were taken into consideration for the integrated evaluation of data. All biochemical and histochemical tests were able to reflect accurately the site-specific differences, as well as an observed pollution event at the end of 1995 as determined by chemical analyses. The correlation analysis revealed a connection not only between the single parasitological and biochemical parameters but also within these groups. The non-specific immune response and TrichodinL1 infection intensity were correlated with all other parameters, leading to the assumption that these may serve as links between the lowest and the highest levels of biological organisation. The simultaneous use of metabolic and parasitological results facilitated the interpretation of the observed variations of the data and the distinction between natural variation and pollution-mediated effects.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  88     Total Times Cited:  97     Cited Reference Count:  65,10.1007/s101520050023     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"integrated biological effect monitoring;North Sea;metabolic, pathological and parasitological biomarkers;Platichthys flesus;FLOUNDER PLATICHTHYS-FLESUS;DAB LIMANDA-LIMANDA;CYTOCHROME P4501A INDUCTION;WINTER FLOUNDER;MARINE FISH;ENVIRONMENTAL-STRESS;BETA-NAPHTHOFLAVONE;LYSOSOMAL STRUCTURE;OIL-SPILL;CRUDE-OIL",NA,NA,the use of fish metabolic pathological and parasitological indices in pollution monitoring 1 north sea

It is a silverfish that may be difficult to eradicate because it utilizes many parts of a building. Heavy use of pesticides is undesirable from a health perspective, and baits with low concentrations of toxins are consequently preferable. To safeguard the indoor environment during management, the present study describes procedures for the efficient control of Ctenolepisma longicaudata with small amounts of bait. This is as efficient, as sprayable pesticides and declines with more than 90% reduction of the pest population can be achieved within 15 to 20 weeks. Successful eradication can be achieved with as little as 0.5 to 1.0 g bait per 100 m(2).        Pest management strives to be an efficient, yet healthy and environmentally safe control method, and the use of poisoned bait often fulfils these criteria. In the present study, we show that bait with indoxacarb as the active ingredient is highly efficient for controlling Ctenolepisma longicaudata (Escherich, 1905) and two of its relatives, Lepisma saccharina (Linnaeus, 1758) and Ctenolepisma calva (Ritter, 1910). Applying small bait droplets (size similar to 10 mg) along the walls of several types of buildings, at no more than 0.5 to 1.0 g bait per 100 m(2), was a cost-efficient and safe strategy for the knockdown and eradication of C. longicaudata. During field experiments, the demography changed from an initial mixture of different stages to total dominance of early instars preceding the population collapse. Poisonous bait outcompeted mass-trapping with sticky-traps and conventional insect spray treatment for the efficient control of C. longicaudata in apartments. Different droplet densities (1 vs. 0.5/m(2)) and active ingredients (indoxacarb vs. clothianidin) did not have different effects in field experiments. These results show that poisoned bait is a highly relevant tool for managing C. longicaudata and potentially against other silverfish infestations.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  42,10.3390/insects11120852     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Ctenolepisma longicaudata;control;demography;efficiency;poisoned bait;population collapse;safe strategy;GERMAN COCKROACHES DICTYOPTERA;FIELD-EVALUATION;INDOXACARB;SECONDARY;ZYGENTOMA;Poisoning;Poisons,NA,NA,development of a poisoned bait strategy against the silverfish <i>ctenolepisma longicaudata<i> escherich 1905

Objectives: This study aimed to assess spray-workers' management of insecticide risk indicators and occupational insecticidal poisoning. Materials and        Methods: An analytical cross-sectional survey was adopted, that involved all of the professional indoor residual spray-workers serving in the Omo-Nada woreda (district), Ethiopia. The survey was conducted between January and April 2011 by administering a pretested questionnaire. All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS v. 19.0. A two-sided Fisher's exact test was performed to determine associations between the variables.        Results: Overall, 52.4% of the study participants had an awareness of the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), whereas 41.9% were unable to read the pesticide labels. About 75.3% of spray-workers never drink or eat or smoke, while spraying. Statistical analysis (two-sided Fisher's exact test) confirmed that there is no statistically significant association between safe insecticide practice with the spray-worker's gender (P = 0.332), whereas, there were strong correlations found with age (P = 0.001), educational status (P = 0.001) and years of work experience (P = 0.001).        Conclusions: Despite adequate awareness of safe insecticide management, most of the spray-workers were observed to be reluctant to put this knowledge into practice, either due to the inadequacy of PPE or negligence. Furthermore, a sizable faction of these workers still had limited knowledge and erroneous risk perceptions, thus increasing their risk of OIP.

The parasitic sea lamprey contributed to the devastating collapse of native fish communities after invading the Great Lakes during the 1800s and early 1900s. Economic tragedy ensued with the loss of the fishery and severe impacts to property values and tourism resulting from sea lamprey-induced ecological changes. To control the sea lamprey and rehabilitate the once vibrant Great Lakes ecosystem and economy, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission (Commission) was formed by treaty between Canada and the United States in 1955. The Commission has developed a sea lamprey control programme based on their physiological vulnerabilities, which includes (i) the application of selective pesticides (lampricides), which successfully kill sedentary sea lamprey larvae in their natal streams; (ii) barriers to spawning migrations and associated traps to prevent infestations of upstream habitats and remove adult sea lamprey before they reproduce; and (iii) the release of sterilized males to reduce the reproductive potential of spawning populations in select streams. Since 1958, the application of the sea lamprey control programme has suppressed sea lamprey populations by similar to 90% from peak abundance. Great Lakes fish populations have rebounded and the economy is now thriving. In hopes of further enhancing the efficacy and selectivity of the sea lamprey control programme, the Commission is exploring the use of (i) sea lamprey chemosensory cues (pheromones and alarm cues) to manipulate behaviours and physiologies, and (ii) genetics to identify and manipulate genes associated with key physiological functions, for control purposes. Overall, the Commission capitalizes on the unique physiology of the sea lamprey and strives to develop a diverse integrated programme to successfully control a once devastating invasive species.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  61     Total Times Cited:  67     Cited Reference Count:  162,10.1093/conphys/cox031     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Conservation physiology;integrated pest management;invasive species;population control;sea lamprey;MALE-RELEASE TECHNIQUE;3-TRIFLUOROMETHYL-4-NITROPHENOL TFM;LAMPRICIDE TFM;PHEROMONE COMMUNICATION;POTENTIAL APPLICATION;ENVIRONMENTAL FATE;ACUTE TOXICITY;CASE-HISTORY;GUIDE USE;LARVAL,NA,NA,use of physiological knowledge to control the invasive sea lamprey <i>petromyzon marinus<i> in the laurentian great lakes

The floodwaters flowing into nearshore areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) were known to contain oils, metals, and a wide range of pathogens and enteric bacteria, and there was also concern about synthetic chemical contaminants from flooded businesses and homes. The Northwest Fisheries Science Center was asked to mount an immediate response, both to collect samples of fish and shrimp from the potentially affected area as well as providing a wide range of chemical and microbiological analyses. Consequently, we conducted several sampling cruises from a variety of research vessels and chartered fishing boats in the GoM over the course of the following 12 months. While we sampled many species, we focused our analyses on Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulalus and white shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus. Sampling began on 13 September 2005, within 1 week after floodwater pumping was intitated, and continued through September 2006. More than 300 seafood, water, and sediment samples were analyzed for a suite of organic chemical contaminants, including organochlorines, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs). The samples were also tested for bacterial contamination, including fecal contaminants such as Escherichia coli and potentially pathogenic Vibrio spp. While a range of both chemical and microbiological substances were detected, none were present in edible tissues at levels that posed any appreciable risk to human consumers of seafood products from the GoM, assuming that normal seafood preparation practices were followed. Petroleum-derived PACs in whites shrimp from both Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound increased over several sampling periods in the fall and early winter (p < 0.001). However, these levels were quite low and had declined considerably by April 2006. Other than the increases in petroleum-derived PACs. our findings suggested little evidence of increased levels of contaminants immediately following the hurricane; however, the lackk of prestorm data hampered that determination. A lack of standard protocols, as well as issues related to risk assessment methodologies, complicated the ability to provide a coordinated multiagency communication of the results. As a result of our experiences in responding to this unprecedented environmental emergency. we recommend a more unified national capability for assessing seafood safety in our nation's coastal waters.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  44,,SOLE PAROPHRYS-VETULUS;SEDIMENT-ASSOCIATED XENOBIOTICS;AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS;SIMULTANEOUS EXPOSURE;SECRETION;COAST,NA,NA,assessing seafood safety in the aftermath of hurricane katrina

This RfD is based on retrospective studies of an acute poisoning incident in Iraq in which grain contaminated with a methylmercury fungicide was inadvertently used in the baking of bread.(1) The exposures, which were relatively high but lasted only a few months, were associated with neurological effects in both adults (primarily paresthesia) and infants (late walking, late talking, etc.). It is generally believed that the developing fetus represents a particularly sensitive subpopulation for the neurological effects of methylmercury. The USEPA derived an RfD of 0.1 mug/kg/day based on benchmark dose (BMD) modeling of the combined neurological endpoints reported for children exposed in utero. This RfD included an uncertainty factor of 10 to consider human pharmacokinetic variability and database limitations (lack of data on multigeneration effects or possible long-term sequelae of perinatal exposure). Alcoa signed an Administrative Order of Consent for the conduct of a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) at their Point Comfort Operations and the adjacent Lavaca Bay in Texas to address the effects of historical discharges of mercury-containing wastewater. In cooperation with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and USEPA Region VI, Alcoa conducted a baseline risk assessment to assess potential risk to human health and the environment. As a part of this assessments Alcoa pursued the development of a site-specific RfD for methylmercury to specifically address the potential human health effects associated with the ingestion of contaminated finfish and shellfish from Lavaca Bay. Application of the published USEPA RfD to this site is problematic; while the study underlying the RfD represented acute exposure to relatively high concentrations of methylmercury, the exposures of concern. for the Point Comfort site are from the chronic consumption of relatively low concentrations of methylmercury in fish. Since the publication of the USEPA RfD, several analyses of chronic exposure to methylmercury in fish-eating populations have been reported. The purpose of the analysis reported here was to evaluate the possibility of deriving an RfD for methylmercury, specifically for the case of fish ingestion, on the basis of these new studies. In order to better support the risk-management decisions associated with developing a remediation approach for the site in question, the analysis was designed to provide information on the distribution of acceptable ingestion rates across a population, which could reasonably be expected to be consistent with the results of the epidemiological studies of other fish-eating populations. Based on a review of the available literature on the effects of methylmercury, a study conducted with a population in the Seychelles Islands was selected as the critical study for this analysis. The exposures to methylmercury in this population result from chronic, multigenerational ingestion of contaminated fish. This prospective study was carefully conducted and analyzed, included a large cohort of mother-infant pairs, and was relatively free of confounding factors.        The results of this study are essentially negative, and a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) derived from the estimated exposures has recently been used by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) as the basis for a chronic oral minimal risk level (MRL) for methylmercury. In spite of the fact that no statistically significant effects were observed in this study, the data as reported are suitable for dose-response analysis using the BMD method. Evaluation of the BMD method used in this analysis, as well as in the current USEPA RtD, has demonstrated that the resulting 95% lower bound on the 10% benchmark dose (BMDL) represents a conservative estimate of the traditional NOAEL, and that it is superior to the use of ""average"" or ""grouped"" exposure estimates when dose-response information is available, as is the case for the Seychelles study. A more recent study in the Faroe Islands, which did report statistically significant associations between methylmercury exposure and neurological effects, could not be used for dose-response modeling due to inadequate reporting of the data and confounding from coexposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). BMD modeling over the wide range of neurological endpoints reported in the Seychelles study yielded a lowest BMDL for methylmercury in maternal hair of 21 ppm. This BMDL was then converted to an expected distribution of daily ingestion rates across a population using Monte Carlo analysis with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to evaluate the impact of interindividual variability. The resulting distribution of ingestion rates at the BMDL had a geometric mean of 1.60 mug/kg/day with a geometric standard deviation of 1.33; the 1st, 5th, and 10th percentiles of the distribution were 0.86, 1.04,- and 1.15 mug/kg/day. In place of the use of an uncertainty factor of 3 for pharmacokinetic variability, as is done in the current RfD, one of these lower percentiles of the daily ingestion rate distribution provides a scientifically based, conservative basis for taking into consideration the impact of pharmacokinetic variability across the population. On the other hand, it was felt that an uncertainty factor of 3 for database limitations should be used in the current analysis. Although there can be high confidence in the benchmark-estimated NOAEL of 21 ppm in the Seychelles study, some results in the New Zealand and Faroe Islands studies could be construed to suggest the possibility of effects at maternal hair concentrations below 10 ppm. In addition, while concerns regarding the possibility of chronic sequelae are not supported by the available data, neither can they be absolutely ruled out. The use of an uncertainty factor of 3 is equivalent to using a NOAEL of 7 ppm in. maternal hair, which provides additional protection against the possibility that effects could occur at lower concentrations in some populations. Based on the analysis described above, the distribution of acceptable daily ingestion rates (RfDs) recommended to serve as the basis for site-specific risk-management decisions at Alcoa's Point Comfort Operations ranges from approximately 0.3 to 1.1 mug/kg/day, with a population median (50th percentile) of 0.5 mug/kg/day. By analogy with USEPA guidelines for the use of percentiles in applications of distributions in exposure assessments, the 10th percentile provides a reasonably conservative measure. On this basis, a site-specific RfD of 0.4 mug/kg/day is recommended.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  236,,benchmark dose;exposure assessment;methylmercury;Monte Carlo;reference dose;risk assessment;IN-UTERO EXPOSURE;MACACA-FASCICULARIS INFANTS;COLLABORATIVE BEHAVIORAL TERATOLOGY;METHYL MERCURY NEUROTOXICITY;EVOKED-POTENTIAL ALTERATIONS;SEYCHELLES CHILD-DEVELOPMENT;VISUAL RECOGNITION MEMORY;PERINATAL PCB EXPOSURE;ADVERSE EFFECT LEVELS;PRENATAL METHYLMERCURY;Eating,NA,NA,determination of a sitespecific reference dose for methylmercury for fisheating populations

This presentation was subsequently published (Smrchek and Morcock 1999). Recently, there has been a great increase in harmonization activities between OPPTS and OECD. Many additional activities are currently ongoing in five test method areas: physical chemical properties (e.g., K-ow methods), effects on biotic systems (ecological effects, e.g., Lemna growth inhibition, covered elsewhere), fate (degradation and accumulation, e.g., aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation), health effects, and in special activities such as in method development and testing of endocrine disrupters (e.g., avian reproduction, fish whole life cycle). The goal remains as before: to harmonize OPPTS guidelines (eventually to be published final as parts 810-885 in volume 40 of the U.S, Code of Federal Regulations) and test guidance with OECD so as to avoid unnecessary and duplicative testing of those chemicals marketed on a world wide basis, to increase efficiency, save test animals, and to reduce nontariff barriers to trade. The latest harmonization activities and results achieved, with a specific emphasis on aquatic and sediment methods are presented. ASTM has played and must continue to play an important part in the U.S. role in the development of these OECD tests. Recent activities include revision of OECD Test Guideline No. 202, Daphnia sp., Acute Immobilisation Test; development of a new oligochaete reproduction test; two chironomid sediment tests (spiked water and spiked sediment); an oligochaete bioaccumulation test; and a guidance document on Aquatic Toxicity Testing of Difficult Substances and Mixtures. Challenges and potential problems for effective harmonization continue to be present. These can be categorized into internal within the U.S. EPA and external to the agency. The former include having adequate available resources, redistribution and changes in workloads to accommodate OECD work, continual education to demonstrate the advantages of harmonization, and obtaining continued support in an environment of budget constraints. External aspects include challenges from the public, the problem of incurring continuing harmonization costs by U.S. industry, accommodating voluntary standards organizations such as ASTM, and difficulties in developing a ""U.S. position"" on OECD test guidelines. There also continue to be difficulties (not unexpected) in coordination, communication, and cooperation in expert panels and among participating OECD member countries.

Subsequently, recombinant gcSAA protein (rgcSAA) was prepared from a prokaryotic expression system after codon optimization of its coding sequence. The direct antibacterial activity assay and the plate count assay disclosed that gcSAA inhibited the growth and survival of A. hydrophila but not Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida) which both are common bacterial pathogens in aquaculture. The propidium iodide (PI) uptake assay confirmed the bactericidal property of gcSAA, showing that it is able to enhance the uptake of PI in A. hydrophila but not E. piscicida.

In the present study, we reported the functional characterization of zebrafish nos2a during bacterial infection. We found that zebrafish nos2a promoted bacterial proliferation, accompanied by an increased susceptibility to Edwardsiella piscicida infection. The nagative regulation of zebrafish nos2a during E. piscicida infection was characterized by the impaired ROS levels, the induced NO production and the decreased expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, antibacterial genes and oxidant factors. Furthermore, although both inducing ROS and inhibiting NO production significantly inhibited bacterial proliferation, only inhibiting NO production but not inducing ROS significantly increased resistance to E. piscicida infection. More importantly, ROS supplementation and inhibition of NO completely abolished this detrimental consequence mediated by zebrafish nos2a during E. piscicida infection. All together, these results firstly demonstrate that the innate response mediated by zebrafish nos2a in promoting bacterial proliferation is dependent on the lower ROS level and higher NO production.

Thereby, tambaqui specimens were submitted to two different Trichlorfon concentrations (30% and 50% of LC50-96 h) under experimental conditions. The retrotransposons were analyzed using the FISH technique and the heterochromatin standard with the C-band technique. The retrotransposons studied presented a dispersed distribution profile in the tambaqui karyotype with Rex3 being more prominent than the others, showing the greatest increase in markings. Furthermore, the heterochromatin profile showed that these retrotransposons can be found in the heterochromatic portions of the chromosomes. Thus, it was observed that Trichlorfon has an activation mechanism for these retroelements, especially Rex3. Rex retroelements are the best-known transposable elements class and are broadly distributed through fish and also individual genomes, playing an important role in their evolutionary dynamics. Several agents can stress these elements; among them, there are some parasitic compounds such as the organochlorophosphate Trichlorfon. Consequently, knowing that the organochlorophosphate Trichlorfon is indiscriminately used as an antiparasitic in aquaculture, the current study aimed to analyze the effects of this compound on the activation of the Transposable Elements (TEs) Rex1, Rex3, and Rex6 and the structure of heterochromatin in the mitotic chromosomes of the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum). For this, two concentrations of the pesticide were used: 30% (0.261 mg/L) and 50% (0.435 mg/L) of the recommended LC50-96 h concentration (0.87 mg/L) for this fish species. The results revealed a dispersed distribution for Rex1 and Rex6 retroelements. Rex3 showed an increase in both marking intensity and distribution, as well as enhanced chromosomal heterochromatinization. This probably happened by the mediation of epigenetic adaptive mechanisms, causing the retroelement mobilization to be repressed. However, this behavior was most evident when Trichlorfon concentrations and exposure times were the greatest, reflecting the genetic flexibility necessary for this species to successfully adapt to environmental changes.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  44,10.3390/ani12151945     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FISH;heterochromatinization;organophosphate;repetitive elements;TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS;REPETITIVE DNA;ORGANOPHOSPHORUS PESTICIDES;REX3;CHARACIFORMES;SEQUENCES;CATFISH;GENES;Trichlorfon;Antiparasitic Agents,NA,NA,a perspective of molecular cytogenomics toxicology and epigenetics for the increase of heterochromatic regions and retrotransposable elements in tambaqui <i>colossoma macropomum<i> exposed to the parasiticide trichlorfon

Two radar surveillance stations were installed on Sivuqaq, including at the Northeast Cape. High levels of persistent organic pollutants and toxic metals continue to leach from the Northeast Cape formerly used defense (FUD) site despite remediation efforts.

We found that Hg and PCB concentrations significantly differed across locations, with the highest concentrations found in fish collected near the FUD site. We found that 89% of fish collected from near the FUD site had Hg concentrations that exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) unlimited Hg-contaminated fish consumption screening level for subsistence fishers (0.049 mu g/g). All fish sampled near the FUD site exceeded the EPA's PCB guidelines for cancer risk for unrestricted human consumption (0.0015 mu g/g ww).

However, there is little information about how culturally specific fish consumption contributes to exposure to toxicants. In this work, we surveyed fish consumption among Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese communities and purchased 103 seafood samples from local markets in Chicago. Each sample was analyzed for mercury (Hg) and 92 organic chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and Dechlorane Plus and related compounds (DPs). The rank order of pollutant concentration in all samples was Hg >> Sigma(66)PCBs > Sigma(17)OCPs > Sigma 8PBDEs > Sigma(8)DPs. Positive correlations were noted among most contaminant groups. Bluefish, pike, tuna steak, and albacore tuna had the highest mean Hg (>300 ng/g). The mean Sigma(66)PCBs was highest in pike and bluefish (>100 ng/g) followed by pollock and mackerel (>40 ng/g). Overall, octopus, shrimp and tilapia were the least contaminated; while pike, bluefish, and pollock were the most contaminated. Omega-3 fatty acids were more strongly affiliated with the organic contaminants than mercury. A risk assessment identified seven types of fish that should have consumption limitations and six that should not be consumed. For these seafoods, consumption advice based on Hg levels would adequately protect health, except for mackerel. In the survey participants, 10.3% of seafood mass consumed is from types of fish that should be limited to 1 or 2 meals/week, while 1.3% of the seafood mass consumed comes from types that should not be consumed at all.

In the present study, we identified and characterized a Ly-6D homologue (named PoLy-6D) from the teleost fish Paralichthys olivaceus and examined its immune function. PoLy-6D possesses a hydrophobic signal peptide, a LU domain including a conserved ""LXCXXC"" motif in N-terminus and a ""CCXXXXCN"" motif in C-terminus. Under normal physiological condition, PoLy-6D expression distributes in all the examined tissues, the highest three tissues are successively spleen, head kidney, and blood. When infected by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and viral pathogen, PoLy-6D expression was induced and the patterns vary with different types of microbial pathogens infection and different immune tissues. In vitro experiment showed recombinant PoLy-6D (rPoLy-6D) inhibited the lysis of rabbit red blood cells by serum and selectively improved bacterial survival in serum. After serum were treated by antibody of rPoLy-6D, bacteriostatic effect of serum was obviously enhanced. These results indicate the importance of PoLy-6D as a complement regulator. rPoLy-6D possessed the binding activity to multiple bacteria but did not exhibit antimicrobial activities. The interaction between rPoLy-6D and bacteria suggests that PoLy-6D is involved in host clearance of pathogens probably by serving as a receptor for pathogens.

T.Norl.) is a significant environmental weed in coastal New South Wales (NSW). Control of extensive infestations of bitou bush within native vegetation can be undertaken using aerial herbicide application. Aerial spraying to control bitou bush proved to be a suitable control option following herbicide studies on native plant species which showed they were tolerant to the aerial application at very low rates during winter months (Toth et al. 1993). This technique was developed following ground based herbicide trials carried out in the late 1980s near Jervis Bay, NSW, in which six herbicides were initially trialled for the control of bitou bush. At the same time, a permit was granted to deliberately apply the same herbicides to seven native plant species, being Acacia longifolia subsp. sophorae (Labill.) Court, Banksia integrifolia L.f., Casuarina glauca Sieber ex Spreng., Leptospermum laevigatum (Gaertn.) F.Muell., Leucopogon parviflorus (Andrews) Lindl., Monotoca elliptica (Sm.) R.Br. and Lomandra longifolia Labill., to determine their response to off-target damage associated with bitou bush control. The results showed that only herbicides containing glyphosate or metsulfuron methyl as the only active ingredient were effective for controlling bitou bush (Toth et al. 1996). In addition, the effect of low rates of glyphosate on the native species produced no measurable damage, and low rates of metsulfuron methyl resulted in only ephemeral damage to L. laevigatum and L. parviflorus. Hence these two herbicides proved sufficiently selective for bitou bush (Toth et al. 1993). A subsequent trial was undertaken to examine the seasonal sensitivity of bitou bush to glyphosate and metsulfuron methyl. These herbicides were also trialled to determine an effective application rate for bitou bush control amongst native species. The two-year trial indicated that bitou bush is at least twice as sensitive to glyphosate in winter than during summer, especially following peak winter flowering (Toth 1997). There was no apparent trend with metsulfuron methyl. Effective bitou bush control during the winter was also achieved with very low rates of both herbicides. Similar seasonal and rate trials were subsequently carried out on five of the native plant species, being A. longifolia subsp. sophorae, B. integrifolia, L. laevigatum, L. parviflorus and L. longifolia to examine if there was also a seasonal and application rate tolerance. The results showed a seasonal tolerance of these native plants to low rates of herbicides applied during winter. However, seedlings of A. longifolia subsp. sophorae showed some sensitivity to glyphosate (Toth et al. 1996). The combined results indicated that low rates of glyphosate and metsulfuron methyl applied during winter not only controlled bitou bush, but were unlikely to result in significant off-target damage to native plant species. Independently, Anderson (1989) trialled aerial boom spraying of bitou bush at 8 L ha-1 of glyphosate [four times the current rate] at South Stradbroke Island which showed control was selective for bitou bush with little damage to native species. However subsequent examination showed that three species may be adversely impacted (see Toth et al. 1996); further analysis of these three species following control at 2 L ha-1 shows that such impacts are likely to be reduced at the lower application rates currently used. A series of herbicide trials were then carried out using aerial boom spraying in NSW in which very low rates of glyphosate (2 L ha-1 of Roundup¬Æ (36 g L-1 glyphosate)) and metsulfuron methyl (30g L-1 of Brushoff¬Æ (600 g kg-1 metsulfuron methyl)) were applied to bitou bush infestations. These results supported the original ground based trials described above. Penetrants were also trialled during the ground based herbicide applications for glyphosate and metsulfuron methyl. The addition of Pulse¬Æ (1020 g L-1 polyether modified polysiloxane) had a negative effect on L. lavigatum in that it lead to a greater degree of leaf burn. Based on this result Pulse¬Æ has not been recommended for use in the aerial spraying of bitou bush (Toth et al. 1996). A further trial in 1997 examined the potential use of Roundup Bioactive¬Æ (36 g L-1 glyphosate) for aerial spraying of bitou bush, however, the results indicated that Roundup Bioactive is more phytotoxic to the following five native plant species Scaevola calendulacea (Andrews) Druce, Carpobrotus glaucescens (Haw.) Schwantes, Myoporum boninense Koidz. and Correa alba Andrews, than either Roundup¬Æ or Brush-off¬Æ (Toth unpublished data). As no other herbicide was used in this trial the results do not necessarily translate to other generic brands of glyphosate or metsulfuron methyl. Using aerial boom spraying to control bitou bush in New South Wales Aerial boom spraying (hereafter aerial spraying) to control bitou bush has been undertaken along the NSW coastline between Narooma and Tweed Heads since 1992. However, it was not until 2006 that best practice guidelines were developed (Broese van Groenou and Downey 2006). The guidelines, which are a checklist of events in chronological order, highlight the complexity of aerial spraying for weeds, especially in natural ecosystems, and the degree of coordination and knowledge needed to undertake aerial spraying. These guidelines are now used widely when planning and undertaking aerial spraying of bitou bush in NSW. The outcome of 15 years of aerial spraying to control bitou bush in New South Wales has revealed that while large areas can be treated effectively, follow-up control is essential to managing bitou bush recruitment, as well as secondary weed invasion, after each aerial spraying operation. And, more importantly, that aerial spraying should only be undertaken when resources are available to undertake such follow-up control work. Where areas are being aerially sprayed on a regular basis (i.e. annually), the use of one application of metsulfuron methyl may help to prevent any possibility of herbicide resistance to glyphosate developing in bitou bush. Repetitive use of metsulfuron methyl in annual applications is not recommended at this stage because of the residual effects of metsulfuron methyl and comparatively less information available on its impact to native species. To assist with revegetation, aerial direct seeding during aerial spraying operations has also been employed in some areas. The results of these aerial seeding trials are inconclusive due to the influence from a number of external factors. For example, success when using scarified seeds is dependent on rain within several days of the application. However if rain does not occur, seed viability can decrease dramatically. Aerial spraying has proved to be efficient and cost effective for broad-acre control of bitou bush in NSW compared to ground based herbicide application, especially over large areas and in areas that are otherwise inaccessible (e.g. coastal cliffs). Developing an aerial spot spraying methodology In the past few years, another method of aerial control has been developed for bitou bush. The technique, known as aerial spot spraying, uses ground based spraying equipment mounted onto a helicopter. This spray rig has a modified nozzle within a metal conical casing which is lowered from the helicopter directly over the targeted plants. The herbicide can therefore be applied to individual or isolated bitou bush plants within native vegetation or in inaccessible areas (e.g. cliff faces). This technique has been used widely over the past few years and is now contributing to the aerial management of bitou bush in NSW. It must be noted that this techniques uses ground based application rates of herbicide and not the low herbicide rates used in aerial boom spraying. Assessing the impact of aerial spraying on native species In addition to the seven native species originally tested for herbicide sensitivity (see above), further information has been gathered over the past 15 years on the herbicide sensitivity of other plant species (native and weeds). This observational data has been collected on the response of 220 plant species (weeds and natives) to glyphosate and 83 to metsulfuron methyl to date (see Broese van Groenou and Downey 2006). However information is still needed for many native plant species, particularly in relation to their response to metsulfuron methyl. It should be noted that these data are based on results from basic formulations of glyphosate (i.e. Roundup¬Æ - 36 g L-1 glyphosate) and metsulfuron methyl (Brushoff¬Æ - 600 g kg-1 metsulfuron methyl) only. Thus, further research is needed into other formulations, as extrapolations to such formulations are not warranted based on the trials with penetrants (see above). The effect of aerial spraying on rare and endangered species is of particular significance, for example research by Matarczyk et al. (2002) found that spray drift from ground-based applications of glyphosate can adversely impact populations of Pimelea spicata R.Br., an endangered species in NSW. It is therefore important to take a precautionary approach and locate rare and threatened species on each site prior to aerial spraying, so that these areas can be appropriately protected from any potential adverse impacts (see Broese van Groenou and Downey 2006). These species can either be excluded from the aerial spraying area with suitable buffers demarcated, or in some instances covered, for example with hessian (see Broese van Groenou and Downey 2006).",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 7,,Acacia;Acacia longifolia;Banksia integrifolia;Carpobrotus;Casuarina glauca;Chrysanthemoides monilifera;Leptospermum;Leptospermum laevigatum;Leucopogon parviflorus;Lomandra longifolia;Monotoca elliptica;Myoporum;Myoporum boninense;Pimelea spicata;Scaevola calendulacea;New South Wales;Wales;Learning,NA,NA,bitou bush aerial spraying in new south wales what have we learned

It has a widespread, though declining distribution in England and parts of Wales but does not occur naturally in Scotland. The North American signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana), is not native to Europe and was introduced to Britain in the 1970s. The signal crayfish out-competes the native white-clawed crayfish as it is larger and more aggressive. It is also responsible for the introduction and spread of crayfish plague, which has devastated white-clawed crayfish populations in Europe. Signal crayfish populations are causing significant changes to the equilibrium of native flora and fauna through increased grazing and predation pressures; they also contribute to habitat degradation through burrowing. Manual removal of crayfish using traps and pond trials with biocides have met with moderate success in reducing crayfish numbers and containing populations. However, with new populations of signal crayfish being reported each year within the UK, there is now an urgent need to develop a strategy with which to eradicate or contain their spread. Signal crayfish have populated many habitat types in the UK, each of which may require a different control strategy; hence no single strategy or universal solution is likely to be attainable. Signal crayfish are susceptible to various biocides and microbial pathogens but significant scientific research will be required to develop safe biological control methods and integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to control these invasive organisms. ¬© 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 81; Correspondence Address: M.

Sediment grab sample results were interpolated to produce a map that showed the area to be dominated by mud (1246 km2, 40%) and sand/shell sediments (780 km2, 25%). A total of 201 taxa were recorded and over 5800 individual specimens were processed, revealing that the sediments hold varying community compositions, with annelids being the dominant group (73%) followed by crustaceans (14%). Relationships were evident between community, feeding guilds, and sediment types, which give an indication of communities that can be expected in similar sediments in other areas of the Tropical Eastern Pacific.

Freshwater bodies which chemistry is dominated by dissolved humic substances (HS) seem to be the major type on Earth, due to huge non-calcareous geological formations in the Northern Hemisphere and in the tropics. Based on the paradigm of the inertness of being organic, direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms are mostly neglected. However, dissolved organic carbon, the majority of which being HS, are natural environmental chemicals and should therefore directly interact with organisms. Major results that widened our perspective on humic substance ecology come from experiments with the compost nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, which behaved contradictorily to textbook knowledge and provoked an in-depth re-consideration of some paradigms. Approach. To overcome old paradigms on HS and their potential interactions with organisms, we reviewed recent international literature, as well as 'grey' literature. We also include results from own ongoing studies. Results. This review focuses on direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms and disregards indirect effects, such as under-water light quenching. Instead we show with some macrophyte and algal species that HS adversely interfere with photosynthesis and growth, whereby closely related algal species show different response patterns. In addition to this, HS suppress cyanobacteria more than eukaryotic algae. Quinones in the HS appear to be the effective structure. Furthermore, HS can modulate the offspring numbers in the nematode C. elegans and cause feminization of fish and amphibians - they possess hormone-like properties. The ecological consequences of this potential remain obscure at present. HS also have the potential to act as chemical attractants as shown with C. elegans and exert a mild chemical stress upon aquatic organisms in many ways: induction of molecular chaperons (stress proteins), induction and modulation of biotransformation and anti-oxidant enzymes. Furthermore, they produce an oxidative stress with lipidperoxidation as one clear symptom or even stress defense strategy. Stronger chemical stresses by HS may even lead to teratogenic effects as shown with fish embryos; all physiological responses to HS-mediated stress require energy, which were compensated on the expense of yolk as shown with zebra fish embryos. One Finnish field survey supports the view of a strong chemical stress, as the weight yield in fish species decreases with increasing HS content in the lakes. Discussion. HS exert a variety of stress symptoms in aquatic and compost organisms. According to current paradigms of ecotoxicology, these symptoms have to be considered adverse, because their compensation consumes energy which is deducted from the main metabolism. However, the nematode C. elegans looks actively for such stressful environments, and this behavior is only understandable in the light of new paradigms of aging mechanisms, particularly the Green Theory of Aging. In this respect, we discuss the mild HS-mediated stress to aquatic and compost organisms. New empirical findings with HS themselves and HS building blocks appear to be consistent with this emerging paradigm and show that the individual lifespan may be expanded. At present the ecological consequences of these findings remain obscure. However, a multiple-stress resistance may be acquired which improves the individual fitness in a fluctuating environment. Conclusions. It appears that dissolved HS have to be considered abiotic ecological driving forces, somewhat less obvious than temperature, nutrients, or light. Perspectives. The understanding of the ecological control by dissolved humic substances is still fragmentary and needs to be studied in more details. ¬© 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 107; Correspondence Address: C.

Taihu Basin is one of the most developed regions of China. Over the past decades, especially since the reforming and opening-up of China in 1980s, the lake has received more and more pressure from a variety of interlinked human activities, including industrial pollution, fertilizer and pesticide application, eutrophication, overfishing, etc. Water quality has been deteriorating sharply in the lake. In this paper, we made a comprehensive assessment of the environmental and socio-economic issues to affect Taihu Lake ecosystem health. Pollution was identified as the most serious environmental concern. The root causes of these environmental problems are recognized to be diverse, including dense population, high urbanization, heavy industrialization, fast economic development, insufficient sewage treatment, weak public awareness of environment conservation, and lack of institutional capacity and insufficient enforcement through regulations and legislation. On the policy part, past and current policies and measures are reviewed, especially the ""Zero"" discharge action and phosphate ban in detergents in Taihu Basin. In order to mitigate environmental problems, some further policy options have been proposed, including: improving the fishery management; strengthening cross- provincial collaboration; making efforts to reduce flood disaster and increasing investment to new environmental protection technologies. It is important to assess the economic, social and environmental values of natural resources (soil, water and organisms) in order to allocate them efficiently and fairly between the present and future generations. ¬© 2009 Higher Education Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 22; Correspondence Address: Y.

We raise a concern that generally longer living birds in warmer climates, laying fewer eggs per clutch, might be at increased risk when compared with trophically similar birds exposed to equivalent levels of pollution in colder climates. Given the scarcity of water and the high biodiversity in Southern Africa, climate change will exert strong pressure, and any additional anthropogenic contamination at levels that can cause subtle behavioural, developmental and reproductive changes, can have serious effects. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Human exposure to toxaphene is mainly through consumption of contaminated fish, therefore fish-borne residues of toxaphene (cod liver extract, CLE) were prepared by exposing cod to technical toxaphene (TT) for 63 days. UV-irradiated toxaphene (uvT) was included to represent a physico-chemical weathered toxaphene mixture. In vitro, TT, uvT and CLE all showed a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) with a relative potency of CLE > TT = uvT. Tumour promoting potency was further studied in vivo in a medium term two-stage initiation/promotion bioassay in female Sprague-Dawley rats, using an increase in altered hepatic foci positive for glutathione-S-transferase-P (AHF-GST-P) as read out. No increase in AHF-GST-P occurred following exposure to either TT, uvT, or CLE, except for the positive control group (2,3,7,8-TCDD). Based on this study the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for tumour promoting potency is at least 12.5 mg/kg/week, or higher for CLE. Considering current human exposure levels in Europe it is doubtful that consumption of fish at current levels of toxaphene contamination give rise to human health risk. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover direct sunlight irradiation in this area caused pronounced photodegradation. These conditions bring about the distinct fate and distribution of hazardous pollutant transported by surface water into the estuarine. This study elucidates the influence of tropical climate to the behavior of agrochemicals and heavy metals transported into, in and out of Segara Anakan. Segara Anakan is an extremely productive tropical lagoon estuary ecosystem, that plays a critical role in the productivity of the coastal waters and as supporting rich fisheries resource within its boundaries. The study was carried out from July 2003 to March 2004. Diurnal water characteristics showed that water temperature was relatively constant, salinity was influenced by tidal wave inlet from Indian Ocean, but in wet season, the salinity was dominated by fresh water inflow at high velocity from rivers surrounding Segara Anakan estuary. The most dominating characteristic in this ecosystem was the amount of rainfall. Based on the observed rainfall data, the condition was differentiated in: dry season from July to September 2003, changing period from dry season to wet season considered as early wet season, from October to November2003, wet season from December 2003 to March 2004, and changing period from wet season to dry season considered as late wet season, from April to May 2004. The texture of newly sediment deposited in Segara Anakan, i.e. the upper (5 cm) layer, changes with season, indicating of different sediment origin. During the dry season, the salinity was high, causing nutrients, micropollutants such as organochlorine pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and heavy metals bonded or sorbed into the sediments. Sorption-desorption processes between upper layer sedimen and water was clearly showed in heavy metals capable in chlorocomplex forming i.e. Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg.. In dry season their bioavailability increases, therefore they could be determined in Geloina spp and Mugil spp. Due to its lipophylicity, in saline water organochlorines are bioaccumulated in lipid rich tissues, causing higher level in Mugil spp. than in Geloina spp. In case of PAH, due to the limited capability to metabolize PAHs, higher bio-accumulation factor of the carcinogenic benzo(a)pyrene were observed in Geloina spp. During the wet season fresh water inflow at high velocity bringing run-off material into the estuary and decreases its salinity, increases the total suspended solids, similarly the turbidity, causing plankton diversity and density to decrease. Further, the washing out of micro pollutant by suspended solid transportation was established. The trace metals, Cu, Ni, Zn, Cr in sediment were determined at lower level than in 1994. Compared to the measurements of OCs in Mugil sp. at 1994, the level of OCs in this study are lower. Owing to the complex interaction of ecological and physicochemical parameters, socialeconomic level and food habit of local people, it is difficult to draw a general policy for food safety concerning heavy metal level in seafood of Segara Anakan, however, concerning the organochlorine level, the seafood of Segara Anakan are safe to consume. ¬© 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It is used primarily as a molluscicide to control slugs and snails in a very wide range of gardens and croplands worldwide. Secondary use of this pesticide is for the control of fish, leeches, and frogs. In recent years, a widespread concern about the increasing number of poisoning incidents that have occurred in pets, birds, and wild animals are registered. Poisoning cases have also been encountered in large animals. This chapter describes the toxicity of metaldehyde and its metabolites in mammalian and avian species. Metaldehyde is toxic to all animals. Secondary poisoning is also not uncommon. It is highly toxic by inhalation, moderately toxic by ingestion, and slightly toxic by dermal absorption. Ingestion is the most common route of poisoning. Most of the time, metaldehyde poisoning is acute in nature and results from accidental or malicious activity. The poisoning is characterized by neurological signs such as violent convulsions and seizures. Without timely and aggressive treatment, death ensues due to respiratory failure. Because no specific antidote is available, treatment relies upon supportive and symptomatic therapies. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet little attention has been directed at the messages people are receiving from fish consumption advisories. This study examines knowledge about the benefits and risks of fish in relation to ethnicity and the degree of knowledge in a general university population in New Jersey. Subjects were asked open-ended questions about risks and benefits and responses were grouped into categories. A far greater percent of people had heard something about the risks and benefits of eating fish than could report specific information about the risks or benefits. While only 16% of subjects did not know what the benefits of eating fish were, 62% did not have any specific information about why there were warnings. However, for people who had some specific information, a higher proportion (57%) could identify the chemicals (PCBs, mercury) causing the risks, than could identify omega-3 fatty acids as contributing to benefits (40%). Much of the knowledge was very general, such as eating fish is ""good for the heart"", ""good for you"", or ""brain food"". Less than half of the subjects could name species of fish that were either high or low in contaminants. There were ethnic disparities in knowledge about both the benefits and the risks from fish consumption. A higher percentage of whites knew about both the benefits and risks of fish consumption than others; Asians knew the least about the risks, and blacks and hispanics knew the least about the benefits. There were also ethnic differences in ability to name fish that are low in contaminants, or high in contaminants. Minorities, particularly hispanics, were unable to list species that are high in contaminants. We identified three levels of knowledge about fish consumption: 1) whether people are aware of the risks or benefits of fish consumption, 2) whether they have any specific knowledge about the benefits or risks from fish consumption, and 3) whether that knowledge is correct. We suggest that for people to make informed decisions about whether to eat fish, and what fish to eat (amount, fish size, species), they must have knowledge at all three levels about both the risks and benefits. Although agencies such as FDA are concerned that the public will be confused by advisory details, we find that the lack of details is a major component of ineffective communication. To provide the public with sufficient information to make sound risk decisions, public agencies and the media have to provide clearer, more directed messages dealing with the basis for making risk decisions. ¬© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this pursuit, India has recently embarked upon a highly innovative programme for disseminating the portfolio of services emanating from the space systems, as well as other Information Technology (IT) tools, directly down-the-line to the rural communities, through a 'single window', - the Village Resource Centres (VRCs). The VRCs, at their minimal, are characterized by: (i) digital connectivity for videoconferencing and information transfer, linking them with knowledge centers and specialty hospitals, enabled through the INSAT satellite; (ii) repository of spatial information on natural resources generated using the 1RS data; (iii) host of information pertaining to management of natural resources and socio-economic relevance; and (iv) limited facilities for primary healthcare services and distance learning. With the participation of stakeholders, the VRCs are also catalyzing rural entrepreneurship, and facilitating e-Governance and other services of social relevance. The VRCs, essentially being a 'Community Resource', are being implemented in partnership with Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) working at the grassroots. The portfolio of services delivered by the VRCs include: tele-education - focusing on vocational training in support of alternate livelihood, supplementary teaching to rural children, non-formal and adult education; tele-healthcare - focusing on preventive and curative healthcare at primary level; information on land and water resources derived from high-resolution 1RS images - for better management of the land resources; interactive advisories to villagers - wherein experts at knowledge centers discuss with them on cropping systems, optimization of agricultural inputs (seeds, water, fertilizer, insecticides, pesticides, etc.), producer-oriented marketing opportunities, crop insurance, etc; tele-fishery - providing satellite derived information and advisories on Potential Fishing Zones (PFZ) in those VRCs located in coastal tracts; e-Governance -information and guidance to local people on village-oriented governmental schemes on agriculture, poverty alleviation, rural employment, social safety nets and other basic entitlements, animal husbandry and livestock related, micro-finance related, etc; and local weather and agro-meteorology advisory. Over 200 VRCs set up across different regions of the country are already benefiting over a million people on a dayto-day basis. The VRCs are also being populated across all the rural/ semi-urban tracts in India. The VRCs are found to be a unique means of integrating the Satellite Communication and Earth Observation technologies in reaching out to the grassroots in a timely and cost effective manner. Further, the leanings from this effort would also be useful in refining the space systems themselves and development of newer applications for the benefit of the society. The paper while highlighting the programmatic focus of VRCs also places emphasis on sustainability of such efforts in the long run, their ownerships from intermediary to stakeholders themselves and their increasing roles in globalized world for the access and outreach to community needs and aspirations.

Algae are considered less dangerous than cyanobacteria, because even if they can proliferate quite intensively in eutrophic fresh waters, they rarely accumulate to form dense surface blooms like blue-green algae do. Thus the toxins they produce do no accumulate to levels high enough to become hazardous to human and animals health. Cyanobacteria: both planktonic and benthic species, can instead form huge agglomeration close to the shore, which can become very dense and concentrated. This material can take a long time to disperse and so become a risk for human health and mainly for animals, which can easely enter in contact with poisoned water. Lots of blue-green algae species have been found to produce toxins, and some authors assume that it could be prudent to assume that any cyanobacterial population can have a toxic potential. At present known toxins are classified as neurotoxins (anatoxin-a, anatoxina(s) and saxitoxin), cytotoxin or cylindrospermopsin and microcystins or nodularins. Anyway, starting from existing studies, it seems likely that other unidentified toxins exists. Neurotoxins: act by blocking neuronal signal transmission with two main mechanisms: anatoxins act as acetylcholine mimic (anatoxin-a) or as cholinesterase inhibitor (anatoxin-a (s)), causing an organophosphate like syndrome, while saxitoxin acts by blocking the sodium channel, thus disrupting sodium balance into nerve cells. Despite their high toxicity, their only occasionally are responsible of human intoxication, while neurotoxicity may be experienced by livestock and pets, that can drink polluted water or ingest scum material. Cytotoxin: is an alkaloid that blocks protein synthesis by binding to DNA or RNA. It's responsible for cytogenetic damages via DNA strand breaks and loss of whole chromosomes (aneuploidy) and has proved to be potentially carcinogenetic. Finally, it was found that cylindrospermopsin toxicity is associated with significant losses of glutathione and depletion of glutathione results in cell death. The fall in glutathione levels is due to an inhibition of the final common pathway of glutathione synthesis, and this in turn contributes to cylindrospermopsin cytotoxicity, as lower cell glutathione levels predispose to cylindrospermopsin toxicity. Numerous reports involving the poisoning of farm and wild animals following drinking water from lakes and ponds containing surface scum from cyanobacterial blooms exist, most have been documented in Australia. Australia was also interested by human poisoning episodes via drinking water, with patients escaping death only through skilled and intensive hospital care. Microcystins: are the most frequently occurring and widespread of the cyanotoxins; they act by blocking protein phosphatases 1 and 2a, causing toxicity at the hepatic level, as they use bile carrier to pass through cell membranes. Microcystins toxicity is greater after intraperitoneal injection, but also intranasal exposure showed high toxicity, being this uptake route relevant for water sports activities (i.e. waterskiing). Nodularins toxicity has shown to be cumulative, as a single oral dose resulted in no hepatic damage, while the same dose applied daily over several days caused hepatic injury. Microcystins have also shown to be tumor-promoting agents, as they can increase the incidence of hepatic tumors in human too. Concerning Fresh Water Algae: their toxicity is considerably lower than that of cyanobacteria, because algae do not have effective mechanism of accumulation and the toxic potency of their toxins is several order of magnitude lower than that of cyanotoxins. Available data reports about dinoflagellates within or related to the Peridinium genus as potential producers of toxins (ichtyotoxins). Ichtyotoxins caused fish kills and have shown to have an algicidal effect on the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa. It is possible that toxic blooms of dinoflagellates in freshwater occur more frequently than reported and that they affect the biota in those habitats. Toxins production is considered as a defensive strategy for dinoflagellates from fish larvae preying. In human some allergic reaction has been reported after Uroglena spp. and Gonyostomum semen exposure, but clear toxic episode was reported. ¬© Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: A.

Scott Center for Neuroscience, Mind and Behavior, Department of Biological Sciences, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH 43403, United States","Previous research suggests that agricultural herbicides interfere with olfactory-mediated behavior, such as responses to alarm signals and the ability to locate food, in aquatic organisms. In crayfish, aggressive interactions are also mediated by chemical signals. These social signals are important in establishing dominance, which in turn has an impact on an individual's ability to find and use mates, food, and habitat space. In this study, we investigated the impact of exposure to sublethal levels of the herbicide metolachlor on the ability of crayfish to respond to olfactory signals used in agonistic behaviors. Crayfish were exposed to three different environmentally relevant concentrations (60 ppb, 70 ppb, and 80 ppb) of metolachlor for 96 hours. Each exposed crayfish was then placed in a fight arena and was allowed to interact with a na√Øve, untreated crayfish for 15 minutes. We analyzed several characteristics of fighting behavior, including initial aggressiveness, time to fight, intensity levels, duration, number of encounters, and the winner and loser of each fight. Crayfish exposed to 80 ppb metolachlor were less likely to initiate and win encounters against na√Øve conspecifics than any other treatment group. Analysis of fight dynamics shows that metolachlor does not alter the temporal fighting dynamics within crayfish aggression. We conclude that high sublethal concentrations of metolachlor may be interfering with the ability of crayfish to receive or respond to social signals and thus affect certain agonistic behaviors. ¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 53; Correspondence Address: P.

The effects of biofouling include increased drag and fuel consumption, delayed transports times, higher cleaning costs, more frequent dry docking cycles and the translocation of invasive marine species. The effective control of fouling is therefore crucial to minimise the costs to the shipping industry and to mitigate the spread of invasive species. Previously the control of fouling was predominately based on heavy metals and pesticides. There is now a wide recognition that non-toxic alternatives are required to minimise the impact to non-target marine species. In this study natural antifouling systems are investigated. The surface of the blue mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, is used as a model to determine what characterises a fouling resistant surface. Microtextured ripples (1-2 Œºm) were discovered on the surface of the blue mussel, which correlated to low fouling cover. The surface features of 36 other species of shellfish were characterised and a variety of microtopographies were discovered. The surface roughness properties of these shell surfaces correlated to fouling resistance and removal. When the microtopographies of selected shell surfaces were mimicked, those surfaces that provided fewer attachment points reduced the settlement of a wide range of fouling organisms. Extracts derived from the surface of the blue mussel have also been successful in deterring the attachment of certain microfoulers. Other novel non-toxic solutions to control biofouling are presented including extreme wettabilities and foul-release surfaces.

Inter-sex condition did not occur and testicular and ovarian cells appeared normal for the respective developmental stage and we observed no morphological alteration in fish. The population-level impacts of these findings are uncertain. Studies examining the long-term, generational and behavioral effects to aquatic organisms chronically exposed to low levels of OWC mixtures are needed. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: D.B.
