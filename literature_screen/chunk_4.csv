Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is a popular alternative to brominated flame retardant and halogenated OPFRs. Neurodevelopmental toxicity is TPHP's primary adverse effect, whereas the biomarkers and the modes of action have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg of TPHP were orally administered to mice from postnatal day 10 (P10) to P70. The behavioral tests showed a compromised learning and memory capability. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus exposed to 0.5 or 50 mg/kg of TPHP identified 531 differentially expressed proteins that were mainly involved in axon guidance, synaptic function, neurotransmitter transport, exocytosis, and energy metabolism. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis showed that exposure to TPHP reduced the protein levels of TUBB3 and SYP in the synapses of hippocampal neurons. TPHP exposure also downregulated the gene expression of neurotransmitter receptors including Grins, Htr1α, and Adra1α in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, the calcium-dependent synaptic exocytosis governed by synaptic vesicle proteins STX1A and SYT1 was inhibited in the TPHP-treated hippocampus. Our results reveal that TPHP exposure causes abnormal learning and memory behaviors by disturbing synaptogenesis and neurotransmission. © 2020","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 34; Correspondence Address: Y.

Many Carp management methods have been applied including physical removal, pesticide treatments of whole lakes, and water drawdowns. Herein, we tested key elements of a potential “bait and switch” approach in which corn could be used to induce feeding aggregations of Carp and then switched for corn pellets with a pesticide Antimycin-A (ANT-A) to selectively target the Carp. First, laboratory experiments were used to determine if addition of lethal concentrations of ANT-A to corn pellets deterred Carp from eating corn-based food pellets. Second, a pond experiment tested if a corn-based bait containing ANT-A functioned as a species-specific Carp management tool in a semi-natural environment with three common native fishes: White Sucker (Catostomus commersonii Lacepède, 1803), Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens, Mitchill, 1814), and Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque, 1819). The use of baited sites by Carp and native species was monitored using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Mortality of each species and presence of corn in their digestive tracts was also monitored. Our laboratory experiment showed that presence of ANT-A did not deter Carp from consuming the pellets. The pond experiment showed that only Carp perished in significant numbers once toxic bait was applied. Further, only Carp increased their use of baited sites once baiting began, and only Carp had corn in their digestive tracts. Overall, our results indicate that corn might function as a species-specific Carp attractant in systems of North American Midwest and that corn-based bait can be used to effectively conceal a lethal dose of ANT-A. Further research is necessary to refine this potential management tool, specifically investigating the behavioral and social dynamics of Carp aggregating at sites baited with corn to enhance the temporal and spatial specificity of pesticide application. © Hundt et al.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: P.J.

In present studies, Nineteen maize inbreds selected from diverse sources were characterized for resistance traits against shoot fly under its natural infestation using moistened fishmeal. Though the antixenosis to shoot fly for oviposition was not observed in the test genotypes. But, the presence of significant variation in the deadhearts incidence revealed the existence of relative amount of resistance among the test genotypes. The Tolerance (measured in the terms of less proportion of deadhearts out of total shoot fly incidence (leaf injury + deadhearts)) and Antibiosis (in terms of larval and pupal weight, duration and survival) were recognized as key mechanisms of this resistance. Tolerance to shoot fly was significantly more in resistant inbreds, SO1SHYQBBB13B, HK12-6-2-4, DMSC 28, CM 143 and Winpop 8 (29.46–36.56%) in comparison to the susceptible genotypes SE 563 and LM 16 (46.31–47.44%). The correlation and stepwise regression analyses revealed that the more seedling vigor, less leaf area, less number of leaves and thin stem had significant impact on the shoot fly deadhearts incidence and provided resistance against this pest. The total soluble sugars (TSS), proteins and amino acids were significantly higher in the susceptible inbreds; whereas, total phenols and tannins; and activities of defensive enzymes viz. phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were significantly higher in resistant inbreds. Further, the stepwise regression revealed that the larval period, per cent pupation, pupal weight female, pupal weight male and adult emergence of shoot fly were significantly influenced by PAL activity, which explained 71.5, 82.9, 47.0, 29.8 and 39.9% of their total variation, respectively. PPO activity significantly influenced the pupal period (R2 = 59.7%) whereas, the larval weight was significantly influenced by amino acids (R2 = 56.9%), proteins (R2 = 10.2%) and TSS (R2 = 7.7%). So, the correlation and regression analyses revealed that these physico-chemical characters of the maize inbreds can be utilized as reliable markers traits to identify resistant sources to develop shoot fly resistant maize hybrids. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

Multiple strategies are adopted for its control including eradication of mosquito breeding sites by improving water storage and solid waste disposal as well as treating breeding sites with chemical insecticides. However, continuous use of insecticides has resulted in development of insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti. This study explores the potential biocontrol of Ae. aegypti by the use of commercial entomopathogenic nematodes, namely Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, H. downesi, H. megidis, Steinernema carpocapsae, S. feltiae and S. kraussei. The pathogenic effect of nematodes (concentrations 10, 250, 500 and 1,000 infective juveniles (IJs)) was assessed against third instar Ae. aegypti in multi-well culture plates for 3 days. The evaluated nematode species were pathogenic to Ae. aegypti, however, their virulence varied significantly. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and S. carpocapsae were most virulent causing 90-100% mortality at 100 IJs per larva, whereas H. megidis and S. kraussei showed least virulence causing 40-60% mortality. Heterorhabditis downesi and S. feltiae had intermediate virulence. Third instar Ae. aegypti indiscriminately overfeed nematodes triggering melanisation but ingested nematodes overcome the defence system resulting in killing the larvae and reproduced within them. Some of the nematodes were melanised, suggesting a strong humoral defence response by Aedes, nevertheless, with variable degree of melanisation. The melanisation did not stop nematode from multiplying and killing Aedes larvae and thus, they have potential to be developed into a novel strategy for Ae. aegypti control. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: M.A. Ansari; Institute of Life Science 1, Swansea University, Swansea, Singleton Park, SA2 8PP, United Kingdom; email: m.a.ansari@swansea.ac.uk; CODEN: BSTCE",10.1080/09583157.2020.1776215,Aedes aegypti;entomopathogenic nematodes;Heterorhabditis;ingestion;mosquito;Steinernema;Heterorhabditis bacteriophora;Heterorhabditis downesi;Heterorhabditis megidis;Nematoda;Steinernema carpocapsae;Steinernema feltiae;Steinernema kraussei;Zika virus;cause of death;chikungunya;dengue fever;disease control;disease vector;entomopathogenic organism;feeding;larva;nematode;potential biocontrol agent;yellow fever;Zika virus disease;Cause of Death;Q Fever;Fever;Aedes,NA,NA,indiscriminate feeding of commercial entomopathogenic nematodes caused death of aedes aegypti larvae potential for vector control of chikungunya dengue and yellow fever

The ability to sense host cell-imposed damages, and to mount efficient stress responses are crucial for survival and proliferation of intracellular pathogens. The various combinations of host defence mechanisms acting on intracellular bacteria and their individual response also explain the occurrence of distinct subpopulations of intracellular S. enterica such as dormant or persisting, slowly or rapidly replicating cells. Here we describe a set of fluorescence protein (FP)-based reporter strains that were used to monitor the expression of cytoplasmic or periplasmic stress response systems of single bacterial cells. This is mediated by a fast-maturing FP as reporter for induction of stress response genes. We evaluated slower maturing FPs for a second function, that is, the analysis of the status of intracellular proliferation of pathogens. The combination of two FPs allows, at level of single bacterial cells, the interrogation of stress response and intracellular proliferation.

All the cellular processes taking place in an organism are strictly regulated by an intracellular network of signaling pathways. In the case of immune cells, the NF-κB pathway is considered the key signaling pathway as it regulates the expression of more than 200 genes. The transcription factor NF-κB is sensitive to exogenous factors, such as xenoestrogens (XEs), which are compounds mimicking the action of endogenous estrogens and are widely distributed in the environment. Moreover, XE-induced modulation of signaling pathways may be crucial for the proper development of the immune system. In this review, we summarize the effects of XEs on the NF-κB signaling pathway. Based on our analysis, we constructed a model of XE-induced signaling in immune cells and found that in most cases XEs activate NF-κB. Our analysis indicated that the indirect impact of XEs on NF-κB in immune cells is related to the modulation of estrogen signaling and other pathways such as MAPK and JAK/STAT.

The D1 protein of Photosystem II is highly abundant in the chloroplast with a rapid steady-state turnover; the final step of D1 protein processing is thus exploited for the continuous release of antioxidant peptides into the organism. Three antioxidant peptides, isolated from different food sources, were successfully expressed in C. reinhardtii. We show that the in vitro antioxidant activity of algae extract is lower in transgenic lines, while the in vivo antioxidant activity is highly evident towards radical oxygen-generating substances than in the control strain. Moreover, the antioxidant mutant releasing the peptide designed from Hoki fish, showed a longer shelf-life and a better resistance to high light and heat stress than the control. These features can be exploited in the vision of the development of robust biocomponents for bioassay applications.

This study investigated the survival of viable oospores and chlamydospores of P. cinnamomi when present as free propagules in untreated soil, or in soil subject to four exogenous treatments: smoke water, fish emulsion and two fungicides (ridomil and furalaxyl). The exogenous treatments were applied under moist and dry soil conditions. Spore viability was determined by the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining technique, with a qPCR assay used to compare general patterns of decline. Over 96% of oospores lost viability over a period of 48 weeks irrespective of soil moisture conditions. The mean percentage viability for oospores decreased from 91% at time zero to 72, 35, 20 and 1% after 6, 12, 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. Reduction in viability of chlamydospores was more rapid than oospores, with viability declining from 92% to zero after 12 weeks. There was no significant difference between untreated soil and the exogenous treatments. The RNA-based qPCR assay indicated a strong presence of viable oospores of P. cinnamomi up to week 12 for moist soil and week 3 for dry soil, but thereafter failed to detect RNA even though viable oospores could be detected by MTT staining. Based on the MTT staining, this study indicated that viability of P. cinnamomi oospores may be entirely lost within 1 year and that of chlamydospores within 3 months for the soil type tested. Therefore, oospores and chlamydospores when existing as free propagules in soil appear unlikely to be involved in the long-term survival of P. cinnamomi. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: J.

The median lethal concentration (96 h-LC50) was determined, and the effects of a sublethal concentration on oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated in the liver, gills, white muscle, and heart. During the acute toxicity test, fish mortality progressively increased with RT concentration along with behavioral abnormalities were detected. The calculated 96 h-LC50 value of RT was found as 1.21 mg/L. Fish exposed to 0.5 mg/L of RT (40% of 96 h-LC50) showed a significant increase in the hepatic somatic index (HSI) with a concomitant decrease in Fulton’s condition factor (K). The sublethal exposure also induced significant increases (p < 0.05) in the hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, reduced glutathione (GSH) content, and catalase (CAT) activity, with a concomitant decrease in the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. In the gills, RT exposure induced significant increases in the GST activity, GSH and LPO levels, whereas CAT activity was inhibited. RT also induced CAT and GST activities together with the content of GSH and LPO levels in the white muscle. On the other hand, significant decreases in the CAT and GST activities were detected in the heart with a marked increase in the GSH content and no changes in LPO levels. Therefore, the exposure to 0.5 mg/L of RT induced oxidative stress in the liver, gills and white muscle with tissue-specific responses related to antioxidant defenses.

There is an urgent need to develop improved analytical methodologies as well as for a deep insight into the mechanism behind the interaction between pesticides and the nucleic acids of living organisms. In the present work, the electrochemical behavior of the diacylhydrazine insecticide methoxyfenozide (Met) on a boron-doped diamond electrode and its interaction with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were investigated for the first time by applying cyclic voltammetry and square-wave (SW) voltammetry. The influence of numerous factors, such as composition of the supporting electrolyte, its pH, and voltammetric parameters, was analyzed. Under the optimized conditions, a simple and sensitive SW voltammetric procedure was developed for the determination of Met. Quantification was found to be linear from 5.0 × 10−7 to 7.0 × 10−5 mol L−1, with a detection limit of 1.4 × 10−7 mol L−1. The application of the developed voltammetric methodology for the analysis of tap water, river water and grape juice was tested with spiked samples. Studies on the interaction between methoxyfenozide and double-stranded salmon sperm DNA were conducted using both voltammetric and spectroscopic techniques.

Designing cost-effective fishways is essential for a trade-off between water uses and successful longitudinal connectivity restoration. The multislot fishway (MSF) concept, which operates with 30–50% lower discharge than a vertical slot fishway (VSF), was recently developed. This study assessed and compared the entrance performance (entrance time; entry efficiency) and transit times of two cyprinids for VSFs and MSFs. Four configurations, with the same structural characteristics (slope; water depth; head drop; pool width and depth), operating with different discharges (Q), were tested (VSF 1: Q = 112 L·s−1; VSF 2: Q = 80 L·s−1; MSF 1: Q = 58 L·s−1; MSF 2: Q = 37 L·s−1 ). Hydrodynamics characterization was performed using a numerical model. Results showed that entry efficiency was higher in MSFs than in VSFs, while entrance time and transit time were overall lower. Numerical modelling revealed that velocities were around 30% lower in MSFs, and turbulence could reach a difference of around 70% in Reynolds shear stress and 50% in turbulent kinetic energy. Overall, MSFs can be considered as a cost-effective fishway solution that can balance the trade-offs between divergent interests in water uses. © 2021 by the authors.

In recent years, researchers have made great progress in the theoretical researches and technical promotion of rice-fish co-culture system in China. Rice-fish coculture system shows obvious advantages over the conventional practice in reducing fertilizers and pesticides, increasing rice production and efficiency, and improving soil and water physicochemical properties. Furthermore, rice-fish co-culture system can guarantee food security, increase farmers' income and reduce non-point source pollution, with good economic, ecological and social benefits. Currently, the area of rice-fish co-culture systems is still small in Guangdong Province. In this paper, we summarize and analyze the situation and the advantage of nature resources of the rice-fish co-culture system in Guangdong Province, and pointe out some problems such as small application area, low production, backward technology development and promotion, poor water and fertilizer management, few rice and fish varieties for the rice-fish co-culture system, and lack of mechanization and intelligentization technology. It is believed that rice-fish co-culture system would have an extensive market prospect in Guangdong Province.

We reviewed integrated pest and disease management steps and techniques in hydroponics to qualify as suitable techniques for different aquaponic designs. Non-chemical prophylactic measures are highly proficient for pest and disease prevention in all designs. Still, the use of chemical control methods remains highly complicated for all systems. We simulated 10–20% runoff concentrations of 9 pesticides in the common UVI design and compared them with NOEC, LC50 of fish. Endosulfan seems most toxic with runoff AI (20.7 μg L−1) exceeding LC50 (10.2 μg L−1) and NOEC (0.05 μg L−1). At 20% runoff, most chemical pesticides pose risks in aquaponic systems. Natural pesticides were also discussed as potential alternatives with low acute toxicity to fish, but little is known about their effects on water and bacteria. While insecticides and herbicides are replaceable by well-established commercial biocontrol measures, fungicides and nematicides would still be relevant in aquaponics due to low efficiency of alternatives (e.g. natural enemies, entomopathogenic fungus). Monitoring and cultural control are the first approaches to contain pest population below the action threshold. Biological controls, in general, are adaptable to a larger extent.

Edwardsiella piscicida is one of the fish pathogens that seriously infect cultured and wild fish species. To understand the molecular immune mechanisms underlying the response to E. piscicida, a comparative gene transcription analysis was performed through RNA-Seq technology. The low-quality sequences were excluded, and the high-quality sequences were assembled into a total of 60,759 contigs with an average length of 988.95 bp. A gene ontology (GO) analysis was employed to classify 5744 genes according to three major functional categories: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. A total of 19,918 genes were successfully annotated into 26 functional categories according to the clusters of orthologous groups (COG) classification. Furthermore, 15,006 genes were classified into 332 KEGG pathways. The q-value was introduced to estimate 5109 genes significantly differentially expressed which includes 1781 up-regulated genes and 3328 down-regulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were involved in the major immune-related pathways which refer to the pathogen recognition, inflammation, Toll-like receptor and chemokine signalling pathways. Moreover, 24,487 potential simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 193,760 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected and identified in the C. striata liver transcriptome.

These deficits include impacts on social and attachment behaviors in a prosocial rodent: the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster). The prairie vole is a laboratory-acclimated rodent that exhibits spontaneous attachment behaviors including pair bonding. Here we extend previous work by addressing how developmental exposure to FM 550 impacts pair bonding strength via an extended-time partner preference test, as well as neuron electrophysiological properties in a region implicated in pair bond behavior, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) core. Dams were exposed to vehicle or 1000 μg of FM 550 via subcutaneous injections throughout gestation, and female and male pups were directly exposed beginning the day after birth until weaning. Pair bond behavior of adult female and male offspring was assessed using a three hour-long partner preference test. Afterwards, acute brain slices of the NAcc core were produced and medium spiny neuron electrophysiological attributes recorded via whole cell patch-clamp. Behavioral impacts were sex-specific. Partner preference behavior was increased in exposed females but decreased in exposed males. Electrophysiological impacts were similar between sexes and specific to attributes related to input resistance. Input resistance was decreased in neurons recorded from both sexes exposed to FM 550 compared to vehicle.

Residual malaria transmission occurs under several possible circumstances, among which the presence of exophilic vector species, such as Anopheles dirus, or indoor- and outdoor-biting vectors, such as Anopheles nili, or specific behavior, such as feeding on humans indoors, then resting or leaving the house the same night (such as Anopheles moucheti) or also changes in behavior induced by insecticides applied inside houses, such as the well-known deterrent effect of permethrin-treated nets or the irritant effect of DDT. The use of insecticides may change the composition of local Anopheles populations, such as A. arabiensis taking up the place of A. gambiae in Senegal, A. aquasalis replacing A. darlingi in Guyana, or A. harrisoni superseding A. minimus in Vietnam. The change in behavior, such as biting activity earlier than usually reported - for example, Anopheles funestus after a large-scale distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets - or insecticide resistance, in particular the current spread of pyrethroid resistance, could hamper the efficacy of classic pyrethroid-treated long-lasting insecticidal nets and maintained transmission. These issues must be well documented in every situation to elaborate, implement, monitor, and evaluate tailored vector control programs, keeping in mind that they must be conceived as integrated programs with several well and appropriately coordinated approaches, combining entomological but also parasitological, clinical, and social methods and analyses. A successful integrated vector control program must then be designed to reduce transmission and incidence rates of malaria morbidity and overall mortality. © 2021 World Health Organization, 2021.

Therefore, based on the previously reported beneficial functions of the L1 cell adhesion molecule, we hypothesized that L1 mimetic compounds may serve to neutralize neurotoxicity triggered by the pesticide paraquat (PQ). In this study, we attempt to use PQ for inducing PD-like pathology and the L1 mimetic compounds phenelzine sulfate (PS) and tacrine (TC) as potential candidates for the amelioration of PD symptoms using zebrafish as a model system. Administration of PQ together with the L1 mimetic compounds PS or TC (250 nM) improved survival of zebrafish larvae, protected them from locomotor deficits, and increased their sensorimotor reflexes. Moreover, application of PQ together with PS (500 nM) or TC (1000 nM) in adult zebrafish counteracted PQ-induced toxicity, maintaining normal locomotor functions and spatial memory in an open field and T-maze task, respectively. Both L1 mimetic compounds prevented reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine levels, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, protected against impairment of mitochondrial viability, improved the antioxidant enzyme system, and prevented a decrease in ATP levels. Altogether, our findings highlight the beneficial functions of the agonistic L1 mimetics PS and TC by improving several vital cell functions against PQ-triggered neurotoxicity.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  141,10.3389/fnins.2020.00458     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),pesticide;paraquat;zebrafish;Parkinson's disease-like pathology;L1 cell adhesion molecule;phenelzine sulfate;tacrine;OXYGEN SPECIES PRODUCTION;SPINAL-CORD REGENERATION;PARKINSONS-DISEASE;OXIDATIVE STRESS;MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION;RECOGNITION MOLECULES;ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN;RAT-BRAIN;IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY;FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY;Pesticides,NA,NA,adhesion molecule l1 agonist mimetics protect against the pesticide paraquatinduced locomotor deficits and biochemical alterations in zebrafish

We used atrazine, one of the most used herbicides in the world, and Daphnia pulex, a representative cladocerans, to test the possible interference effect of herbicides on the induced defensive traits of cladocerans in response to predator fish (Rhodeus ocellatus) kairomone, including morphological defense, life history strategies, and the expression of defense-related genes.

Exposure to atrazine affected the expression of defense-related genes, and we speculated that atrazine affected the signaling process in the induced anti-predation defense of cladocerans. Specially, fish kairomone attenuated the negative effects of high concentrations of atrazine on the life history traits of D. pulex.

Metal residues (Cu, Cd, As and Pb), in liver and muscle, as well as oxidative stress biomarkers were assessed at different stages in the life cycle of white seabream under culture conditions and in wild specimens, of a marketable size. Metal concentrations in tissues were low, and below the established limits. However, wild white seabream showed higher accumulation than cultured ones. Antioxidant enzymes, namely catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were correlated with metal accumulation. Oxidative damages to tissues were low, with wild white seabream showing lower levels than cultured fish.

Fish were exposed to the herbicide at concentrations of 10,20 and 40 mu l per liter of water for 24 hours to determine its effects on gills and liver epithelia. The estimated LC50 was 34.64 mu l of 2,4-D per liter of water.

Histochemistry revealed qualitative variations of glycoconjugates present on mucous cells and granules. The four types of mucous cells contained neutral granules, acids, or both. Increasing amounts of syalomucins were observed from the control group to the group exposed to the highest concentration of 2,4-D, suggesting increased mucous viscosity and the formation of plaques that could inhibit gas exchange and osmoregulation. Lamellar fusion observed in the group exposed to 40 mu l of 2,4-D suggests a defense mechanism. Hepatocytes showed vacuolization in the 10 and 20 mu l/L groups. The 40 mu l/L group showed normal hepatocytes as well as changed ones, many Ito cells, micronuclei, and nuclear swelling.

Biochemical analysis and synergistic studies with metabolic inhibitors indicated that elevated glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) with a predominant peroxidase activity conferred resistance to both pyrethroids, whereas esterases conferred part of the resistance to permethrin. Purified esterases hydrolysed permethrin at a slow rate, but incubation of either pyrethroid or their primary metabolites with partially purified GSTs had no effect on the metabolic profile. Although GSTs were sensitive to inhibition by both pyrethroids, they did not serve as binding proteins, as previously hypothesized [Grant and Matsumura (1988) Insect Biochem. 18, 615-622]. We demonstrate that pyrethroids, in addition to their neurotoxic effect, induce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in insects. Pyrethroid exposure induced lipid peroxides, protein oxidation and depleted reduced glutathione. Elevated GSTs in the resistant strains attenuated the pyrethroid-induced lipid peroxidation and reduced mortality, whereas their in vivo inhibition eliminated their protective role. We therefore hypothesize that the main role of elevated GSTs in conferring resistance in N. lugens is through protecting tissues from oxidative damage.

These neurobehavioral injuries have been linked to reduced survival and population declines. Despite the importance of maintaining proper olfactory signaling processes in the presence of chemical exposures, little is known regarding chemical detoxification in the salmon olfactory system, and in particular, the antioxidant defenses that maintain olfactory function. An understudied, yet critical component of cellular antioxidant defense is phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx/GPx4), an isoform within the family of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzymes that can directly reduce lipid peroxides and other membrane-bound complex hydroperoxides. In this study, we cloned two gpx4 isoforms (gpx4a and gpx4b) from Coho salmon olfactory tissues and compared their modulation in olfactory and liver tissues by cadmium, an environmental pollutant and olfactory toxicant that cause oxidative damage as a mechanism of toxicity. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the two gpx4 isoforms shared 71% identity, and also relatively high sequence identities when compared with other fish GPx4 isoforms. Sequence comparisons with human GPx4 indicated conservation of three important active sites at selenocysteine (U46), glutamine (Q81), and tryptophan (W136), suggesting similar catalytic activity between fish and mammalian GPx4 isoforms. Tissue profiling confirmed the expression of gpx4a and gpx4b in all ten Coho tissues examined. The expression of gpx4 mRNAs in the Coho olfactory system was accompanied by comparably high initial rates of GPx4 enzymatic activity in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. Exposure to low (3.7 ppb) and high (347 ppb) environmental Cd concentrations for 24-48 h significantly decreased gpx4a expression in Coho olfactory rosettes, whereas olfactory gpx4b mRNA expression was not modulated by exposures at these concentrations. In summary, Coho salmon express two paralogs of gpx4, a key enzyme in the maintenance of signal transduction processes that protect against cellular oxidative damage. The Cd-associated downregulation of salmon olfactory gpx4a expression in particular, may be associated with the loss of olfactory signal transduction that accompanies metal-associated loss of olfaction in salmonids.

Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were determined in blood and tissues for measurement of oxidant-antioxidant status. A significant elevation in the level of MDA, as an index of lipid peroxidation, and reductions in antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px) and low molecular weight antioxidant (GSH) levels were observed in DM-exposed fish. Treatment with lycopene attenuated the DM-induced oxidative stress by significantly decreasing the levels of MDA.

Laboratory experiments examined feeding and respiration rates of the caddisfly Sericostoma vittatum as well as the growth, emergence and respiration rates of the midge Chironomus riparius, exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of imidacloprid. The effects of the two stressors on burrowing behaviour of both species were also assessed. The results show significant effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of imidacloprid on all endpoints studied. Perceived predation risk also elicited sub-lethal effects in C. riparius and S. vittatum, the latter species being less responsive to predation cues. The effects of simultaneous exposure to both types of stressors were assessed using two different approaches: analysis of variance and conceptual models [concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA)] normally used for the evaluation of contaminant mixture exposure. Both statistical approaches showed no significant interactions on responses in simultaneous exposures in the majority of parameters assessed with only a signification deviation from the reference CA and IA models being found for C. riparius respiration data contrary to the ANOVA results.        Exposure to imidacloprid also compromised antipredator behavioural responses of both insect species, with potential negative consequences in terms of mortality from predation in the field.        The results obtained demonstrate that natural and anthropogenic stressors can be treated within the same framework providing compatible data for modelling. For an improved interpretation of ecological effects it will be important to expand the mechanistic study of effects of combined exposure to pesticides and perceived predation risk by measuring different endpoints over a wider range of pesticide concentrations.

In this laboratory study, we tested the prediction that prior chemical exposure to a non-native predator feeding on conspecific tadpoles will subsequently allow tadpoles of the common toad (Bufo bufo) to recognize the chemical cues specifically released by this starved predator. Furthermore, we investigated the vulnerability of this chemically-mediated process to herbicide contamination. With these aims in view, groups of tadpoles were kept either unexposed or exposed for ten days to chemical cues from Turkish crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) previously fed on tadpoles, both in uncontaminated water and in the presence of four sublethal concentrations of amitrole (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.l(-1)). We then assessed the effects of the six conditioning treatments on general activity and behavioural response to chemical cues from starved crayfish. Larval treatments did not affect the general activity of the tadpoles. By contrast, the treatments had significant effects on the behavioural response to the test solution prepared form starved crayfish. The only tadpoles to show an antipredator behavioural response to the chemical stimulation from starved crayfish belonged to the groups derived from chemical exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in uncontaminated water and in contaminated water with the lowest concentration of amitrole (0.01 mg.l(-1)). Conversely, this chemical stimulation produced no behavioural change in the control group or in the groups derived from exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in contaminated water containing 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.l(-1) of amitrole. This study demonstrates that chemical cues released during the predator's feeding activity can subsequently be used by common toad tadpoles in the recognition of an unfamiliar predator. In addition, our results show that the presence of sublethal amitrole concentrations can impair this recognition process.

During periods of food scarcity, arctic seabirds experience lipid mobilization, allowing stored lipid soluble contaminants to re-enter the body circulation. In the present study, we investigated the effects of PCB exposure and fasting on the antioxidant defense system in HG chicks. Forty newly hatched chicks were exposed to contaminated cod liver oil for 6 weeks and then fasted for 1 week. We assessed the hepatic total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) against peroxynitrite, hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, and measured glutathione (reduced: GSH, and oxidized: GSSG) levels and the enzymatic activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase. The results show that fasting significantly increased the HOC levels in the HG chick livers. Limited effects were observed on antioxidant responses; significant effects were only found for catalase (CAT) activity, Se-dependent GPX activity and the GSH/GSSG ratio in the exposed and fasted group. CAT and Se-dependent GPX activities correlated negatively with the PCB concentrations within this group, and a nonlinear relationship between glutathione and contaminant levels was also found. These effects were generally not observed after exposure or fasting alone and were likely related to the high PCB levels induced by the combination of exposure and fasting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Chlorpyrifos was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 July 2006 by Commission Directive 2005/72/EC5. It was a specific provision of the inclusion, that notifiers were required to submit to the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') further studies to confirm the risk assessment for birds and mammals within two years from the entry into force of the inclusion Directive.        In accordance with the specific provision, Dow AgroSciences, on behalf of the Chlorpyrifos Task Force, submitted further studies in June 2008, which were evaluated by the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), Spain, in the form of an Addendum to the assessment report. In compliance with Guidance Document SANCO 5634/2009 rev. 3, the RMS distributed the Addendum to Member States and the EFSA for comments on 30 June 2009. The RMS collated all comments in the format of a Reporting Table, which was submitted to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) in November 2009.

This activity often takes place in areas subjected to various recurring pollutions. The recrudescent use of herbicides in agriculture including atrazine implies pollutant transfer towards aquatic environment in estuarine areas. Harmful effects of such substances on animals in marine environment, particularly on cultured bivalves, are poorly documented. Bivalve molluscs such as mussels and oysters have been postulated as ideal indicator organisms because of their way of life. They filter large volumes of seawater and may therefore accumulate and concentrate contaminants within their tissues. Moreover, development of techniques allowing effect analysis of such compounds on bivalve biology may lead to the development of diagnosis tools adapted to analyze pollutant transfer towards estuarine areas. In this context, influence of atrazine on defence mechanisms was analyzed in Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas.

In mammals, it inhibits monoamine uptake through binding to the dopamine transporter, with a mechanism of action similar to cocaine, resulting in higher levels of dopamine at the synapse. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in a broad spectrum of processes such as locomotion, cognition, reward, and mental disorders. In this work we have studied, for the first time, the effects of TDF on behavior of both larval and adult zebrafish and its connection with changes in the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We evaluated the acute exposure of 5 dpf larvae to different concentrations of TDF, ranging from 5 mg/L to 35 mg/L. The lowest concentration does not alter neither locomotor activity nor dopamine levels but produced changes in the expression of two genes, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine transporter (dat). Besides, it induced a reduction in extracellular serotonin and had an anxiolytic-like effect, supported by a decrease in cortisol production. On the other hand, a high concentration of TDF produced a dose-dependent reduction in locomotion, which was reversed or enhanced by D1 (SCH-23390) or D2 (Haloperidol) dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively. Using in vivo electrochemistry, we show that these changes could be associated with higher levels of dopamine in the brain. Thus, in adult zebrafish, though not in larvae, TDF exposure increases locomotor activity, anxiety and aggressiveness, which coincides with the behaviors observed in mammals.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  42,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.12.012     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Triadimefon;Dopamine;Serotonin;Zebrafish;Behavior;TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE;DOWN-REGULATION;LARVAL;THIGMOTAXIS;MODULATION;LOCOMOTION;FUNGICIDES;PATTERNS;RELEASE;NEURONS,NA,NA,behavioral effects of triadimefon in zebrafish are associated with alterations of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways

Susceptibility of different tissues to oxidative DNA damage was studied by exposing fish to model pollutants. Cu(II), paraquat (PQ) and malathion failed to promote DNA oxidation in liver, while dieldrin significantly increased the 8-oxodG content in this organ, but not in gills or blood. After PQ exposure, fish liver showed high levels of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (G-6PDH) and GSSG reductase activities. The increased antioxidant status and the lack of a specific transport system could explain the lack of susceptibility of liver to DNA oxidative damage induced by PQ. Increased levels of 8-oxodG were detected in the gills of PQ-exposed fish after 8 and 24 h. In contrast, after 48 h exposed fish contained lower 8-oxodG levels than controls. The existence of a PQ transport system in this O-2-rich organ and the lack of a significant increase in antioxidant defenses would explain the sensitivity of gills to DNA damage promoted by PQ. Elimination of this soluble chemical and the putative induction of DNA-repair enzymes specific for oxidative damages could explain the drop of 8-oxodG levels at longer times. Fish exposed to moderate levels of urban and industrial pollution showed significantly high 8-oxodG content in hepatic DNA. We conclude that 8-oxodG determination in chromosomal DNA by HPLC-EC is a potentially useful biomarker of environmental pollution, although its response is still somewhat lower than that of other well-established biomarkers of oxidative stress.

Following exposure to a broad variety of aquatic pollutants, early morphologically detectable toxic effects often manifest in alterations of the gills. Suitable methods for an accurate and unbiased quantitative characterization of the type and the extent of morphological gill alterations are therefore essential prerequisites for recognition, objective evaluation and comparison of the severity of gill lesions. The aim of the present guidelines is to provide practicable, standardized and detailed protocols for the application of unbiased quantitative stereological analyses of relevant morphological parameters of the gills of rainbow trout. These gill parameters inter alia include the total volume of the primary and secondary gill lamellae, the surface area of the secondary gill lamellae epithelium (i.e., the respiratory surface) and the thickness of the diffusion barrier. The featured protocols are adapted to fish of frequently used body size classes (300-2000 g). They include well-established, conventional sampling methods, probes and test systems for unbiased quantitative stereological analyses of light- and electron microscopic 2-D gill sections, as well as the application of modern 3-D light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) of optically cleared gill samples as an innovative, fast and efficient quantitative morphological analysis approach. The methods shown here provide a basis for standardized and representative state-of-the-art quantitative morphological analyses of trout gills, ensuring the unbiasedness and reproducibility, as well as the intra- and inter-study comparability of analyses results. Their broad implementation will therefore significantly contribute to the reliable identification of no observed effect concentration (NOEC) limits in ecotoxicological studies and, moreover, to limit the number of experimental animals by reduction of unnecessary repetition of experiments.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  133,10.1371/journal.pone.0243462     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),DESIGN-BASED STEREOLOGY;SURFACE-AREA;FISH GILL;HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ALTERATIONS;ARBITRARY PARTICLES;SALMO-GAIRDNERI;PATHOLOGICAL RESEARCH;MEMBRANE THICKNESS;PROLONGED EXPOSURE;BRACHYDANIO-RERIO,NA,NA,a practical guide to unbiased quantitative morphological analyses of the gills of rainbow trout <i>oncorhynchus mykiss<i> in ecotoxicological studies

Compression affects the quality of the depth maps which in turn may introduce various structural and textural distortions in the DIBR-synthesized images. Estimation of the compression-related distortion in depth maps is very important for a high-quality 3D experience. The task becomes challenging when the corresponding reference depth maps are unavailable, e.g., when evaluating the quality on the decoder side. In this paper, we present a no-reference quality assessment algorithm to estimate the distortion in the depth maps induced by compression. The proposed algorithm exploits the depth saliency and local statistical characteristics of the depth maps to predict the compression distortion.

The first synthetic pyrethroids developed in the United States are allethrin and bioallethrin. According to the World Health Organization, the classification pyrethroids has a place in the fourth group of insecticides and includes 42 substances. More than 30% of pyrethroid insecticides are used worldwide. In the year 2015, the global market of pyrethroid insecticides has been estimated at USD 4.67 billion and is expected to touch USD 6.45 billion by the year 2021. Pyrethroid insecticides are potent against an extensive variety of pests belonging to the orders Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, and Thysanoptera. Pyrethroid insecticides interrupt the functioning of the peripheral nervous system by reacting with the voltage-gated sodium channels and cause a series of bursts and paralyses. The low tendency to accumulate in organisms, short biodegradation period, and economic value have led to the overuse of pyrethroids with unavoidable consequences. The increase in the production of mites in cotton, in tea, and in vegetables was reported by the constant use of synthetic pyrethroids. Even at a very low concentration in water, pyrethroids are strongly absorbed by the gills of fish due to their lipophilic nature and lead to their toxicity and even altered homing ability in honeybees. Pyrethroid metabolites were detected in the breast milk of women in various parts of the world. Long-term exposure of pyrethroids leads to aggressive behavior in humans due to the leftover traces of pyrethroid metabolites in urine.

In the present study, zebrafish embryos and larvae were used to study the effects of the insecticide diazinon and the herbicide diuron in regard to occurrence of oxidative stress-related cellular responses, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR)-related efflux transporter activity—which represents the first line of defense against xenobiotics in many aquatic organisms—and responses of different molecular and biochemical biomarkers. Results: The recently established non-invasive quantitative plate assay, which uses the fluorescent probes CM-H                             2                             DCFDA and CellTracker™ Green CMFDA and measures the fluorescence in whole zebrafish larvae, was applied to assess changes in reactive oxidative species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) after exposure to the investigated pesticides. The results showed a significant increase of GSH after 1 h exposure of zebrafish larvae to both diazinon and diuron. Regarding the ROS induction, no significant increases in fluorescence could be detected after 2 h exposure to the investigated pesticides. Applying a newly adapted assay for MXR activity, it was determined that diuron caused no change after a 24-h exposure, but caused a significant induction of MXR activity after a 48-h exposure (indicated by a decreased amount of accumulated rhodamine B). On the other hand, diazinon caused an inhibition of MXR activity after both 24 h and 48 h exposure (indicated by an increased amount of accumulated rhodamine B). Regarding the biomarkers, different set-ups and exposure periods were applied and both molecular (gene expression) and biochemical (enzymatic activities) responses were assessed. Diazinon caused an inhibition of carboxylesterase (CES) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in zebrafish larvae, diuron inhibited AChE activity in in vitro testing, and both pesticides significantly affected gene expression and activities of some of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family enzymes. Conclusions: The obtained results show various effects of the investigated pesticides and will help to elucidate how aquatic animals cope with pesticides present in their environment. Additionally, the recently developed fluorescence-based assay and the newly adapted MXR activity assay proved to be useful tools for ecotoxicological risk assessment to further investigate pesticide effects.                          © 2019, The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 38; Correspondence Address: T.-B.

The present study aimed to evaluate the toxic effects of Monocrotophos on the locomotor activity, antioxidant activity, lipid peroxidation, and expression of genes related to apoptosis using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model. The neurotoxic effects of sub-lethal concentration of the Monocrotophos on fish were evaluated. The locomotor activity of the fishes was determined, followed by an antioxidant activity, and lipid peroxidation assays were performed. The expression of genes related to apoptosis in the brain was also determined by qPCR. The Lethal Concentration for 96 hrs. was estimated to be 36.5 mg/L. When exposed to sub-lethal concentration, marked changes were observed in locomotor activity (distance traveled, swimming speed and meandering), acetylcholinesterase activity, oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxidation) and antioxidant defenses in the brain. Expression of apoptotic genes determined by qPCR revealed an increase in Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 expressions.

The presence of neonicotinoids in surface waters raises the concern of the potential risk of exposure to non-target aquatic species, with relevance for both free-living and parasitic taxa. The susceptibility of aquatic free-living parasitic stages to the lethal effects of neonicotinoids may influence the prevalence and intensity of host infection, and their availability as prey for a variety of organisms (e.g., fish, invertebrates). We examined the effects of two commonly used neonicotinoids on the survival of free-living infectious stages (cercariae) from two trematode (flatworm) species (Diplostomum sp. and Haematoloechus sp.). We found that exposure to commercially formulated imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, individually and in a binary mixture, had no significant effect on cercarial survival for either species at environmentally relevant concentrations. Further study is required to understand if the ability of the surviving cercariae to infect the next host in their life cycle is compromised in the presence of neonicotinoids, or if host defenses are compromised, as changes in parasite infectivity or host susceptibility could influence infection dynamics and have community- and ecosystem-level implications. © 2020, Crown.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: S.A.

Methods: This review presents qualitative and quantitative evidence in three animal models (rodent, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans), for neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects occurring at CPF doses lower than those inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Results: CPF treatment in rodents at low noncholinergic doses during neurodevelopment showed behavioral effects, including locomotor activity, neuromotor function (NMF), cognition, anxiety, social behavior, and maternal care. Zebrafish and C. elegans, which are transparent during development, allow for detailed analysis of specific systems; further, they exhibit neurotoxic effects closely emulating those observed in mammalian pathways. Qualitative results showed concordance among rodents, zebrafish and C. elegans for adverse effects on locomotor activity, NMF, and AChE inhibition. Male rodents had greater sensitivity for effects on locomotor activity than females and exposure during the gestation day 10–14 window showed consistent increases in locomotor activity at low CPF doses (≤1.0 mg kg−1 day−1). Zebrafish had cognitive and anxiety deficits after CPF treatment at low doses and young adult C. elegans had reproductive dysfunction associated NMF and disruption of the serotonergic pathway. Quantitative data for all three species showed neurobehavioral effects after exposure to CPF doses approximately 2–10-fold below the threshold for AChE inhibition. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings provided a weight-of-evidence for low-dose CPF neurotoxicity and noncholinergic mechanisms.

After 28 d of CYP exposure, the levels of Immunoglobulin M (IgM), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and C-reactive protein (CRP)were significantly decreased (p < 0.05)after treatment with 1.5 μg/L CYP. Moreover, an induction of inflammatory cytokine transcripts (tnfa, il-6, il-8, and il-12)was observed (p < 0.05)after treatment with 1.5 μg/L CYP. After challenge with Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens), plasma lysozyme (LYS)activity at 24 and 48 hours post-injection (hpi)was significantly decreased in the 0.5 and 1.5 μg/L CYP treatment groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, liver Complement component 3 (C3)and CRP contents at 24 hpi were significantly decreased in the 1.5 μg/L CYP treatment group (p < 0.05), whereas significant decreases in liver C3 and IgM contents were observed at 48 hpi (p < 0.05). Inhibition of expression of Toll-like receptor-nuclear factor kappa B (TLR-NF-kB)signaling pathway-related genes was observed in the CYP treatment groups and resulted in significant down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines (il-1β and il-12)in the 1.5 μg/L CYP treatment group at 48 hpi (p < 0.05). Interestingly, the mortality in the 0.5 and 1.5 μg/L CYP treatments was significantly increased at 48 hpi (p < 0.05). These results indicated that environmentally relevant concentrations of CYP suppressed the Chinese rare minnow immune system and reduced immune defense against bacterial infection, thereby causing subsequent mortality.

However, in aquaculture settings the application of SCP to treat cynobacterial blooms may affect non-targeted biota, such as fish due to H2O2 being known to elicit toxic oxidative stress. Consequently, a better understanding of the side effects as a function of dosing concentrations would help to improve treatment efficacy and fish welfare. Thus, the aim of the current study is to assess the potential risks of SCP to largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), a high priced fish in the U.S. To this end, fish were exposed to two recommended doses of SCP corresponding to either 2.5 or 4.0 mg/L H2O2 for 6 days, with a control group in parallel. After 6 days, the effect of SCP exposure on oxidative stress, histopathological changes and anti-oxidant potential in the brain, liver, gills and muscle were investigated. Results show that exposure to 4.0 mg/L H2O2 -SCP incited oxidative damage, evidenced by an over-accumulation of H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the brain and liver, which were accompanied by an increment in xanthine oxidase activity. Unlike 4.0 mg/L H2O2, these oxidative stress biomarkers in the brain and liver tissue of 2.5 mg/L H2O2-SCP exposed fish were restrained within control levels and concomitant with an increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) activity. In contrast, many of these anti-oxidants sentinels in the 4.0 mg/L H2O2 exposed fish were either unaffected or significantly inhibited, which resulted in over-accumulation of H2O2 and MDA. In addition, a series of histopathological alterations were observed, and the most severe brain injuries and liver inflammation were recorded in 4.0 mg/L H2O2-SCP exposed fish. Based on oxidative parameters, both SCP doses resulted in a relatively mild oxidative stress in gills but no effect in muscle, probably explaining the modest anti-oxidative responses in the former and almost complete lack of anti-oxidative responses in the latter. Overall, our findings suggests that the application of SCP at 4.0 mg/L H2O2 to control cyanobacterial blooms in aquaculture settings can possess potential risks to the farmed fish. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 25; Correspondence Address: N.

Towards this end, we designed and synthesized a synthetic peptide of 23 amino acids (AAs) (1GWLIRGAIHAGKAIHGLIHRRRH23) from a defense protein 3 cDNA sequence of Octopus minor. The sequence of the peptide, which was named Octominin, had characteristic features of known antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as a positive charge (+5), high hydrophobic residue ratio (43%), and 1.86 kcal/mol of Boman index. Octominin was predicted to have an alpha‐helix secondary structure. The synthesized Octominin was 2625.2 Da with 92.5% purity. The peptide showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of 50 and 200 μg/mL, respectively, against Candida albicans. Field emission scanning electron microscopy observation confirmed that Octominin caused ultrastructural cell wall deformities in C. albicans. In addition, propidium iodide penetrated the Octominin‐treated C. albicans cells, further demonstrating loss of cell membrane integrity that caused cell death at both MIC and MFC. Octominin treatment increased the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and decreased cell viability in a concentration dependent manner. Cytotoxicity assays revealed no significant influence of Octominin on the viability of human embryonic kidney 293T cell line, with over 95% live cells in the Octominin‐treated group observed up to 100 μg/mL. Moreover, we confirmed the antifungal action of Octominin in vivo using a zebrafish experimental infection model. Overall, our results demonstrate the Octominin is a lead compound for further studies, which exerts its effects by inducing cell wall damage, causing loss of cell membrane integrity, and elevating oxidative stress. © 2020 by the authors.

The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 μg/L of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: S.N.

Since traditional methods only consider a small fraction of substances present in the water cycle, biological effect monitoring is required for a more reliable assessment of the pollution status. A major challenge for environmental risk assessment (ERA) is the application of adverse outcome pathways (AOP), i.e. the linking of pollutant exposure via early molecular and biochemical changes to physiological effects and, ultimately, effects on populations and ecosystems. We investigated the linkage between responses at these different levels. Many AOP aspects were investigated, from external and internal exposure to different classes of micropollutants, via molecular key events (MKE) the impacts on organs and organisms (fish physiology), to changes in the population dynamics of fish. Risk assessment procedures were evaluated by comparing environmental quality standards, bioassay responses, biomarkers in caged and feral fish, and the impact on fish populations. Although no complete AOP was observed, indirect relationships linking pollutant exposure via MKE to impaired locomotion were demonstrated at the most polluted site near a landfill for chemical waste. The pathway indicated that several upstream key events requiring energy for stress responses and toxic defence are likely to converge at a single common MKE: increased metabolic demands.

In this study, the endocrine disrupting effects of commonly used insecticides thiamethoxam and λ cyhalothrin were investigated by using Oreochromis niloticus as a model organism. The fish exposed to 1/20, 1/10 of 96-h LC50 value of thiamethoxam and λ cyhalothrin (477.29 mg/L, 2.901 µg/L), individually and in mixtures, for 7 and 15 days. Fish were then left to depurate in pesticide-free water for 7 days. Results showed that acetyhcholinesterase, catalase and estradiol/testosterone levels decreased, while the amount of etoxyresorufin-Odeetylase (EROD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione (GSH) and protein carbonil (PCO) increased in comparison to the control. After the recovery period, EROD, GST, malondialdehyde, estradiol/testosterone levels were found to be lower than the control. In the pesticide mixture group, the activity of antioxidant enzymes was highest and the level of hormones was lowered. The group of the mixture pesticide showed the highest lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation than only thiamethoxam or λ cyhalothrin exposure. In conclusion, the mixture of the insecticides showed a more toxic effect on the gonad of tilapia compared to individual pesticide exposures. In addition, the depuration period of 7 days was not adequate to eliminate the toxic effects of these insecticides.

During evolution, they have developed different anti-predator behaviours, as the vibrational-evoked startle response and its habituation, for promoting survival to predator's strikes. Whereas these two behaviours can be altered by the exposure to some neurotoxicants, it is currently unknown if the exposure to environmentally relevant concentration (ERC) of neurotoxic pollutants could impair them. In this study thirty neurotoxic environmental pollutants from nine chemical groups, including: herbicides; carbamate, organophosphate (OP), organochlorine (OC), neonicotinoid and pyrethroid insecticides; toxins; metal and non-metal elements, have been screened at two concentrations, including one environmental relevant concentration (ERC), for adverse effects on anti-predator behaviours by using the Vibrational Startle Response Assay on zebrafish larvae. Significant effects over anti-predator responses were equally observed in both exposure concentrations. Focusing on the ERC scenario, it was found that the startle response was the less affected behaviour, where ten pollutants from all chemical groups except for organochlorine, neonicotinoid and pyrethroids, altered this response. Interestingly, organic and inorganic pollutants showed opposite effects on this response: whereas all organic pollutants decreased the startle response, the three remaining inorganic pollutants increased it. On the other hand, more pollutants affected habituation of the startle response of the larvae, where thirteen of the pollutants from all groups, except for herbicides, altered this behaviour at ERC, generally resulting in a faster habituation except for one OP and one marine toxin, which were able to delay this response. Ultimately, only one chemical from the OP, toxin, metal and non-metal element groups altered both the startle response and its habituation at both ERC and WSC. These results emphasize the environmental risk of the current levels of some neurotoxicants present in our aquatic ecosystems, as they are high enough to impair essential anti-predator behaviours in fish larvae. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 25; Correspondence Address: M.

However, limited information is known about the toxicological effects of their enantiomers on aquatic organisms. In this study, zebrafish were separately exposed to 100 and 1000 μgL−1 hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers for 21 d 1H NMR-based metabolomics analysis showed that the exposure of low and high dose of hexaconazole enantiomers altered energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism of zebrafish, with the different metabolic profiles resulted from the same dose of (+)-hexaconazole and (−)-hexaconazole. Similar to hexaconazole enantiomers, the metabolic profiles, including the changes related to energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, were demonstrated in low and high dose epoxiconazole enantiomers treatment groups. There are differences in the metabolic profiles of zebrafish between exposed to (+)-epoxiconazole and (−)-epoxiconazole of the same dose. The results of histological examination revealed that the exposure of both enantiomers for hexaconazole and epoxiconazole resulted in the similar histopathological changes. The exposure of hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers at low and high dose resulted the vacuolization and swell in the liver of the female and male zebrafish. Compared to female zebrafish, more liver damage was found in male zebrafish in the hexaconazole enantiomers exposure groups. The reduction of spermatids was observed in hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers treatment groups of both doses. Hexaconazole enantiomers exposure of low and high dose resulted the increase in the number of mature eggs, while such effect was not observed in epoxiconazole enantiomers exposure groups. Hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers exposure resulted in no changes in brains of female and male zebrafish. As a result, both triazole-based chiral bactericides, hexaconazole and epoxiconazole, have similar toxicological effects but their mechanisms of action are not exactly the same.

Fishes in the Family Cichlidae have been especially successful colonizers of south Florida freshwater habitats. Herein we report a multi-agency effort to eradicate two non-native cichlid fishes in Miami, Florida (Bay Snook Petenia splendida and Blue Mbuna Labeotropheus fuelleborni). These fishes were removed before they were observed in the extensive, interconnected canal system through which they may have been able to expand throughout south Florida and access protected areas such as Everglades National Park. The study site, Pinecrest Gardens, is important because it contains remnant coastal cypress-strand habitat in an increasingly urbanized landscape that historically provided refuge to native amphidromous fishes and invertebrates. The project took considerable time (3.5 years), and we detail in this report how it evolved from a focus on isolating the non-native fishes and reducing their population sizes to an eradication. Gardens’ staff hydrologically isolated their ponds from nearby waterbodies by plugging a culvert with a solid gate. That provided the interagency team with more time to remove the potential threats. Compromises were made between fish management strategies and the Gardens’ priorities. Hurricane impacts helped shift priorities to more aggressive fish-management strategies. Cooperation among several federal and state agencies, as well as the Gardens, was key to the project’s success. We hope this effort may serve as a model for removing non-native species before they spread into ecosystems where eradication is not practical. © Schofield et al.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: P.J.

These short cationic peptides are bactericidal against both Gram-positive and -negative enteric pathogens, but may also exert killing effects on intestinal luminal microbiota. Simultaneously, these peptides modulate numerous cellular responses crucial for gut defenses, including leukocyte chemotaxis and migration, wound healing, cytokine production, cell proliferation, and pathogen sensing. This review discusses recent advances in our understanding of expression, mechanisms of action and microbicidal and immunomodulatory functions of major colonic host defense peptides, namely cathelicidins, β-defensins, and members of the Regenerating islet-derived protein III (RegIII) and Resistin-like molecule (RELM) families. In a theoretical framework where these peptides work synergistically, aspects of pathogenesis of infectious colitis reviewed herein uncover roles of host defense peptides aimed to promote epithelial defenses and prevent pathogen colonization, mediated through a combination of direct antimicrobial function and fine-tuning of host immune response and inflammation. This interactive host defense peptide network may decode how the intestinal immune system functions to quickly clear infections, restore homeostasis and avoid damaging inflammation associated with pathogen persistence during infectious colitis. This information is of interest in development of host defense peptides (either alone or in combination with reduced doses of antibiotics) as antimicrobial and immunomodulatory therapeutics for controlling infectious colitis. © Copyright © 2020 Blyth, Connors, Fodor and Cobo.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 28; Correspondence Address: E.R.

Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) is a well-known medicinal plant with many pharmacological properties. Hence, the present study was designed to explore the probable beneficial effect of M. oleifera on CPF-induced health disturbances in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Two hundred and seventy fish were allocated into six groups in triplicate. For 30 days, the first group was fed a basal diet; the second group was exposed to 1/10 of the LC                             50                              of CPF (0.007 mg/L) and fed the basal diet; the third and fourth groups were fed basal diets supplemented with 7% M. oleifera seeds and 10% M. oleifera leaves, respectively; and the fifth and sixth groups were exposed to 1/10 of the LC                             50                              of CPF and fed basal diets supplemented with 7% M. oleifera seeds and 10% M. oleifera leaves, respectively. CPF exposure significantly altered growth performance, haematologic profiles, immune defence mechanisms, liver functions, and oxidant/antioxidant status. Additionally, CPF exposure resulted in prominent genotoxic and lipid peroxidative impacts. Interestingly, dietary supplementation with 7% M. oleifera seeds or 10% M. oleifera leaves significantly counteracted the CPF-induced adverse impacts on O. niloticus growth performance and health. These outcomes show that dietary supplementation with M. oleifera seeds or leaves can safeguard the commercially valuable freshwater fish species O. niloticus against CPF-induced health disorders and may be a candidate feed additive for Nile tilapia in aquaculture.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 57; Correspondence Address: Y.M.

Antifungal and entomotoxic effects were demonstrated for Jaburetox, an intrinsically disordered polypeptide derived from jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) urease. Here we describe the properties of Soyuretox, a polypeptide derived from soybean (Glycine max) ubiquitous urease. Soyuretox was fungitoxic to Candida albicans, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species. Soyuretox further induced aggregation of Rhodnius prolixus hemocytes, indicating an interference on the insect immune response. No relevant toxicity of Soyuretox to zebrafish larvae was observed. These data suggest the presence of antifungal and entomotoxic portions of the amino acid sequences encompassing both Soyuretox and Jaburetox, despite their small sequence identity. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic data revealed that Soyuretox, in analogy with Jaburetox, possesses an intrinsic and largely disordered nature. Some folding is observed upon interaction of Soyuretox with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles, taken here as models for membranes. This observation suggests the possibility for this protein to modify its secondary structure upon interaction with the cells of the affected organisms, leading to alterations of membrane integrity. Altogether, Soyuretox can be considered a promising biopesticide for use in plant protection. © 2019 by the authors.

We use the case of fish-friendly rice produced in Shiga prefecture, Japan, which contributes to the conservation of the water and ecosystem in rural areas around Lake Biwa by setting up fish ways and reducing the use of herbicides. We assume two conditions for consumers to pay premiums on environmental-friendly agricultural products. The first is that consumers recognize multifunctionality in agriculture. The second condition is that consumers have a correct understanding of environment-friendly agricultural products. We thus examine the effects of respondents’ attributes on their responses to two types of visual stimuli: one associated with the multifunctionality of agriculture and information about environment-friendly agricultural products. In the analysis of the respondents; willingness to pay, the price premium of the group with both the stimulus and information is significantly higher than the price premium of the control group with no interventions. However, the price premium of the group with only the stimulus is not statistically different for the control group. The policy implication of this research is that consumers are more likely to support agri-environmental policies if they recognize both the multifunctionality of agriculture and the properties of environmental-friendly agricultural products.

However, fish responses to organophosphates may vary depending on the activation of different defense mechanisms as well as the length of exposure. As such, the evaluation of acetylcholinesterase activity, in combination with the evaluation of biotransformation and antioxidants enzymes levels, is useful for indicating damage in fish exposed to this insecticide. Moreover, evaluating mitochondrial activity might evidence how the hierarchic responses occur in relation to the length of time that the fish is exposed. Therefore, the aim of our study is to evaluate whether the length of exposure to malathion differentially affects the biochemical responses of tambaqui. Our hypothesis is that the physiological alterations due to exposure are time dependent. Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of the insecticide during 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Contrary to expectations, there was no acetylcholinesterase activity inhibition during the experiment, which indicates an absence of neurotoxicity. Phase II biotransformation mechanism was activated early, especially in the liver. Oxidative damage was evident in the first hours of exposure and was concurrent with the activation of antioxidant enzymes. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were differentially affected by the length of exposure. The data suggest that the tambaqui regulates mitochondrial respiration differently over time, seeking to maintain homeostasis and ATP demand, and ensures the activation of response mechanisms, thus minimizing oxidative damage and avoiding the neurotoxicity of malathion.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  40,10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105997,Detoxification;Response mechanisms;Mitochondrial respiration;ATP demand;INTEGRATED BIOMARKER RESPONSE;CARPIO PROTECTIVE ROLE;CHIROSTOMA-JORDANI;LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY;DANIO-RERIO;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE;INHIBITION;CHLORPYRIFOS;BIOENERGETICS;DYSFUNCTION,NA,NA,temporal exposure to malathion biochemical changes in the amazonian fish tambaqui <i>colossoma macropomum<i>

The selective mode of action of diflubenzuron provided us with a unique tool for examining the indirect responses of an experimental aquatic ecosystem following direct impacts at the primary consumer (invertebrate) trophic level. Twelve outdoor aquatic mesocosms (0.1 ha each) were randomly assigned to three treatments of diflubenzuron (four mesocosms/treatment): control, monthly (five total 10-mu g/L applications), or biweekly (twice monthly; nine total 10-mu g/L applications). Direct impacts on invertebrates (numbers and species composition of insects and zooplankton) and indirect impacts on fish (mortality, growth, and reproduction of bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass), phytoplankton (biomass and productivity), and water quality were measured over 16 weeks posttreatment. Both monthly and biweekly treatments of diflubenzuron decreased total numbers (fivefold reduction) and species richness (twofold reduction) and increased dominance (twofold increase) of zooplankton within 4 weeks posttreatment; Cladocerans, Copepods, and Rotifers were all sensitive. Diflubenzuron reduced species richness of emergent insects, which resulted in increased dominance by a few species; however, impacts on emergent insects were confounded by a treatment x time interaction. Direct reductions in invertebrate grazers caused indirect increases in algal biomass. Indirect effects on biomass (50% reduction) and individual weight (50% reduction) of juvenile bluegill occurred because of apparent decreases in invertebrate food resources. No statistically significant impacts were observed on adult bluegill or largemouth bass for the duration of the experiment.

POPs are therefore addressed by the Stockholm Convention globally with human milk or blood as matrix for effectiveness evaluation. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess plasma concentrations of certain chlorinated POPs in subjects from the urban population in Algiers. Methods: A total number of 207 adult subjects were recruited in Algiers and plasma concentrations of Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), p,p'Dichlorodiphenyl DichloroEthylene (4,4'DDE) and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) were determined by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). Results: The nanogram per gram of lipids (ng g???1 lipids) geometric means of plasma concentrations of studied compounds were: 6.09 for HCB, 131.60 for 4,4'DDE, 8.61 for PCB153, 7.95 for PCB138 and 8.39 for PCB180. PCB 180, PCB 153 and PCB 138 showed a high correlation with each other (r > 0.5). 4,4'DDE concentrations were significantly higher in women and in subject with low educational level, whereas POPs were higher in older participants (> 65 years old). Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and PCB153 concentrations were higher in overweight and obese subjects. There was no significant difference between POPs concentrations according to breastfeeding history, smoking status or fish consumption. Conclusions: Chlorinated POPs were detected in the blood plasma of adults living in Algiers. Plasma concentrations were consistent with those of several studies in the world. However, further investigations are needed to assess the exposure profile of subjects living near contaminated sites. (c) 2021 The Authors.

However, stability has not been investigated for cases in which multiple types of density dependence act simultaneously. To determine whether IDD mortality can destabilize populations that are otherwise regulated by directly density-dependent (DDD) mortality, I used scale transition approximations to model populations with IDD mortality at smaller ""aggregation"" scales and DDD mortality at larger ""landscape"" scales, a pattern observed in some reef fish and insect populations. I evaluated dynamic stability for a range of demographic parameter values, including the degree of compensation in DDD mortality and the degree of spatial aggregation, which together determine the relative importance of DDD and IDD processes. When aggregation-scale survival was a monotonically increasing function of density (a ""dilution"" effect), dynamics were stable except for extremely high levels of aggregation combined with either undercompensatory landscape-scale density dependence or certain values of adult fecundity. When aggregation-scale survival was a unimodal function of density (representing both ""dilution"" and predator ""detection"" effects), instability occurred with lower levels of aggregation and also depended on the values of fecundity, survivorship, detection effect, and DDD compensation parameters. These results suggest that only in extreme circumstances will IDD mortality destabilize dynamics when DDD mortality is also present, so IDD processes may not affect the stability of many populations in which they are observed. Model results were evaluated in the context of reef fish, but a similar framework may be appropriate for a diverse range of species that experience opposing patterns of density dependence across spatial scales.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  80,10.1007/s12080-010-0083-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Dynamic stability;Negative binomial distribution;Scale transition approximation;Social aggregation;Thalassoma bifasciatum;REEF FISH POPULATIONS;PREY;RECRUITMENT;PREDATORS;MORTALITY;DISPERSAL;PATTERN;MUSSEL;CONSEQUENCES;CONNECTIVITY;Animal Shells;Animals,NA,NA,can inverse density dependence at small spatial scales produce dynamic instability in animal populations

The acute toxicity study revealed that the 96-h LC50 of BF is 6.81 mu g/L, and varying degrees of behavioral changes were recorded in a dose-dependent manner. The subchronic study revealed reduction of dissolved oxygen and increased ammonia in aquaria of BF-exposed fish. Clinical signs revealed high degree of discomfort and aggressiveness together with reductions in survival rate and body weight gain. The levels of monoamines in brain, and GABA and amino acids in serum were reduced, together with decreased activities of Na+/K+-ATPase and acetylcholine esterases (AchE). The activities of antioxidant enzymes were also diminshed in the brain while oxdative damage and DNA breaks were elevated. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in serum increased with overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain tissue. BF also upregulated the expression of brain-stress related genes HSP70, Caspase-3 and P53. Supplemention of PEO to BF markedly abrogated the toxic impacts of the insecticide, specially at the high level.

Although the toxicity of ATZ in fish is well documented, there are few studies on the recovery capacity after cATZ exposure. This work aimed to evaluate, using several biomarkers, the toxic effects of long-term exposure to the sublethal (3.57 mg/L) and nonlethal realistic (3.00 mu g/L) cATZ concentrations followed by a recovery assay, in fingerlings of a Brazilian teleost, the Piaractus mesopotamicus (pacu).        Materials and Methods: Pacu fingerlings were housed in glass tanks and divided into the following experimental groups (two tanks/group): Exposure control = EC, recovery control = RC, the sublethal groups exposed to 3.57 mg/L of cATZ, (sublethal exposure group = SLE and sublethal recovery group = SLR) and the nonlethal groups treated with 3.00 mu g/L of cATZ (nonlethal exposure group = NLE and nonlethal recovery group = NLR). The exposure assay was semi-static with a duration of 30 days and the recovery assay (after cATZ withdrawal) lasted 14 days. Several biomarkers were evaluated in fingerlings from all groups: The swimming behavior, the body weight gain, the micronucleus formation and nuclear alterations in erythrocytes, and the hepatic and renal histopathology analyzed by qualitative and semi-quantitative morphological methods (using light and electron microscopy).        Results: No significant difference in weight gain was observed among the groups after the exposure and recovery assays. The sublethal exposure induced impaired swimming movements, significant histopathological alterations, including necrosis in the liver and kidney, and a significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in erythrocytes. The nonlethal exposure induced only subtle histopathological changes in the liver and kidney. After recovery assay, no genotoxic alteration was noted in pacu exposed to sublethal concentration, while the cATZ-induced kidney damage was partially reversed but not the hepatic injury.        Conclusion: cATZ exhibits long-term toxic effects on pacu, even at relatively low concentrations, affecting mainly the liver and the kidney, and the effects of sublethal concentration are only partially reversed after cATZ withdrawal.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.14202/vetworld.2020.147-159     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Brazilian ichthyofauna;genotoxicity;histopathology;liver and kidney lesions;recovery assay;ultrastructure;EMERGING CONTAMINANTS;MICRONUCLEUS TEST;GENE-EXPRESSION;RISK-ASSESSMENT;ACUTE TOXICITY;CHLORPYRIFOS;WATER;FISH;KIDNEY;RIVER,NA,NA,effects of sublethal and realistic concentrations of the commercial herbicide atrazine in pacu <i>piaractus mesopotamicus<i> longterm exposure and recovery assays

Although in vitro approaches are used internationally, South African studies have only used in vivo methods. Considering ethical implications, the authors support the use of in vitro bioassays to screen environmental matrices for their OS potential. Since OS responses are initiated and measurable at lower cellular concentrations compared to other toxicity endpoints, in vitro OS bioassays could be used as an early warning sign for the presence of chemical mixtures in non-target environments. Areas of concern in the country could be identified and prioritized without using animal models.

NK cells are a subset of lymphocytes that act as an initial immune defense against tumor cells and virally infected cells. TBT is an environmental contaminant that has been detected in human blood, which has been shown to interfere with ATP synthesis. Previous studies have shown that TBT is able to decrease very significantly the lytic function of NK cells. In this study NK cells were exposed to various concentrations of TBT and to two other compounds that interfere with ATP synthesis (rotenone a complex I inhibitor and oligomycin an ATP synthase inhibitor) for various lengths of time before determining the levels of ATP and lytic function. Exposures of NK cells to 10, 25, 50 and 100 nm TBT did not significantly reduce ATP levels after 24 h. However, these same exposures caused significant decreases in cytotoxic function. Studies of brief I h exposures to a range of TBT, rotenone and oligomycin concentrations followed by 24 h, 48 h and 6 day periods in compound-free media prior to assaying for ATP levels or cytotoxic function showed that each of the compounds caused persistent decreases in ATP levels and lytic function of NK cells. Exposures to 0.05-5 mu m rotenone or oligomycin for 1 h reduced ATP levels by 20-25% but did not have any measurable effect on the ability of NK cells to lyse tumor cells. ATP levels were also decreased by about 20-25% after 24 h or 48 h exposures to rotenone or oligomycin (0.5 mu m), and the lytic function was decreased by about 50%. The results suggest that TBT-induced decreases in ATP levels were not responsible for the loss of cytotoxic function seen at I h and 24 h. However, TBT-induced decreases of NK-ATP levels may be at least in part responsible for losses of NK-cytotoxic function seen after 48 h and 6 day exposures.

To our knowledge, the mechanisms of toxicity to fish by the carbamate fungicide Tattoo that contains mancozeb [ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate)] have not been studied. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of Tattoo on goldfish gills and blood, tissues that would have close early contact with the pollutant. Exposure of goldfish Carassius auratus to 3,5 or 10 mg L-1 of Tattoo for 96 h resulted in moderate lymphopenia (by 8 percent) with a concomitant increase in both stab (by 66-88 percent) and segmented (by 166 percent) neutrophils. An increase in the content of protein carbonyl groups in blood (by 137-184 percent) together with decreased levels of protein thiols (by 23 percent) and an enhancement of lipid peroxide concentrations (by 29 percent) in gills after exposure to 10 mg L-1 of Tattoo demonstrated the induction of mild oxidative stress in response to Tattoo exposure. At the same time, the activities of selected antioxidant enzymes were enhanced in gills: superoxide dismutase by 18-25 percent and catalase by 27 percent. A 34 percent increment in low molecular mass thiol concentrations (mainly represented by glutathione) also occurred in gills and could be related to increased activity (by 13-30 percent) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The results indicate that Tattoo exposure perturbs free radical processes, i.e. induces mild oxidative stress and enhances the activity of certain antioxidant and associated enzymes in goldfish gills. It is clear that goldfish respond to the presence of waterborne pesticide by adjusting antioxidant defenses through upregulation of activities of antioxidant and associated enzymes.

Crayfish are polytrophic, meaning that they feed on and become prey for all levels of the aquatic food web as well as are also important for the transfer of energy between benthic and terrestrial food webs. Because crayfish are a keystone species, it is important to investigate any factors that may affect their population size. Crayfish are active at night and rely heavily on their sensory appendages (e.g., antennulues, maxillipeds, and pereopods) to localize food sources. In this experiment, we investigated the effects of atrazine (ATR) exposure on the chemosensory responses of male and female crayfish to food odors. We exposed crayfish to environmentally relevant, sublethal levels of ATR [80 ppb (A mu g/L)] for 72 h and then examined the behavioral responses of both ATR-treated and control crayfish to food odor delivered from one end of a test arena. We used Noldus Ethovision XT software to measure odor localization and locomotory behaviors of crayfish in response to food (fish) odor. We found that control crayfish spent more time in the proximal region of the test arena and at the odor source compared with ATR-treated crayfish. Furthermore, there were no differences in the time spent moving and not moving, total distance travelled in the tank, and walking speed (cm/s) when control and ATR-treated crayfish were compared.

As a result, removal of invasive species and reestablishment of natural vegetation have been attempted in order to restore biodiversity and ecosystem function. This study examined how native arthropod assemblages, an abundant and functionally important group of organisms in many ecosystems, are affected by the incursion of the invasive wetland plant Phragmites australis and if the restoration of the native vegetation in brackish Spartina alterniflora marshes results in the reestablishment of the arthropod community. The invasion of Phragmites into a coastal Spartina marsh in southern New Jersey seriously altered arthropod assemblages and trophic structure by changing the abundance of trophic groups (detritivores, herbivores, carnivores) and their taxonomic composition. Herbivore assemblages shifted from the dominance of external free-living specialists (e.g., planthoppers) in Spartina to concealed feeders in Phragmites (stem-feeding cecidomyiids). Moreover, free-living arthropods in Phragmites became dominated by detritivores such as Collembola and chironomids. The dominant marsh spiders, web-building linyphiids, were significantly reduced in Phragmites habitats, likely caused by differences in the physical environment of the invaded habitats (e.g., lower stem densities). Thus, trophic structure of arthropod assemblages in Phragmites, as seen in the large shifts in feeding guilds, was significantly different from that in Spartina. Removal of Phragmites with the herbicide glyphosate resulted in the rapid return of Spartina (<= 5 yrs). Moreover, return of the dominant vegetation was accompanied by the recovery of most original habitat characteristics (e.g., live and dead plant biomass, water flow rate). The arthropod assemblage associated with Spartina also quickly returned to its preinvasion state and was not distinguishable from that in uninvaded Spartina reference sites. This study provides evidence that the reestablishment of native vegetation in areas previously altered by an invasive plant can result in the rapid recovery of the native arthropod assemblage associated with the restored habitat.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  147     Total Times Cited:  197     Cited Reference Count:  70,10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00045.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alloway Creek;arthropod community structure;habitat restoration;invasive plants;Phragmites;salt marsh;Spartina;trophic structure;MUMMICHOG FUNDULUS-HETEROCLITUS;ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT;COASTAL SAGE SCRUB;COMMON REED;TIDAL WETLANDS;NORTH-AMERICA;NEW-JERSEY;BOTTOM-UP;BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS;BRACKISH-MARSH,NA,NA,restoration of arthropod assemblages in a <i>spartina<i> salt marsh following removal of the invasive plant <i>phragmites australis<i>

The total average PCB concentrations were as high as 96 and 29 mu g/g dry wt, in eels and damselfish, respectively, from Tern Island. The localized behavior and high bioaccumulation potential for PCBs suggest that damselfish are an excellent species for monitoring PCBs in small areas in the ocean. The high average concentrations of the sum of PCBs in different food chain levels suggest that pollution source(s) are around Tern Island and possibly around Disappearing Island. Aroclor 1254 and its analogs are suspected sources responsible for PCBs in the samples. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Fish were allocated into 6 groups: the control group was reared in clean water and fed with a commercial basal diet (CNT), two groups were fed with the basal diet supplemented with two different levels of GEO (GEO1 and GEO2, respectively), one group was intoxicated with 1/5 of ATZ 96-h lethal concentration 50 (1.39 mg/L) (ATZ group), and the remaining two groups were fed with the GEO-supplemented diets and concurrently exposed to 1.39 mg ATZ/L (GEO1+ATZ and GEO2+ATZ, respectively). The experiment lasted for 60 days. GEO supplementation exerted a significantly positive influence on fish growth, feed utilization, and hepatic antioxidant defense systems at both levels of supplementation. ATZ exposure significantly reduced fish survival rates and impaired fish growth and feed utilization, with the lowest final weights, weight gain, total feed intake, and the highest feed conversion ratio being recorded in the ATZ-intoxicated group. ATZ exposure caused significant changes in intestinal digestive enzyme activity (decreased lipase activity), hematological indices (decreased hemoglobin, packed cell volume, erythrocytes, and leukocytes), blood biochemical variables (decreased total proteins, albumin, globulins, and immunoglobulin M; increased total cholesterol, triglycerides, and cortisol), and hepatic oxidative/antioxidant indices (decreased glutathione level, superoxide dismutase and catalase enzyme activity and mRNA expression levels, and increased malondialdehyde content). Moreover, in the hepatic tissue of ATZ-intoxicated Nile tilapia, histopathological alterations and upregulated mRNA expression levels of stress- and apoptosis-related genes (Hsp70, caspase 3, and p53) were observed. GEO supplementation in ATZ-treated groups significantly attenuated the aforementioned negative effects, though some parameters did not reach the CNT values. These findings provide further and partly new evidence that sub-lethal ATZ toxicity induces reduced survivability, growth retardation, impaired digestive function, anemia, immunosuppression, hepatic oxidative stress damage, and overall increased stress level in Nile tilapia, and suggest that GEO supplementation may be useful for mitigating this toxicity and provide more general support to the productive performance and health status of this fish species.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  95,10.3389/fmars.2022.920057     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"herbal essential oils;aquafeed;animal health;animal welfare;productive performance;oxidative stress;physiological parameters;atrazine toxicity;HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS;FRESH-WATER FISH;DNA-DAMAGE;AMERICAN GINSENG;GENE-EXPRESSION;STRESS-RESPONSE;EXPOSURE;ENZYMES;GROWTH;CHLORPYRIFOS;Dietary Supplements;Animals;Oils, Volatile;Panax;Animal Shells",NA,NA,dietary supplementation of nile tilapia <i>oreochromis niloticus<i> with <i>panax ginseng<i> essential oil positive impact on animal health and productive performance and mitigating effects on atrazine induced toxicity

Amongst them, the cholinesterases are commonly extracted from several organisms to evaluate/measure organophosphate and carbamate neurotoxic effects. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) is an enzyme of the group of serine esterases that acts on the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine allowing the intermittence of the nerve impulses responsible for the neuronal communication. This enzyme is the main target for the action of some pesticides and the inhibition of its activity in bivalve mollusks may be used as biomarker due to their filter-feeding habit. In this context, the present study aimed to characterize physicochemical and kinetic parameters of the AChE extracted from gills and viscera of the oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae and investigate the in vitro effect of pesticides (dichlorvos, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, methyl-parathion, temephos, carbaryl, carbofuran, aldicarb, diflubenzuron and novaluron) in search for assessing its potential as biomarker. Specific substrates and inhibitors evidenced the predominance of AChE in both tissues. The optimum pH found for gills and viscera AChE were 8.0 and 8.5, respectively. The maximum peak of activity occurred at 70 degrees C for gill AChE and 75 degrees C for viscera AChE. The enzymes of both tissues presented remarkable thermostability. The Michaelis-Menten constant for both enzymes were 1.32 +/- 0.20 mM for gills and 0.43 +/- 0.12 mM for viscera. The values for gills and viscera were 53.57 +/- 1.72 and 27.71 +/- 1.15 mU/mg, respectively. The enzymes were able to reduce the activation energy to 9.75 kcal mol(-1) (gills) and 11.87 kcal mol(-1) (viscera) obtaining rate enhancements of 3.57 x 10(5) and 1.01 x 10(4), respectively, in relation to non-catalyzed reactions. Among the pesticides under study, the carbamates carbaryl and carbofuran exerted the strongest inhibitory effects on the enzyme activity achieving important degrees of inhibition at concentrations below national and international current regulations. The first observation of the effects of benzoylurea pesticides (diflubenzuron and novaluron) on AChE from mollusks is reported here. The gills AChE of C. rhizophorae showed potential to be specific biomarker for the carbamate carbaryl while the viscera AChE showed it for carbofuran.

Phase one utilized an online, voluntary, self-administered survey with 2788 responses received from a convenience sample of Laurentian Great Lakes Basin residents. Phase two included three “Thinkshops” of fishing and boating stakeholders in southern Michigan. Across all hypothetical Asian carp invasion scenarios, the application of rotenone to a large area was the most frequently selected management response. When impacts from Asian carp and their management were discussed, study participants supported framing risks in terms of environment and economy. Insights herein provide new evidence that can help narrow the gap between how invasion risks are perceived and responded to by natural resource managers to reduce social conflicts over, and potentially address, invasive species threats more rapidly. © Kahler et al.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: M.L.

In this study, krasV12 genetically modified zebrafish, Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2; TRE2:EGFP-krasG12V), a model system in which liver tumors can be induced by doxycycline (DOX), was used to evaluate the liver tumor promotion potential of TDCIPP. Briefly, krasV12 transgenic females were exposed to 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP, 20 mg/L DOX or a binary mixture of 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP with 20 mg/L DOX, and liver size, histopathology, and transcriptional profiles of liver were determined. Treatment with TDCIPP resulted in increased liver size and caused more aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Compared with the exposure to DOX, TDCIPP in the presence of DOX up-regulated the expression of genes relevant with salmonella infection and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. These results implied an occurrence of inflammatory reaction, which was sustained by the increase in the amount of infiltrated neutrophils in the liver of Tg(lyz:DsRed2) transgenic zebrafish larvae whose neutrophils were labelled by red fluorescent protein under the lysozyme C promoter. Furthermore, compared with the binary exposure of DOX and TDCIPP, treatment with a ternary mixture of TDCIPP, DOX and inflammatory response inhibitor (ketoprofen) significantly decrease the liver size and the amounts of neutrophils in the livers of kras and lyz double transgenic zebrafish larvae.

We check the relationships of these environmental factors with the total bird abundance (N), the alpha-fisher diversity (α), the bird species richness (S), the Berger-Parker dominance (d), the Margalef diversity (Mg), the Shannon diversity (H), the Shannon entropy (eh), the Simpson diversity (D) and the Simpson dominance (1-D) using stepwise multiple linear regression. To validate these statistical models, we determine the coefficients of determination (R2), the residual normality by Shapiro-Wilk test (W) and the residual homoscedasticity by Breusch-Pagan test (BP). In all the regressions we obtained high coefficients of determination, residual normality (except in Simpson dominance) and residual homoscedasticity. The main causal variables that effected ecological parameters of community were altitude, distance to nearest city, noise level and shrub cover. The park age was irrelevant because in urban areas the environment is continuously modified by gardening and, consequently, the succession processes are not produced.

In this study, we investigated the immunotoxic effects of Gla exposure on zebrafish embryos. Firstly, Gla markedly decreased the survival rate and caused a series of morphological malformations in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the number of macrophages and neutrophils was substantially reduced upon Gla exposure. In addition, the levels of oxidative stress were changed and the antioxidant enzyme activities such as CAT and SOD were elevated with the increase of Gla concentrations. Secondly, comparative transcriptome analysis identified 1, 366 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 789 up-regulated and 577 down-regulated in zebrafish embryos after Gla exposure. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that metabolic pathways such as drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 was markedly regulated and proteolysis, oxidation-reduction process, and peptidase activity were significantly enriched by the GO analysis. Besides, 55 immunity-related genes were identified in the DEGs, and we found that the genes in the metabolism, redox and immunity display an unique expression profilings by clustering analysis. Finally, 8 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were further conﬁrmed and they were differentially regulated after Gla exposure. In summary, a global survey of zebrafish defense against glufosinate was performed, and a large number of gene expression levels regarding metabolism, redox, and immunity-related genes were acquired from RNA-Seq.

In line with the regulatory framework implemented within the European Union (EU) to reduce the levels of endocrine disruptors (EDs) for consumers, new and effective methods for ED testing are needed. The OBERON project will build an integrated testing strategy (ITS) to detect ED-related metabolic disorders by developing, improving and validating a battery of test systems. It will be based on the concept of an integrated approach for testing and assessment (IATA). OBERON will combine (1) experimental methods (in vitro, e.g., using 2D and 3D human-derived cells and tissues, and in vivo, i.e., using zebrafish at different stages), (2) high throughput omics technologies, (3) epidemiology and human biomonitoring studies and (4) advanced computational models (in silico and systems biology) on functional endpoints related to metabolism. Such interdisciplinary framework will help in deciphering EDs based on a mechanistic understanding of toxicity by providing and making available more effective alternative test methods relevant for human health that are in line with regulatory needs. Data generated in OBERON will also allow the development of novel adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). The assays will be pre-validated in order to select the test systems that will show acceptable performance in terms of relevance for the second step of the validation process, i.e., the inter-laboratory validation as ring tests. Therefore, the aim of the OBERON project is to support the organization for economic co-operation and development (OECD) conceptual framework for testing and assessment of single and/or mixture of EDs by developing specific assays not covered by the current tests, and to propose an IATA for ED-related metabolic disorder detection, which will be submitted to the Joint Research Center (JRC) and OECD community. © 2020 by the authors.

These organisms can replicate and survive within host macrophages to escape from the subversion of the immune defense. E. piscicida-macrophage interaction is very important in determining the outcome of edwardsiellasis. As an effector protein of E. piscicida T6SS, EvpP has been determined to be a very important virulence factor for E. piscicida, although its precise role in E. piscicida-macrophage interactions is not yet clear. In this study, the roles of EvpP in E. piscicida-macrophage interactions were characterized. Here, we constructed the deletion mutants of evpP (ΔevpP) and complementation (ΔevpP-C) by the allelic exchange method. Compared to wild type strain (WT), ΔevpP was found to be attenuated for growth within macrophages. In line with this observation, we found its survival capacity was lower than WT under oxidative and acid stress in vitro, which simulate conditions encountered in host macrophages. Attenuation of ΔevpP also correlated with enhanced activation of macrophages, as reflected by augmented NO production in ΔevpP-treated macrophages. Moreover, compared to WT, ΔevpP induced markedly increased apoptosis of macrophages, characterized by increased Annexin V binding and the activation of cleaved caspase-3. These findings provided strong evidence that EvpP is involved in the process of E. piscicida-macrophage interactions and is required for its survival and replication in macrophages. Thus, we propose that EvpP might be an important factor that controlling the fate of E. piscicida inside macrophages. To further exploring the underlying mechanism of EvpP action, the cDNA library was constructed from E. piscicida-infected macrophages and a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to search for cellular proteins interacting with EvpP. Ribosomal protein S5 (RPS5) was identified as a target of EvpP. Furthermore, the interaction was validated with co-immunoprecipitation assay. This result implies that the observed effect of EvpP on macrophages might be related to RPS5-mediated regulation, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms of EvpP involved in E. piscicida-macrophage interactions. © Copyright © 2020 Qin, Wang, Gao, Bi and Wang.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: L.

In this study, Tg(fabp10:rtTA2s-M2; TRE2:EGFP-krasG12V), referred as kras transgenic zebrafish which was shown to be an inducible liver tumor model, was applied as experimental model to assess the promotion potential of TDCIPP for HCC in males. In brief, kras males were exposed to 20 mg/L doxycycline (DOX), 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP and a binary mixture of 20 mg/L DOX with 0.3 mg/L TDCIPP, and after exposure liver size, histopathology and transcriptional profiles of liver from these treatments were examined. With the involvement of TDCIPP, the liver size was significantly increased and the lesion of hepatocyte became more aggressive. Furthermore, expressions of genes involved in DNA replication and inflammatory response were simultaneously up-regulated in the treatment of TDCIPP compared with the solvent control and in the treatment of the binary mixture of the two chemicals compared to the single DOX treatment.

Based on data from 934 Chinese consumers, confidence in the safety of milk and IMF was measured by using a multi-item scale with 2 dimensions—optimism and pessimism. We found that Chinese consumers were optimistic about the safety of milk and IMF but, at the same time, were concerned about the risks related to milk and IMF. Chinese consumers have less confidence in IMF than in milk. Structural equation modeling indicated that consumer trust in manufacturers and third parties in the dairy supply chain and confidence in other foods, such as meat and fish, can foster consumer confidence in the safety of milk and IMF, while the extent of recall of the melamine infant formula incident in 2008 and trait worry exert negative effects. In addition, consumers with more children or less family income are likely to be more confident in domestically produced IMF.

This pesticide is an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, an essential enzyme for termination of nerve impulses. High rates of TRF use generate risks to the environment and human health. In the environment, pesticides can affect the local fauna and generate an ecological breakdown. There are several studies performed with fish production; however, gaps are created for native fish with other commercial values. The tuvira (Gymnotus carapo) is a fish native to Brazilian fauna and has great commercial importance in sport fishing. The present study aimed to determine the lethal concentration of trichlorfon (Masoten) in Gymnotus carapo and its sublethal effects on the enzyme AChE. In this study, the acute toxicity (the concentrations to kill 50% of the fish LC50 ) of TRF in tuviras (Gymnotus carapo) and acetylcholinesterase inhibition in liver and muscle tissue of tuviras submitted to sublethal concentrations were evaluated. For the acute assay, concentrations of 0.0, 5.0, 7.5, 15, 22.5, 30, 37.5 and 45 mg L-1 were used for a period of 96 h. After the acute exposure period, a LC50 of 6.38 mg L-1 was determined. In the sublethal assay, concentrations of 0.0, 0.238, 0.438 and 0.638 mg L-1 were used, based on 10% of the LC50, over a period of 14 days. Two collections were performed: one at seven days and the other at the end (day 14). Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in the liver was only shown (p < 0.05) for the treatment with 0.638 mg L-1 after 14 days of exposure. At seven days, muscle activity showed a significant difference only for the treatments 0.438 and 0.638 mg L-1, compared with the treatment 0.238 mg L-1 and control. At 14 days of exposure, only the treatment 0.638 mg L-1 showed significant differences in relation to the other groups, thus showing that enzyme recovery had occurred. The value found in the acute test allowed the conclusion that TRF presents moderately toxic characteristics to Gymnotus carapo. The toxicity parameter values calculated in the present study assisted in estimation of maximum allowable limits in bodies of water when combined with test data from other non-target organisms. © 2020, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

For this reason, larger, older females often disproportionately contribute to recruitment. However, increases in body size and age have also been shown to correlate with increased bioaccumulation of environmental contaminants, which negatively impact reproduction and larval survival. In this study, we tested for maternal age and size effects on fecundity, egg size and quality, contaminant body burden, and maternal transfer in Alligator Gar Atractosteus spatula to assess the potential for contaminant bioaccumulation to offset reproductive benefits of large females. We measured fecundity and egg quality (via lipid content) as well as tissue concentrations of mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in female Alligator Gar from the Trinity River, Texas. Fecundity was positively correlated with body size, but egg lipid was not significantly correlated with body size or with fecundity. Total mercury (THg) in both liver and muscle was positively correlated with maternal body size, and egg THg was positively correlated with maternal body size and liver THg. All liver and egg samples contained detectable levels of PCBs and OCPs, which were positively correlated with body size. Concentrations of PCBs and OCPs were positively correlated between tissues for each female, with egg concentrations being generally higher than liver concentrations. Based on concentrations of Hg, PCBs, and OCPs known to cause biological impairment in adult and larval fishes, the concentrations observed in this study suggest that adult reproductive function and behavior—as well as egg hatching success, larval development, and survival—could be compromised.

Although the toxicity of ATZ in fish is well documented, there are few studies on the recovery capacity after cATZ exposure. This work aimed to evaluate, using several biomarkers, the toxic effects of long-term exposure to the sublethal (3.57 mg/L) and nonlethal realistic (3.00 μg/L) cATZ concentrations followed by a recovery assay, in fingerlings of a Brazilian teleost, the Piaractus mesopotamicus (pacu). Materials and Methods: Pacu fingerlings were housed in glass tanks and divided into the following experimental groups (two tanks/group): Exposure control = EC, recovery control = RC, the sublethal groups exposed to 3.57 mg/L of cATZ, (sublethal exposure group = SLE and sublethal recovery group = SLR) and the nonlethal groups treated with 3.00 μg/L of cATZ (nonlethal exposure group = NLE and nonlethal recovery group = NLR). The exposure assay was semi-static with a duration of 30 days and the recovery assay (after cATZ withdrawal) lasted 14 days. Several biomarkers were evaluated in fingerlings from all groups: The swimming behavior, the body weight gain, the micronucleus formation and nuclear alterations in erythrocytes, and the hepatic and renal histopathology analyzed by qualitative and semi-quantitative morphological methods (using light and electron microscopy). Results: No significant difference in weight gain was observed among the groups after the exposure and recovery assays. The sublethal exposure induced impaired swimming movements, significant histopathological alterations, including necrosis in the liver and kidney, and a significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in erythrocytes. The nonlethal exposure induced only subtle histopathological changes in the liver and kidney. After recovery assay, no genotoxic alteration was noted in pacu exposed to sublethal concentration, while the cATZ-induced kidney damage was partially reversed but not the hepatic injury. Conclusion: CATZ exhibits long-term toxic effects on pacu, even at relatively low concentrations, affecting mainly the liver and the kidney, and the effects of sublethal concentration are only partially reversed after cATZ withdrawal. © Delcorso, et al.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: S.

The implications of these findings for fish was unknown, therefore we investigated the effects of chronic (21 day) exposures to NTO and an NTO-containing IM formulation called IMX-101 (composed of 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN), nitroguanidine (NQ), and NTO) in adult male fathead minnows to assess if impacts on testes were conserved. The NTO exposure caused no significant mortality through the maximum exposure concentration (720 mg/L, measured), however NTO elicited testicular impacts causing significant asynchrony in spermatogenesis and necrosis in secondary spermatocytes at the two highest exposure concentrations (383 mg/L and 720 mg/L) and testicular degeneration at the highest exposure. Microarray-based transcriptomics analysis identified significant enrichment of steroid metabolism pathways and mTORC-signal control of spermatogonia differentiation in NTO exposures each having logical connections to observed asynchronous spermatogenesis. Additionally, NTO impaired transcriptional expression for genes supporting sperm structural and flagellar development including sperm-associated antigen 6 (Spag6). These functional transcriptomic responses are hypothesized contributors to impacted reproductive physiology in NTO exposures that ultimately lead to reductions in spermatozoa. In contrast to NTO, the IMX-101 formulation elicited significant mortality at the two highest exposure concentrations of 25.2 and 50.9 mg/L (DNAN nominal + NTO measured + NQ measured). Unlike NTO and NQ, the DNAN component of the IMX-101 formulation underwent significant transformation in the 21d exposure. From previous investigations, neither NTO nor NQ caused mortality in fish at >1000 mg/L suggesting that mortality in the present study arose from DNAN / DNAN-attributable transformation products. The 12.6 mg/L IMX-101 exposure caused significant sublethal impacts on testes including sperm necrosis, interstitial fibrosis, and Sertoli-like cell hyperplasia. Transcriptional profiles for IMX-101 indicated significant enrichment on multiple signaling pathways supporting spermatogenesis, mitosis / meiosis, and flagellar structure, all logically connected to observed sperm necrosis. Additionally, pronounced transcriptional increases within the PPARα-RXRα pathway, a known DNAN target, has been hypothesized to correspond to Sertoli cell hyperplasia, presumably as a compensatory response to fulfill the nurse-function of Sertoli cells during spermatogenesis. Overall, the transcriptional results indicated unique molecular responses for NTO and IMX-101. Regarding chemical hazard, NTO impacted testes and impaired spermatogenesis, but at high exposure concentrations (≥ 192 mg/L), whereas the IMX-101 formulation, elicited mortality and impacts on reproductive physiology likely caused by DNAN and its transformation products present at concentrations well below the NTO-component concentration within the IMX-101 mixture formulation. © 2019","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: K.A.

Rice-fish farming has been applied in Margoluwih Village, Seyegan District, Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta Province for a few years. This study aims to analyze the use of inputs and production costs in rice-fish (minapadi) farming compared to monoculture rice farming, to estimate the income of rice-fish farming and monoculture rice farming, and to identify factors that influence farmers’ decision in adopting the integrated rice-fish farming. The study was conducted at Margoluwih Village, Sayegan District, Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta in March 2017. A total of 50 farmers were surveyed, comprising of 25 rice-fish farmers and 25 monoculture rice farmers. The methods used to achieve these objectives are descriptive analysis, income analysis, and logistic regression analysis. The results show that rice-fish farming requires inputs such as fish seeds, fish feed, prebiotics, and molasses of sugarcane while monoculture farming does not require such inputs, but monoculture farming uses pesticides and herbicides to overcome pest attacks and applies more chemical fertilizers than rice-fish farming. The labor time devoted to rice-fish farming is also higher than in monoculture farming. The total cost of rice-fish farming per hectare in one production season is Rp 63.47 million, while the total cost of monoculture rice farming amounted to Rp 17.55 million. However, rice-fish farming significantly earn more income compared to monoculture farming with an average value of Rp 28.45 and Rp 3.19 million per hectare in one growing season, respectively. Income is believed to be the main factor in determining the adoption, while social factors that influence farmer's decision to adopt rice-fish farming are age of farmer and experience of rice cultivation. © 2019, International Society for Southeast Asian Agricultural Sciences.

Previous studies have not evaluated the relationships of the frequency and severity of crayfish injuries with physical habitat quality, water quality, and biotic factors within agricultural headwater streams. Understanding these relationships will assist with determining if crayfish injury variables can serve as an indicator of physical habitat quality or water quality in these small degraded streams. We sampled crayfishes, documented the frequency and type of injuries, and measured instream habitat and water chemistry in 2014 and 2015 within 12 agricultural headwater streams in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. We documented five native crayfish species from 1641 adult captures. The most abundant species were Faxonius rusticus, Faxonius immunis, and Faxonius propinquus. Linear mixed effect model analyses indicated that four crayfish injury response variables were positively correlated (p < 0.05) with crayfish density, physical habitat quality, and water velocity diversity and that crayfish injury response variables were more strongly correlated with crayfish density than physical habitat quality or water quality.

Ecological models provide a means of quantitatively linking measured risk assessment endpoints with protection goals, by integrating potential chemical effects with species life history, ecological interactions, environmental drivers and other potential stressors. Here we demonstrate how an ecosystem modeling approach can be used to quantify insecticide-induced impacts on ecosystem services provided by a lake from toxicity data for organism-level endpoints. We used a publicly available aquatic ecosystem model AQUATOX that integrates environmental fate of chemicals and their impacts on food webs in aquatic environments. By simulating a range of exposure patterns, we illustrated how exposure to a hypothetical insecticide could affect aquatic species populations (e.g., recreational fish abundance) and environmental properties (e.g., water clarity) that would in turn affect delivery of ecosystem services. Different results were observed for different species of fish, thus the decision to manage the use of the insecticide for ecosystem services derived by anglers depends upon the favored species of fish. In our hypothetical shallow reservoir, water clarity was mostly driven by changes in food web dynamics, specifically the presence of zooplankton. In contrast to the complex response by fishing value, water clarity increased with reduced insecticide use, which produced a monotonic increase in value by waders and swimmers. Our study clearly showed the importance of considering nonlinear ecosystem feedbacks where the presence of insecticide changed the modeled food-web dynamics in unexpected ways.

The area of low polarity analytes in high fat foods had not been covered by the OAWG for many years since the key comparison CCQM-K21 p,p'-DDT in fish oil occurring in 2000. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is one of the markers for the occurrence of PAHs in foods, for which maximum residue limits are enforced in many countries. Edible oil and fats are the main source of human PAH intake. BaP may form in edible oils by pyrolytic processes, such as incomplete combustion of organic substances. Worldwide regulatory limits of BaP in edible fats and oils are from 2.0 μg/kg to 10 μg/kg. Comparable and traceable measurement results for BaP in oil are important worldwide. Thus BaP in edible oil was the model system selected to align within the OAWG strategy. 16 NMIs and DIs participated in CCQM-K146. Different methods such as liquid-liquid extraction, GPC and SPE were applied in the sample pre-treatment and HPLC-FLD, HPLC-MS/MS, and GC-MS or GC-MS/MS were applied for detection by the participants. Most participants either used their own CRMs, other NMI's CRMs or pure materials assessed in house to guarantee traceability to SI for the calibrants. One lab was excluded from the KCRV evaluation, as they did not meet the CIPM metrological traceability requirements for their calibrant. Regarding the data evaluation, five labs withdrew their results from the statistical evaluation of the KCRV for technical reasons. In line with the OAWG guidance document for KCRV estimator selection, the Hierarchical Bayes option was selected for the KCRV value, which was determined as 2.74 μg/kg with a standard uncertainty of 0.03 μg/kg. The remaining ten institutes that were included in the calculation of the consensus KCRV all agreed within their standard uncertainties. In general, the majority of CCQM-K146 participants performed very well. Therefore, this Track A Key Comparison directly illustrates the capabilities in determining mass fraction of organic compounds, with molecular mass of 100 g/mol to 500 g/mol, having low polarity pKow <-2, in mass fraction range from 0.1 μg/kg to 1000 μg/kg in a high fat, low protein, low carbohydrate food matrix.

Both compounds are nonionic surfactants produced by the alkoxylation of ethylene oxide with tallow amine, and they are used in variety of industries such as textiles, paints, metal working, agriculture, and polish manufacture. Fish were exposed to six concentrations of TA15 (0.2–4.0 mg/L) or TH30 (8–140 mg/L) for 96 h. The LC50 for TA15 was 2.08 mg/L and for TH30 47.32 mg/L. The main clinical signs observed in fish exposed to 4 mg/L of TA15 and 32 to 140 mg/L of TH30, were lethargy, loss of shoaling behavior, respiratory distress, changes in swimming pattern, such as, loss of balance and abnormal buoyancy, prolapse of the lower lip and superior location in the water column. The highest concentrations of these compounds induced nervous signs and collapse. The relevant macroscopic lesions were skin and fins erosions with necrotic lysis of the caudal peduncle. In addition, hemorrhages in mouth, branchial arches, and petechial hemorrhages in skin were observed. An increased fluid in the celomic cavity and meningeal hemorrhages were also evident. Organs as gills, liver, brain, and anterior kidney presented severe lesions at the highest concentrations of each compound. For the first time, it is reported lesions in interrenal tissues and choroidal bodies, as well as severe telencephalic lesions associated with the POEA toxicity. These last lesions were more severe in fish exposed to TA15 than to TH30, although the pattern of injuries was similar with both substances. According to the Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemical (GHS) by the United Nations, we reported that TA15 is classified as Acute Category 2 and TH30 is Acute Category 3 for white cachama. Due to the low LC50 and the highly toxic effects of both POEA compounds for neotropical fish, a revision of the regulation of the use of herbicide mixtures by Colombian legislation is necessary. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: P.R.

PCB concentrations in bluefish varied between different locations, and also among fish from a given location. A generally decreasing gradient in PCB concentrations was evident as the bluefish were collected away from the Superfund Site. The average sum of PCB concentrations were highest for bluefish collected in the Upper Harbor between Inter-state-195 Bridge and Coggeshall Street Bridge (Upper Harbor), followed by bluefish in Lower Harbor from north of Popes Island Bridge (Lower Harbor), and bluefish from Outer Harbor south of Hurricane Barrier (Outer Harbor). The levels of PCBs in bluefish from Clarks Cove and PCBs in bluefish from Buzzards Bay were similar and lowest among all bluefish specimens analyzed in the present study. Pesticide concentrations were about one order of magnitude or lower than the PCB concentrations, and the gradient of pesticide concentrations generally followed the gradient of PCB concentrations. Some of the commonly detected pesticides in the order of decreasing concentrations included DDTs and metabolites, heptachlor epoxide, endosulfan sulfate, and alpha-chlordane. Distribution of PCBs and sulfate, and alpha-chlordane. Distribution of PCBs and organochlorine pesticides were examined in the tissues of YOY bluefish from Clarks Cove. PCBs and lipids in the brain samples of YOY bluefish were generally numerically greater than PCBs in the liver samples, but these differences were not statistically significant. PCBs and lipids in hypaxial muscle samples were numerically greater than PCBs in epaxial muscle samples, although these two groups of tissues were not statistically different. Despite the higher susceptibility of lighter PCB homologs to geophysical and biogeochemical weathering processes, the relative dominance of lighter homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor samples suggested ongoing or recent sources of these lighter PCBs, particularly Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016 in this area. The presence of heavier homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor bluefish samples could be attributed to Aroclor 1252 and Aroclor 1254 that were being used in relatively smaller quantities in the manufacture of electrical components in addition to Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016. The concentration of heavier PCB homologs appears to increase in YOY bluefish the further away from the PCB Superfund Site in the Acushnet Estuary the samples were collected. Principal component analyses of PCB 153 normalized concentrations of the individual PCB congeners resulted in two general groupings; a relatively tight group comprised of YOY bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor, and a rather loose and more dispersed group comprised of Buzzards Bay bluefish and the tissue samples of bluefish from Clarks Cove. Principal component analyses of major pesticides suggested close groupings of bluefish from Clarks Cove and bluefish from Buzzards Bay. Pesticides in bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor formed a loose group, with some bluefish from these locations populating close to Clarks Cove and Buzzards Bay bluefish.        Although PCBs have been implicated in various behavioral and health effects in the experimental and field studies, the deleterious effects of chronic exposure to high concentrations of PCBs and the potential for recruitment of New Bedford Harbor YOY bluefish population to the adult stock remains obscure. Adaptive or evolutionary resistance to contaminants have been documented in resident species in some highly contaminated estuaries, however similar responses have not been investigated in the migratory species like bluefish. The results of the present study provide a reference baseline for YOY bluefish for ""before-and-after"" comparative studies and other toxicological studies for the New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site that is currently being remediated.

Unexpectedly, these structures reveal DNA melting at the heptamer of the RSSs, thus resulting in a corkscrew-like rotation of coding-flank DNA and the positioning of the scissile phosphate in the active site. Substrate binding is associated with dimer opening and a piston-like movement in RAG1, first outward to accommodate unmelted DNA and then inward to wedge melted DNA.

Smaug orthologs form cytosolic membrane-less organelles (MLOs) in several organisms and cell types. We have performed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays that revealed that SDHB and UQCRC1 mRNAs associate with Smaug1 bodies in U2OS cells. Loss of function of Smaug1 and Smaug2 (also known as SAMD4A and SAMD4B, respectively) affected both mitochondrial respiration and morphology of the mitochondrial network. Phenotype rescue by Smaug1 transfection depends on the presence of its RNA-binding domain. Moreover, we identified specific Smaug1 domains involved in MLO formation, and found that impaired Smaug1 MLO condensation correlates with mitochondrial defects. Mitochondrial complex I inhibition upon exposure to rotenone, but not strong mitochondrial uncoupling upon exposure to CCCP, rapidly induced the dissolution of Smaug1 MLOs. Metformin and rapamycin elicited similar effects, which were blocked by pharmacological inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Finally, we found that Smaug1 MLO dissolution weakens the interaction with target mRNAs, thus enabling their release. We propose that mitochondrial respiration and the AMPK-mTOR balance controls the condensation and dissolution of Smaug1 MLOs, thus regulating nuclear mRNAs that encode key mitochondrial proteins.

It was based on the principle of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition and chemometric data analysis using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Four types of native or recombinant AChEs (electric eel, bovine erythrocytes, rat brain, Drosophila melanogaster) were immobilised by screen printing on four-electrode thickfilm sensors in sets containing each AChE. The multisensors were used for quantitative inhibition analysis of binary reagent mixtures combining the AChE-multisensor with feed-forward ANNs. The sensors registered a detection range for both analytes of 0.2-26 mu g/l with an overall assay time of less than 60 min. The individual inhibition pattern of each AChE-analyte combination enabled the discrimination of both analytes by the use of neural network data processing. Thus, paraoxon and carbofuran in mixtures displaying a concentration range of 0-20 mu g/l for each analyte could be analysed with prediction errors of 0.9 mu g/l for paraoxon and 1.4 mu g/l for carbofuran.

The purpose of this study is to understand how differing routes of exposure to atrazine alter social behaviors and physiological responses of aquatic organisms. This study used agonistic encounters in crayfish Orconectes virilis as a behavioral assay to investigate impact of sublethal concentrations of atrazine (0, 40, 80, and 160 A mu g/L) delivered by methods mimicking ground water and surface runoff influx into flow-through exposure arenas for a total of 23 h. Each experimental animal participated in a dyadic fight trial with an unexposed opponent. Fight duration and intensity were analyzed. Experimental crayfish hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle tissue samples were analyzed for cytochrome P450 and acetylcholinesterase levels to discern mechanism of detoxification and mode of action of atrazine. Atrazine delivered via runoff decreased crayfish overall fight intensity and contrastingly ground water delivery increased overall fight intensity. The behavioral differences were mirrored by increases in cytochrome P450 activity, whereas no differences were found in acetylcholinesterase activity.

For Fisher, dominance of the wild-type is the result of selection, whereas for Wright it is a mere consequence of the biochemical properties of physiological pathways. Over time, Wright's theory has appeared as the most appropriate, and Kacser and Burns explained why the widespread occurrence of recessive mutants is the inevitable consequence of the kinetic structure of enzyme networks. Does Wright and Kacser and Burns (W-K-B)'s theory apply for newly arisen adaptive genes? A survey of more than 70 studies shows that pesticide resistance conferred by mutations decreasing the affinity of the pesticide target-sites varies from complete recessivity to complete dominance. This review shows that dominance always has a purely physiological explanation that can be roughly, but not simply, predicted by W-K-B's theory.

On the other hand, the natural environment of amphibians is extremely polluted by various xenobiotics. This study evaluated how pre-exposure of Bombina variegata tadpoles to chronic environmental stress (desiccation) modulates the biochemical response of juvenile individuals to following acute chemical stressor (pesticide deltamethrin). Our results demonstrated that individually applied pesticide changed the thiol and lipid status of the treated juveniles but animals subjected solely to desiccation pressure were more tolerant to free radicals and showed no induction of lipid peroxidation. Comparison of juveniles exposed to deltamethrin revealed that desiccation pretreatment during the larval stage of development modified cellular protection in the juveniles. Higher activities of CAT, GSH-Px and GR were recorded in the preexposed group, as well as a lower degree of lipid peroxidation relative to the group that was not pre-exposed to low water stress. Pre-desiccated groups displayed the greatest range of coordination of investigated antioxidant parameters, supported by Pearson's correlations. Activation of the GSH-redox system is a significant marker in juveniles against stress caused by desiccation and a chemical stressor. The stressful environment experienced during tadpole development produced an adaptive reaction to subsequent exposure to another stressor in juveniles.

The deduced OfMIF and OfDDT protein sequences revealed the presence of the catalytic oxidoreductase (CXXC), motif. They also possessed highly conserved proline (P-2) and lysine residues (K-33), responsible for their isomerase and tautomerase functions. Rock bream MIF and DDT homologues shared higher identity with fish homologues and also with mammals and occupied a distinct position in the phylogenetic tree, depicting their evolutionary conservation. The spatial expression analysis revealed the highest expression of both OfMIF and OfDDT in liver, while portraying constitutive expression in other tissues. The recombinant proteins purified using the Escherichia coli system revealed potent oxidoreductase activity against insulin with both dithiothreitol and glutathione as reducing agents. Stimulation of rock bream head kidney cells with recombinant OfMIF and OfDDT proteins induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta).

By studying HMGB1 release mechanisms, here we identify a role for double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR, also known as EIF2AK2) in inflammasome activation. Exposure of macrophages to inflammasome agonists induced PKR autophosphorylation. PKR inactivation by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition severely impaired inflammasome activation in response to double-stranded RNA, ATP, monosodium urate, adjuvant aluminium, rotenone, live Escherichia coli, anthrax lethal toxin, DNA transfection and Salmonella typhimurium infection. PKR deficiency significantly inhibited the secretion of IL-1 beta, IL-18 and HMGB1 in E. coli-induced peritonitis. PKR physically interacts with several inflammasome components, including NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), NLRP1, NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and broadly regulates inflammasome activation.

These results show a crucial role for PKR in inflammasome activation, and indicate that it should be possible to pharmacologically target this molecule to treat inflammation.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  598     Total Times Cited:  676     Cited Reference Count:  26,10.1038/nature11290     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PROTEIN-KINASE PKR;SUBSTRATE RECOGNITION;NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME;APOPTOSIS;ACID;ELF2-ALPHA;INFECTION;PATHWAYS;BINDING;STRESS,NA,NA,novel role of pkr in inflammasome activation and hmgb1 release

A total of 146 collections containing two or more apogonid species was made in the Gulf of Honduras, 22 in Puerto Rico, and 35 in the Hawaiian Islands. Detrended correspondence analysis determined whether collections from specific habitats clustered together in ordination space. Analysis of the Atlantic apogonid data did not result in the recognition of any exclusive assemblages corresponding to specific habitats, whereas collections from the Pacific Ocean demonstrated exclusive clusters of cardinalfish assemblages from different habitats. Horn's Index of Similarity was used to compare assemblages, and a randomization test was used to evaluate their significance. Because these differences could be the result of large differences in sample sizes between collections from the two oceans, subsamples of the much larger Atlantic dataset were taken. The subsamples demonstrated that with smaller samples the probability of visualizing polygons containing only samples from a single habitat are greater, but these samples did not result in the same level of habitat specificity as found for the Pacific samples, and similarity measures also differed. These data demonstrate for the first time that assemblage patterns within a single fish family differ between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

Immunological responses were examined at different organizational levels, from individuals to gene expression. No negative effects of PD were noted on the Fulton index nor on the liver or spleen somatic indices (LSI; SSI) before viral infection, but the infectious stress seems to generate a weak but significant decrease in Fulton and LSI values, which could be associated with consumption of energy reserves. During the viral challenges, the distribution of cumulative mortality was slightly different between infected groups. The impact of the virus on fish previously contaminated by PD started earlier and lasted longer than controls. The proportion of seropositive fish was lower in the fish group exposed to PD than in the control group, with similar quantities of anti-IHNV antibodies secreted in positive fish, regardless of the treatment. While no significant differences in C3-1 expression levels were detected throughout the experiment, TNF1&2, TLR3, Il-1 beta and IFN expression levels were increased in all infected fish, but the difference was more significant in fish groups previously exposed to herbicide.

Exposure to estrogenic endocrine disrupters during critical periods in fetal life can alter the development of reproductive organs, the neuroendocrine system and subsequent behavior. We present a series of studies on the effects of exposure during fetal life to low, environmentally relevant doses of two pesticides, o, p ' DDT and methoxychlor, and of low doses of the synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol on subsequent neuro-behavioral development in house mice. The main findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Mice prenatally exposed to methoxychlor showed changes in reflex development. Exposure to a very low dose of methoxychlor appeared to produce an increased reactivity during early postnatal life. (2) Methoxychlor exposed periadolescent mice showed a decreased reaction time exploring both a novel environment and a novel object. (3) The onset of male intrasex aggression appeared to be delayed in males prenatally exposed to low doses of methoxychlor, since exposed males showed low levels of aggressive interactions during early adolescence but not after they reached adulthood. (4) The rate of depositing urine marks in a novel environment was increased in males prenatally exposed to DES, and also to o, p ' DDT and methoxychlor. (5) The proportion of both males and females attacking a same-sex conspecific was increased in mice prenatally exposed to low doses of DES and, marginally, to o, p ' DDT. This effect appeared to be related to a decreased latency to attack. However, males prenatally exposed to o, p ' DDT displayed a decreased intensity of aggression. The possible implications of perturbing the hormonal milieu during fetal development on the modulation of developmental turnpoints and future behavioral responses are discussed.

We used congener-specific and total Aroclor quantitative approaches, both of which involved gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (electron ionization mode), we confirmed the presence of PCBs in the combined serum samples and in the aliquots of bluefish and lobsters. In measuring the PCB levels in serum, we found good agreement between the two electron capture detector approaches (r greater-than-or-equal-to 0.97) when the serum of specific congeners was compared to total Aroclor. We used univariate and multivariate quality control approaches to monitor these analyses. Analytical results for bluefish showed a better agreement between the two techniques than did those for lobsters; however, the small number of samples precluded any statistical comparison. We also measured levels of chlorinated pesticides in the serum samples of two groups of New Bedford residents, those with low PCB levels (< 15 ng/ml) and those with high PCB levels (greater-than-or-equal-to 15 ng/ml). We found that residents with high PCB levels also tended to have higher levels of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-di-(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE).

Coagulation, liver, and kidney indices were first analyzed by variance analysis, receiver operating characteristic curves, and Fisher discriminant analysis. Then, a new, intelligent, machine learning-based system was established to effectively provide prognostic analysis of PQ-poisoning patients based on a combination of the aforementioned indices. In the proposed system, an enhanced extreme learning machine wrapped with a grey wolf-optimization strategy was developed to predict the risk status from a pool of 103 patients (56 males and 47 females); of these, 52 subjects were deceased and 51 alive. The proposed method was rigorously evaluated against this real-life dataset, in terms of accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficients, sensitivity, and specificity. Additionally, the feature selection was investigated to identify correlating factors for risk status. The results demonstrated that there were significant differences in the coagulation, liver, and kidney indices between deceased and surviving subjects (p<0.05). Aspartate aminotransferase, prothrombin time, prothrombin activity, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, urea nitrogen, and creatinine were the most highly correlated indices in PQ poisoning and showed statistical significance (p<0.05) in predicting PQ-poisoning prognoses. According to the feature selection, the most important correlated indices were found to be associated with aspartate aminotransferase, the aspartate aminotransferase to alanine ratio, creatinine, prothrombin time, and prothrombin activity. The method proposed here showed excellent results that were better than that produced based on blood-PQ concentration alone. These promising results indicated that the combination of these indices can provide a new avenue for prognosticating the outcome of PQ poisoning.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  43     Total Times Cited:  46     Cited Reference Count:  34,10.1371/journal.pone.0186427     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),GREY WOLF OPTIMIZER;FACE RECOGNITION;CLASSIFICATION;PREDICTION;Kidney;Poisoning;Liver,NA,NA,a new machinelearning method to prognosticate paraquat poisoned patients by combining coagulation liver and kidney indices

Reliable indicators still need to be found in order to properly assess the impact of pesticides in fish. After an in vivo chronic exposure to pendimethalin, the detoxification process and the antioxidant defense system were assessed in 120 adult rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Four nominal exposure conditions were tested: control (C), 500 ng L-1 (P500), 800 ng L-1 (P800) and the commercial formulation Prowl at 500 ng L-1 (Pw500). Fish samples were made after a 28 day exposure period (D28) and after a fifteen day recovery period in clean fresh water (D43). At D28, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was not activated in liver in spite of the pendimethalin uptake in fish. At D43, EROD activity in fish exposed to the commercial product was lower than in control fish, which may be explained by the high presence of herbicide in fish (613 +/- 163 ng g bile(-1)). Furthermore, antioxidant defense responses were set up by trout in gills and liver following chronic exposure to 800 ng L-1 of pendimethalin concentration. While the glutathione content (GSH) decreased in gills, it increased in liver associated with higher activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). These disturbances could lead to reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress in the vital organs in fish. After fifteen days in clean water, while the SOD activity was restored, the GSH content and GPx activity were still significantly disturbed in fish exposed to pendimethalin in comparison with control. These significant differences between treatments in antioxidant defenses parameters measured, attesting to the irreversibility of the effects. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Considering the importance of genomic integrity, it is critical to improve the knowledge on ozone-related genotoxic hazard to organisms reared in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) applying ozonation. Therefore, genetic damage induced by ozone exposure in the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) was assessed, combining the comet and the erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) assays, reflecting different damage levels, i.e. DNA and chromosomal damage, respectively. Fish were subjected to a daily 6-h ozone (0.15 mg L-1) exposure, repeated for 3 consecutive days, simulating a short-term event of overozonation. To assess the temporal impact of the previous event, the progression of damage was evaluated 7 days later, following transference to ozone-free water or to 0.07 mg L-1 ozone, a routinely adopted level in RAS. Both endpoints pointed to the ozone genotoxic potential, displaying DNA oxidation as a possible mechanism of damage. Overall, the present findings pointed out the genotoxic hazard of ozone to fish, highlighting the importance of these types of studies and contributing to improve aquaculture practices, namely in RAS systems. These early genotoxic signals may be a prelude to negative repercussions on fish health, which may affect the aquaculture productivity. The present findings recommend precautions in relation to accidental or intentional overozonation in fish-farming, even when short-term events are considered. The strategies to mitigate the impact of ozonation in S. senegalensis may include a dietary extra supplementation of antioxidants (regularly, or punctually in cases of overozonation).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  54,10.1016/j.cbpc.2019.02.001     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),DNA damage;Ozone;Fish;RAS;TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS;GLYPHOSATE-BASED HERBICIDE;ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA L.;RECIRCULATION AQUACULTURE;COMET ASSAY;NUCLEAR ABNORMALITIES;OZONATED SEAWATER;E SUPPLEMENTATION;OXIDATIVE STRESS;UV-IRRADIATION;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA,NA,NA,dna and chromosomal damage in senegalese sole <i>solea senegalensis<i> as side effects of ozonebased water treatment contribution to optimization of fishfarming practices

This effort has led to the production of large, complex data sets of environmental results making the task of evaluation of the aquatic chemical status more difficult. Furthermore, the evaluation of the chemical status of the water ecosystems is one of the main aspects which should be considered in a River Basin Management Plan. In this study, two indices were developed in order to assess the combined pesticide ecotoxicity to aquatic non-target organisms, the Aquatic Quality Index of Short term Toxicity of Pesticides (AQI ShToxP) and the Aquatic Quality Index of Long term Toxicity of Pesticides (AQI LToxP). These indices were applied to the environmental results obtained from an intensive monitoring study of 302 pesticides in 102 stationary sampling stations located on the surface aquatic network of the Pinios River Basin, in Greece, in 2011 and 2012. The evaluation of the surface water quality was achieved by taking into consideration the frequency and the intensity of exposure of the aquatic organisms to pesticides above the respective ecotoxicological quality objectives such as the acute or chronic term predicted no-effect concentrations derived from risk assessment. Seventy-five pesticides, that have been previously identified as the River Basin Specific Pollutants of Pinios by an environmental and human risk hierarchy exercise, were assessed. It appears, from the implementation of the two indices, that the detected pesticides in the surface aquatic ecosystem of the Pinios River Basin exert significant pressure on the aquatic non-target organisms especially at the chronic effect level. The developed AQI ShToxP and AQI LToxP indices, as well as the proposed quality classification system could be valuable communication and interpretation tools for River Basin Management Plans that can contribute in the restoration of environmental health. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: A.

The lack of researchers and resources in insect nematology also contributed significantly to this delay. During the 1980s, as applications made against foliage-feeding insects generally proved to be ineffective because of rapid desiccation and inactivation by sunlight, a shift to usage in their natural habitat against soil insects occurred. These trials had greater success, particularly against root weevils, but field evaluations of efficacy against soil insect pests other than root weevils produced inconsistent results.3'4 The sources of variation included application methods, nematode species and strains, host stage and defense mechanisms, and the biotic and abiotic soil environments.

Despite recent advances in fish, mice, and insects, there are still only a few compelling examples of major genes and cellular mechanisms associated with complex behavioral changes. Shifts in food or host preferences in insects, accompanied by changes in the peripheral chemosensory system, offer some of the best examples of adaptive behavioral evolution. A remarkable example is the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, a major indoor pest with a highly diverse omnivorous diet. Strong and persistent selection pressure with toxic-baits has induced rapid evolution of behavioral resistance in multiple cockroach populations. While typical cockroaches detect and accept the sugar glucose as a feeding-stimulant, behaviorally resistant cockroaches avoid eating glucose-containing toxic baits by sensing glucose as a deterrent.

On the synthetic solution, the study was conducted with a concentration of l50ppm of fenitrothion submitted to gamma rays of 60Co to absorbed doses varying from l5 to 50kGy. The results showed that on the one hand, the pesticide concentration decreased with dose increasing and, on the other hand, irradiation acidifies the pH of solution, which passed from 5.l7 to 3.2l at 50kGy. The High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis has shown that 90 % of the fenitrothion contained in the solution was degraded at the dose of 50kGy. Some by-products formed during irradiation were identified. The study on sewer water was conducted on real samples collected from a purification plant effluent that receives industrial and domestic sewer water. Samples were irradiated in 2 -l2 kGy dose range. The results showed the decrease of the pH of the effluent sample with the increase of the absorbed dose. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) of irradiated and non-irradiated samples was determined. The results showed that gamma radiation at the dose of l2kGy reduced by 46%the COD of the effluent.

Hypoxia manifests these unfavorable effects through activation of a family of transcription factors, Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play a pivotal role in the adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxic and nutrient-deprived conditions by upregulating the transcription of several pro-oncogenic genes. Several advanced human cancers share HIFs activation as a final common pathway. Areas covered: This review highlights the role and regulation of the HIF-1/2 in cancers and alludes on the biological complexity and redundancy of HIF-1/2 regulation. Moreover, this review summarizes recent insights into the therapeutic approaches targeting the HIF-1/2 pathway. Expert opinion: More studies are needed to unravel the extensive complexity of HIFs regulation and to develop more precise anticancer treatments. Inclusion of HIF-1/2 inhibitors to the current chemotherapy regimens has been proven advantageous in numerous reported preclinical studies. The combination therapy ideally should be personalized based on the type of mutations involved in the specific cancers, and it might be better to include two drugs that inhibit HIF-1/2 activity by synergistic molecular mechanisms. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 185; Correspondence Address: W.

METHODS: We interviewed 177 pregnant women between November 2016 and February 2017 in the 10 basic health units of the municipality of Propriá, state of Sergipe, two located in the rural area and eight in the urban area, during prenatal appointments, to raise information about the use of preventive measures against the vector transmission of Zika virus. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods, chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, and the odds ratio was calculated. The independent variables were grouped by the analysis of principal components, and the dependents (the use of repellent, mosquito nets, garments, screens and insecticides) were analyzed using the logistic regression method. RESULTS: Among the measures recommended by the Ministry of Health, mosquito nets were the most used by pregnant women living in rural areas and with low education level, while the repellents were more used by women in the urban area and with higher education level. Women in a vulnerable socio-economic situation presented a risk 2.4 times higher for not using screens in their homes, 1.9 times higher for not changing clothes and 2.5 times higher for not using repellent than pregnant women in better economic conditions.

Though this “knowing-doing gap” has been well-described, there have been few efforts to guide scientists in how to develop useful and usable science. Here we demonstrate how a comprehensive survey of managers (representing 42 wetland management units across the Great Salt Lake watershed) can highlight management practices and challenges (here for the widespread invasive plant, Phragmites australis, a recent and aggressive invader in this region) to ultimately inform a research program. The diversity of surveyed organizations had wide-ranging amounts of Phragmites which led to different goals and approaches including more aggressive control targets and a wider array of control tools for smaller, private organizations compared to larger government-run properties. We found that nearly all managers (97%) used herbicide as their primary Phragmites control tool, while burning (65%), livestock grazing (49%), and mowing (43%) were also frequently used. Managers expressed uncertainties regarding the timing of herbicide application and type of herbicide for effective control. Trade-offs between different Phragmites treatments were driven by budgetary concerns, as well as environmental conditions like water levels and social constraints like permitting issues. Managers had specific ideas about the plant communities they desired following Phragmites control, yet revegetation of native species was rarely attempted. The results of this survey informed the development of large-scale, multi-year Phragmites control and native plant revegetation experiments to address management uncertainties regarding herbicide type and timing. The survey also facilitated initial scientist-manager communication, which led to collaborations and knowledge co-production between managers and researchers. An important outcome of the survey was that experimental results were more pertinent to manager needs and trusted by managers. Such an approach that integrates manager surveys to inform management experiments could be adapted to any developing research program seeking to be relevant to management audiences. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 23; Correspondence Address: C.B.

(Aizoaceae), a prominent invasive plant in Europe. Carpobrotus species are mat-forming trailing succulent perennial herbs native from South Africa, introduced in Europe for ornamental and soil stabilization purposes since the beginning of the seventeenth century, now widely naturalized on coastal habitats of southern and western Europe. C. acinaciformis and C. edulis are the main species recognized outside South Africa, together with their hybrids and potential hybrid swarms. Identification conflicts both in the native and invaded areas raise doubts on the taxonomy of these taxa, but hybridization processes may boost adaptive changes in the invaded range. The release of Carpobrotus in natural environments and protected areas is prohibited in several European countries, but this taxon is not included in the list of invasive species of Union concern. Carpobrotus is a pioneer of disturbed sites and coastal areas including cliffs and sand dune systems, due to its tolerance to stress factors such as salinity, drought and excess of light. Carpobrotus invasion ultimately affects patterns of native species diversity. Moreover, it has been recognized as a major driver of soil conditions shifts and soil geochemical processes disruptions, representing a serious threat for coastal habitats. Management plans for Carpobrotus must consider its high plasticity for morphological and ecophysiological traits, which may probably explain its tolerance to a wide range of ecological conditions. Its flexible mating systems, which represent an optimal strategy to facilitate local adaptation and habitat colonization, include ability to produce apomictic seeds, self- and cross-pollination, and an intense vegetative clonality. In addition, Carpobrotus produces a large seed bank with a moderate short-term persistence, and fruits are effectively dispersed by mammals. The most efficient control methods are physical removal and herbicide application on leaves, whereas integration of biological control with other conventional management methods are likely to be most effective.

However, antimicrobials (typically antimicrobial peptides, AMPs) in the venom often exist in low abundance that might exclude their immune role alone, leaving an open question with regard to their in vivo biological function. Here, we report the bactericidal activity of seven peptides isolated from the scorpion Mesobuthus eupeus venom, including one classical α-helical AMP and five ion channel-targeted neurotoxins. This AMP of 49 amino acids (named Meucin-49) is a multifunctional molecule that displays a wide-spectrum and highly potent activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with strong hemotoxicity on scorpion’s predators (i.e., mammals, lizards, and birds) and high insecticidal activity. Although the neurotoxins targeting voltage-gated sodium (Na                             v                             ) and/or large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels showed only marginal activity towards several species of bacteria, they were capable of significantly potentiating the bactericidal potency of Meucin-49. This observation highlights, for the first time, the venom’s antibacterial immune function mediated by a joint action between neurotoxins and AMPs. The findings that traditionally defined neurotoxins possess (synergistic) bactericidal activity, while the classical AMPs play predatory and defensive roles, provide new evidence in favor of a general and intrinsic multifunctionality of scorpion venom components.                          © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: S.

Treatment may continue during pregnancy, since untreated depression poses a risk to the mother and child. However, many antidepressants readily pass through the placental barrier to reach the fetus or may be ingested by the newborn via breastmilk. Little is known about the effects of antidepressants on brain development and subsequent behavior in young children. In the current study, we used zebrafish as a model system to examine the neurodevelopmental effects of three commonly prescribed antidepressants, sertraline, duloxetine and bupropion. Zebrafish were exposed to these antidepressants during development and were examined for changes in larval avoidance behavior, activity, social behaviors, and anxiety-related behaviors. The results show that antidepressants commonly affect larval swim speeds and resting, and differentially affect other behaviors depending upon the exposure period. Using cluster analysis profiling, we compared the obtained results to previous reports on behavioral defects induced by organophosphate pesticides. We found that the behavioral profiles induced by antidepressants and pesticides overlap, indicating a common mechanism of action. We conclude that developmental antidepressant exposures lead to specific behavioral changes in zebrafish larvae.

As there are limited studies focusing on farmers’ and retailers’ knowledge related to pesticide use and associated risks as well as safety behaviour, this study assesses their perceptions of pesticide use, associated impacts on human and environmental health and safety behaviours. This study is also intended to quantify pesticide use in vegetable farming. We used the Health Belief Model (HBM) to evaluate farmers’ and retailers’ safety behaviour associated with pesticides. We interviewed 183 farmers and 45 retailers. The study revealed that farmers applied pesticides at an average of 2.9 kg a.i./ha per crop per season; and insecticides, especially pyrethrins and pyrethroids as well as organophosphate, were the most frequently used. Retailers were more aware of the threats surrounding pesticide use and were thus more aware of the risks to their own health as well as to the health of animals, birds, fishes, and honey bees. Headache (73.8%) was the most commonly reported acute health symptom of pesticide use. Farmers often did not adopt the appropriate safety measures when handling pesticides sighting the constrained perceived barriers (direct path coefficient, DPC = −0.837) such as feeling uncomfortable and the unavailability of safety measures. Likewise, retailers lacked the incentive (direct path coefficient, DPC = 0.397) to adopt the necessary safety measures while handling pesticides. Training and awareness programs addressing safe handling practices and safety measures as well as education concerning the long-term risks of pesticide exposure on health and the environment, through radio, television and posters, may improve the safety behaviour of farmers and retailers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 79; Correspondence Address: G.

This is particularly so for fungal pathogens, which can occupy several niches in the host. We developed an infection model of talaromycosis in zebrafish embryos with the thermally-dimorphic intracellular fungal pathogen Talaromyces marneffei and used it to define different roles of neutrophils and macrophages in infection establishment. This system models opportunistic human infection prevalent in HIV-infected patients, as zebrafish embryos have intact innate immunity but, like HIV-infected talaromycosis patients, lack a functional adaptive immune system. Importantly, this new talaromycosis model permits thermal shifts not possible in mammalian models, which we show does not significantly impact on leukocyte migration, phagocytosis and function in an established Aspergillus fumigatus model. Furthermore, the optical transparency of zebrafish embryos facilitates imaging of leukocyte/pathogen interactions in vivo. Following parenteral inoculation, T. marneffei conidia were phagocytosed by both neutrophils and macrophages. Within these different leukocytes, intracellular fungal form varied, indicating that triggers in the intracellular milieu can override thermal morphological determinants. As in human talaromycosis, conidia were predominantly phagocytosed by macrophages rather than neutrophils. Macrophages provided an intracellular niche that supported yeast morphology. Despite their minor role in T. marneffei conidial phagocytosis, neutrophil numbers increased during infection from a protective CSF3-dependent granulopoietic response. By perturbing the relative abundance of neutrophils and macrophages during conidial inoculation, we demonstrate that the macrophage intracellular niche favours infection establishment by protecting conidia from a myeloperoxidase-dependent neutrophil fungicidal activity. These studies provide a new in vivo model of talaromycosis with several advantages over previous models. Our findings demonstrate that limiting T. marneffei’s opportunity for macrophage parasitism and thereby enhancing this pathogen’s exposure to effective neutrophil fungicidal mechanisms may represent a novel host-directed therapeutic opportunity. © 2018 Ellett et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 48; Correspondence Address: G.J.

Therefore, in this study, effects of TDCIPP on yolk diameter, surface morphology of eggs, sperm density and total motility were evaluated. First generation (F0) zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio) were exposed to 0, 50, 500 or 5000 ng/L tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) from 14 days post fertilization (dpf) to 120 dpf. The F0 generation of zebrafish were paired and F1 generation of embryos were collected and continuously exposed to the same concentrations of TDCIPP until 150 dpf. TDCIPP bioconcentration in the whole body as well as effects on survival and fecundity were evaluated in F1 generation. Exposure to TDCIPP resulted in an accumulation of the chemical and decreased survival of F1 generation of zebrafish. TDCIPP decreased cumulative production and changed surface morphology of eggs in females. In males, TDCIPP decreased total motility of sperm but did not affect sperm density. These effects on quality of egg and sperm might be responsible for the decreased hatching rates observed in cross mating experiments. Furthermore, TDCIPP exposure resulted in down-regulated gene expression related to gonadal development and maturation of germ cells in females or/and males, and the down-regulation was correlated to decreased fecundity. Taken together, the results suggested that exposure to TDCIPP could decrease the quantity of eggs and sperms by down-regulating the expression of genes related to gonadal development and maturation of germ cells in zebrafish. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 22; Correspondence Address: C.

The presence of different diseases in crops often leads to a misuse of the proper therapeutic, or the combination of different diseases forces the use of more than one pesticide. This work concerns the development of a ‘super-Blad’: a chimeric protein consisting of Blad polypeptide, the active ingredient of a biological fungicide already on the market, and two selected peptides, SP10-5 and Sub5, proven to possess biological potential as antibacterial agents. The resulting chimeric protein obtained from the fusion of Blad with SP10-5 not only maintained strong antibacterial activity, especially against Xanthomonas spp. and Pseudomonas syringae, but was also able to retain the ability to inhibit the growth of both yeast and filamentous fungi. However, the antibacterial activity of Sub5 was considerably diminished when fused with Blad, which seems to indicate that not all fusion proteins behave equally. These newly designed drugs can be considered promising compounds for use in plant protection.

This study presents a case study analysis based on an extensive literature review examining how these hazard characteristics affect people’s risk and benefit perceptions, and associated attitudes and behaviors. The cases include E. coli incidences (outbreaks linked to fresh spinach and fenugreek sprouts), contamination of fish by environmental pollutants, (organochlorine contaminants in farmed salmon), radioactive contamination of food following a nuclear accident (the Fukushima accident in Japan), and GM salmon destined for the human food chain. The analysis of the cases over the acute vs. chronic dimension suggests that longitudinal quantification of the relationship between risk perceptions and impacts is important for both acute and chronic food safety, but this has infrequently been applied to chronic hazards. Technologies applied to food production tend to potentially be associated with higher levels of risk perception, linked to perceptions that the risk is unnatural. However, for some risks (e.g. those involving biological irreversibility), moral or ethical concerns may be more important determinants of consumer responses than risk or benefit perceptions. (Lack of) trust has been highlighted in all of the cases suggesting transparent and honest risk–benefit communications following the occurrence of a food safety incident.

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the introduced fish species Gambusia affinis as a bioindicator of environmental pollution in the middle-lower basin of the Suquia River. The assessment was performed by measuring biomarkers at different levels of biological organization, at two sampling sites (before and after Cordoba city), and at dry and wet seasons. Water quality evaluation was made through a water-quality index (based on physico-chemical parameters), heavy-metals and pesticides concentrations in water. The water quality varied between sampling sites, showing the most degraded conditions downstream Cordoba city. The same pattern of variation was detected in the biomarkers studied, mainly in: gill and liver histopathological indexes, copulatory organ (gonopodium) morphology and vitellogenin expression in males and females. The present study characterized the environmental conditions in the middle-lower basin of the Suquia River and revealed the low freshwater quality at the most polluted site. Although G. affinis is an introduced species, it could be considered a good sentinel of water resource quality of invaded Neotropical basins. Our results demonstrated the importance of addressing the environmental quality monitoring through an integrated analysis of water quality parameters together with histological, morphological and molecular parameters. Thus, our study provides a good model for application in other basins of South America. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Zebrafish, an important developmental model, has been used for studying the effects of toxic compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure to dichlorvos at early life stages (1 h postfertilization - 7 days postfertilization) in the zebrafish and its toxicological effects during the development, through morphological (7 days postfertilization), locomotor and social behavior analysis (7, 14, 30, 70, and 120 days postfertilization). Dichlorvos (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) exposure reduced the body length and heartbeat rate at 7 days postfertilization (dpf), as well as the surface area of the eyes (5 and 10 mg/L). The avoidance behavior test showed a significant decrease in escape responses at 7 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 14 (5 and 10 mg/L) dpf zebrafish. The evaluation of larval exploratory behavior showed a reduction in distance traveled, mean speed (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and time mobile (10 mg/L) between control and dichlorvos groups. In addition, the analysis performed on adult animals showed that the changes in distance traveled and mean speed remained reduced in 30 (1, 5, and 10 mg/L) and 70 dpf (5 and 10 mg/L), recovering values similar to the control at 120 dpf. The social behavior of zebrafish was not altered by exposure to dichlorvos in the early stages of development. Thus, the exposure to organophosphorus compounds at early stages of development induces an increased susceptibility to behavioral and neuronal changes that could be associated with several neurodegenerative diseases.

We carried out a 2 1/2-year immunotoxicological experiment in which two groups of 11 harbour seals each were fed herring from either the relatively contaminated Baltic Sea or the relatively uncontaminated Atlantic Ocean. Seals in the Baltic Sea group accumulated 3-4 times higher levels of Ah-receptor-mediated 2,3,7,8-TCDD Toxic Equivalents in blubber than did their Atlantic counterparts following 2 years on the respective diets. Blood was sampled a total of 17 times during the course of the experiment for immunological evaluation, during which time the natural cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from seals fed Baltic Sea herring declined to a level approximately 25% lower than that observed in seals fed Atlantic herring (P < 0.01). Natural killer (NK) cell activity has not been previously described for a marine mammal species. We characterized the natural cytotoxic activity of harbour seal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and found this to be interleukin-2 (IL-2) responsive, sensitive to antibody anti-asialo GM1, and it was higher against a virus-infected target cell, like NK cells described for other mammals. As NK cells are leukocytes which play an important role in the first line of defence against viruses, the observed impairment of NK cell activity in the seals feeding on the Baltic Sea herring suggests that exposure to contaminants may have an adverse effect on the defence against virus infections in seals inhabiting polluted waters in Europe.

Bacteria that reside free and inside phagocytes cause acute and chronic forms of photobacteriosis. Infections of juveniles rapidly kill up to 90-100% fish. Factors underlying failure of the immune protection against bacteria remain largely unknown. The reported study used a transcriptomic approach to address this issue. juvenile sea breams (0.5 g) were challenged by immersion in salt water containing 2.89 x 10(8) CFU of a virulent Phdp and the head kidney was sampled after 24- and 48-h. Analyses were performed using the second version of a 44 k oligonucleotide DNA microarray that represents 19,734 sea bream unique transcripts and covers diverse immune pathways. Expression changes of selected immune genes were validated with qPCR. Results suggested rapid recognition of the pathogen, as testified by up-regulation of lectins and antibacterial proteins (bactericidal permeability-increasing protein lectins, lysozyme, intracellular and extracellular proteases), chemokines and chemokine receptors. Increased expression of proteins involved in iron and heme metabolism also could be a response against bacteria that are dependent on iron. However, negative regulators of immune/inflammatory response were preponderant among the up-regulated genes. A remarkable finding was the increased expression of IL-10 in concert with up-regulation of arginase I and II and proteins of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway that diverts the arginine flux from the production of reactive nitrogen species. Such expression changes are characteristic for alternatively activated macrophages that do not develop acute inflammatory responses. Immune suppression can be induced by the host to reduce tissue damages or by the pathogen to evade host response. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The taxa that numerically dominated the region included few large, deep-burrowing suspension feeders that typify estuaries elsewhere. This pattern is indicative of disturbance, and results in dominance by trophic groups that live near the sediment-water interface (early benthic-community succession). Trophic structure was significantly related to several sediment contaminants (especially metals, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, DDT), and three environmental gradients (salinity, depth, and sediment silt-clay content). Generally trophic diversity increased and proportion of subsurface-deposit feeders (SSDF) decreased with salinity, meaning that a more even distribution of trophic structure was found at high-salinity stations.        The trophic shift toward dominance by shallow, subsurface-deposit feeders in contaminated habitats may have dire implications for fisheries. Several important commercial and recreational fisheries of the region depend on fish that feed primarily at the sediment surface. Higher proportion of subsurface-deposit feeders, coupled with low macrobenthic density in contaminated sediments, may imply that limited energy is transferred to higher trophic levels.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  100     Total Times Cited:  119     Cited Reference Count:  109,10.1071/MF97089     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),trophic ecology;feeding ecology;benthos;estuary;contaminants;hypoxia;benthic pelagic;coupling;Gulf of Mexico;indicator species;principal component analysis (PCA);community succession;pollution;community structure;fisheries;red drum;Sciaenops ocellata;spotted seatrout;Cynoscion nebulosus;surface-deposit feeders;subsurface-deposit feeders;filter feeders;suspension feeders;carnivores;omnivores;CONTROL PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS;SOFT-BOTTOM COMMUNITIES;GULF-OF-MEXICO;MISSISSIPPI SOUND;CHESAPEAKE BAY;ORGANIC ENRICHMENT;BENTHIC COMMUNITY;FEEDING-BEHAVIOR;NORTHERN GULF;MOBILE-BAY,NA,NA,trophic function in estuaries response of macrobenthos to natural and contaminant gradients

It is source of neurotoxins known as aphantoxins or paralytic shellfish poisons (PSPs), which present a major threat to the environment and human health. The molecular mechanism of PSP action is known, however the in vivo effects of this neurotoxin on oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant defense responses in zebrafish brain remain to be understood. Aphantoxins purified from a natural isolate of A. flos-aquae DC-1 were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. The major components of the toxins were gonyautoxins 1 and 5 (GTX1 and GTX5, 34.04% and 21.28%, respectively) and neosaxitoxin (neoSTX, 12.77%). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were injected intraperitoneally with 7.73 mu g/kg (low dose) and 11.13 mu g/kg (high dose) of A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins. Oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defense responses in the zebrafish brain were investigated at various timepoints at 1-24 h post-exposure. Aphantoxin exposure was associated with significantly increased (>1-2 tidies) reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in zebrafish brain compared with the controls at 1-12 h postexposure, suggestive of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In contrast, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in the zebrafish brain exposed to high or low doses of aphantoxins decreased by 44.88% and 41.33%, respectively, after 1-12 h compared with the controls, suggesting that GSH participated in detoxification to ROS and MDA. Further analysis showed a significant increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) compared with the controls, suggesting elimination of oxidative stress by the antioxidant response in zebrafish brain. All these changes were dose and time dependent. These results suggested that aphantoxins or PSPs increased ROS and MDA and decreased GSH in zebrafish brain, and these changes induced oxidative stress. The increased activity of SOD, CAT and GPx demonstrated that these antioxidant enzymes could play important roles in eliminating excess ROS and MDA. These results also suggest that MDA, ROS, GSH and these three antioxidant enzymes in the brain of zebrafish may act as bioindicators for investigating A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins or PSPs and algal blooms in nature.

Increasing evidence shows that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), members of the steroid receptor subfamily, are potential targets for EDCs. GR and MR mediate the actions of glucocorticoids and miner-alocorticoids, respectively, which are two main classes of corticosteroids involved in many physiological processes. The effects of EDCs on the homeostasis of these two classes of corticosteroids have also gained more attention recently. This review summarized the effects of environmental GR/MR ligands on receptor activity, and disruption of corticosteroid homeostasis. More than 130 chemicals classified into 7 main categories were reviewed, including metals, metalloids, pesticides, bisphenol analogues, flame retardants, other industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The mechanisms by which EDCs interfere with GR/MR activity are primarily involved in ligand-receptor binding, nuclear translocation of the receptor complex, DNA-receptor binding, and changes in the expression of endogenous GR/MR genes. Besides directly interfering with receptors, enzyme-catalyzed synthesis and prereceptor regulation pathways of corticosteroids are also important targets for EDCs. The collected evidence suggests that corticosteroids and their receptors should be considered as potential targets for safety assessment of EDCs.

In the second experiment, zander (Stizostedion lucioperca) (secondary carnivore), were stocked in the lake resulting in a reduction in the population size of roach to 51% of its previous population size (31% of biomass). In both experiments, seasonal average biomass of Daphnia cucullata) increased in the two years with the lowest roach biomasses. but no shift to larger zooplankton forms took place. In the years with increased Daphnia biomass, phytoplankton biomass and transparency showed an increased seasonal variation (measured as coefficient of variation). In contrast to manipulations in which planktivorous fish were totally removed, no effect on seasonal average phytoplankton biomass was observed. Due to the high reproductive capacity of roach, the system returned to previous conditions within a year or two after the perturbations. Under unperturbed conditions, the lake showed few indications of instability as suggested by the paradox of enrichment hypothesis. This lack of instability can. among other things, be related to high zooplanktivore predation pressure present in highly productive lakes preventing overexploitation of primary producers by grazers. In addition, the omnivorous feeding characteristics of roach (feeding on both zooplankton and algae/detritus) and interactions between the open water and the detritus nutrient pool are likely to increase the stability of the system. The two perturbation experiments plus a previous natural experiment (winter fish kill), which all were pulsed perturbations, provide no evidence for the presence of alternative stable states in highly productive lakes.

We established cellular stress response markers for proteotoxicity (HSP70, HSP90), phase I detoxification mechanism (CYP1A1), metal-binding (metallothionein), as well as immune-function and pathogen-defense (TGF-beta, Mx-protein, nRAMP). Quantitative real-time TaqMan (R) PCR was used to examine tissue-specific changes in the transcriptome of liver, spleen, white muscle, anterior kidney and gills after 7-day Cu exposures and 24-h esfenvalerate exposures. On the transcriptome level, exposure to Cu showed strongest effects on the transcription of metallothionein in spleen tissue, causing a 4-fold increase of mRNA at 42 ppb total Cu and a 10-fold increase at 160 ppb Cu. Exposure to Cu also caused significant tissue-specific changes in gene transcription for immune-system related genes. Esfenvalerate exposure had tissue-specific effects on the transcription of HSP70, HSP90 and CYP1A1. The most significant effects were detected in liver tissue after exposure to 0.64 mu g/L esfenvalerate.        Our results show that the stress response at the transcriptome level is a more sensitive indicator for Cu and esfenvalerate exposures at low concentrations than swimming behavior, growth or mortality.

The fish were exposed to 20% of 96-hour LC50 of fenthion for 24 and 96 hours. Total and oxidized glutathione, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, protein levels, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase-specific enzyme activities were measured spectrophotometrically. There was a 15-day depuration period to evaluate the changes in the studied parameters. Fenthion caused a time-dependent depletion of the total and reduced glutathione levels. The oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio and catalase specific enzyme activity were reduced while the glutathione-S-transferase activity was elevated. Intraperitonal buthionine sulfoximine application disclosed the inhibitory effect of fenthion on superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, whereas glutathione-S-transferase activity was increased. There was no change in lipid peroxidation levels during the experiments. No amelioration was observed in the affected parameters except the glutathione-S-transferase activity in the 15-day depuration period. In conclusion, glutathione-S-transferase and catalase enzyme activities and total and reduced glutathione levels were better estimators to monitor the effects of fenthion in low concentration in the liver of C. carpio.

The clear chorion and embryo of the zebrafish allow for continuous visualization of the anatomical changes associated with development, which, along with short maturation times and the capability of complex behavior, makes this model particularly useful for measuring changes to the developing nervous system. Moreover, the rich array of developmental, behavioral, and molecular benefits offered by the zebrafish have contributed to an increasing demand for the use of zebrafish in behavioral teratology. Essential for this endeavor has been the development of a battery of tests to evaluate a spectrum of behavior in zebrafish. Measures of sensorimotor plasticity, emotional function, cognition and social interaction have been used to characterize the persisting adverse effects of developmental exposure to a variety of chemicals including therapeutic drugs, drugs of abuse and environmental toxicants. In this review, we present and discuss such tests and data from a range of developmental neurobehavioral toxicology studies using zebrafish as a model. Zebrafish provide a key intermediate model between high throughput in vitro screens and the classic mammalian models as they have the accessibility of in vitro models and the complex functional capabilities of mammalian models.

While they are often used as an indicator species due to their high organochlorine contaminant loads, little is known of their movements in relation to contaminated habitats. A Vemco Positioning System acoustic telemetry array was used to collect fine-scale movement data and characterize the site fidelity, area use, and dispersal of 83 white croaker on the Palos Verdes Shelf Superfund Site, California over 27 months. White croaker generally demonstrated low residency and recurrence to the Palos Verdes Shelf, and were observed to be largely nomadic. However, individual behavior was highly variable. Although the entire monitored shelf was visited by tagged white croaker, habitats in 0-200 m proximity to wastewater outfalls and between 25 and 35 m depth were used most frequently. Approximately half of white croaker migrated into Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbors; areas where they may be targeted by subsistence fishers.

However, concerns about the pesticide residues in agricultural products have been raised in recent years because of public interest in health and food quality and safety. Thus, rapid, convenient, and accurate analytical methods for the detection and quantification of pesticides are urgently required. RESULTS A nanohybrid system composed of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and tetrakis(N-methyl-4-pyridiniumyl) porphyrin (TMPyP) was used as an optical probe for the detection and quantification of five pesticides (Paraquat, Dipterex, Dursban, methyl thiophanate and Cartap). The method is based on the aggregation effect of pesticides on the carboxyl group modified by AuNPs. Subsequently, with the help of particle swarm optimization-optimized sample weighted least squares-support vector machine (PSO-OSWLS-SVM), all the pesticides could be successfully quantified. In addition, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was applied and the five pesticides were satisfactorily recognized based on data array obtained from the ultraviolet visible (UV-visible) spectra of AuNP-TMPyP complex. Furthermore, the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the five pesticides could be also achieved in the complex real samples, in which all the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 0.3 parts per thousand and all the linear absolute correlation coefficients were more than 0.9990. Furthermore, recognition rate of the training set and the prediction set based on multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), or second-order derivative (2nd derivative) UV-visible spectra in PLS-DA model could reach 100%. CONCLUSION This method was successfully applied for the rapid and accurate determination of multicomponent pesticide residues in real food samples.

Zinc pyrithione is an organometallic biocide, with bactericidal, algicidal and fungicidal activities. It has been recently incorporated in antifouling formulas, such as paints, which prevent the establishment of a biofilm on surfaces exposed to the aquatic environment. It has also been used in cosmetics, such as anti-dandruff shampoos and soaps. Previously reported data has shown the presence of this substance in the aquatic compartment, a factor contributing to the potential exertion of toxic effects, and there is also evidence that photodegradation products of zinc pyrithione were involved in neurotoxic effects, namely by inhibiting cholinesterases in fish species. Additional evidence points to the involvement of zinc pyrithione in alterations of metal homeostasis and oxidative stress, in both aquatic organisms and human cell models. The present work assesses the potential ecotoxicity elicited by zinc pyrithione in the freshwater fish Gambusia holbrooki after an acute (96 h) exposure. The oxidative stress was assessed by the quantification of the activities of specific enzymes from the antioxidant defense system, such as catalase, and glutathione-S-transferases; and the extent of peroxidative damage was quantified by measuring the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels. Neurotoxicity was assessed through measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity; and a standardized method for the description and assessment of histological changes in liver and gills of was also used. Zinc pyrithione caused non-specific and reversible tissue alterations, both in liver and gills of exposed organisms. However, histopathological indices were not significantly different from the control group. In terms of oxidative stress biomarkers, none of the tested biomarkers indicated the occurrence of pro-oxidative effects, suggesting that the oxidative pathway is not the major toxicological outcome of exposure to zinc pyrithione.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  63,10.1007/s10646-015-1525-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Antifouling;Organometallics;Biomarkers;Histological damage;Mosquitofish;Oxidative stress;Neurotoxicity;OXIDATIVE STRESS;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;ANTIFOULING BIOCIDES;COPPER PYRITHIONE;HISTOPATHOLOGY;EXPOSURE;GILL;LIVER;PHARMACEUTICALS;BIOMARKERS;Zinc,NA,NA,ecotoxicological effect of zinc pyrithione in the freshwater fish <i>gambusia holbrooki<i>

While fenpropathrin was found to have neurotoxic effects in mammals, it remains unclear whether it has similar effects on fish. Here, we used adult zebrafish to investigate the impacts of fenpropathrin on fish social behaviors and neural activity. Exposure of adult zebrafish to 500 ppb of fenpropathrin for 72 h increased anxiety levels but decreased physical fitness, as measured by a novel tank diving test and swimming tunnel test. Fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to spend more time in the conspecific zone of the tank, possibly seeking greater comfort from their companions. Although learning, memory, and aggressive behavior did not change, fish exposed to fenpropathrin appeared to have shorter fighting durations. The immunocytochemical results showed the tyrosine hydroxylase antibody-labeled dopaminergic neurons in the teleost posterior tuberculum decreased in the zebrafish brain. According to a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of the brain, exposure to fenpropathrin resulted in a decrease in the messenger (m)RNA expression of monoamine oxidase (mao), an enzyme that facilitates the deamination of dopamine. In contrast, the mRNA expression of the sncga gene, which may trigger Parkinson's disease, was found to have increased.

The fish community has undergone dramatic shifts in composition, from freshwater species present in the initial wash-in to stocked marine species to dominance by an unintentionally introduced cichlid. Historical catch records, creel censuses, and gill-netting studies suggest that total fish biomass in the lake increased dramatically throughout the 1970s, crashed in the late 1980s, recovered in the mid-1990s, and crashed again in the early 2000s. We speculate that crashes in fish populations are primarily due to three physiological stressors-rising salinity, cold winter temperatures, and high sulfide levels and anoxia associated with mixing events. The trends in fish biomass are mirrored in population trends of both breeding and wintering fish-eating birds, as indexed by a number of independent bird surveys. In contrast, most non-piscivorous birds at the Salton Sea show no indication of these temporal dynamics.

An alternative explanation, put forward by Wright, is that the commonly observed dominance of wildtype alleles is simply a physiological consequence of metabolic pathways. Wright's explanation has gained support over the years, largely ending the debate over the general recessivity of deleterious mutations. Nevertheless there is reason to believe that dominance relationships have been moulded by natural selection to some extent. First, the metabolic pathways are themselves products of evolutionary processes that may have led them to be more stable to perturbations, including mutations. Secondly, theoretical models and empirical experiments suggest that substantial selection for dominance modifiers exists during the spread of adaptive alleles or when a polymorphism is maintained either by overdominant selection or by migration-selection balance.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  62     Total Times Cited:  69     Cited Reference Count:  40,10.1038/sj.hdy.6885600     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),balanced polymorphism;deleterious mutations;dominance modifiers;metabolic pathways;overdominance;patchy environment;MOLECULAR-BASIS;INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE;GENETIC DOMINANCE;ADAPTIVE GENES,NA,NA,the evolution of dominance

The recognition of the limitations of numerous, if not all, pesticides in terms of species-specificity, toxicity level, persistency in the environment, influencing its runoff and transport ability, among other characteristics, have been the subject of numerous studies over the years. These have especially focused on the deleterious impacts of such substances in non-target organisms, including potential effects in humans, considering pesticide uptake through the ingestion of contaminated foodstuff. Aquatic ecosystems may be considered the most vulnerable to pesticide contamination, has most toxicants may eventually end up in these systems, if not directly, via indirect inputs. Aquatic communities are, thus, susceptible both to on-point acute contaminations and to exposure to mixtures of different contaminants for longer periods. Impacts of numerous pesticides in non-target aquatic species have been reported and investigated, contributing to the definition of regulations and legislation to prevent harmful effects to the communities. However, in order to assess effectively the effect of different pesticides in organisms, the definition of suitable biomarkers is crucial. As one of the most identifiable effect of pesticides is cell damage induced by oxidative stress, most studies have resorted to the analysis of antioxidant enzymes to assess the impacts of contamination in the organism. Nonetheless, with methodological advances, other molecules have been identified as potentially useful to be used as biomarkers, as fatty acids. These ubiquitous macromolecules in living organisms are major constituents of biological membranes and tissues. Evidence of the impact of xenobiotics on lipid metabolism and composition, as well as the sensitivity of fatty acids profiles to alterations in the homeostasis of organisms, have been arising, supporting the suitability of these macromolecules as biomarkers of toxicants exposure. However, most studies using fatty acids as biomarkers have dwelled mostly on marine ecosystems, disregarding other aquatic systems, as freshwater systems. Given the importance of these systems as providers of numerous services and goods and their role in ecological integrity and support, the present literature review aims to compile and critically review the studies conducted until the present time regarding the use of fatty acids as biomarkers of pesticide exposure assessment in freshwater communities, as well as highlight limitations identified and propose future research.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  56,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107299     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Saturated fatty acids;Monounsaturated fatty acids;Polyunsaturated fatty acids;Highly unsaturated fatty acids;Xenobiotics;Bioindicators;ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES;OXIDATIVE STRESS;DAPHNIA-MAGNA;HUMAN HEALTH;GOLD TZ;FISH;ENDOSULFAN;EXPOSURE;HERBICIDE;FOOD;Pesticides,NA,NA,fatty acids as suitable biomarkers to assess pesticide impacts in freshwater biological scalesa review

The present study was conducted on Channa punctata Bloch exposed to sub-lethal doses of PD (0.5 and 0.8 ppb) for 96 h. The exposure resulted in alterations in epinephrine levels in the fish brain. Epinephrine levels decreased significantly in a dose dependent manner with increase in the PD exposure. A marked decrease in the activity of acetylcholinesterase along with reduction in Na+-K+-ATPase and monoamine oxidase activity was also observed. In comparison with the corresponding controls, the sub-lethal doses of PD also caused significant changes in the oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxidation and carbonyl derivatives of protein oxidative destruction levels) and antioxidant defenses (reduced glutathione levels, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase activity) in brain tissue.

We suggest that influence of shared genetic biases should be detectable by the disproportionate use of the same genes in independent instances of parallel phenotypic evolution. We show how progress in testing this prediction can be made through simple tests of parallel inheritance of genetic differences: similar additive, dominance, and epistasis components in analysis of line means and similar effective numbers of loci. We demonstrate parallel inheritance in two traits, lateral plate number and body shape, in two lineages of threespine stickleback that have adapted independently to freshwater streams on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean. Notably, reduction of plate number in freshwater involves a substitution at the same major locus in both lineages. Our results represent only a first step in the study of the genetics of parallel phenotypic evolution in sticklebacks.

The persistence of PBDEs in the environment leads to continued ubiquitous exposure to low levels, with infants and children experiencing higher exposures than adults. Accumulating evidence suggest that low-level exposures during early life stages can affect brain development and lead to long-term behavioral impairments. We investigated the effects of zebrafish exposure to low doses of the two prominent PBDEs; 2,2′,4,4′,5,-Pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) and 2,2′,4,4′,-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), during embryo-development on short- and long-term behavioral endpoints. We included the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) due to its well documented neurotoxicity across species from zebrafish to humans. Methods: Zebrafish embryos were exposed to the following individual treatments; 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control); 0.3 μM CPF; 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 μM BDE-47; 0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20 μM BDE-99 from 5 until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). Low exposure levels were determined as those not causing immediate overt toxicity, and behavior assays were conducted in the low-level range. At 144 hpf the larvae were tested for locomotor activity. At approximately 6 months of age adult zebrafish were tested in a behavioral battery including assays for anxiety-related behavior, sensorimotor response and habituation, social interaction, and predator avoidance. Results: In the short-term, larval locomotor activity was reduced in larvae treated with 0.3 μM CPF and 0.1 μM BDE-47. BDE-99 treatment caused non-monotonic dose effects, with 0.3 μM causing hyperactivity and 1 μM or higher causing hypoactivity. In the long-term, adult anxiety-related behavior was reduced in all treatments as measured in both the novel tank dive test and tap test. Discussion: We show that exposure of zebrafish embryos to low concentrations of the brominated flame retardants BDE-47 and BDE-99, and the organophosphate pesticide CPF, caused both short- and long-term behavioral impairments. Interestingly, we also found that at very low exposure concentrations, where there were no visible effects on larval activity, adult behavior was still strongly affected. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 57; Correspondence Address: L.

Most studies use biological monitoring methods to monitor water pollutants, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and organic pollutants. However, there are still many difficulties at present. Few methods consider the influence of illumination and complex background in the monitoring environment, and the characteristics parameters extracted in the systems are single. In addition, the results of using shallow neural networks for water quality classification are often not ideal. In order to solve the above problems, we design a water quality monitoring system combined with the computer image processing technology and use computer vision to analyze the fish behavior in real-time for monitoring the existence or not of water pollution. For the illumination problem, we use the no-reference quality assessment algorithm based on natural scene statistics for contrast distortion images to evaluate the video and configure the lighting conditions of the monitoring environment. White balance preprocessing is also performed to provide a great basis for moving target detection. Besides, we use background modeling to eliminate the influence of complex background on the moving target detection and the foreground is extracted using the saliency detection algorithm. In order to comprehensively analyze the influence of water quality on the fish behavior from the extracted foreground targets, multi-dimensional feature parameters are used to quantify the indicators, including movement velocity, rotation angle, spatial standard deviation, and body color which characterize the behavior changes of the fish. Finally, the classification model based on the long short-term memory neural network is used to classify the feature parameters data of the fish behavior in different water quality environments. In this paper, red zebra fish is used as the indicator organism and copper sulfate solution is used as the toxic pollutant to simulate the water pollution. Experiment results show that the classification accuracy rate of water quality using the proposed system can reach 100% at level 2 classification (93.33% at level 3 and 91% at level 4). Our system can achieve more accurate multi-level classification than the shallow neural network, such as RNN, and it is faster for real-time monitoring with a high reference for the water environment emergencies. © 2013 IEEE.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 34; Correspondence Address: E.

Although less toxic to mammals and birds compared to organophosphates, nicotinoids have the potential to impact non-target invertebrates, especially through sublehal effects on behavior, physiology, reproduction, and development. We investigated the impact of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on the defensive responses of rusty crayfish Orconectes rusticus exposed to 0, 1, 10, and 100 µg•L−1 of imidacloprid for 10 days (n = 7 crayfish per treatment). Defensive behaviors were examined with the rod test, in which a glass rod was jabbed into the crayfish’s container at a 90 degree angle from the bottom and about 0.5 cm directly in front of the crayfish. Crayfish responded to the rod aggressively with claw raising and pinching, neutrally (no response), or by backing or tail-flipping away. The frequency of neutral responses more than doubled after four days in the high (100 µg•L−1) group and after eight days in the low (1 µg•L−1) exposure group. Furthermore, most crayfish in the 100 µg•L−1 treatment were not able to right themselves within 30 s when placed on their backs. Several studies have reported concentrations of imidacloprid contamination in freshwater ecosystems that exceed this study’s lowest exposure scenario, 1 µg•L−1. We therefore conclude that imidacloprid contamination reduces the defensive behaviors of crayfish, impairing their ability to survive in habitats where they play important ecological roles. © 2018, The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: R.J.

Population models can incorporate population resilience, physiological susceptibility, and likelihood of exposure, and can therefore be employed to extrapolate from individual- to population-level effects in ERA. Here, we present the development of an individual-based model (IBM) for the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and its application in assessing population-level effects of disrupted male breeding behaviour after exposure to the anti-androgenic pesticide, fenitrothion. The stickleback is abundant in marine, brackish, and freshwater systems throughout Europe and their complex breeding strategy makes wild populations potentially vulnerable to the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Modelled population dynamics matched those of a UK field population and the IBM is therefore considered to be representative of a natural population. Literature derived dose-response relationships of fenitrothion-induced disruption of male breeding behaviours were applied in the IBM to assess population-level impacts. The modelled population was exposed to fenitrothion under both continuous (worst-case) and intermittent (realistic) exposure patterns and population recovery was assessed. The results suggest that disruption of male breeding behaviours at the individual-level cause impacts on population abundance under both fenitrothion exposure regimes; however, density-dependent processes can compensate for some of these effects, particularly for an intermittent exposure scenario. Our findings further demonstrate the importance of understanding life-history traits, including reproductive strategies and behaviours, and their density-dependence, when assessing the potential population-level risks of EDCs. © 2018","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: C.R.

The security of this water environment has a strong influence on national economic development and public health. However, data on the pollution status and potential risks due to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in this area is insufficient. In this study, we selected a branch of the Grand Canal in Hangzhou as the study subject from which 16 surface water samples were collected in the summer of 2016. The concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) (including 4 hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and 6 dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs)), 12 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and 35 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the water samples were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Non-carcinogenic risk, carcinogenic risk, and cytotoxicity experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential health risks due to these POPs. Additionally, the toxicological data for the Danio rerio aquatic organism from the US EPA were employed for comparison with the residue from POPs in this area. The results showed that the total concentrations of HCHs, DDTs, PCBs, and PAHs were 29.937, 60.2, 8.30, and 1670.2 ng/L, respectively. Some pollutants (including acenaphthene and acenaphthylene, hepta-PCBs and tetra-PCBs, octa-PCBs and hexa-PCBs, β-HCH and α-HCH, and δ-HCH and γ-HCH) showed a correlation, which indicated they might have a similar origin. There were no non-carcinogenic risks or ecological risks for adults, children, and aquatic organisms, but a relatively low carcinogenic risk for adults presented at certain sites.

To aid conservation managers conducting hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle) management, we evaluated changes in aquatic vegetation community structure and dominance in dioecious hydrilla-infested ponds by applying several management tools and monitoring vegetation changes on an annual basis over a 4 yr period. The study was conducted in fully vegetated (dioecious hydrilla and native macrophytes) 0.3 ha mesocosm ponds using 4 levels of triploid grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella Valenciennes) stocking densities (0–129 per vegetated hectare), a one-time second-year herbicide treatment to reduce standing biomass of hydrilla and other submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV), and native plantings to provide the basis for replacing hydrilla as it was controlled. Grass carp stocking density had an inverse relationship with coverage of total vegetation, hydrilla, volunteer SAV, and volunteer emergents. All vegetation categories recovered from the one-time herbicide application, although this was suppressed by higher densities of grass carp. Grass carp did not significantly affect planted growth forms (SAV, floating-leaved, and emergent), with increases in mean coverage in all treatments through time, although coverage was lowest at the highest grass carp density. Vegetation dominance shifted from hydrilla to native in both control and low grass carp density treatments, with most SAV eliminated from treatments stocked with more than 72 per hectare. ©, This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Podbel'skogo, St. Petersburg, 196608, Russian Federation","Currently, the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis represents a key agent for biological protection against dipteran species, which are harmful to livestock and crop production and transmit infectious diseases of economically important animals. The production strains can be obtained by isolation from natural resources, selection of previously used isolates, screening of genetic collections, and genetic or genomic engineering. The issue of preservation and control of practically valuable properties of strains is of high importance. Biologicals are of significant interest due to their substantial advantages over chemical pesticides and are considered in modern agricultural systems as environmentally and socially priority alternatives to agrochemicals. In the present work, we performed the first comprehensive comparative analysis of crystallogenic and acrystallogenic variants of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (BtH14) isolated after storage of the strain in different modes. For crystallogenic variants, genes encoding the target insecticidal toxins, Cry4 and Cry11, were detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and it was shown that the acrystallogenic variants are devoid of these genes. It was found that the culture fluid of crystallogenic variants is approximately 7000 times more active against the Aedes aegypti larvae than the same of acrystallogenic. The aim of this work was to compare the morphological, biochemical, technological, larvicidal properties of the crystal-forming and acrystallogenic variants of the strains of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (BtH14) and testing for the presence of genes encoding Cry insecticidal toxins, which are key determinants of virulence. We studied the strains 404 and 87 stored for 28 years by freeze-drying, then 2 years in test tubes on canted fish agar (FA) with replanting every 6 months; the 7-1/23 strain stored for 28 years in crystals of NaCl, then 2 years in culture liquid (CL) at 3 °C. Bacterial strains were inoculated on Petri dishes to obtain separate colonies. On day 7 of growth, the 404/14, 87/21, 7-1/23-4 (crystal-forming) and 404/19, 87/33, 7-1/23-8 (acrystallogenic) variants were selected by microscopic analysis using aniline black dye. The differences in the colony morphology were not revealed: the colonies were flat, opaque, grayish-white, rough, rounded, the structure was finegrained, and the consistency was viscous. The differences either in the morphology of the vegetative cultures, or in the main biochemical properties (the formation of acetylmethyl carbinol, lecithinase, the use of carbohydrates, the splitting of starch, etc.), or in the titer on the yeast-polysaccharide medium were not shown as well. The productivity of the 404/14, 87/21, 7-1/23-4 and 404/19, 87/33, 7-1/23-8 strains varied from 3.36×109 CFU/ml to 4.02×109 CFU/ml and from 3.74×109 CFU/ml to 4.13×109 CFU/ml, respectively. The larvicidal activity of the crystalforming variants, expressed in LC50 for L4 Aedes aegypti, was (0.12-0.16)×10-3 %, while acrystallogenic variants were inactive within the standard dilutions (×10-3%) 1.0; 0.5; 0.25; 0.125; 0.06. Only their 1 % suspension (7000-fold higher concentration) caused 22-39 % death of the Aedes larvae after 24 hours; the same concentration of active variants resulted in 100% death in 15 minutes. It was established that cultural liquid of the acrystallogenic variants formed a precipitate and a supernatant layer after 12 hours, while the crystal-forming variants remained suspended. The investigated variants of BtH14 were analyzed for the presence of genes encoding insecticidal toxins. The results of the PCR analysis with the Bti-specific primers confirmed the belonging of the both crystal-forming and acrystallogenic variants to BtH14. It has been found that the 404/14, 87/21, 7-1/23-4 strains carry genes encoding the Cry4 and Cry11 insecticidal toxins, while 404/19, 87/33, 7-1/23-8 acrystallogenic variants are devoid of these genes agreeing with the absence of larvicidal activity against A. aegypti. © 2019 Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

The pathogenesis of ASD is not well characterized and involves a multifaceted interaction between genetic, neurobiological and environmental factors. Animal (experimental) models possess evolutionarily conserved behaviors and molecular pathways that are highly relevant for studying ASD. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a relatively new animal model with promise for understanding the pathogenesis of complex brain disorders and discovering novel treatments. As a highly social and genetically tractable organism, zebrafish have recently been applied to model a variety of deficits relevant to ASD.

Here, we used dechorionated Tropical 5D wild-type zebrafish embryos to screen a 91-compound library provided by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) for developmental toxicity. This library contained 86 unique chemicals that included negative controls, flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), drugs, industrial chemicals, and pesticides. Fish were exposed to 5 concentrations of each chemical or an equal amount of vehicle (0.5% DMSO) in embryo medium from 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). Fish were examined daily for mortality and teratogenic effects and photomotor behavior was assessed at 4 and 5 dpf. Of the 5 negative control compounds in the library, none caused mortality/teratogenesis, but two altered behavior. Chemicals provided in duplicate produced similar outcomes. Overall, 13 compounds caused mortality/teratology but not behavioral abnormalities, 24 only affected behavior, and 18 altered both endpoints, with behavior affected at concentrations that did not cause mortality/teratology (55/86 hits). Of the compounds that affected behavior, 52% caused behavioral abnormalities at either 4 or 5 dpf. Compounds within the same functional group caused different behavioral abnormalities, while similar behavioral patterns were caused by compounds from different groups. Our data suggest that behavior is a sensitive endpoint for developmental toxicity screening that integrates multiple modes of toxic action and is influenced by the age of the larval fish at the time of testing. © © The Author(s) 2018.

Phytophthora spp. and Pythium spp. which belong to the Oomycetes pseudo-fungi require special attention because of their mobile form of dispersion, the so-called zoospores that can move freely and actively in liquid water. In coupled aquaponics, curative methods are still limited because of the possible toxicity of pesticides and chemical agents for fish and beneficial bacteria (e.g. nitrifying bacteria of the biofilter). Furthermore, the development of biocontrol agents for aquaponic use is still at its beginning. Consequently, ways to control the initial infection and the progression of a disease are mainly based on preventive actions and water physical treatments. However, suppressive action (suppression) could happen in aquaponic environment considering recent papers and the suppressive activity already highlighted in hydroponics. In addition, aquaponic water contains organic matter that could promote establishment and growth of heterotrophic bacteria in the system or even improve plant growth and viability directly. With regards to organic hydroponics (i.e. use of organic fertilisation and organic plant media), these bacteria could act as antagonist agents or as plant defence elicitors to protect plants from diseases. In the future, research on the disease suppressive ability of the aquaponic biotope must be increased, as well as isolation, characterisation and formulation of microbial plant pathogen antagonists. Finally, a good knowledge in the rapid identification of pathogens, combined with control methods and diseases monitoring, as recommended in integrated plant pest management, is the key to an efficient control of plant diseases in aquaponics. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2019, corrected publication 2020.

Water withdrawal from their tributaries is one and in many cases main reason for that. Since prehistoric times, the size and shape of the Aral Sea changed depending on the amount of water arriving at the lake. The Aral Sea system is in equilibrium when the amount of water flowing in equals the amount of water evaporating over the year. During the 1950s, the government of the former USSR decided to increase the areas used for agriculture in the river valleys of the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya. To this end, water was and still is deviated from the rivers by thousands of open trenches being unsealed and leading to a massive loss of water by evaporation and seepage. In consequence, less water was and is arriving at the Aral Sea and its size is shrinking dramatically. Especially on its eastern shoreline even a small decrease in the water level leads to the exposition of large areas of former sea bottom because the lake is very shallow. Cities like Aralsk and Munyak formally located directly on the seaside are now completely surrounded by the steppe far away from the water. Although the shrinking of the Aral Sea was an economic disaster for the population living on the coast, the population in the river valleys increased significantly. Today, the major part of Uzbekistan’s population is working in this area, and in Kazakhstan there are also millions of people depending on the irrigation water taken from the tributaries of the Aral Sea. The area around the Aral Sea was declared to be a “zone of ecological disaster,” and small subsidies are (still) paid to its inhabitants. Most of the former fishermen moved away to other lakes. In consequence of the breakdown of the economic background the social structure in the population changed completely and people are suffering from unemployment and the lack of any economic perspective. However, studies performed up to now could not prove the assumption that the health of the local population impaired because of environmental pollutants having their origin in the river valleys of the Aral Seas tributaries. There is no doubt that the health of inhabitants of the area is severely affected by the environmental conditions, but not by single contaminants. People living in the Syr Darya valley and, most probably, in the Amu Darya valley suffer much more from pesticide pollution than those living in the former shoreline area of the Aral Sea. Owing to the use of certain pesticides, high concentrations of dioxins and dibenzofurans have been detected in their bodies. Water is a valuable resource and probably the most important economic factor in the countries of Central Asia. The problems of the Aral Sea cannot be solved in the short term. The problems are a result of economic decisions made in the 1950s within a different political context on the basis of a Soviet Union-wide organized economy. Now that small countries are struggling for survival of their local economies, there is, at least in the nonoil producing countries, not enough economic power for a rapid change. However, the area of the Aral Sea will enlarge with an increasing amount of water left over in the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya, even if the Aral Sea probably will not regain its former size during the next generation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The blood stress indicators of cortisol concentration increased after intraperitoneal injection, and consequentially influenced some of the organism defense mechanisms as observed through a decrease of white blood cell phagocytic activity and other effects. Furthermore, when three kinds of pathogens (Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida, Streptococcus iniae and Tenacibaculum maritimum) administered to induce an experimental infection one hour after intraperitoneal injection, the accumulative death rates of the intraperitoneal injection group infected with P. damselae subsp. piscicida and S. iniae were significantly higher than the control group.

Although current treatment regimens cure approximately 70% of patients with localized disease, they are ineffective for most patients with metastases or relapse. New treatment combinations are necessary for these patients. Experimental Design: Ewing sarcoma cells are dependent on focal adhesion kinase (FAK) for growth. To identify candidate treatment combinations for Ewing sarcoma, we performed a small-molecule library screen to identify compounds synergistic with FAK inhibitors in impairing Ewing cell growth. The activity of a top-scoring class of compounds was then validated across multiple Ewing cell lines in vitro and in multiple xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma. Results: Numerous Aurora kinase inhibitors scored as synergistic with FAK inhibition in this screen. We found that Aurora kinase B inhibitors were synergistic across a larger range of concentrations than Aurora kinase A inhibitors when combined with FAK inhibitors in multiple Ewing cell lines. The combination of AZD-1152, an Aurora kinase B–selective inhibitor, and PF-562271 or VS-4718, FAK-selective inhibitors, induced apoptosis in Ewing sarcoma cells at concentrations that had minimal effects on survival when cells were treated with either drug alone. We also found that the combination significantly impaired tumor progression in multiple xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma. Conclusions: FAK and Aurora kinase B inhibitors synergistically impair Ewing sarcoma cell viability and significantly inhibit tumor progression.

A non-native strain of Phragmites australis (Common Reed; hereafter Phragmites) is aggressively invading North American wetlands, and the species has been shown to alter hydrology and impact aquatic organisms. Clear Creek Wildlife Management Area, in Kentucky, is heavily impacted by Phragmites invasion. Portions of the Wildlife Management Area with Phragmites were treated with herbicide to restore wetland flora, and in this study, we evaluated the effects of both the presence and management of Phragmites on wildlife populations and ecosystem function. We selected 3 locations (treated Phragmites, untreated Phragmites, and Phragmites-free) and surveyed each for water chemistry, wildlife populations, and stable-isotope signatures over a 2-y period. Water chemistry varied with the presence or absence of Phragmites, suggesting differences in nutrient cycling. Fish diversity did not differ among sites, but individual species varied in distribution and abundance between the Phragmites sites and the Phragmites-free site. Turtles showed significant differences in both diversity and body size based on the presence or absence of Phragmites, but not herbicide treatment. We detected no significant differences in frog diversity across treatments. We recorded 8 Kentucky Species of Greatest Conservation Need, but there were few differences in the distribution of these species across sites. Stable-isotope analysis revealed variation in food-web structure based on the presence of Phragmites. These results indicate that herbicides had little effect on fish and herpetofaunal communities in the short term, but potentially significant ecological changes may occur if Phragmites were eradicated. Our conclusions highlight the importance of monitoring habitat restoration to guide future management. A holistic, ecosystem-level approach is necessary to understand the impacts of both invasive species and their management. © 2018 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

Methods: Firstly, flow cytometry, cell viability assay, transwell assay, and tube formation were used to explore the role of miR-17-5p in angiogenesis. Then zebrafish model was used to confirm effects of miR-17-5p on angiogenesis. qRT-PCR analysis and Immunofluorescence assay were used to explore the expression of miR-17-5p in NPC tissues and cells compared to the normal control. Besides, in vitro assays were used to analyze the biological functions of miR-17-5p in NPC. What’s more, in vitro and in vivo assays were used to detect the function of exosomal miR-17-5p in angiogenesis. Finally, luciferase reporter assay and western bolt were used to determine the relationship between miR-17-5p and BAMBI. Results: We observed that high expression of miR-17-5p promoted angiogenesis in NPC. Also, high expression of miR-17-5p promoted the NPC cells proliferation and migration. To know whether there’s any communication between HUVECs and NPC cells, exosomes derived from CNE-2 cells were collected. Further results showed that exosomal miR-17-5p secreted from NPC promoted the angiogenesis. What’s more, in vitro assays revealed that miR-17-5p targets BAMBI and regulates AKT/VEGF-A signaling.

The preference was related to the avoidance of artificial sweeteners, flame retardants, fragrances, PAHs, PCBs, pesticides, UV filters and some inorganic elements.

We aimed to determine if a model fish, the goldfish, could sense reuse water using olfaction (smell), and if 30 min or 7 d (acute) and 60 d (sub-chronic) exposures would affect their olfactory responses to natural odorants. We examined olfaction as previous studies have found that numerous chemicals can impair the olfactory sense, which is critical to carrying out numerous life-sustaining behaviors from feeding to mating. We also examined if fish olfactory and liver tissues would mount a response in terms of biotransformation enzyme gene expression, and whether treatment of reuse water with UV/H2O2 ameliorated adverse effects following reuse water exposure. We found that fish olfactory tissue responded to reuse water as it would to a natural odorant and that UV/H2O2 treatment had no influence on this. With acute exposures, olfactory impairment was apparent regardless of water type (e.g. responses of 23–55% of control), but in sub-chronic exposures, only the untreated reuse water caused olfactory impairment. The exposure of fish to reuse water increased the expression of one enzyme (CYP1A; > 2.5–6.5 fold change) and reuse water treatment with UV/H2O2 reversed the effect. There was a seasonal effect that was likely due to changes in water quality (60 d summer exposure impaired olfaction whereas spring and fall exposures did not). Overall, the data suggest that reuse water may be detected by olfaction, impair olfactory responses in fish receiving unavoidable exposures, and that exposure duration and season are important factors to consider regarding adverse effects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: K.B.

We explored associations between exposures and metabolism through an exposome-metabolome wide association scan and multivariate O2PLS modeling. Novel and reproducible associations were found across two periods of pregnancy for three nonpersistent pollutants and across two subcohorts for four of the persistent pollutants. We found novel metabolic signatures associated with arsenic exposure: TMAO and dimethylamine possibly related to gut microbial methylamine metabolism and homarine related to fish intake.

CPF exposure led to a significant decrease in the activity of oxidative stress markers as follows: AChE (84 %), BChE (46 %), and gills Na+/K+ ATPase (62 %). At the end of the recovery period, enzyme levels were recovered except in leg muscle. Total lipids and SOD decreased; CAT and LPO levels increased; and GPx, GR, and GST showed tissue-specific activities. Maximum recovery was observed in GPx followed by GR in HP tissue of crab.

However, neurobehavioral effects associated with exposure have not been characterized in detail. We investigated the behavioral effects of FM 550 in zebrafish to facilitate the integration of the cellular and molecular effects of FM 550 with its behavioral consequences. The effects of developmental FM 550 exposure on zebrafish larvae swimming shortly after the end of exposure as well as the persisting effects of this exposure on adolescent behavior were studied. In addition, the acute effects of FM 550 on behavior with exposure during adolescence in zebrafish were studied.        Methods: Developmental exposure to 0, 0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion spanned 0-5 days post fertilization, with larval testing on day 6 and adolescent testing on days 40-45. Acute adolescent (45 dpf) exposure was to 0, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion, for 24 h, with testing 2 h or 1 week later. The vehicle condition was colony tank water with.0004% (developmental) or .0012% (adolescent) DMSO. Zebrafish behavior was characterized across several domains including learning, social affiliation, sensorimotor function, predator escape, and novel environment exploration.        Results: Persisting effects of developmental FM 550 exposure included a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in social behavior among all dose groups. Acute FM 550 exposure during adolescence caused hypoactivity and reduced social behavior (p's < 0.05) when the fish were tested 2 h after exposure. These effects were attenuated at the 1 week post exposure testing point        Discussion: Taken together, these data indicate that FM 550 may cause persisting neurobehavioral alterations to social behavior in the absence of perturbations along other behavioral domains and that developmental exposure is more costly to the organism than acute adolescent exposure.

The objective of this work was to investigate the direct effects of long-term exposure to environmental concentrations of pendimethalin over a period of 18 months in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) genitors. To do so, an experimental system consisting of eight similar 400 L tanks with a flow-through of fresh river water was used to perform daily chemical contamination. Fish were exposed to 850 ng/L for one hour and the pendimethalin concentration was then gradually diluted during the day to maintain optimal conditions for the fish throughout the experiment and to achieve a mean theoretical exposure level of around 100 ng L-1 per day. Every November, males and females were stripped to collect eggs and sperm and two new first generations of offspring were obtained. Kinetic sampling revealed differences in immune system parameters and antioxidative defences in the contaminated trout compared to the controls, due to pesticide exposure combined with seasonal changes related to gamete maturation. Moreover, reproductive capacity was significantly affected by exposure to the herbicide; a time lag of more than five weeks was observed for egg maturation in contaminated females and high bioconcentrations of pendimethalin were measured in eggs and sperm.

The quality of bivalve mollusks is closely related to the sanitary conditions of surrounding waters where they are cultivated. Presently, cultivation areas receive large amounts of effluents derived mainly from treated and non-treated domestic, rural, and urban sewage. This contributes to the contamination of mollusks with trace metals, pesticides, other organic compounds, and human pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoan. The aim of this study was to perform a thorough diagnosis of the shellfish growing areas in Florianopolis, on the coast of Santa Catarina. The contamination levels of seawater, sediments, and oysters were evaluated for their microbiological, biochemical, and chemical parameters at five sea sites in Florianopolis, namely three regular oyster cultivation areas (Sites 1, 2, and oyster supplier), a polluted site (Site 3), and a heavily polluted site (Site 4). Samples were evaluated at day zero and after 14 days. Seawater and sediment samples were collected just once, at the end of the experiment. Antioxidant defenses, which may occur in contaminated environments in response to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by organisms, were analyzed in oysters, as well as organic compounds (in oysters and sediment samples) and microbiological contamination (in oysters and seawater samples). The results showed the presence of the following contaminants: fecal coliforms in seawater samples (four sites), human adenovirus (all sites), human noroviruses GI and GII (two sites), Hepatitis A viruses (one site), JC Polyomavirus in an oyster sample from the oyster supplier, Giardia duodenalis cysts, and Cryptosporidium sp oocysts (one site). Among organochlorine pesticides, only DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane) were detected in some sediment and oysters samples in very low levels; site 4 had the highest concentrations of total aliphatic hydrocarbons. PAHs, and linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) found either in oysters or in sediment samples. The major concentration of fecal sterol coprostanol was found at site 4, followed by site 3. After 14 days of allocation in the four selected sites, there was a significant difference in the enzymes analyzed at the monitored spots. The detection of different contaminants in oysters, seawater, and sediment samples in the present study shows the impact untreated or inadequately treated effluents have on coastal areas. These results highlight the need for public investment in adequate wastewater treatment and adequate treatment of oysters, ensuring safe areas for shellfish production as well as healthier bivalve mollusks for consumption.

Transcription of these genes was regulated in response to H2O2, paraquat, or organic peroxides. Expression of katB-lacZ and the observed KatB catalase levels in P. aeruginosa PAO1 were induced up to 250-fold after exposure to oxidative stress-generating compounds. Also, ahpB-lacZ and ahpC-lacZ expression was 90- and 3-fold higher, respectively, upon exposure to paraquat. The dose- and time-response curves revealed that 1 mu M paraquat was sufficient for half-maximal activation of each reporter fusion within 5 min of exposure. Expression of these genes was not observed in a Delta oxyR mutant, indicating that OxyR was essential for this response. The transcriptional start sites of katB-ankB, ahpB, and ahpC-ahpF were mapped, putative OxyR-binding sites were identified upstream of the -35 promoter elements, and direct binding of purified OxyR protein to these target promoters was demonstrated. The oxyR mutant was hypersusceptible to oxidative stress-generating agents, including H2O2 and paraquat, in spite of total KatA catalase activity being comparable to that of the wild type. The oxyR phenotype was fully complemented by a plasmid containing the oxyR gene, while any of the katB, ahpB, or ahpCF genes alone resulted in only marginal complementation. Increased katB-lacZ expression and higher KatB catalase levels were detected in a Delta ahpCF background compared to wild-type bacteria, suggesting a compensatory function for KatB in the absence of AhpCF. In P. aeruginosa, oxyR is located upstream of recG, encoding a putative DNA repair enzyme. oxyR-lacZ and recG-lacZ reporter activities and oxyR-recG mRNA analysis showed that oxyR and recG are organized in an operon and expressed constitutively with regard to oxidative stress from a single promoter upstream of oxyR. Mutants affected in recG but not oxyR were dramatically impaired in DNA damage repair as measured by sensitivity to UV irradiation.

However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood in invertebrates. Mesenchyme cells of the starfish larvae, which allowed Metchnikoff to complete his landmark experiments, are important model for analysis of immune cell migration. The present study investigated the role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-an evolutionarily conserved cytokine that is functionally similar to chemokines-in the larvae of the starfish Patiria (Asterina) pectinifera, which were found to possess two orthologs, ApMIF1 and ApMIF2. ApMIF1 and ApMIF2 clustered with mammalian MIF and its homolog D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT), respectively, in the phylogenetic analysis. In contrast to the functional similarity between mammalian MIF and DDT, ApMIF1 knockdown resulted in the excessive recruitment of mesenchyme cells in vivo, whereas ApMIF2 deficiency inhibited the recruitment of these cells to foreign bodies. Mesenchyme cells migrated along a gradient of recombinant ApMIF2 in vitro, whereas recombinant ApMIF1 completely blocked ApMIF2-induced directed migration. Moreover, the expression patterns of ApMIF1 and ApMIF2 messenger RNA in bacteria-challenged mesenchyme cells were consistent with in vivo observations of cell behaviors. These results indicate that ApMIF1 and ApMIF2 act as chemotactic inhibitory and stimulatory factors, respectively, and coordinately regulate mesenchyme cell recruitment during the immune response in starfish larvae. This is the first report describing opposing functions for MIF- and DDT-like molecules.

The 98 000 km2 region has a high rate of primary production relative to other parts of arctic Canada. About 60 g C.m-2  are fixed annually, of which approximately 90% is contributed by phytoplankton, 10% by ice algae, and 1% by kelp. Phytoplankton production is twofold higher along the south coast of Cornwallis Island than elsewhere in Barrow Strait. Four copepod species, of which Pseudocalanus acuspes is the most important energetically, graze about one-third of the phytoplankton production. Bivalves maintain high biomass but low energy flow, acting as sedimenting agents. Arctic cod is a major component, with 125 000 tonnes being consumed by marine mammals and 23 000 tonnes by seabirds annually. Our hydroacoustic estimate for mean arctic cod density, 0.0022 fish.m-2, is probably too low, partly because we have been unable to quantify dense aggregations of schooling fish. The ecological efficiency of ringed seal is near maximum, with 5% of ringed seal ingestion going to bears and man as seal flesh. The data on total kill and prey consumption in whales and birds is incomplete because they migrate out of the Lancaster Sound region in winter. The food chain is very long, with bears occupying the fifth trophic level; this is reflected by high biomagnification factors for persistent lipophilic pollutants such as PCBs.

The most toxic PCBs are the non-ortho-substituted (""dioxin-like"") congeners that act through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. In humans, perinatal exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is associated with neurodevelopmental toxicity in children. Yet, the full potential for later-life neurobehavioral effects that result from early-life low level exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of developmental exposure to low levels of dioxin-like PCBs on early- and later-life behavioral phenotypes using zebrafish as a model system. We exposed zebrafish embryos to either vehicle (DMSO) or low concentrations of PCB126 (0.3, 0.6, 1.2 nM) for 20 h (4-24 h post fertilization), and then reared them to adulthood in clean water. Locomotor activity was tested at two larval stages (7 and 14 days post fertilization). Adult fish were tested for anxiety-related behavior using the novel tank and shoaling assays. Adult behavioral assays were repeated several times on the same group of fish and effects on intra- and inter-trial habituation were determined. While there was no effect of PCB126 on larval locomotor activity in response to changes in light conditions, developmental exposure to PCB126 resulted in impaired short- and long-term habituation to a novel environment in adult zebrafish. Cyp1a induction was measured as an indicator for AHR activation. Despite high induction at early stages, cyp1a expression was not induced in the brains of developmentally exposed adult fish that showed altered behavior, suggesting that AHR was not activated at this stage.

Flow cytometric results showed that the percentages of apoptotic cells incubated with 20mg L-1 (-)PFF, (+)PFF and rac-PFF for 24h reached 23.4%, 9.2% and 14.2% (P < 0.01), respectively. Hippocampal neurons incubated with (-)PFF, (+)PFF and rac-PFF exhibited a dose-dependent accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and a dose-dependent inhibition of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, implying that the defense system of the tests induces oxidative damage. A statistically significant difference was observed between the two enantiomers at 5mg L-1 and above. Moreover, the results showed that (-)PFF exposure caused a significant loss in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP), an upregulation of Ca2+ and Bax protein expression, a downregulation of Bcl-2 protein expression, and the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in a dose-dependent manner; (+)PFF and rac-PFF exhibited these effects to a lesser degree. All results suggest that PFF induced apoptosis in rat hippocampal neurons via the mitochondria-mediated pathway, and oxidative stress is one of the factors of PFF-induced apoptosis.

Four adult males and two ovulated females were placed in the aquarium together with eight mature male parr. Four of the parr were exposed during the previous 4 days to two concentrations (0.1 or 1.0 mu g l(-1)) of the pyrethroid pesticide cypermethrin (a disrupter of olfactory receptor function) and four of the parr to the solvent ethanol. The behaviour of all fish was followed for 24 h and then blood and milt was collected. Exposure to the higher concentration of cypermethrin disturbed the reproductive behaviour of the parr. They displayed fewer courting events, spent less time near the nesting females and had lower volumes of strippable milt. They also had significantly lower amounts of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) in the blood plasma than the control roup. The higher cypermethrin group also had significantly lower levels of all these variables than the 9 lower cypermethrin group, apart from strippable milt that showed no significant differences between two groups. No significant differences in non-reproductive behaviours were observed between any of the groups. In the control fish, there were significant positive Correlations between (a) the number of courting events and the amount of time spent near the female, (b) blood plasma levels of 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta-P) and time spent near the female and (c) plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P and the number of courting events. Further, in control fish, higher plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P were observed in part-interacting with a female compared to those with no female contacts. A priming experiment confirmed a previous study that cypermethrin damages olfactory reception. Parr exposed to cypermethrin had significantly lower blood plasma levels of 17,20 beta-P and 11-KT than control males after exposure to ovarian fluid and urine (known to contain reproductive priming pheromones).

A variety of pesticides have direct effects on retinoic acid (RA) signaling and as RA signaling has important roles in neurodevelopment, such compounds may cause developmental neurotoxicity through an overlapping adverse outcome pathway. It is hypothesized that a pesticide's embryonic effects on retinoid function may correspond with neurobehavioral disruption later in development. In the current studies, we determined the effects of RA-acting pesticides on neurobehavioral development in zebrafish. Buprofezin and imazalil caused generalized hypoactivity in the larval motility test, whereas chlorothalonil and endosulfan I led to selective hypoactivity and hyperactivity, respectively. With buprofezin, chlorothalonil, and imazalil, hypoactivity and/or novel anxiety-like behaviors persisted in adulthood and buprofezin additionally decreased social attraction responses in adulthood. Endosulfan I did not produce significant adult behavioral effects. Using qPCR analyses of adult brain tissue, we observed treatment-induced alterations in RA synthesis or catabolic genes, indicating persistent changes in RA homeostasis. These changes were compound-specific, with respect to expression directionality, and potential patterns of homeostatic disruption. Results suggest the likely persistence of disruptions in RA signaling well into adulthood and may represent compensatory mechanisms following early life stage exposures. This study demonstrates that early developmental exposure to environmental toxicants that interfere with RA signaling causes short as well as long-term behavioral disruption in a well-established zebrafish behavioral model and expand upon the meaning of the RA adverse outcome pathway, indicating that observed effects likely correspond with the nature of underlying homeostatic effects.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  45,10.1093/toxsci/kfae001,zebrafish;development;neurobehavioral toxicology;retinoic acid receptors;VITAMIN-A;CRITICAL PERIOD;MENTAL-HEALTH;VALPROIC ACID;HOX GENES;ABNORMALITIES;ORIGINS;Pesticides,NA,NA,developmental exposure to pesticides that disrupt retinoic acid signaling causes persistent retinoid and behavioral dysfunction in zebrafish

In vertebrates, the stress response is regulated via neuroendocrine pathways, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis that regulates the secretion of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids have cascading effects on multiple physiological pathways, affecting the metabolic rate, reactive oxygen species production, or immune system. Determining the extent to which natural and anthropogenic environmental factors induce stress responses in vertebrates is of great importance in ecology and conservation biology. Here we study the physiological stress response in spadefoot toad tadpoles (Pelobates cultripes) against three levels of a series of natural and anthropogenic stressors common to many aquatic systems: salinity (0, 6, and 9 ppt), herbicide (0, 1, and 2 mg/L acid equivalent of glyphosate), water acidity (pH 4.5, 7.0, and 9.5), predators (absent, native, and invasive), and temperature (217, 257, and 29 degrees C). The physiological stress response was assessed examining corticosterone levels, standard metabolic rate, activity of antioxidant enzymes, oxidative cellular damage in lipids, and immunological status. We found that common stressors substantially altered the physiological state of tadpoles. In particular, salinity and herbicides cause dramatic physiological changes in tadpoles. Moreover, tadpoles reduced corticosterone levels in the presence of natural predators but did not do so against invasive predators, indicating a lack of innate recognition. Corticosterone and the antioxidant enzyme glutathione reductase were the most sensitive parameters to stress in this study.

The lowest observable effect concentration (LOECs) for the standard measures of survival and growth was 5.6 mu g/L. Two behavioral endpoints were of similar sensitivity to the standard measures: swimming capacity, LOEC of 5.6 mu g/L; and prey strike frequency, LOEC of 5.6 mu g/L. However, aggressive interactions were ten-fold more sensitive than swimming or feeding behavior with a LOEC occurring at 0.6 mu g/L.

The aim of the current study is to investigate whether the exposure of Lithobates catesbeianus tadpoles to different abamectin concentrations [12.5, 25, and 50% of the median lethal concentration (LC50)] leads to behavioral and morphological changes and/or generates possible cytotoxic effects. The aggregation test showed that tadpoles exposed to the highest ABA concentrations did not respond to the stimulus from non-familial and unrelated co-specific species. On the other hand, there was no difference in the total number of crossings in the central line of the herein adopted apparatus between groups; it suggests that ABA did not affect animal locomotion in the aforementioned test, although changes in the normal swimming pattern of tadpoles exposed to the pesticide were recorded in the swimming activity test. In addition, the herein exposed animals did not respond to the predatory stimulus in the antipredator response test; this result suggests defensive response deficit caused by the pesticide. With respect to their oral morphology, tadpoles exposed to ABA presented the lowest scores for mandibular pigmentation and structures, as well as for dentition condition. Finally, it was possible seeing that the exposure to ABA, even at the lowest concentration (12.5% of the LC50), resulted in nuclear changes in the erythrocytes of the animals; these changes became evident in the increased number of micronuclei and in other nuclear abnormalities. Thus, besides confirming the cytotoxic potential of ABA in amphibians, the current study corroborates the hypothesis that the exposure to the herein investigated pesticide leads to behavioral and morphological changes in tadpoles, fact that may negatively reflect on the survival, as well as on natural populations of these individuals.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  22     Cited Reference Count:  83,10.1007/s11356-018-1562-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agrochemicals;Pesticide;Environmental toxicology;Amphibians;BULLFROG TADPOLES;LITHOBATES-CATESBEIANUS;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;OXIDATIVE DAMAGE;ORAL DEFORMITIES;KIN RECOGNITION;LARVAL ANURANS;RANA-SYLVATICA;DANIO-RERIO;BODY-SIZE;Biological Markers,NA,NA,behavioral and mutagenic biomarkers in tadpoles exposed to different abamectin concentrations

Mononuclear or dinuclear neutral or cationic complexes were obtained by reaction of the ligands with 1 or 2 equiv of Pd(C6XF4)(2)(cod) (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene; X = F, H) or the palladium fragment [Pd(eta(3)-2-Me-C3H4)(S)(2)](+) (S = acetone). The reaction of the dinuclear derivatives with 1 equiv of the respective free ligand immediately led to the regeneration of the mononuclear complexes. Except in the case of the synthesis of [{Pd(C6HF4)(2)}{Pd(C6F5)(2)}(bpzpm)], where two similar metallic groups are present, all attempts to obtain dinuclear asymmetric complexes with two different palladium fragments failed. Instead, the dinuclear symmetric complexes were formed. This result could be considered as an example of molecular recognition with the ligand acting as a ditopic receptor. This behavior is comparable to chemical symbiosis but in this case applied to the ligand rather than to the metal center as occurs normally. The polyfluorophenyl rings are situated on average in a perpendicular orientation with respect to the coordination plane. Their restricted rotation results in several atropoisomers for the complexes with m-C6HF4.

The immunostimulatory effects of glucan, chitin, lactoferrin and levamisole for fish and shrimp have been reported. Nutritional factors such as Vitamins B and C, growth hormone and prolactin have also been reported to be immunostimulators. These immunostimulants mainly facilitate the function of phagocytic cells and increase their bactericidal activities. Several immunostimulants also stimulate the natural killer cells, complement, lysozyme and antibody responses of fish. The activation of these immunological functions is associated with increased protection against infectious disease. Resistance to bacterial pathogens such as Vibrio anguillarum, V. salmonicida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia rukeri and Streptococcus spp. and to parasitic infections such as white spot disease can be increased by administration of immunostimulants, but not to intracellular pathogens such as Renibacterium salmoninarum and Pasteurella piscicida. The most effective method of administration of immunostimulants to fish is by injection. Oral and immersion methods have also been reported, but the efficacy of these methods decreases with long-term administration. Overdoses of several immunostimulants induce immunosuppression in fish. The side effects of immunostimulants have not been well-studied. Growth-promoting activity has been noted in fish or shrimp treated with glucan or lactoferrin. Immunostimulants can overcome immune suppression by sex hormones. Thus, the influence of immunostimulants in mature fish should be studied. In conclusion, immunostimulants can reduce the losses caused by disease in aquaculture; however, they may not be effective against all diseases. For the effective use of immunostimulants, the timing, dosages, method of administration and the physiological condition of fish need to be taken into consideration. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Methods: Both low malarious (DDT spray from 1958 to 1976) and high malarious (DDT spray from 1958 to April 2006) villages were selected for the study in Arid zone district Jodhpur, Rajasthan during March-April 2006. Resting behaviour of the species during all its movement rhythms covering 24 h period related to: (i) swarming/mating; (ii) pre- and post-biting rest; (iii) after feed resting between hoping movements; (iv) night and day time resting and; (v) diel activity movements in response to temperature changes, were carried out.        Results: The results showed that household objects like cupboards, furnitures, hanging clothes, goods stacked on loft, stored clothes, cobwebs and floor were the dominant resting sites both in sprayed and unsprayed villages. About 95 and 97% of An. stephensi preferred to rest on household objects of unsprayed and sprayed villages respectively. There was no significant difference in resting behaviour of the species in both groups of villages (p >0.05). The pre-biting resting time was recorded as 5 to 15 min whereas post-biting resting time lasted for 15 to 25 min. After biting outdoor (in courtyard open to sky) species starts entering the rooms at around 2330 hrs. It was observed that during III quarter (0100 to 0400 hrs) maximum species entered into the room were 56% in unsprayed and 62% in sprayed villages. Statistically there was no significant difference in the entry of mosquitoes (p >0.05) in both the groups of villages.        Conclusion: Before DDT era, An. stephensi was found resting at all heights of the walls inside the human dwellings. Present study revealed that An. stephensi is trying to avoid sprayable surfaces and tend to rest on unsprayable surfaces during all its movement rhythms starting from swarming, pre-/post-biting and during hopping movements in the courtyard and thereafter household objects inside the room as final day time resting. It was concluded that changed behaviour of resting of An. stephensi on unsprayable objects in sprayed rooms largely accounted for failure of malaria control. Control of An. stephensi, thus requires an integrated vector control strategy based upon interesectoral, environmental, larviciding with chemical/biolarvicide and use of larvivorous fish wherever feasible.

Accordingly, the present study aimed to assess the modulatory effects of dietary methionine on the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) immune status, inflammatory response and disease resistance to Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp). For this purpose, fish were randomly distributed in three independent groups (three replicates per group) and each was fed the corresponding diet: a control diet (CTRL) formulated to meet the established amino acid requirements for the species; a diet supplemented with methionine at 0.5% of feed weight relative to the CTRL diet (8.2% of methionine concentration above CTRL); and one supplemented with methionine at 1% of feed weight to the CTRL diet (11.8% of methionine concentration above CTRL). To evaluate the immune status of fish fed with each of the diets before being submitted to bacterial infection fish were sampled from each group at 2 and 4 weeks after the beginning of feeding. Non-sampled fish were injected intraperitoneally with Phdp (5 x 10(3) cfu/fish) at 4 weeks after initiation of feeding and the inflammatory response (at 4, 24, and 48 h post-infection) and survival (lasting 21 days post-infection) evaluated. Fish hematological profile, peripheral cell dynamics, plasma humoral immune parameters, leucocyte migration to the inflammatory focus and head-kidney gene expression were evaluated. Results show that methionine dietary supplementation improves seabass cellular immune status without evidence of activation of pro-inflammatory mechanisms. Additionally, the observed enhanced immune status provided by methionine supplementation translated into an improved immune response to infection, as higher cellular differentiation/proliferation and recruitment to the inflammatory focus, improved plasma humoral immune parameters and modulation of key immune-related genes was observed. Lastly, after a bacterial challenge, higher survival was observed in fish fed supplemented diets, ultimately corroborating the positive effect of methionine administration for 4 weeks in the cellular immune status.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  41     Total Times Cited:  45     Cited Reference Count:  41,10.3389/fimmu.2018.02672     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),amino acids;cell proliferation;inflammation;immunostimulation;fish;nutraceutics;SULFUR AMINO-ACIDS;INHIBITS AUTOPHAGY;JUVENILE JIAN;SPARUS-AURATA;METABOLISM;PROTEIN;METHYLATION;MECHANISMS;MODULATORS;TRYPTOPHAN;Methionine,NA,NA,dietary methionine improves the european seabass <i>dicentrarchus labrax<i> immune status inflammatory response and disease resistance

The diversity of potential sources contributes to the likelihood of contaminated marine waters and sediments and increases the probability of uptake by marine organisms. Despite widespread recognition of direct and indirect pathways for contaminant deposition and organismal exposure in coastal systems, spatial and temporal variability in contaminant composition, deposition, and uptake patterns are still poorly known. We investigated these patterns for a suite of persistent legacy contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and chemicals of emerging concern including pharmaceuticals within two Oregon coastal estuaries (Coos and Netarts Bays). In the more urbanized Coos Bay, native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) tissue had approximately twice the number of PCB congeners at over seven times the total concentration, yet fewer PBDEs at one-tenth the concentration as compared to the more rural Netarts Bay. Different pharmaceutical suites were detected during each sampling season. Variability in contaminant types and concentrations across seasons and between species and media (organisms versus sediment) indicates the limitation of using indicator species and/or sampling annually to determine contaminant loads at a site or for specific species. The results indicate the prevalence of legacy contaminants and CECs in relatively undeveloped coastal environments highlighting the need to improve policy and management actions to reduce contaminant releases into estuarine and marine waters and to deal with legacy compounds that remain long after prohibition of use. Our results point to the need for better understanding of the ecological and human health risks of exposure to the diverse cocktail of pollutants and harmful compounds that will continue to leach from estuarine sediments over time. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: E.F.

In all the villages, MDA was carried out by the state health machinery, as part of the national filariasis elimination programme. Thirty-six difficult-to-control villages were grouped as, viz, MDA alone, MDA + EPS and MDA + EPS + PIC arms. Implementation and monitoring of IVC was carried out by the community. After 3 years of IVC, higher reductions in filariometric indices were observed in both the community and vector population. Decline in antigenaemia prevalence was higher in MDA + IVC as compared to MDA alone arm. Vector density dropped significantly (P < 0.05) in both the IVC arms, and nil transmission was observed during post-IVC period. Almost 53.8 and 75.8 % of the cesspits in MDA + EPS and MDA + EPS + PIC arms were closed by the householders, due to the enhanced awareness on vector breeding.

In this study, the effects of exposure to TBT on the antioxidant defense system, Na+-K+-ATPase activity, neurological enzymes activity and Hsp 70 protein level in brain of juvenile common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were studied. Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of TBT (5, 10 and 20 μg/L) for 7 days. Based on the results, with increasing concentrations of TBT, oxidative stress was apparent as reflected by the significant higher levels of oxidative indices, as well as the significant inhibition of all antioxidant enzymes activities. Besides, the activities of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Monoamine oxidases (MAO) and Na+-K+-ATPase were significantly inhibited after exposure to TBT with higher concentrations. In addition, the levels of Hsp 70 protein were evaluated under TBT stress with dose-depended manner.

The tool has been tested in salmon, beef-and-dairy, and fruit juice production sectors. Methods: The SENSE project has evaluated several existing methodologies for environmental impact assessment over the life cycle including also social aspects, in order to deliver a new integral system for the environmental and social assessment of agricultural and aquaculture food products. Results and discussion: The system includes a standardization of a data gathering system, a selection of relevant key environmental performance indicators for food supply chains and a common methodology to perform simplified life cycle impact assessment. The results are based on collected information on the use of resources and emissions generated along the supply chain of food or drink products. The main result is a web-based software tool that is based on a summation of the partial impacts of the different steps in food supply chains. In this software, different actors in the supply chain can enter their own data and link them to the data of other companies. The results obtained in the tool could be used for at least six different approaches: (i) environmental impact assessment of the product, (ii) food chain hot spot identification, (iii) comparison of hypothetical or real improvement scenarios, (iv) assessment of the environmental impact development over the years, (v) benchmarking opportunity for the companies, and (vi) a business to business communication strategy. The scientific robustness of the tool has been tested comparing the obtained results with the same analysis with commercial software. Conclusions: The SENSE tool is a simplified tool designed for food and drink SMEs to assess their sustainability on their own. This cannot be fully compared to a complete LCA study. The testing with SMEs showed that they need additional support for filling in the questionnaires correctly and interpret the results. The simplified evaluation of environmental impacts based on a life cycle approach could lead to benefits to SMEs within the food industry. The future application and development of the tool will be focused on adapting the tool to the Product Environmental Footprint initiative requirements and self-assessment opportunities. © 2015, The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 20; Correspondence Address: S.

By the 1870s, Euro-Americans had extirpated the American bison (Bison bison), introduced cattle, and begun agricultural cultivation in the region. Lesser Prairie-Chicken populations initially increased with changes on the landscape that came with early settlements, with populations sufficiently abundant to support both subsistence and market hunting. The proportion of prairies converted to cropland steadily increased from the late 1800s to the early 1900s. Habitat loss, combined with drought and high winds, precipitated the Dust Bowl, an ecological disaster during the 1930s in the heart of the species' range. By the late 1930s, Lesser Prairie-Chicken populations were reported to be near extirpation in Kansas, New Mexico, and Colorado, with greatly reduced numbers in Texas and Oklahoma. The disaster of the Dust Bowl prompted many of the first landscape conservation efforts to benefit Lesser Prairie-Chickens, including the eventual establishment of the Cimarron and Comanche National Grasslands. Lesser Prairie-Chicken populations generally recovered during the 1940s-1960s, but new threats to the species' habitats emerged during that period. Conversion of grasslands to croplands continued, and development of center-pivot irrigation systems made it possible to farm previously nonarable sand prairie, sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia) prairie, and sand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) prairie, all prime habitats for Lesser Prairie-Chicken. Oil and gas development and associated infrastructure encroached on and degraded Lesser Prairie-Chicken habitats throughout the species' range, most intensively in the Permian Basin of west Texas and adjacent New Mexico. The encroachment of invasive trees on grasslands, facilitated by a century of fire suppression, reached levels intolerable to Lesser Prairie-Chickens and caused further habitat loss within the range of the species. Extensive herbicide treatments of both sand sagebrush and sand shinnery oak prairies have degraded the quality of these remaining habitats. By the late 1900s, only 10%-15% of the historical range remained occupied by Lesser Prairie-Chickens. A petition to list the species as ""threatened"" under the Endangered Species Act was submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1995. The USFWS determined that the listing was ""warranted but precluded"" by higher priorities, leaving the Lesser Prairie-Chicken as a ""candidate"" species. The change in conservation status prompted new research and conservation activity for the species, including land acquisitions. Considerable effort and resources were channeled through the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Lesser Prairie-Chicken populations expanded their range and numbers substantially in Kansas in response to native species grasslands established through the CRP. Much of the conservation activity was monitored through the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Interstate Working Group, which produced three documents that culminated with a range-wide conservation plan put into action in early 2014. Continuing loss and degradation of Lesser Prairie-Chicken habitats due to energy development and prolonged drought prompted the USFWS to list the species as ""threatened"" on May 12, 2014. The listing decision was vacated by a judicial decision in September 2015, creating considerable regulatory uncertainty regarding the legal status of the species. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

So the aim of the present study was to investigate the toxic effects of CuSO4.5H2O by examining oxidative damage markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA) for lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant enzymatic defense system components (glutathione reductase (GR), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT)) in freshwater fish Capoeta umbla (Heckel, 1843) liver, kidney and gill. In this purpose, the 96 h LC50 values (with 95% confidence limits) of CuSO4.5H2O for C. umbla was estimated as a 1.478 mg/L. Three different CuSO4.5H2O sublethal doses (0.185, 0.370 and 0.739 mg/L) were administered to C. umbla at different time intervals (12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h). Antioxidant enzyme activities and MDA levels were measured spectrophotometrically. Liver, kidney and gills samples were collected at the end of the experiment, and analysed for their oxidant–antioxidant status, including MDA level, GR, G6PD, SOD, CAT and GPx activities. Results obtained showed that CuSO4.5H2O, significantly decreased (P<0.05) the GR, G6PD and GPx activities, but increased (P<0.05) the CAT, SOD activities and MDA levels of C. umbla liver, kidney and gill tissue in a dose-dependent manner.

We present a selection of the most commonly used agents to study purines in the nervous system. Some of these compounds, including A1 and A3 AR agonists, P2Y1R and P2Y12R antagonists, and P2X3, P2X4 and P2X7 antagonists, are potentially of clinical use in treatment of disorders of the nervous system, such as chronic pain, neurodegeneration and brain injury. Agonists of the A2AAR and P2Y2R are already used clinically, P2Y12R antagonists are widely used antithrombotics and an antagonist of the A2AAR is approved in Japan for treating Parkinson's disease. The selectivity defined for some of the previously introduced compounds has been revised with updated pharmacological characterization, for example, various AR agonists and antagonists were deemed A1AR or A3AR selective based on human data, but species differences indicated a reduction in selectivity ratios in other species. Also, many of the P2R ligands still lack bioavailability due to charged groups or hydrolytic (either enzymatic or chemical) instability. X-ray crystallographic structures of AR and P2YRs have shifted the mode of ligand discovery to structure-based approaches rather than previous empirical approaches. The X-ray structures can be utilized either for in silico screening of chemically diverse libraries for the discovery of novel ligands or for enhancement of the properties of known ligands by chemical modification. Although X-ray structures of the zebrafish P2X4R have been reported, there is scant structural information about ligand recognition in these trimeric ion channels. In summary, there are definitive, selective agonists and antagonists for all of the ARs and some of the P2YRs; while the pharmacochemistry of P2XRs is still in nascent stages. The therapeutic potential of selectively modulating these receptors is continuing to gain interest in such fields as cancer, inflammation, pain, diabetes, ischemic protection and many other conditions.

Hemlock mortality has been linked to a loss in esthetics, declines in trout habitat, and an increase in safety hazards in public forests. Available options to control HWA vary in terms of cost and environmental impact. As infestations occur often on public lands, which are popular recreation destinations, understanding public knowledge of and attitudes toward HWA control options will be important to any successful control program. Household survey results indicate public support for combating HWA, but public awareness of control options and of HWA in general is low. Survey respondents revealed concerns related to increased risk of wildfire, safety, and reduced quality of recreation but were less concerned with property value reduction or loss of trees on private land. Spraying oil and soap on branches and injecting insecticides into tree trunks were preferred to chemical soil treatments or releasing nonnative predatory beetles.

As biomixtures employ high content of lignocellulosic substrates, their bioaugmentation with ligninolytic fungi represents a novel approach for their enhancement. Nonetheless, the decrease in the concentration of the pesticide may result in sublethal concentrations that still affect ecosystems. Two matrices, a microcosm of rice husk (lignocellulosic substrate) bioaugmented with the fungus Trametes versicolor and a biomixture that contained fungally colonized rice husk were used in the degradation of the insecticide/nematicide carbofuran (CFN). Elutriates simulating lixiviates from these matrices were used to assay the ecotoxicological effects at sublethal level over Daphnia magna (Straus) and the fish Oreochromis aureus (Steindachner) and Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum). Elutriates obtained after 30 d of treatment in the rice husk microcosms at dilutions over 2.5% increased the offspring of D. magna as a trade-off stress response, and produced mortality of neonates at dilutions over 5%. Elutriates (dilution 1:200) obtained during a 30 d period did not produce alterations on the oxygen consumption and ammonium excretion of O. mykiss, however these physiological parameters were affected in O. aureus at every time point of treatment, irrespective of the decrease in CFN concentration. When the fungally colonized rice husk was used to prepare a biomixture, where more accelerated degradation is expected, similar alterations on the responses by O. aureus were achieved. Results suggest that despite the good removal of the pesticide, it is necessary to optimize biomixtures to minimize their residual toxicity and potential chronic effects on aquatic life. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: C.E.

Age-0 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), a species of conservation concern, share similar stream habitats with larval sea lampreys and these streams can be targeted for lampricide applications on a 3- to 5-year cycle. Previous laboratory research found that lake sturgeon smaller than 100 mm could be susceptible to lampricide treatments. We conducted stream-side toxicity (bioassay) and in situ studies in conjunction with 10 lampricide applications in nine Great Lakes tributaries to determine whether sea lamprey treatments could result in in situ age-0 lake sturgeon mortality, and developed a logistic model to help predict lake sturgeon survival during future treatments. In the bioassays the observed concentrations where no lake sturgeon mortality occurred (no observable effect concentration, NOEC) were at or greater than the observed sea lamprey minimum lethal concentration (MLC or LC99) in 7 of 10 tests. We found that the mean in situ survival of age-0 lake sturgeon during 10 lampricide applications was 80%, with a range of 45–100% survival within streams. Modeling indicated that in age-0 lake sturgeon survival was negatively correlated with absolute TFM concentration and stream alkalinity, and positively correlated with stream pH and temperature. Overall survival was higher than expected based on previous research, and we expect that these data will help managers with decisions on the trade-offs between sea lamprey control and the effect on stream-specific populations of age-0 lake sturgeon. © 2016","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 24; Correspondence Address: L.M.

Although it has been documented that they affect the behavior and reproduction of aquatic species, researches investigating cellular detoxification and the defense system in bivalves are scarce. In this study, adult Asian clams (C. fluminea) were exposed to tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP) and tributyl phosphate (TBP) at 20, 200, and 2000 μg/L for 28 d. The results showed no noticeable difference in siphoning behavior. However, the siphoning behavior displayed a trend toward a slight decrease in the treatment groups. GR activity was markedly reduced compared with the control groups, whereas the levels of cyp4 significantly increased following the 2000 μg/L TBP treatments (p < 0.05). Moreover, the levels of gsts1 and gstm1 significantly decreased following all TBEP treatments and were significantly inhibited by 20 μg/L TBP (p < 0.05). The adverse effects on antioxidant enzymes suggested that C. fluminea mainly relies on the antioxidant system to reduce damage without an increase in MDA levels following exposure to a low concentration. Moreover, mRNA expression levels of heat shock proteins (hsp 22, 40, 60, 70, and 90) were significantly down-regulated with TBEP and TBP treatments lower than 200 μg/L (p < 0.05), whereas significant up-regulations were observed for hsp 22 and hsp 70 in response to 2000 μg/L TBP treatment (p < 0.05). Up-regulation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes (abcb1 and abcc1) showed that TBEP and TBP could activate the multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) system to discharge xenobiotics in C. fluminea, which kept its shell closed at high concentrations to prevent xenobiotic entry.

(Poaceae), in the USA. Maize plants expressing Bt toxins targeting the corn rootworm complex have been widely adopted and are the primary insecticidal control measure for this pest in North America. Insect resistance management tactics using various refuge structures have been adopted to ensure Bt products will retain durability. An assumption of the refuge strategy is that males and females emerging from Bt and refuge plantings mate randomly; this has not been tested in the field. We conducted cage studies using field populations of WCR in Indiana, USA, to generate empirical field data on mating rates between beetles emerging from Cry3Bb1-expressing Bt and refuge maize plants. Two refuge configurations were tested; all refuge plants were labeled using the stable isotope 15N. This mark persists in adult beetles after eclosion, allowing for collection and analysis of isotopic ratios of all beetles. Additional data collected included adult emergence rates, timing and sex ratios for each of the treatments, and head capsule size and dry weights of beetles collected. Treatment had a significant effect on dry weight; mean dry weight decreased in Bt-only treatments. Fisher's exact test of proportions of mating pairs of refuge and Bt insects indicated that mating was not random in 20% strip refuges and 5% seed blend treatments. We found high percentages of beetles that fed on Bt-expressing plants as larvae, suggesting that mating between resistant beetles may not be rare even if random mating did occur. © 2016 The Netherlands Entomological Society","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: C.H.

In the present study, we exposed the Hooded oyster Saccostrea cucullata to TBT to investigate histopathological effects and proteome stress response. Animals were exposed to three TBT sub-lethal concentrations, 10, 50 and 150 μg/l for 48 h. TBT produced stress leading to histopathological changes in oyster tissues including mantle, gill, stomach and digestive diverticula. TBT induced mucocyte production in epithelia and hemocyte aggregation in connective tissue. Cell necrosis occurred when exposure dosages were high. Comparative proteome analyses of mantle protein of oysters exposed to 10 μg/l and control animals were analyzed by a 2-DE based proteomic approach. In total, 32 protein spots were found to differ (p < 0.05). Of these, 17 proteins were identified which included 14 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated proteins. TBT induced the expression of proteins involved in defensive mechanisms (HSP-78, HSP-70, aldehyde dehydrogenase and catalase), calcium homeostasis (VDAC-3), cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton-associated proteins, energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Our study revealed that TBT disturbs calcium homeostasis via VDAC-3 protein in mantle and this probably is the key molecular mechanism of TBT acting to distort shell calcification. Moreover, proteins involved in cell structure (tubulin-alpha and tubulin-beta) and protein synthesis were reduced after TBT exposure. Additionally, differential proteins obtained from this work will be useful as potential TBT biomarkers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: S.

The trichlorphon-degrading symbiont Citrobacter freundii (CF-BD) of the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis was recently discovered; however, its intraspecies transmission pathway among flies remains unknown. Here, we use fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), PCR detection, and a series of ingenious experiments to reveal that CF-BD was aggregated in rectal pads associated with the female ovipositor, and the CF-BD symbiont was vertically transmitted via egg surface contamination. Although CF-BD was not detected in ovaries, it was found in deposited eggs. In addition, CF-BD was readily acquired horizontally between larvae or adults via oral uptake, although it was not transferred via mating behavior. Surface sterilization of eggs had a negative effect on the insects, which exhibited a lower body weight and a sharp decrease in fecundity, suggesting important biological roles of CF-BD in the fitness of the host insects. Our findings may also help to explain the high pesticide resistance levels of B. dorsalis. Furthermore, identifying a clear transmission pathway of this organophosphorus-degrading symbiont will be useful for pesticide resistance management and future pest control technologies. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 34; Correspondence Address: G.

Weeds are a major problem in broccoli cultivation. There are still limited information to prevent the yield loss caused by weeds, therefore the herbicide application in broccoli growth were researched. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of several weed control managements to obtain the most effective and efficient weed control in broccoli. Methodology: The research was conducted in Temas Village, Batu Sub-District, East Java (900 m a.s.l) during rainy season, since February until May 2016. This study established using Randomized Block Design consisting of seven treatments with four replications and comprised seven methods of weed control viz: Wy (weedy), Wf (weed free), W15 (weeding at 15 DAT), W15 +30 (weeding at 15 and 30 DAT), O1 + W15 (oxyfluorfen 240 g a.i ha-1 + weeding at 15 DAT), O1.5 (oxyfluorfen 360 g a.i ha-1 ) and O2 (oxyfluorfen 480 g a.i ha-1 ). Data obtained were subjected to an one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 0.05 level, if there is a significance difference will be continued by Fisher's Least Significant Differences (LSD) test at the 0.05 probability level.

Many pesticides are employed on rice crops grown in the Palizada River system, mainly carbofuran, chlorpyrifos, glyphosate, monocrotophos, metomil, edifenfos, benomyl, among others. In order to assess the impact of agricultural activities on human and animal populations from the Palizada River system, mosquito fish (Gambusia yucatana) and black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis) were chosen as bioindicators for the analysis of biomarkers of exposure and effect to pesticides. Farmers and agricultural workers from the communities of El Juncal, Ich-Ek, Suc-Tuc and Castamay were also evaluated because they are exposed to pesticides during application. The integration of information generated in wild fish and exposed in situ reflected a concordance between percentages of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity inhibition during the pesticide application period. Results indicate that whistling ducks are exposed to pesticides (inhibition above 30% of AChE activity), at least during the season of intensive application. All agricultural workers are exposed to dangerous pesticides, and farmers from Suc-Tuc and Ich-Ek have a significant inhibition of AChE activity. It is recommended the use of pesticides that are less aggressive to the environment and human health.

This study aimed to elucidate the effects of chlorothalonil on biochemical biomarkers of oxidative stress in tissues of the fish Danio rerio. To achieve this, animals were exposed for 4 and 7 days, to nominal concentrations of chlorothalonil at 0 mu g/L (DMSO, 0.001%), 0.1 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L, and after the exposure period, the tissues (gills and liver) were removed for biochemical analysis. Antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and enzyme activities, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), were evaluated in both tissues. In addition, the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were also analysed. A significant increase in ROS concentration, ACAP levels, GST and GCL activities and a significant reduction of LPO levels in gills exposed to the highest concentration were observed after 4 days. However, there was a significant reduction of ACAP and CAT activity, as well as a significant increase of GST activity and LPO levels in gills exposed to the lower concentration after 7 days. The liver was less affected, presenting a significant reduction in CAT activity and LPO levels after 4 days. However, a significant increase in SOD activity and LPO levels occurred after 7 days. These results indicate that chlorothalonil, after 4 days, caused activation of the antioxidant defence system in gills of animals exposed to the highest concentration. However, after 7 days, the lowest concentration of this compound caused oxidative stress in this same organ. Also, the results show that gills were more affected than the liver, probably because gills can be involved in chlorothalonil metabolisation. Therefore, it is possible that the liver could be exposed to lower chlorothalonil concentrations or less toxic metabolites due to the metabolism taking place in the gills.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  43,10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105527     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Antioxidant defense system;Biomarkers;Fish;Fungicide;Pesticides;FUNGICIDE CHLOROTHALONIL;BIOLOGICAL-SYSTEMS;SURFACE-WATER;GLUTATHIONE;TOXICITY;2,4,5,6-TETRACHLOROISOPHTHALONITRILE;PESTICIDE;ZEBRAFISH;MECHANISM;ASSAY;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress",NA,NA,chlorothalonil causes redox state change leading to oxidative stress generation in <i>danio rerio<i>

Coastal defense structures such as breakwaters are becoming recognized as large-scale artificial reefs that support abundant and diverse marine communities and play important roles in coastal ecology and management. However, there is limited understanding of how substrate materials used to construct artificial reefs or breakwaters can influence the development of habitat-forming benthic organisms. To assess the influence of substrata on coral recruitment and overall benthic community development, we deployed standard-size tiles of materials used in the construction of break-waters and artificial reefs (concrete, gabbro, granite, and sandstone), along with terra-cotta for comparative purposes, at two breakwaters (DDD, PRT) and two natural reef sites (NR1, NR2) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, for one year. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with post-hoc Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to examine differences in coral recruitment among sites and materials. Coral recruitment was highest at the DDD (4.9 +/- 0.5 recruits 100 cm(-2)), while recruitment was low and did not differ among other sites (PRT: 0.1 +/- 0.04, NR1: 0.3 +/- 0.1, NR2: 0.1 +/- 0.03 recruits 100 cm(-2)). There were significant differences in coral recruitment among materials at DDD, where gabbro had higher recruit densities than concrete and sandstone; sandstone also contained less coral recruits than terra-cotta. Variability associated with low coral recruit densities precluded significant differences among materials at other sites. Overall benthic community structure differed more as a result of differences among sites than among substrate materials. Higher community dissimilarity was observed among sites than among material in SIMPER analysis, and significant differences were only observed among sites in ANOSIM. Univariate comparison of the benthos correlated with community differences in NMS ordination also showed significant differences among sites but not material. Overall, these results indicate that site-specific differences in recruitment patterns are more important in determining early benthic community structure and coral recruitment than are differences among substrate material. However, where coral recruitment is high, these results suggest that gabbro should be used preferentially over concrete or sandstone where it is feasible, but that granite may be a suitable alternative where it is the dominant stone.

Mercury is also delivered to these islands via global atmospheric transport, prevailing ocean currents, and biotransport by migratory species. Mercury contamination of freshwater ecosystems is poorly understood in this region. Total Hg (THg) concentrations were measured in threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) collected from eight lakes at Adak Island, an island in the center of the archipelago with a long military history.

Amphibian larvae are naturally exposed to these pesticides in their aquatic environments located within agricultural areas. We studied the effect of the carbamate carbaryl (CB) and the OP azinphos methyl (AM), compounds extensively used in Northern Patagonian agricultural areas, on reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and the activities of esterases and antioxidant enzymes of the toad Rhinella arenarum larvae. Larvae were exposed 48 h to AM 3 and 6 mg/L or CB 10 and 20 mg/L Cholinesterase and carboxylesterases were strongly inhibited by CB and AM. In insecticide-exposed larvae, carboxylesterases may serve as alternative targets protecting cholinesterase from inhibition. GSH-S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly increased by CB and AM. Superoxide dismutase activity increased in tadpoles exposed to 6 mg/L AM. Conversely, catalase (CAT) was significantly inhibited by both pesticides. GSH levels, GSH reductase and GSH peroxidase activities were not significantly affected by pesticide exposure. GST increase constitutes an important adaptive response to CB and AM exposure, as this enzyme has been related to pesticide tolerance in amphibian larvae. Besides, the ability to sustain GSH levels in spite of CAT inhibition indicates quite a good antioxidant response. In R. arenarum larvae, CAT and GST activities together with esterases could be used as biomarkers of CB and AM exposure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation of tryptophan and methionine on European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) cellular and humoral status. The immunomodulatory effects of tryptophan and methionine during an inflammatory insult was also evaluated after intraperitoneal injection with inactivated Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp).        A practical isonitrogenous (45% crude protein) and isolipidic (16% crude fat) diets was formulated to include fish meal and a blend of plant feedstuffs as protein sources and fish oil as the main lipid source (CRL diet). Two other diets were formulated similar to the control but including L-tryptophan or L-methionine at x2 the requirement level (diets TRP and MET, respectively). European seabass weighing 275 g were fed the experimental diets for a period of 15 days before being sampled (trial 1). Then, fish were subjected to a peritoneal inflammation by intraperitoneally injecting UV killed Phdp (106 colony forming units ml(-1)) and sampled following 4 and 24 h post-injection (trial 2). Fish injected with a saline solution served as control. The haematological profile, peripheral cell dynamics and several plasma immune parameters were determined in trials 1 and 2, whereas cell migration to the inflammatory focus was also determined in trial 2.        MET positively affected European seabass immune status by improving the peripheral leucocyte response, complement activity and bactericidal capacity, a stronger cellular recruitment to the inflammatory focus, and higher plasma peroxidase and bactericidal activities. TRP also seemed to improve immunostimulation, as there was a trend to augment both cell-mediated immunity and humoral capacity. However, TRP failed to improve an inflammatory response, verified by a decrease in blood phagocyte numbers and lack of immune cells recruitment. In summary, it is confirmed that MET has a pronounced influence on the innate immune response to inflammation, which is more evident than TRP, and raises its potential to incorporate in functional feeds to be used in prophylactic strategies against predictable unfavourable events.

In recent decades, the aquaculture sector has experienced a steady growth postulating as a good alternative for seafood production. However, a social debate exits about the differential level of pollutants in wild and farmed species. This study was designed to evaluate the level of pollutants in a sentinel species: Bogue (Boops boops) associated and non-associated to fish-farm cages. A total of 82 chemical substances were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, including persistent (polychlotobiphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCP5)), semi-persistent (bromodiphenyl ethers (BDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), and emerging pollutants (such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and UV-filters). In general, aquaculture-associated bogues showed lower levels of semi-persistent and emerging pollutants than wild-caught fish, especially when sums were considered. Thus, sum of BDEs was significantly lower in the aquaculture group (p = 0.01). A similar trend was also observed for benzo(a)anthracene, the UV-filter 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate and some OPFRs. In the case of persistent pollutants, the sum of dioxin-like PCBs and sum of DDTs were lower in the group of wild-caught bogues (p = 0.034 and p = 0.003, respectively) than in aquaculture-associated bogues, as previously described for some aquaculture species. Fish feed appear as an important factor in the uptake of such substances suggesting a diet intervention to reduce their levels in the aquaculture products. Another interesting result is that for almost all chemical substances analyzed, bogues captured near sewage outfalls showed the highest levels of pollutants, pointing out the need of stringent measures for wastewater treatment units discharging in coastal areas. On the light of these results, further research in specific farmed and wild fish species in relation to their dietary value and pollutant's levels seems to be mandatory.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  82,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.12.107     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Aquaculture;Persistent organic pollutants;Emerging pollutants;Organophosphorus flame retardants;Sunscreen;Chlorpyrifos;POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS;POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS;ORGANOPHOSPHORUS FLAME RETARDANTS;FARMED ATLANTIC SALMON;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS;ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES;ORGANIC POLLUTANTS;SEA-TURTLES;HALOGENATED COMPOUNDS;AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT;Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia,NA,NA,comparative analysis of selected semipersistent and emerging pollutants in wildcaught fish and aquaculture associated fish using bogue <i>boops boops<i> as sentinel species

Although the regulon that these factors control is known in many bacteria, similar data are not available for Klebsiella pneumoniae. To address this data gap, oxidative stress was artificially induced in K. pneumoniae MGH78578 using paraquat and the corresponding oxidative stress regulon recorded using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). The soxS gene was significantly induced during oxidative stress, and a knockout mutant was constructed to explore its functionality. The wild type and mutant were grown in the presence of paraquat and subjected to RNA-seq to elucidate the soxS regulon in K. pneumoniae MGH78578. Genes that are commonly regulated both in the oxidative stress and soxS regulons were identified and denoted as the oxidative SoxS regulon; these included a group of genes specifically regulated by SoxS. Efflux pump-encoding genes and global regulators were identified as part of this regulon. Consequently, the isogenic soxS mutant was found to exhibit a reduction in the minimum bactericidal concentration against tetracycline compared to that of the wild type. Impaired efflux activity, allowing tetracycline to be accumulated in the cytoplasm to bactericidal levels, was further evaluated using a tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP1) accumulation assay. The soxS mutant was also susceptible to tetracycline in vivo in a zebrafish embryo model. We conclude that the soxS gene could be considered a genetic target against which an inhibitor could be developed and used in combinatorial therapy to combat infections associated with multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae.

Azinphos-methyl has been found in water from this region throughout the year at a maximum concentration of 22.48 mu g L-1 during the application period. Toxicological studies on local non-target species have been performed mostly on vertebrates, while mollusks, which could be more sensitive, have not been studied so far. This work aims to characterize cholinesterase (ChE) and carboxilesterase (CE) activities of Chilina gibbosa, a freshwater gastropod native to southern Argentina and Chile. These enzymes, together with neurotoxicity signals, are evaluated herein after as sensitive biomarkers of exposure to azinphos-methyl at environmentally relevant concentrations. Effects of azinphos-methyl on antioxidant defenses: glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) are also studied in order to complete a set of biomarkers with different sensitivity and specificity, to propose C. gibbosa as a sentinel species. The highest specific activity was obtained with acetylthiocholine as substrate, followed by propionylthiocholine (83% in comparison to acetylthiocholine) and butyrylthiocholine (19%). The lowest K-m and the highest efficiency for ChE were obtained with acetylthiocholine. Regarding CEs activities, a higher efficiency was obtained with p-nitrophenyl butyrate than with p-nitrophenyl acetate. Eserine produced significant inhibition of ChE activity (81% with 0.001 mM and 98% with 1 mM) while iso-OMPA did not produce any significant effect on ChE. Our results show that C. gibbosa ChE is very sensitive to azinphos-methyl (CI50 0.02 mu g L-1) while CEs are inhibited at higher concentrations (CI50 1000 mu g L-1). CEs have been reported to be more sensitive to OPs than ChEs in most of the aquatic invertebrates protecting the organisms from neurotoxic effects. In contrast, C gibbosa, has ChE which are much more sensitive to azinphos-methyl than CEs and shows marked signs of neurotoxicity. Regarding antioxidant defenses, GSH levels were significantly increased by 0.02 and 20 mu g L-1 azinphos-methyl (80 and 103%, respectively), CAT activity was increased 85% only at 0.02 mu g L-1 and SOD and GST did not show any significant response. Since ChE activity, neurotoxicity signs, GSH and CAT are sensitive biomarkers of acute exposure to azinphos-methyl at environmental concentrations C. gibbosa could be included as sentinel species in monitoring programs of pesticide hazard in regions of Argentina and Chile.

Debates regarding the need to control aquatic plants, how Much vegetation to control and where, and the herbicides chosen can be divisive. This paper will focus on the use patterns and technical features of aquatic herbicides and factors that Should be considered when implementing a herbicide program for aquatic plant management in reservoirs. Both the angling community and general public often have misconceptions regarding herbicide use patterns, plant selectivity and nontarget impacts, and management objectives. There are currently 10 herbicide active ingredients registered for aquatic use. Glyphosate and imazapyr are used strictly for emergent aquatic plant control while copper, endothall, and fluridone are used almost exclusively for submersed plant control. The herbicides diquat, carfentrazone, penoxsulam, triclopyr, and 2,4-D are used for both emergent and submersed plant control. Many of the registered herbicides have been used since the 1950s and 1960s for aquatic plant management. Each compound has unique properties that impact the recommended use rates and use patterns, label restrictions, and plant selectivity. There are also several new herbicides that are Currently being evaluated for aquatic plants. While herbicides are used in a wide variety of aquatic systems, reservoirs often present unique challenges due to high-flow events and vegetation growing in narrow strips along the shoreline or in open flats. Rapid dilution or dispersion of the herbicide from the target area remains a significant technical challenge in reservoirs. The introduction of invasive plants Such as hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata and Eurasian watermilfoil Myriophyllum spicatum has increased the complexity of management decisions. These fast-growing submersed species can be viewed as both beneficial and detrimental to various reservoir systems. While some see these plants as invasive species that require management, others see them as providing valuable habitat in systems with limited native vegetation. Despite both social and environmental challenges, aquatic herbicides continue to provide reliable, relatively rapid results and site-specific aquatic plant management at a wide variety of scales.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  55,,SPECIES SELECTIVITY EVALUATION;LAKE FLURIDONE TREATMENTS;EURASIAN WATERMILFOIL;LARGEMOUTH BASS;POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS;MESOCOSM EVALUATION;PLANT COMMUNITY;ENDOTHALL;SEMINOLE;HYDRILLA;Vegetables,NA,NA,the use of herbicides for managing aquatic vegetation in southern reservoirs

The experiment was conducted randomly with two treatments: control and TCF (0.5 mg L-1). No mortality or changes in hematological profile were recorded for the fish. On the other hand, we found that TCF exposure caused behavioral, metabolic and hormonal changes that modified the response patterns of the immune and enzymatic defense system in muscle and liver tissues. Increased plasma cortisol and glucose combined with the reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle and liver tissue after 96-h of TCF exposure indicates chemical stress. In response to this harmful situation, we observed changes in the immune system that lead to an increased number of leukocytes, thrombocytes, monocytes, lysozyme and leukocyte respiratory burst activity. Furthermore, we associate the increased activity of glutathione-S-transferase in liver tissue as a strategy fish use to combat the effects of TCF. Thus, we conclude that TCF affects the physiologic parameters of Nile tilapia, which can generate irreversible situations of recovery of the clinical condition. Such fact highlights the need to search for new compounds that could replace TCF, that have no or few adverse effects on fish species.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.22034/IAR.2020.1904943.1071     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Aquaculture;Toxicology;Chemotherapy;Trichlorfon;LEUKOCYTES RESPIRATORY BURST;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;OXIDATIVE STRESS;INNATE IMMUNITY;COMMON CARP;FISH;DIAZINON;GLUTATHIONE;LYSOZYME;AQUACULTURE,NA,NA,physiological and biochemical responses of nile tilapia <i>oreochromis niloticus<i> to acute trichlorfon exposure

Four mechanistic models, including biomass conversion, digestion or gastrointestinal magnification, micelle-mediated diffusion, and fat-flush diffusion, are evaluated. The models contain many similarities and represent an evolution in understanding of chemical bioaccumulation processes. An important difference between the biomagnification models is whether intestinal absorption of an ingested contaminant occurs solely via passive molecular diffusion through serial resistances or via facilitated diffusion that incorporates an additional advective transport mechanism in parallel (i.e., molecular ferrying within gastrointestinal micelles). This difference has an effect on the selection of physicochemical properties that best anticipate the bioaccumulative potential of commercial chemicals in aquatic and terrestrial food chains. Current regulatory initiatives utilizing K-OW threshold criteria to assess chemical bioaccumulation potential are shown to be unable to identify certain bioaccumulative substances in air-breathing animals.

Our objectives were to: (1) characterize littoral zone macroinvertebrate communities in surface mine lakes; (2) identify factors that influence macroinvertebrate diversity and community structure; and (3) examine the utility of some commonly used bioassessment metrics to assess habitat quality based on macroinvertebrates. Fourteen lakes on a 1133 ha parcel in southern Illinois were sampled in spring 2003 using a dip net that was swept over two (small lakes) or three (large lakes) littoral zone transects. Three hundred macroinvertebrates were randomly removed from each sample and identified. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to examine relationships between several physicochemical and biological variables and macroinvertebrates. Oligochaetes were typically the most abundant taxon, followed by Hyalella, Chironomidae, Physella and Caenis. Seventy percent of the macroinvertebrates collected from the lakes were predators, while collector-gatherers and scrapers constituted 20% and 9%, respectively. Macroinvertebrate richness was positively related to sunfish abundance and macrophyte cover (R-2 = 0.91, P = 0.001). Simpson diversity was positively related to lake area, percent rock and gravel substrates and simazine concentration and negatively related to bank slope and transparency (R-2 = 0.92, P = 0.0003). Richness and diversity metrics, % Oligochaeta, % Chironomidae, % insect taxa and % dominance varied across lakes, while a Hilsenhoff index and the EPT index appeared less useful for biological assessments in these habitats.

Currently, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying E. piscicida-host cross-talk remain obscure. In this study, we revealed that E. piscicida could increase microtubule-associated protein L chain 3 (LC3) puncta in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) monocytes/macrophages and a carp cell line, Epithelioma papulosum cyprini. The autophagic response was confirmed by detecting the colocalization of E. piscicida with LC3-positive autophagosomes and LysoTracker-probed lysosomes in the cells. Moreover, we unveiled the autophagic machinery targeting E. piscicida by which the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptor 1 (NOD1) functioned as an intracellular sensor to interact and recruit autophagy-related gene (ATG) 16L1 to the bacteria. Meanwhile, E. piscicida decreased the mRNA and protein levels of NOD1 and ATG16L1 in an estrogen-related receptora-dependent manner, suggesting a possible mechanism for this bacterium escaping autophagy. Subsequently, we examined the effects of various E. piscicida virulence factors on NOD1 expression and found that two of them, EVPC and ESCB, could reduce NOD1 protein expression via ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, an intrinsic regulator IFN-gamma was found to enhance the colocalization of E. piscicida with NOD1 or autophagosomes, suggesting its involvement in the interaction between autophagy and E. piscicida. Along this line, a short-time treatment of IFN-gamma caused intracellular E. piscicida clearance through an autophagy-dependent mechanism.

In previous studies we have demonstrated the importance of the glutathione (GSH) metabolism in the resistance of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) to thiocarbamate herbicides. The present work studied the effects of the antioxidant and glutathione pro-drug N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) on the survival of a natural population of A. anguilla exposed to a lethal concentration of dichlorvos, focusing on the glutathione metabolism and the enzyme activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and caspase-3 as biomarkers of neurotoxicity and induction of apoptosis, respectively. Fish pre-treated with NAC (I mmol kg(-1), i.p.) and exposed to 1.5 mg l(-1) (the 96-h LC85) of dichlorvos for 96 It in a static-renewal system achieved an increase of the GSH content, GSH/GSSG ratio, hepatic glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutamate:cysteine ligase (GCL), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (gammaGT) activities, which ameliorated the glutathione loss and oxidation, and enzyme inactivation, caused by the OP pesticide. Although NAC-treated fish presented a higher survival and were two-fold less likely to die within the study period of 96 h, Cox proportional hazard models showed that hepatic GSH/GSSG ratio was the best explanatory variable related to survival. Hence, tolerance to a lethal concentration of dichlorvos can be explained by the individual capacity to maintain and improve the hepatic glutathione redox status. Impairment of the,GSH/GSSG ratio can lead to excessive oxidative stress and inhibition of caspase-3-like activity, inducing cell death by necrosis, and, ultimately, resulting in the death of the organism. We therefore propose a reconsideration of the individual effective dose or individual tolerance concept postulated by Gaddum 50 years ago for the log-normal dose-response relationship. In addition, as NAC increased the tolerance to dichlorvos, it could be a potential antidote for OP poisoning, complementary to current treatments. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Non-specific humoral factors include growth inhibiting substances, e.g. transferrin and antiproteases; lysins, e.g. lysozyme, C-reactive protein (CRP), bactericidal peptides and most importantly, complement which has lytic, proinflammatory, chemotactic and opsonic activities thus making a link with non-specific phagocyte responses. These are primarily executed by neutrophils and macrophages. The phagocytes contain many hydrolytic enzymes and when stimulated by bacteria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the hydroxyl radical, via generation of superoxide anions and nitric oxide. ROS are highly bactericidal. In addition, the neutrophils possess large quantities of myeloperoxidase (MPO) which generates bactericidal hypohalite ions from halide ions and H2O2. Macrophages can receive MPO from neutrophils and this may enhance their bactericidal activity. Antibody constitutes a specific humoral defence by inhibiting bacterial adherence or invasion of non-phagocytic host cells and neutralising bacterial toxins. Antibody can act as an opsonin and by activating complement by the classical pathway may lyse the bacterial cell, activate inflammation, phagocyte influx and further enhance phagocytosis. Macrophage bactericidal activity can be markedly increased by cytokines released by T lymphocytes on contact with their specific antigen. Pathogenic bacteria have evolved many ways of subverting these defence mechanisms of fish. These include the in vivo production of high affinity iron uptake systems (e.g. siderophores and their surface receptors, in Aeromonas salmonicida, Vibrio anguillarum). Some bacteria e.g. V. anguillarum strains of serotype 01, while being resistant to the alternative pathway of complement activation in normal serum, are killed in immune serum. In other bacteria, surface layers, capsules and elongated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 0-antigens protect against classical complement-mediated killing (e.g. A. salmonicida, Photobacterium piscicida, V. anguillarum serotype 02 respectively). While some important pathogens (e.g. P. piscicide)are readily killed by macrophages, others (A. salmonicida) possess specialised superoxide dismutase and catalase to resist ROS and are toxic themselves to macrophages. Renibacterium salmoninarum uses antibody, complement and other serum components to activate the respiratory burst of macrophages on immediate contact thus exhausting this macrophage bactericidal mechanism before the bacterium is phagocytosed. Subsequently, R, salmoninarum is taken up by the macrophage where it multiplies as an intracellular pathogen. However, these two highly adapted pathogens, A. salmonicida and R. salmoninarum are both killed by activated macrophages indicating that the whole concerted efforts of specific and non-specific, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are required for immunity against these two important pathogens.

In gills MDA increased showing oxidative damage probably because of an inefficient antioxidant defense. This response evidenced the important role of gills as an organ of direct contact with waterborne contaminants.

Both compounds are nonionic surfactants produced by the alkoxylation of ethylene oxide with tallow amine, and they are used in variety of industries such as textiles, paints, metal working, agriculture, and polish manufacture. Fish were exposed to six concentrations of TA15 (0.2-4.0 mg/L) or TH30 (8-140 mg/L) for 96 h. The LC50 for TA15 was 2.08 mg/L and for TH30 47.32 mg/L. The main clinical signs observed in fish exposed to 4 mg/L of TA15 and 32 to 140 mg/L of TH30, were lethargy, loss of shoaling behavior, respiratory distress, changes in swimming pattern, such as, loss of balance and abnormal buoyancy, prolapse of the lower lip and superior location in the water column. The highest concentrations of these compounds induced nervous signs and collapse. The relevant macroscopic lesions were skin and fins erosions with necrotic lysis of the caudal peduncle. In addition, hemorrhages in mouth, branchial arches, and petechial hemorrhages in skin were observed. An increased fluid in the celomic cavity and meningeal hemorrhages were also evident. Organs as gills, liver, brain, and anterior kidney presented severe lesions at the highest concentrations of each compound. For the first time, it is reported lesions in interrenal tissues and choroidal bodies, as well as severe telencephalic lesions associated with the POEA toxicity. These last lesions were more severe in fish exposed to TA15 than to TH30, although the pattern of injuries was similar with both substances. According to the Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemical (GHS) by the United Nations, we reported that TA15 is classified as Acute Category 2 and TH30 is Acute Category 3 for white cachama.

The gills of the fish are the primary corridor for molecular exchange between the internal milieu of a fish and its environment. Gills perform numerous functions such as oxygen uptake and CO excretion, osmoregulation, acid-basic balance, excretion of nitrogenous compounds and taste. Hazardous chemicals present in water may alter the morphology of the epithelial cells of gills of the fish, which may affect the process of diffusion of gases and ultimately the overall health of the fish. To prove this fact Cyprinus carpio communis Linn. was kept in water for 30 days having low concentration of 0.038 ppm (1\10(th) of LC50) of monocrotophos and an attempt was made to study the different types of degenerations produced in the epithelial cells of gills as compared to the normal epithelial cells of gills of this culturable fish using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) technique. The ultrastructural changes due to the toxic exposure at finerscale were thinning of microridges, upliftment of epithelial cells, development of hyperplasia, decrease in the density of mucous cells which are considered to be the first line of defence and total dystrophy of epithelial tissue. Thus, it is opined that a low concentration of monocrotophos has the potential to bring different type of degenerations at finer scale hence affecting the fish's health drastically and altering the fitness of the fish in water even having insignificant amount of this toxicant in the ambient water.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  20,,Cyprinus carpio communis Linn.;epithelial cells;gills;monocrotophos;SEM;FRESH-WATER FISH;CHLORPYRIFOS;Epithelial Cells,NA,NA,impact of low dose of organophosphate monocrotophos on the epithelial cells of gills of <i>cyprinus carpio communis<i> linn sem study

Basic information on the developmental and reproductive performance of the predator as a function of food is largely lacking. In the present study, development, reproduction and growth rates were determined for A. limonicus on four economically important pests: Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), broad mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) (Acari: Tarsonemidae) and two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). The life history traits of females fed on these different target prey were compared with those of females offered Carpoglyphus lactis L. (Acari: Carpoglyphidae), which is the standard food source for mass-producing this predator. Additionally, three commercially available non-prey food sources with potential for use in the mass production or as supplementary food to sustain populations of the predator in the field were tested: the commercial pollen product Nutrimite (consisting of pollen of narrow-leaved cattail, Typha angustifolia L.), frozen eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and frozen eggs of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann (Diptera: Tephritidae). Survival rates of immature A. limonicus were high (>94% survival) on all tested foods except on T. vaporariorum and T. urticae (76.0% and 17.1%, respectively). The fastest development was obtained when mites were fed on T. angustifolia, whereas the longest developmental times were obtained on T. urticae and T. vaporariorum. When females were offered P. latus, no reproduction was observed, despite a high prey consumption in both the juvenile and adult stages. The reproductive performance of A. limonicus fed on T. vaporariorum was significantly lower than that on F. occidentalis. Furthermore, no second generation could be obtained on a diet solely consisting of T. vaporariorum. Population growth rates were highest when A. limonicus was fed on Nutrimite, E. kuehniella or C lactis, and exceeded those on a diet consisting of their natural prey, F. occidentalis. The phytoseiid showed cannibalistic behavior when maintained on E. kuehniella and C. capitata eggs and T. angustifolia pollen, with females consuming their own eggs. The rate of cannibalism was dependent on the food source offered, but always resulted in reduced population growth rates. This cannibalistic behavior should be taken into account when selecting food sources for mass rearing of A. limonicus or supporting its populations in the field. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Oxidative stress in other organisms is associated with aging as well as with periods of rapid growth, which occurs in young brown trout. We measured protein carbonyls, 20S proteosome activity and glutathione (GSH) levels in farmed Salmo trutta in four different age groups from 5 months to 3 years. We found an increase in protein carbonyls and a decrease in 20S proteosome activity in both brain and liver tissues of the fish with increasing size and age. Total GSH levels in liver tissue declined as fish aged and the GSSG:GSH ratio increased. Five month and 1 year old trout were treated with paraquat (PQ) to induce oxidative stress. Five month old fish showed no changes in the measured parameters while 1 year old fish had both an increase in protein carbonylation in liver tissue and a decrease in 20S proteosome activity in brain tissue. These results indicate that oxidative stress biomarkers are affected by age or rapid growth in brown trout, and that individuals of different ages respond differently to oxidative stress induced by PQ.

A synthetic pyrethroid, cypermethrin, is licensed for use on fish farms to control sea lice infestations as a formulation called Excis((R)). In this study, uptake of cypermethrin from Exci((R)) exposure is investigated through the use of gas chromatography with mass-spectrometry. The effects of Excis((R)) on mussels are also examined by measuring the neutral red retention time of lysosomes, aerial survival and shell closure. The isomeric ratios of cis:trans cypermethrin measured in mussels are around 80:20; a marked increase from 40:60 to which the mussels were exposed. This is most likely due to preferential metabolism of trans-isomers, as the same response is seen in vertebrates. There is a pronounced behavioural effect of shell closure, where mussels exposed to 1000 mug/l cypermethrin shut their shells within an hour of exposure. Arguments are presented for this effect being either a voluntary response on recognition of cypermethrin, or an effect arising from an involuntary action of cypermethrin on the adductor muscle. Even at 1000 mug/l cypermethrin, neutral red retention time and aerial survival are not affected. The data suggest that the responses of mussels shown here are unlikely to occur in the field, even at the concentrations of cypermethrin used in fish cages, for the treatment of sea lice.

Methods This review draws on research projects conducted in partnership with the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation living along the St. Lawrence River as well as published research by others on water contamination at Akwesasne. Quantitative and qualitative methods including toxicological and epidemiological methods, surveys, and ethnographic studies are included. Results Pollution of a river with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) contaminated local fish, a major, traditional, food source. Following health advisories to avoid consuming local fish, consumption and PCB levels decreased. PCB levels were negatively associated with health outcomes. In adolescents, higher PCB levels were associated with advanced sexual maturation in females, reduced testosterone in males and reduced thyroxine levels in young adults. Avoiding fish consumption altered traditional dietary patterns and social interactions, generational transmission of knowledge, and relations between generations, all of which impacted cultural forms and may have added to the perceived injustices in this Native American community. Items substituted for fish may have contributed to increasing rates of obesity as well.

The main goal of our study was to evaluate if variations in the water quality of Suquia river basin affect the reproductive biology of Cnesterodon decemmaculatus and determine if the responses provided by the species can be considered as biomarkers of river quality. This assessment was performed through the measurement of morphological, histological and somatic parameters in adult males collected at four sampling sites during the beginning and the end of the breeding season. The water quality evaluation carried out through the estimation of a water quality index (WQI) and pesticides concentrations in water, revealed a pollution gradient along the studied basin. The same variation pattern was registered for the somatic index. In addition, the analysis of the morphology of the male copulatory organ (gonopodium) showed that individuals collected at Cordoba city had the lowest Gonopodium-Somatic Index (Gonop-SI) value, while those sampled at the most polluted site showed abnormalities in the small structures of the gonopodium. On the other hand, few histological alterations were found in the liver whereas no alterations were found in gonads along the river. The results obtained allowed us to characterize the environmental conditions of the studied basin and demonstrated the water quality deterioration along the Suquia River. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The lack of research into simultaneous use of antibiotic and immunomodulation in the Acipenseridae has created the need for effective methods of prevention and treatment of the diseases affecting these species, especially in relation to intensive rearing and breeding with adapted technologies. The Siberian sturgeons administered oxytetracycline intraperitoneally @ 100 mg/kg BW and 24 hours post-injection the fish were immersed in lysozyme dimer @ 100 mu g/l water for 30 minutes. The impact of oxytetracycline used together with or separately from lysozyme dimer on the morphology of head kidney in Siberian sturgeon was determined. The results of microscopic evaluation of this organ revealed the formation of morphological lesions resulting from the administration of the antibiotic: hyperaemia and regressive lesions in the epithelium of renal tubules - parenchymatous and vacuolar degeneration, necrosis and hyaline casts in the lumen of renal tubules. The domination of hematopoietic cells over lymphocytes, necrosis of hematopoietic cells, proliferation of lymphoid cells, presence of melano-macrophages and less-frequent macrophages were observed.

Although sophisticated techniques such as chromatography and spectrometry provide more accurate and conclusive results, screening tests allow a much higher throughput of samples at a lower cost and with less operator training, so larger numbers of samples can be analysed. Biosensors combine a biological recognition element (enzyme, antibody, receptor) with a transducer to produce a measurable signal proportional to the extent of interaction between the recognition element and the analyte. The different uses of the biosensing instrumentation available today are extremely varied, with food analysis as an emerging and growing application. The advantages offered by biosensors over other screening methods such as radioimmunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, fluorescence immunoassay and luminescence immunoassay, with respect to food analysis, include automation, improved reproducibility, speed of analysis and real-time analysis. This article will provide a brief footing in history before reviewing the latest developments in biosensor applications for analysis of food contaminants (January 2007 to December 2010), focusing on the detection of pathogens, toxins, pesticides and veterinary drug residues by biosensors, with emphasis on articles showing data in food matrices. The main areas of development common to these groups of contaminants include multiplexing, the ability to simultaneously analyse a sample for more than one contaminant and portability.

Tritici) are two of the most prevalent and serious winter wheat diseases in the field, which caused heavy yield loss of winter wheat all over the world. It is necessary to quantitatively identify different diseases for spraying specific fungicides. This study examined the potential of quantitative distinction of powdery mildew and yellow rust by using hyperspectral data with continuous wavelet transform at canopy level. Spectral normalization was processing prior to other data analysis, given the differences of the groups in cultivars and soil environment. Then, continuous wavelet features were extracted from normalized spectral bands using continuous wavelet transform. Correlation analysis and independent t-test were used conjunctively to obtain sensitive spectral bands and continuous wavelet features of 350~1 300 nm, and then, principal component analysis was done to eliminate the redundancy of the spectral features. After that, Fisher linear discriminant models of powdery mildew, stripe rust and normal sample were built based on the principal components of SBs, WFs, and the combination of SBs & WFs, respectively. Finally, the methods of leave-one-out and 55 samples which have no share in model building were used to validate the models. The accuracies of classification were analyzed, it was indicated that the overall accuracies with 92.7% and 90.4% of the models based on WFs, were superior to those of SFs with 65.5% and 61.5%; However, the classification accuracies of Fisher 80-55 were higher but no different than leave-one-out cross validation model, which was possibly related to randomness of training samples selection. The overall accuracies with 94.6% and 91.1% of the models based on SBs & WFs were the highest; The producer' accuracies of powdery mildew and healthy samples based on SBs & WFs were improved more than 10% than those of WFs in Fisher 80-55. Focusing on the discriminant accuracy of different disease, yellow rust can be discriminated in the model based on both WFs and SBs & WFs with higher accuracy; the user' accuracy and producer' accuracy were all up to 100%. The results show great potential of continuous wavelet features in discriminating different disease stresses, and provide theoretical basis for crop disease identification in wide range using remote sensing image. © 2016, Peking University Press.

Specifically, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has the third highest estimated burden of foodborne diseases per population, after the African and South-East Asia regions. However, it is difficult to determine what the burden is since little is published in peer-reviewed journals or government reports for public access. This chapter reviews 16 autonomous nations, namely, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia (KSA), Syrian Arab Republic (Syria), United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen. Countries range in size from Bahrain with 1.8 million inhabitants to Pakistan with a population of 184 million. Agriculture and local food production is much influenced by water availability for irrigation. Water shortages are most severe in the Gulf countries which rely on aquifers, desalination, and recycled waste water for most of their water supplies. This means that most food is imported which is expensive if not subsidized through petrodollars. This impacts food security which is a particular concern in countries under conflict, particularly, Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Gastrointestinal infections are frequent in this region from Salmonella Typhi and other Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, rotavirus, hepatitis A virus, parasites, and more rarely from Aeromonas, Yersinia enterocolitica, Brucella spp., and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Reports indicate that children are the most susceptible and that many isolates are multidrug resistant. Chemical contamination of water supplies and crops are probably more of a concern than published reports indicate, because of widespread indiscriminate use of fertilizers, antibiotics, and pesticides, coupled with increased industrial pollution affecting the water supplies. Like many other parts of the developing world, foodborne disease surveillance is limited and outbreaks are most often reported through the Press but with insufficient detail to determine the etiological agents and the factors contributing to the outbreaks, leading to speculation to the cause by those interested or responsible for food prevention and control. However, there are some well investigated outbreaks in the region that have those details, and reveal where the shortcomings of both the establishments and the inspection systems have been. Where the causative agents are known, the kinds of pathogens are generally similar to those found in the West, e.g., Salmonella, but many outbreaks seem to have short incubation periods that point to a toxin of some kind of chemical or biological origin, but these are almost never identified. Because of sectarian warfare, residents and refugees have been given food that has made them sick and solders? have been deliberately poisoned. Research has been focused on microbial contamination of locally-sold foodstuffs and manager and employee knowledge of food safety and hygienic conditions in food preparation establishments. An innovative pilot project in Qatar is to use seawater and sunlight for raising crops through the Sahara Forest Project. All countries have some kind of food establishment inspection system, but they tend to be punitive if faults are found in management or employees on the premises rather than being used for their education for improving food safety. Restaurants may be closed down and owners and employees fined for often unspecified infringements. However, some food control agents are moving towards employee training through seminars and courses before problems occur, which is a good disease prevention strategy. Unfortunately, many of the food handlers are from Asian countries with languages other than Arabic and English, which makes effective food safety communication and training difficult. Tourists visiting popular resorts in Turkey and Egypt have suffered from foodborne illnesses, usually of unknown origin but poor hygienic conditions are blamed with law suits following, and the adverse publicity affects the long-term viability of some of these resorts. Food exports, important for local economies, have occasionally been contaminated resulting in recalls and sometimes illnesses and deaths, notably fenugreek seeds from Egypt (E. coli O104:H4), pomegranate arils from Turkey (hepatitis A virus), and tahini from Lebanon (Salmonella). Overall, in recent decades, the Middle East has made strides towards improving food safety for both residents and foreign visitors or ex-pat workers. However, within the countries there are large discrepancies in the extent of effective public health oversight including food safety and food security. Currently, almost all of the countries are involved to a greater or lesser extent in the civil wars in Syria and Yemen, or are affected through political tensions and strife in Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Turkey.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate POPs burden, and its determinants, in a population at high risk of suffering CVD enrolled in the PREDIMED Study (Spanish acronym for PREvention by means of MEDiterranean Diet). This cohort was formed by 343 participants (55–80 y.o.), which were selected for a preventive nutritional intervention for CVD based on the Mediterranean Diet. Relevant information on demographic, behavioral, dietary, and socioeconomic characteristics was obtained from each participant through a specific questionnaire, and their anthropometric and clinical measurements were recorded. In addition, the levels of 35 POPs were determined in serum samples taken before the beginning of the nutritional intervention. All the samples showed detectable levels of, at least, one POP, being DDT-derivatives and marker-PCBs the most frequently detected compounds. Our results showed that people at high risk for CVD showed a higher level of contamination by POPs as compared to other studies done in cohorts of Western people at no special risk of CVD. Although educational level seems to be a relevant determinant for POPs burden in our population, the main determining factor seems to be the diet. Thus, while the intake of food of animal origin was significantly associated with levels of PCBs, especially in men, the intake of vegetal-origin food was positively related to levels of organochlorine pesticides, indicating a different dietary source for these two groups of chemicals. Our results showing that subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease present elevated POPs burden might have a relevant public health impact given the generalized and difficult to avoid exposure to POPs and the elevated worldwide frequency of the CVD. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 29; CODEN: ENVRA,10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.053,"Canary Islands;Cardiovascular disease;Dietary habits;Persistent organic pollutants;PREDIMED;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cardiovascular Diseases;Diet, Mediterranean;Environmental Exposure;Environmental Pollutants;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Risk;Spain;Animalia;1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethane;1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene;1,1,1 trichloro 2 (2 chlorophenyl) 2 (4 chlorophenyl)ethane;aldrin;alpha hexachlorocyclohexane;beta hexachlorocyclohexane;chlorphenotane;cholesterol;delta hexachlorocyclohexane;dieldrin;endosulfan;endrin;gama hexachlorocyclohexane;hexachlorobencene;hexachlorobenzene;hexachlorocyclohexane;mitotane;o,p' dde;olive oil;organochlorine derivative;organochlorine pesticide;polychlorinated biphenyl derivative;triacylglycerol;unclassified drug;pollutant;cardiovascular disease;demography;diet;disease incidence;food intake;health impact;health risk;persistent organic pollutant;public health;questionnaire survey;serum;adult;aged;anthropometry;Article;bakery product;biscuit;blood level;cardiovascular risk;cereal;cholesterol blood level;clinical evaluation;cohort analysis;controlled study;dairy product;dietary intake;educational status;female;fish product;fruit;high risk population;human;legume;major clinical study;male;meat;Mediterranean diet;middle aged;multicenter study (topic);nut;primary prevention;priority journal;quality control;randomized controlled trial (topic);sex difference;smoking;social status;triacylglycerol blood level;vegetable;wine;blood;chemically induced;environmental exposure;risk;very elderly",NA,NA,determinants of increasing serum pops in a population at high risk for cardiovascular disease results from the predimedcanarias study

Simultaneously, attention is drawn to infectious or environmental threats against which appropriately composed immunoprophylaxis can be used in production cycles. Fish culture is intensifying in Poland and globally, which means that the role of prevention and well-designed prophylaxis is of increasing significance to the prevention and treatment of fish diseases. Currently, 33 fish species are cultured in Poland as stocking material or for production. The primary methods for preventing diseases in controlled fish culture are ensuring the welfare of fish and other prophylactic methods, including immunoprophylaxis. Many infectious and non-infectious threats that can cause direct losses and limit fish culture are present in the aquatic environment. Fish diseases generally stem from the simultaneous action of many factors that coincide and are difficult to distinguish. Pesticides (organochlorine insecticides, organophosphorus herbicides), aromatic hydrocarbons, pentachlorophenol, heavy metals, and chemotherapeutics are particularly toxic to fish. Biodegradation, which is continual in aquatic environments, is a process by which toxic and other substances that negatively affect fish become bioavailable and impact the immune system, the functioning of which is a specific bioindicator of environmental quality. Innate immunity plays a key role in the defense against disadvantageous factors, which also include pathogens. Immunomodulation methods can protect resistance mechanisms, thereby increasing disease prevention and treatment in controlled fish culture. © 2016 Author(s). © Copyright by Stanisław Sakowicz Inland Fisheries Institute in Olsztyn.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: E.

Females exposed to Thiodan® were divided into four treatments: (i) without acclimation and without food, (ii) without acclimation and with food, (iii) with acclimation for 10 days and without food; (iv) with acclimation for 10 days and with food. In this study, it was noted that the action of Thiodan® at sub-lethal concentrations in a static system did not affect the morphology of follicular development. However, the treatments with acclimation showed lower numbers of primary and secondary follicles when compared to fish from treatments without acclimation. For the groups exposed to Thiodan®, a greater number of atretic follicles were observed compared to the control groups. The follicular diameter of secondary follicles in fish exposed to Thiodan® in the treatment with acclimation and with food was highest in the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the mean gonadosomatic (GSI) and hepatosomatic (HSI) indices of treatments with acclimation were lower than those for treatments without acclimation.

South Africa is also one of few countries to still actively spray DDT as malaria vector control. The aim of the study was to determine the degree to which aquatic biota in selected rivers of the world renowned Kruger National Park (KNP) are exposed to by use of OCPs in the catchments outside the KNP and how this exposure relates to human health. Tigerfish (Hydrocynus vittatus) are economically important apex predators and was selected as bioindicator for this study. Fish were sampled from the KNP sections of the Luvuvhu, Letaba and Olifants rivers during the high and low flow periods from 2010 to 2011 within the KNP and 19 OCPs were determined in muscle tissue using GC-ECD techniques. Significant flow related and spatial OCP bioaccumulation was observed. Tigerfish from the Luvuvhu River displayed the highest OCP bioaccumulation. Concentrations of the majority of the OCPs including the DDTs were the highest levels ever recorded from South African freshwater systems and in many cases the concentrations were higher than most contaminated areas from around the world. The concentrations found in H. vittatus muscle also exceeded maximum residue levels in edible fat as set by the European Union. The health risk assessment also demonstrated that the levels of OCPs pose very high cancer risks to the local populations consuming tigerfish, as high as 2 in 10 increased risk factor. This is of concern not only when managing the water resources of the conservation area but also for surrounding communities consuming freshwater fish.

The most commonly seen DHL is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with t(14;18) and t(8;14) or t(8;22) resulting in overexpression of BCL2 and MYC, respectively. The increased proliferation due to MYC overexpression, without the ability for an apoptotic brake as a result of BCL2 overexpression, results in ‘the perfect storm of oncogenesis’. Thus this disease presents a number of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for the hematologist. The first and foremost challenge is to recognize the DHL. As different morphological entities can be affected it is incumbent on pathologists and clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion especially in disease that appears unusually aggressive or refractory to therapy. Diagnosis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a sensitive and specific method for detection of the disease but is time-consuming and expensive. While detection by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is sensitive and correlates with survival, standardized methods for this are not widely agreed upon. The second and equally important challenge in DHL is optimizing clinical outcome in a group of patients for whom the prognosis is widely regarded as poor. While improvements have been achieved by dose escalating standard chemotherapeutic regimens, many patients continue to do badly. Furthermore as a disease of aging many patients are unsuitable for dose-intensive chemotherapy regimens. There are now multiple novel targeted agents in various stages of clinical development that offer hope for better outcomes without undue toxicity. Among the most exciting of these developments include specific inhibitors of both BCL2 and MYC. © 2015, © The Author(s), 2015.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 17; Correspondence Address: M.A. Anderson; The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, 1G Royal Parade, 3052, Australia; email: manderson@wehi.edu.au",10.1177/2040620715608091,"BCL-2;diffuse large B-cell lymphoma;double hit lymphoma;MYC;4 (4 chlorophenyl) 2,3,9 trimethyl 6h thieno[3,2 f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3 a][1,4]diazepine 6 acetic acid tert butyl ester;4 [4 (4' chloro 2 biphenylylmethyl) 1 piperazinyl] n [4 [3 dimethylamino 1 (phenylthiomethyl)propylamino] 3 nitrobenzenesulfonyl]benzamide;6 (4 chlorophenyl) n ethyl 8 methoxy 1 methyl 4h [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3 a][1,4]benzodiazepine 4 acetamide;alisertib;antineoplastic agent;cpi 0610;cyclophosphamide;cytarabine;doxorubicin;etoposide;ibrutinib;ifosfamide;methotrexate;Myc protein;navitoclax;prednisolone;protein bcl 2;rituximab;unclassified drug;venetoclax;vincristine;aging;Burkitt lymphoma;cancer chemotherapy;cancer prognosis;carcinogenesis;chromosome translocation 14;chromosome translocation 18;chromosome translocation 22;chromosome translocation 8;clinical trial (topic);dosage schedule comparison;drug mechanism;drug megadose;drug research;drug safety;drug targeting;drug tolerability;fluorescence in situ hybridization;gene overexpression;human;immunohistochemistry;large cell lymphoma;lymphoma;nonhodgkin lymphoma;nonhuman;phase 1 clinical trial (topic);priority journal;protein analysis;protein expression;Review;sensitivity and specificity;stem cell transplantation;Lymphoma",NA,NA,current challenges and novel treatment strategies in double hit lymphomas

Optimization was carried out where experimental parameters were determined for the treatment of each pesticide. Both pesticides were totally eliminated by UV/H2O2 system under optimal conditions. However, significant differences were found: CBF degradation was influenced by both parameters and their interactions, while IPR degradation was not statistically affected by initial pH. Interestingly, analysis of degradation pathways showed a major influence of photolysis process and oxidation due to hydrogen peroxide for the CBF degradation, while the synergistic combination between both of them played the most relevant role during IPR degradation. A mixture of both pesticides was also submitted to UV/H2O2 action in which a lower rate was observed for IPR elimination while CBF was not affected.

They support livelihoods through marine and coastal industries such as fishing, aquaculture, energy extraction and tourism. They provide spaces for recreation, play and relaxation. For the many of us who live at the coasts, the marine environment provides a sense of place and identity. Indeed, in some locations, particularly small island nations, our seas and coasts define cultures and cultural practices such as ‘pearling’ (the traditional sea use of harvesting pearls from oyster beds in Bahrain) have even been entered into the World Heritage List. However, our oceans and coasts face many challenges (UNEP/GPA 2006). The Deepwater Horizon-BP oil spill is a stark reminder of the dependence of coastal communities on healthy seas. Considered the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry, the spill led to extensive damage to the marine environment as well as impacts on other marine industries such as fishing and tourism. Oil spills are but one threat to the marine environment. In 1992, the Canadian Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, John Crosbie, declared a moratorium on the northern Cod fishery after six Canadian populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) collapsed largely due to overexploitation. In 2011, 28.8 per cent of fish stocks were estimated as overfished (FAO 2014) which causes negative ecological consequences as well as leading to reductions in fish production, with negative social and economic consequences. Dredging and trawling also has major impacts on the ecological communities of the sea floor. Other problems include rising levels of micro-plastics and waste detritus in general, water quality issues such as the impacts of agricultural fertiliser and pesticide runoff, the dumping of toxic wastes in the deep sea and the introduction of non-native species. On top of these sea levels are rising, oceans are becoming more acidic and sea currents are changing as a result of climate change. The need for improved stewardship of coastal and marine resources is increasingly evident around the globe.

The literature was searched systematically using key words 'occupational dermatoses,' 'occupational skin disease' and name of each Asian country. Ninty five full-text articles were considered relevant and evaluated. Some of the dermatoses seen in industrial workers in Asian countries are similar to those in Western countries, including dermatoses due to chromate in construction and electroplating workers, epoxy resin, and chromate in painters, wood dust in workers in the furniture industry, azo dyes in textile workers and formaldehyde and chromates in those working in the leather and dyeing industries, dermatoses in domestic workers, chefs and health-care workers. Dermatoses in workers engaged in agriculture, beedi (tiny cigars) manufacture, agarbatti (incense sticks) production, fish processing, carpet weaving, sanitation and those working in coffee plantations and coal mines appear to be unique to Asian countries.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) confirmed the molecular imprinting of endosulfan on membrane matrix. Sensing of the endosulfan by voltammetry followed this. The electrochemical potential is additional information enhancing the selectivity of the sensor. It can be concluded that MIP-based voltammetric sensors are very promising analytical tool for the development of highly selective analytical sensor.

A technique that involves sterilization and release of males into wild populations of the same species can be useful in the control of invasive or pest species. Asterile-male release technique (SMRT) was used on a novel vertebrate system, the invasive Sea Lamprey Petromyzon marinus in the Great Lakes, in an attempt to control population size. Sea Lamprey populations in the Great Lakes have been suppressed since the 1950s by (1) pesticide applications to kill larvae in streams and (2) barriers to block upstream spawning migrations. Here, we present a literature review and meta-analysis of the SMRT by using a case study from the St. Marys River, where the SMRT was applied as an experimental method of Sea Lamprey control from 1991 to 2011. Observations obtained from the St. Marys River during and after SMRT application were used to evaluate whether the SMRTwas effective at suppressing reproduction. Males were successfully sterilized and exhibited normal mating behaviors. The survival of embryos in nests was lower during the years when the SMRTwas applied (32%) than during the post-SMRT period (67%). The overall distribution of embryo viability in the river shifted after the SMRT was applied. During the SMRT application period, the observed ratios of sterile males to normal (fertile) males on nests were significantly different than expected, possibly due to an underestimation of adult Sea Lamprey abundance in the St. Marys River. Even at lower sterile male: normal male ratios, the number of viable embryos produced would have declined, but the level of reproductive suppression required to overcome recruitment variability was unclear. We discuss the effectiveness of the SMRT as it pertains to the Sea Lamprey, and we highlight difficulties in data interpretation and provide future direction for similar control programs. © American Fisheries Society 2016.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: G.

Laos and Thailand are countries in south-east Asia where the disease is endemic in both urban and rural areas. Household water storage containers, which are favourable breeding sites for dengue mosquitoes, are common in these areas, due to intermittent or limited access to water supply. This study assessed the effect of household water management and socio-demographic risk factors on Aedes aegypti infestation of water storage containers. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 239 households in Laos (124 suburban and 115 rural), and 248 households in Thailand (127 suburban and 121 rural) was conducted. Entomological surveys alongside semi-structured interviews and observations were conducted to obtain information on Ae. aegypti infestation, socio-demographic factors and water management. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models were used to assess risk factors associated with Ae. aegypti pupal infestation. Results: Household water management rather than socio-demographic factors were more likely to be associated with the infestation of water containers with Ae. aegypti pupae. Factors that was significantly associated with Ae. aegypti infestation were tanks, less frequent cleaning of containers, containers without lids, and containers located outdoors or in toilets/bathrooms. Conclusions: Associations between Ae. aegypti pupae infestation, household water management, and socio-demographic factors were found, with risk factors for Ae. aegypti infestation being specific to each study setting. Most of the containers did not have lids, larvicides, such as temephos was seldom used, and containers were not cleaned regularly; factors are facilitating dengue vector proliferation. It is recommended that, in Lao villages, health messages should promote proper use and maintenance of tightly fitted lids, and temephos in tanks, which were the most infested containers. Recommendations for Thailand are that small water containers should be cleaned weekly. Furthermore, in addition to health messages on dengue control provided to communities, attention should be paid to larval control for indoor containers in rural villages. Temephos or other immature control measures such as the use of pyriproxyfen, antilarval bacteria, or larvivorous fish should be used where temephos resistance is prevalent. Dengue control is not possible without additional adult mosquito control and community participation. © 2017 The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: N.

At LM level WSR extract treatment showed restoration of normal luminal characteristics of PCT & DCT and renal corpuscles but it failed to minimize abortive glomerulus, necrotic renal tubules with hypertrophied area, haemorrhagical clots & chronic venous congestion. At TEM level, WSR extract showed maximum retrieval in the cytoarchitecture of cuboidal epithelial cells of renal tubules and renal corpuscles. Concomitant treatment of endocel and WSR showed a very little sign of anomalies in renal tissues. A non-significant change was marked in control group when treated only with WSR extract.

Macrophages, which play a key role in inflammation, host defense, and reactions against a spectrum of autologous and foreign invaders, are crucial for innate immunity. However, cytotoxicity and apoptosis of macrophages caused by organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have so far received little attention. In this study, we used AF as a model chemical to investigate the cytotoxic effects of OCPs on mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Results from cell viability and apoptosis assays showed that AF induced apparent apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, AF induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage and resulted in the alteration of a series of signaling molecules including up-regulation of p53 and cytochrome c protein levels, decline of the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio, and activation of the caspases cascade through caspase-9 and caspase-3. These results, for the first time, revealed that the increase of endogenous ROS and DNA damage comediating OCP-induced apoptosis in macrophages may be by the mitochondria and p53 signal pathway. Our results suggested that macrophages are involved in AF-induced adverse immune effects.

France) and associated vegetation. A decade later, tree survival, total height, and stem caliper were significantly greater after site preparation by broadcast burning, slashing and burning, spraying Tordon 101 and burning, or aerial spraying of glyphosate than for manually spot-clearing vegetation at planting time, or no site preparation, and the differences were still increasing. Protecting seedlings from animals, primarily mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa), with plastic mesh tubing resulted in 13 percent higher survival; and protected trees averaged 6 percent taller, 9 percent larger in stem diameter, and 49 percent more in volume than unprotected trees at 10 years. Protection improved seedling performance in every site-preparation treatment.        Site preparation by burning reduced total cover the most, from 50 to 5 percent or less. Vegetation recovery in all treatments was rapid; original levels were exceeded by midsummer 1981, the first posttreatment growing season. Total cover on spot-cleared areas almost equaled that on unprepared areas by 1982 but not until 1985 or later on burned or sprayed areas. Herbaceous vegetation was a much higher proportion of total cover for 5 years after burning or spraying than after spot-clearing or no site preparation, but eventually all areas were dominated by woody vegetation. Removal of the overstory by logging fostered diversity among dominant plant species and initiated successional trends in all areas. Site preparation caused large differences in the frequency of occurrence and surface area dominated by individual species but only minor increases in the total number of species. Dynamics of individual species or groups are shown by the frequency, cover, and average height of their dominance in each treatment over time.        Site preparation by burning or spraying and protection from foraging animals were required to obtain more than minimum tree stocking and growth, even in moist coastal conditions. The study results are most specific to the salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis Pursh) brush type but certainly have wider applicability throughout the Coast Ranges and beyond wherever a heavy cover of competing vegetation develops rapidly and populations of foraging mammals are high.

It is thought that more subtle dysregulation of this system, which might be achievable via dietary (i.e. hypervitaminosis A) or pharmacological (i.e. valproic acid) exposure in humans, will manifest on behavioral domains including sociability, without overt physical abnormalities.        Methods: During early life, zebrafish were exposed to low doses of two chemicals that disrupt retinoid signaling. From 0 to 5 dpf, larvae were reared in aqueous solutions containing retinoic acid (0, 0.02, 0.2 or 2 nM) or valproic acid (0, 0.5, 5.0 or 50 mu M). One cohort of zebrafish was assessed using a locomotor activity screen at 6-dpf; another was reared to adulthood and assessed using a neurobehavioral test battery (startle habituation, novel tank exploration, shoaling, and predator escape/avoidance).        Results: There was no significant increase in the incidence of physical malformation among exposed fish compared to controls. Both retinoic acid and valproic acid exposures during development disrupted larval activity with persisting behavioral alterations later in life, primarily manifesting as decreased social affiliation.        Conclusions: Social behavior and some aspects of motor function were altered in exposed fish; the importance of examining emotional or psychological consequences of early life exposure to retinoid acting chemicals is discussed.

The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is currently considered an environmental friendly alternative to the employ of pyrethroids, carbamates and microbial agents (e.g. Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis), since AgNPs are easy to produce, effective and stable in the aquatic environment. However, their biophysical features showed wide variations according to the botanical agent using for the green synthesis, outlining the importance of screening local floral resources used as reducing and stabilizing agents. In this study, we focused on the biophysical properties and the mosquitocidal action of Quisqualis indica-fabricated AgNPs. AgNPs were characterized using spectroscopic (UV, FTIR, XRD) and microscopic (AFM, SEM, TEM and EDX) techniques. AFM, SEM and TEM confirmed the synthesis of poly-dispersed AgNPs with spherical shape and size ranging from 1 to 30 nm. XRD shed light on the crystalline structure of these AgNPs. The acute toxicity of Quisqualis indica extract and AgNPs was evaluated against malaria, arbovirus, and filariasis vectors, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, as well as on three important non-target aquatic organisms. The Q. indica leaf extract showed moderate larvicidal effectiveness on Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 220.42), Ae. aegypti (LC50 = 203.63) and An. stephensi (LC50 = 185.98). Q indica-fabricated AgNPs showed high toxicity against Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 14.63), Ae. aegypti (LC50 = 13.55) and An. stephensi (LC50 = 1252), respectively. Notably, Q indica-synthesized AgNPs were moderately toxic to non-target aquatic mosquito predators Anisops bouvieri (LC50 = 653.05 mu g/mL), Diplonychus indicus (LC50 = 860.94 mu g/mL) and Gambusia affinis (LC50 = 2183.16 mu g/mL), if compared to the targeted mosquitoes. Overall, the proposed one-pot biogenic fabrication of AgNPs using Q. indica is a low-cost and eco-friendly tool in the fight against Zika virus, malaria and filariasis vectors, with little impact against non-target aquatic mosquito predators.

In coral reef-fishes, the movement of larvae from planktonic to reef environments (recruitment) represents a major life-history transition. This transition requires larvae to rapidly identify and respond to sensory cues to select a suitable habitat that facilitates survival and growth. This 'recruitment' is critical for population persistence and resilience. In aquarium experiments, larval Acanthurus triostegus preferentially used their right-eye to investigate a variety of visual stimuli. Despite this, when held in in situ cages with predators, those larvae that previously favored their left-eye exhibited higher survival. These results support the ""brain's righthemisphere"" theory, which predicts that the right-eye (i.e. left-hemisphere) is used to categorize stimuli while the left-eye (i.e. right-hemisphere) is used to inspect novel items and initiate rapid behavioral-responses. While these experiments confirm that being highly lateralized is ecologically advantageous, exposure to chlorpyrifos, a pesticide often inadvertently added to coral-reef waters, impaired visual-lateralization. This suggests that chemical pollutants could impair the brain function of larval fishes during a critical life-history transition, potentially impacting recruitment success.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  25     Total Times Cited:  25     Cited Reference Count:  95,10.1038/s41598-017-09381-0     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),GREAT-BARRIER-REEF;LEFT-RIGHT ASYMMETRY;BEHAVIORAL LATERALIZATION;FRENCH-POLYNESIA;BRAIN LATERALIZATION;SOCIAL-STIMULI;CLIMATE-CHANGE;EYE USE;HABITAT SELECTION;ZEBRAFISH LARVAE;Pesticides;Vision Disorders,NA,NA,exposure to agricultural pesticide impairs visual lateralization in a larval coral reef fish

In coastal North Carolina, USA, this dominance by brown seaweeds is facilitated by omnivorous fishes, which feed both on red and green algae and on herbivorous amphipods that graze brown algae. When fish are removed in the field, brown seaweeds are replaced by red seaweeds, and herbivorous amphipods are more abundant. Using an array of large (similar to 4000 L) outdoor mesocosms, we tested three mechanistic hypotheses for this pattern: fish feeding facilitates brown algal dominance (1) by removing red and green algal competitors, (2) by removing amphipods and reducing their feeding on brown seaweeds, or (3) through an interaction of these mechanisms. Our experiments revealed strong impacts of both fish and amphipods, and a key role for the interaction, in structuring this community. When both fish and amphipods were removed (the latter with dilute insecticide), space was rapidly dominated and held for 17 weeks by fast-growing, primarily filamentous green algae. In contrast, when either fish, amphipods, or both were present, green algae were cropped to a sparse turf, and space was more rapidly dominated by larger macroalgae. The impacts of amphipods and fish on late-successional macroalgal assemblages were comparable in magnitude, but different in sign: red seaweeds prevailed in the amphipod-dominated treatment, whereas browns dominated in the presence of fish. Laboratory feeding assays and amphipod densities in the tanks suggested that the significant effects of amphipods were attributable largely, if not exclusively, to the single amphipod species Ampithoe longimana, which fed heavily on brown macroalgae. Our experimental removal of red and green algae failed to enhance cover of brown algae significantly; however, the latter reached substantially lower cover in the grazer-removal treatment, where green algae were very abundant, than in the fish-only treatment, where green algae were sparse. Thus, our results support the third hypothesis: fish-mediated dominance of brown algae involves both suppression of grazing amphipods and removal of algal competitors. Although collective impacts of fish and amphipods on this benthic community were generally comparable in magnitude, impacts normalized to each grazer's aggregate biomass were consistently higher for amphipods than for fish, sometimes by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Thus, the impacts of grazing amphipods (specifically A. longimana) on the benthic community were both strong and disproportionate to their biomass. These experimental results imply that grazing amphipods, which are ubiquitous in marine vegetation but poorly understood ecologically, may play important roles in the organization of benthic communities, particularly where predation pressure is low.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  306     Total Times Cited:  362     Cited Reference Count:  126,10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070[0237:SIOGAO]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"amphipods;Ampithoe longimana;community organization;Diplodus holbrooki;food webs;mesocosms;North Carolina, USA;seaweeds;trophic cascade;PHYTAL ANIMAL COMMUNITIES;HERBIVOROUS MARINE AMPHIPOD;CAPITA INTERACTION STRENGTH;SEAWEED CHEMICAL DEFENSES;REEF ALGAL COMMUNITIES;SECONDARY PRODUCTION;SPECIES-DIVERSITY;FISH PREDATION;ZOSTERA-MARINA;SEAGRASS MEADOWS",NA,NA,strong impacts of grazing amphipods on the organization of a benthic community

Total PCBs and p,p'=-DDE body burdens increased with fish length, but concentrations generally increased only poorly to moderately, which suggested steady-state contaminant uptake commensurate with aggressive feeding and dilution related to rapid growth characteristic of YOY bluefish within a subestuary. High condition factors paired with elevated contamination levels in bluefish from the Lower Hudson River, as compared with bluefish from Newark Bay with poor condition factors paired with elevated contamination levels, suggested that PCBs and pesticides alone may not determine condition in these fish. We found dissimilar patterns of prominent PCB congeners in bluefish from adjacent subestuaries (e.g., Newark Bay and Lower Hudson River) suggesting separate contaminant sources. Total PCB normalized fingerprints of PCB congeners permitted statistical discrimination among YOY bluefish specimens from various estuaries with a potential to differentiate subpopulations on scales to less than 20 km.

In the current study, we analyzed olfactory-mediated alarm responses, epithelial injury and recovery, and a suite of olfactory molecular biomarkers encoding genes critical in maintaining olfactory function in juvenile coho salmon receiving acute exposures to cadmium (Cd). The molecular biomarkers analyzed included four G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) representing the two major classes of odorant receptors (salmon olfactory receptor sorb and vomeronasal receptors svra, svrb, and gpr27), as well as markers of neurite outgrowth (nrn1) and antioxidant responses to metals, including heme oxygenase 1 (hmox1), and peroxiredoxin 1 (prdx1). Coho received acute (8-168 h) exposures to 3.7 ppb and 347 ppb Cd, and a subset of fish was analyzed following a 16-day depuration. Coho exposed to 347 ppb Cd over 48 h exhibited a reduction in freeze responses, and an extensive loss of olfaction accompanied by histological injury to the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory injury in coho exposed to 347 ppb Cd was accompanied at the gene level by significant decreases in expression of the olfactory GPCRs and increased expression of hmoxl. Persistent behavioral deficits, histological injury and altered expression of a subset of olfactory biomarkers were still evident in Cd-exposed coho following a 16-day depuration in clean water. Exposure to 3.7 ppb Cd also resulted in reduced freeze responses and histological changes to the olfactory epithelium within 48 h of Cd exposure, although the extent of olfactory injury was less severe than observed for fish in the high dose Cd group. Furthermore adverse behavioral effects were present in some coho receiving the low dose of Cd following a 16-day depuration. In summary, acute exposures to environmental levels of Cd can cause olfactory injury in coho salmon that may persist following depuration. Mechanism-based biomarkers of oxidative stress and olfactory structures can augment the evaluation of olfactory injury manifested at the physiological level. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to find out if the HtrA protease contributes to protection of the cell against oxidative stress. We compared the influence of various oxidizing agents on htrA mutant cells with their effects on wild-type bacteria, and found that the htr A mutation did not increase sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide or paraquat but made the cell extremely sensitive to ferrous [Fe(II)] ions, which are known to enhance oxidation of proteins. Treatment with ferrous ions caused a larger increase in the level of protein carbonyl groups in the membrane fraction of the cell than in the periplasm and cytoplasm. Iron-induced oxidation of membrane proteins was enhanced in the htrA mutant relative to wild-type cells. Inhibition of the growth of the htrA mutant by iron could be alleviated more efficiently by a nitroxide antioxidant that localizes in the membranes (A-TEMPO) than by a derivative (40H-TEM-PO) that acts mainly in the soluble fraction of the cell. Inhibition of the growth of the htrA mutant was more pronounced following treatment with cumene hydroperoxide, which partitions into membranes, than with t-butyl hydroperoxide, which forms radical mainly in the cytosol. Both ferrous ions and cumene hydroperoxide, but not hydrogen peroxide, paraquat or t-butyl hydroperoxide, induced synthesis of HtrA.

Early detection and prevention of crop diseases is critical to control the diseases, improve crop yields, reduce the economic losses and control pesticide pollution. Therefore, the research of recognition methods for crop diseases is necessary. This paper proposed a disease recognition method of phomopsis vexans in Solanum melongena, based on leaf disease spot features. In this method, computer vision technology was used as a means of digital image processing and pattern recognition technique, focusing on analysis of the diseased leaf spots of color, shape, texture parameters. Diseased sample image was collected through an image acquisition system which composed of FitPC and server with long-distance point-to-point transmission. The collected diseased leaf images were processed using a series of image pre-processing methods, such as image transforming, smoothing, and segmentation. After removing disturbance of noise with a median filter and excluded non-blade portion with Grabcut algorithm, the preprocessed image was obtained. Since the H-values of preprocessed image in the HSI color space were concentrated within a certain range, the threshold preprocessed image was chosen as the background of the diseased leaf image. The image segmentation method, based on the result of the background and the preprocessed image multiplication, was applied to separate the disease spot images from the diseased leaf images. The twelve color characteristic parameters, eleven shape feature parameters and eight texture feature parameters for each disease spot area, i. e. the 31 disease unions classifying features were extracted by statistical analysis. The feature vectors consisted of twenty strong classification feature parameters, which were selected by the variance and principal component analysis methods. Based on the training set that composed of 35 phomopsis vexans spot feature vectors and feature vectors of 35 other disease of Solanum melongena spot, Fischer discriminant function classification which use to classify the testing set was constructed. The recognition results of the kinds of phomopsis vexans by the proposed method were 90%. Under the premise of not changing the identify objects, to improve the accuracy of recognition, it required to consider of the influence of different classification feature vectors and different samples of training set on the recognition results. The results of control experiment showed that, the identification accuracy rate decreased with the reduction of the training set, and the identification accuracy of Fisher classification discriminant function constructed by feature vectors dropped without characteristic optimization. The causes of these results were that the sample of other disease of Solanum melongena contained phomopsis vexans similar diseases and redundancy parameters were presented in the original classification feature vetor. The analysis and experimental results in this paper demonstrate that before constructing discriminant function, enough training samples should be acquired and it's nesessary to select the effective parameters that identified well from the feature parameters. The proposed method indicated that using computer vision technology could realize the rapid and accurate identification of leaf diseases of Solanum melongena, and provide supporting technology to real-time detection on solanum melongena diseases in open field.

Adenosine signaling is mediated by adenosine receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3); in turn, nucleotide and nucleoside-metabolizing enzymes and adenosine transporters regulate its levels. Scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, has profound amnesic effects in a variety of learning paradigms and has been used to induce cognitive deficits in animal models. This study investigated the effects of acute exposure to caffeine (a non-selective antagonist of adenosine receptors A1 and A2A), ZM 241385 (adenosine receptor A2A antagonist), DPCPX (adenosine receptor A1 antagonist), dipyridamole (inhibitor of nucleoside transporters) and EHNA (inhibitor of adenosine deaminase) in a model of pharmacological cognitive impairment induced by scopolamine in adult zebrafish. Caffeine, ZM 241385, DPCPX, dipyridamole, and EHNA were acutely administered independently via i.p. in zebrafish, followed by exposure to scopolamine dissolved in tank water (200μM).

The biodegradation of this insecticide is principally catalyzed through P450 enzymes, carboxylesterases, and glutathione-S-transferase, increasing the amount of free radicals that could promote the activation of oxidative stress response. The present study identified and evaluated the transcriptomic expression of genes related to the antioxidant system in male and female C. rogercresseyi exposed to deltamethrin (AlphaMax™). Herein, thirty-three transcripts were identified from an EST-database, including CrGST, CrGST-kappa 1, CrSOD, CrCAT, CrSE-GPx, CrPHGP1, CrPHGP2, CrPRX6, CrPRX2, CrPRX4, and CrFERR. The transcription patterns during the life cycle of C. rogercresseyi revealed conspicuous clusters of gene expression, which was composed by CrGST and CrPRX2 associated with the early stages of larval development, and CrSE-GPx and CrPHGP1 mainly related to adults. Moreover, the transcript expression for 11 genes of the antioxidant system exposed to deltamethrin revealed that at 2. ppb the transcriptional activity of CrSOD, CrCAT, CrPRX6, CrPHGP1, and CrPHGP2 was significantly up-regulated. These results suggest that deltamethrin modulates the expression of genes belonging to the antioxidant system in salmon lice, promoting the generation of free radicals for the biodegradation of the insecticide. The implications of this antioxidant activity on the effectiveness of delousing drugs in controlling C. rogercresseyi are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 21; Correspondence Address: C.

Synthetic pyrethroids have been shown to enter the aquatic environment from agricultural runoff or drift from aerial and ground-based spraying applications posing threat to fishes which are less tolerant to pesticides through direct exposure. These insecticides interfere with the sodium channel of the nervous system resulting in prolonged sodium tail current. Widespread application of these chemicals has warranted the attention of the ecologist to understand the impact of these chemicals on the aquatic environment. In this perspective, an updated account of toxicological evaluation of three type II synthetic pyrethroids, viz. deltamethrin, cypermethrin and fenvalerate in terms of their physico-chemical, metabolic, hematological, histological, behavioral and reproductive aspects with respect to the fishes has been presented which may be useful for policy makers, academics, environmental scientists and agricultural professionals needing ready access to this information. The aim of the present synoptic literature appraisal was to summarize the main effect of current use, type II synthetic pyrethroids (deltamethrin, cypermethrin and fenvalerate) on aquatic environment due to their persistence and accumulation. This article will focus on non-target organisms in inland fresh water environment with special reference to fin fishes and will critically evaluate the toxicity of these pyrethroids in terms of growth inhibition, metabolic disorders, neurotoxicity, reproductive failure, enzymatic dysfunction, haematological alterations, and tissue damages. The rationalized information in this milieu may be useful in ecological risk evaluation and human health management as fish serves as an important bio-indicator for aquatic systems health. © 2015, The Author(s).","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 41; Correspondence Address: D.K.

It has been demonstrated that ES can cause negative effects on aquatic animals, including disruption of hormonal systems. However, the alterations produced by this pesticide on the reproductive axis of fish prior to sexual maturity, as well as possible modes of action have hardly been studied. This study aimed at assessing the effect of waterborne exposure to the pesticide ES on the reproductive axis during sexual differentiation of juveniles of the South American freshwater cichlid fish Cichlasoma dimerus. No mortality was observed due to ES subchronic exposure (90 days post-fertilization). Exposure to ES did not affect body weight nor morphometric parameters, indicating that larvae nutritional state was not affected. Timing of sexual differentiation, gonadal morphology and sex ratio were likewise not altered by ES. However, ES acted as an endocrine disrupting chemical in this species as the morphometry of gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH) producing cells was altered. Exposure to ES altered nuclear area, cell area and nucleus/cytoplasm ratio of GnRH II neurons, and cell and nuclear area and diameter of GnRH III neurons. Interestingly, in our previous study, exposure before sex differentiation (30 day exposure) caused no alteration to GnRH II and III, and did alter GnRH I and FSH cells. These alterations could lead to changes in circulating hormone levels, especially when fish are exposed for prolonged periods, ultimately impairing reproductive fitness. C. dimerus juveniles can be an interesting biological model to perform toxicological studies with the intent to assess early disruption endpoints in the reproductive axis during development. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 19; CODEN: EESAD,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.03.013,"Cichlids;GnRH;Gonadotrops;Organochlorine pesticides;Reproductive axis;Analysis of Variance;Animals;Endocrine Disruptors;Endosulfan;Fresh Water;Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone;Gonads;Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated;Insecticides;Larva;Neurons;Protein Precursors;Sex Differentiation;Water Pollutants, Chemical;Animalia;Cichlasoma;Cichlidae;Perciformes;endocrine disruptor;endosulfan;gonadorelin;chlorinated hydrocarbon;fresh water;insecticide;progonadoliberin I;protein precursor;water pollutant;ecotoxicology;hormone;juvenile;morphometry;perciform;pollution effect;pollution exposure;reproductive behavior;sexual maturity;adult;animal cell;animal experiment;animal tissue;Article;biological model;body weight;brain nerve cell;cell nucleus;cell structure;Cichlasoma dimerus;cichlid;controlled study;cytoplasm;development;exposure;female;gonad;juvenile animal;larva;male;morphometrics;nonhuman;nutritional status;reproductive fitness;reproductive toxicity;sex differentiation;sex ratio;analysis of variance;animal;drug effects;metabolism;nerve cell;physiology;toxicity",NA,NA,endosulfan affects gnrh cells in sexually differentiated juveniles of the perciform cichlasoma dimerus

CBD has low affinity for cannabinoid neuroreceptors and agonistic properties to 5-HT receptors. An interaction between cannabinoid and purinergic receptor systems has been proposed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate CBD properties on memory behavioral and locomotor parameters and the effects of pre-treatment of adenosine receptor blockers on CBD impacts on memory using adult zebrafish. CBD (0.1, 0.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) was tested in the avoidance inhibitory paradigm and anxiety task. We analyzed the effect of a long-term caffeine pre-treatment (~ 20 mg/L - four months). Also, acute block of adenosine receptors was performed in co-administration with CBD exposure in the memory assessment. CBD promoted an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve in the anxiety task; in the memory assessment, CBD in the dose of 5 mg/Kg promoted the strongest effects without interfering with social and aggressive behavior. Caffeine treatment was able to prevent CBD (5 mg/kg) effects on memory when CBD was given after the training session. CBD effects on memory were partially prevented by co-treatment with a specific A2A adenosine receptor antagonist when given prior to or after the training session, while CBD effects after the training session were fully prevented by adenosine A1 receptor antagonist. These results indicated that zebrafish have responses to CBD anxiolytic properties that are comparable to other animal models, and high doses changed memory retention in a way dependent on adenosine. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, whether this process also weakens the toxicity of organic pollutants to non-target aquatic organisms is not clear. Therefore, natural sediments were chosen as suspended sediment examples in this research applying atrazine as the target pollutant and Brachydanio rerio (more recently, Danio rerio (Zebrafish)) as the target organism to conduct acute toxicity experiments. The concentration of atrazine in aqueous solution was measured as a time series. Results show that without suspended sediments, the 96-h LC50 of atrazine to Brachydanio rerio is 29.06 mg/l at 95 % confidence interval (24.41 to 40.70 mg/l). For suspended sediments of 7500 and 15,000 mg/l, the LC50 (i.e., concentration resulting in 50 % mortality) equates to 30.74 and 39.51 mg/l, respectively, and the corresponding confidence intervals are between 27.17 and 40.91 mg/l and between 30.43 and 126.93 mg/l in that order. Probit analysis, which is a type of regression used to analyze binomial response variables, was applied using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. For the series of no suspended solids (SS), 7500 and 15,000 mg/l SS, the so-called no-observed-effective concentrations were 3, 9, and 15 mg/l, correspondingly. The uptake quantity and uptake rate of atrazine by B. rerio according to atrazine concentrations in the aqueous solution were computed.

Numerous models have been developed for predicting dementia. To evaluate these models we undertook a systematic review in 2010 and updated this in 2014 due to the increase in research published in this area. Here we include a critique of the variables selected for inclusion and an assessment of model prognostic performance. Methods: Our previous systematic review was updated with a search from January 2009 to March 2014 in electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science). Articles examining risk of dementia in non-demented individuals and including measures of sensitivity, specificity or the area under the curve (AUC) or c-statistic were included. Findings: In total, 1,234 articles were identified from the search; 21 articles met inclusion criteria. New developments in dementia risk prediction include the testing of non-APOE genes, use of non-traditional dementia risk factors, incorporation of diet, physical function and ethnicity, and model development in specific subgroups of the population including individuals with diabetes and those with different educational levels. Four models have been externally validated. Three studies considered time or cost implications of computing the model. Interpretation: There is no one model that is recommended for dementia risk prediction in populationbased settings. Further, it is unlikely that one model will fit all.

A number of clinical photobacteriosis outbreaks among yearling cultured and broodstocks of gilthead sea bream were sampled and submitted to our laboratory during the summer and autumn of 2013. The tissues of infected fish were subjected to an ordinary bacteriological identification and were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry techniques. The results indicated that the selective primers that have been designed for detecting the gene encoding the apoptotic-induced protein, AIP56, represent a powerful tool for sensitive and specific detection of virulent strains of Phdp. AIP56 toxin triggers apoptosis of host macrophages and neutrophils, contributing to the lesions observed during the pathological investigation. Immunohistochemistry allows bacterial identification and antigen expression to be directly correlated to the disease; the immune-positive bacteria were detected in gills, liver, kidneys, spleen, and brain tissues in acute photobacteriosis. These also appeared in the necrotic areas of the granulomas of chronically infected fish. Molecular and immunohistochemical methods were useful as research and diagnostic tools in different stages of the disease; moreover, they appear to have enormous potential in retrospective epidemiological investigations. © by the World Aquaculture Society 2015.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 21; Correspondence Address: N.M.

In this paper, four groups of lettuce were used as experimental samples, the first group was sprayed with acetone, the second group contained dimethoate (volume ratio between omethoate and acetone is 1:1000), the third group contained dimethoate (volume ratio between omethoate and acetone is 1:500), the last group of lettuce leaves dimethoate (volume ratio between omethoate and acetone is 1:100). Totally 384 samples of four varieties were scanned by using the NIR hyperspectral imaging system (871.61~1766.32 nm). The region of interest (ROI) in hyperspectral image of samples was selected, and the mean spectra of all pixels in the region of interest was calculated. At the same time, optimal image selection was carried out by principal component analysis (PCA). The first principal component (PC1) image and the second principal component (PC2) image were used for texture features analysis. Among the processing of spectral data, successive projections algorithm (SPA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to obtain characteristic wavelengths. Finally, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Mahalanobis distance (MD), Fisher linear discriminate analysis (FLDA) algorithm were used for model establishments respectively based on spectral feature and the combined features in full and characteristic wavelength. In all models, the performance of FLDA based on the combination of texture and spectral features by SPA has its superiority in classification recognition with the training rate of 98.90% and prediction rate of 100%.

As a consequence of their massive application, they have become and remain significant environmental pollutants, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Fish are an integral part of the aquatic environment and are, therefore, suitable models for the study of the behavioral, biological, and biochemical effects of triazine exposure. We have summarized and evaluated the effects of triazine herbicides on fish in order to provide an overview of current information on triazines. The overall effects of triazine herbicide exposure on the physiology of fish were evaluated by considering a variety of parameters in a number of reports. Haematological and biochemical profiles of blood provide important information about the internal environment of the organism and the general physiology and health status of triazine exposed fish. According to studies using biotransformation and bioaccumulation indices to estimate the effects of triazines on fish, changes in fish metabolism reflect the pollution of the environment by these herbicides. The responses of antioxidant defence systems in fish to triazine exposure could be an adaptive mechanism to protect the fish from triazine-induced oxidative stress. Acute exposure to triazines affects reproduction or reproductive development in fish; however, some triazines did not affect fish behavior during long-term exposure to low concentrations.

RNA-Seq analysis evidenced high transcription levels of cuticle precursors during the larval stage, while in adults cuticle proteins were highly regulated. Furthermore, 234 transcripts were highly regulated in response to delousing drugs, such as cuticle proteins, P4H, PDI, and chitinase. Principle components analysis revealed a high correlation between exposure to azamethiphos and cuticle precursors, suggesting a putative modulation of organophosphates against cuticle-related proteins in sea lice. Moreover, transcript expression of collagen and cuticle genes revealed significant differences between sexes. These results suggest a modulation by C. rogercresseyi of cuticle biogenesis in response to delousing drugs. Statement of relevance. The present report examined changes in cuticle protein expression in sea lice exposed to delousing drugs. The study gathers high-throughput sequencing features to suggest novel aspects of the drug response to organophosphates and pyrethroids used by the salmon aquaculture industry. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 15; CODEN: AQCLA,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.07.017,Azamethiphos;C. rogercresseyi;Cuticle;Deltamethrin;Drug resistance;QPCR;Caligus rogercresseyi;Phthiraptera;antiparasite defense;aquaculture industry;bioassay;biotechnology;crustacean;drug;drug resistance;enzyme activity;gene expression;insecticide;larva;organophosphate;physiological response;polymerase chain reaction;protein;sex-related difference;Transcriptome;Computer Simulation;Gene Expression Profiling,NA,NA,in silico transcriptome analysis of cuticlerelated genes associated with delousing drug responses in the sea louse caligus rogercresseyi

The purpose of this study is to evaluate CBD properties on memory behavioral and locomotor parameters and the effects of pre-treatment of adenosine receptor blockers on CBD impacts on memory using adult zebrafish. CBD (0.1, 0.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) was tested in the avoidance inhibitory paradigm and anxiety task. We analyzed the effect of a long-term caffeine pre-treatment (~ 20 mg/L - four months). Also, acute block of adenosine receptors was performed in co-administration with CBD exposure in the memory assessment. CBD promoted an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve in the anxiety task; in the memory assessment, CBD in the dose of 5 mg/Kg promoted the strongest effects without interfering with social and aggressive behavior. Caffeine treatment was able to prevent CBD (5 mg/kg) effects on memory when CBD was given after the training session. CBD effects on memory were partially prevented by co-treatment with a specific A2A adenosine receptor antagonist when given prior to or after the training session, while CBD effects after the training session were fully prevented by adenosine A1 receptor antagonist.

In this study, the mosquito larvicidal activity of Pinus kesiya leaf essential oil (EO) was evaluated against the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and the lymphatic filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The chemical composition of the EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. GC-MS revealed that the P. kesiya EO contained 18 compounds. Major constituents were alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, myrcene and germacrene D. In acute toxicity assays, the EO showed significant toxicity against early third-stage larvae of An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, with LC50 values of 52, 57, and 62 mu g/ml, respectively. Notably, the EO was safer towards several aquatic non-target organisms Anisops bouvieri, Diplonychus indicus and Gambusia affinis, with LC50 values ranging from 4135 to 8390 mu g/ml.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to contaminants in embryos of the critically endangered Brazilian guitarfish, Pseudobatos horkelii. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pharmaceuticals and per-sonal care products, and metals were determined in embryos. Additionally, glutathione S-transferase activity (GST), glutathione (GSH), and metallothionein levels (MT) were analyzed. Finally, lipid peroxidation levels (LPO) and protein carbonyl groups (PCO) were assessed. Embryonic exposure depended on yolk consumption, which was conspicuous in earlier development. We observed a dilution effect of contaminants levels, potentially related to biotransformation of these compounds throughout the embryonic development. Nevertheless, GST was not correlated to contaminant concentrations. The multivariate relationship between antioxidant components (GSH and GST) and LPO and PCO was negative, suggesting the lack of efficient defense of these biomarkers in early development, leading to oxidative damage. In this context, our results indicate that prenatal exposure to contaminants might impact the redox status in embryos of P. horkelii, leading to oxidative damage.

The ability of human cells to incorporate and metabolise this type of fatty acids has never been investigated. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate if two human cell lines, INT 407 and SH-SY5Y, incorporate and metabolise extracellular dichlorostearic acid. Cells were incubated with 9,10-dichlorostearic acid for 24 hr, and the amounts of chlorinated fatty acids in cells and culture medium analysed every two days for up to 6 or 10 days. Lipids were separated by solid phase extraction, transesterified to fatty acid methyl esters, and analysed by gas chromatography in combination with a halogen specific detector (GC/XSD). Dichlorostearic acid, dichloropalmitic acid and dichloromyristic acid were found in phospholipids and in neutral lipids of the INT 407 cells. Both cell lines secreted considerable amounts of dichloromyristic acid into the culture medium. Cellular or secreted metabolites shorter than dichloromyristic acid were not Found. Taken together, the results suggest that human cells may(I) incorporate chlorinated fatty acids into membrane lipids and storage lipids, (2) metabolise cellular dichlorostearic acid to dichloropalmitic acid and dichloromyristic acid by beta -oxidation; but that further metabolism is hindered, possibly because of the chlorine atoms, and (3) remove formed dichloromyristic acid by secretion.

The effects of the herbicide oxyfluorfen on the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase were evaluated in freshwater fish Oreochromis niloticus. These were determined in tilapia liver exposed to sublethal concentrations (0.3 and 0.6 mg/L at 7, 14, and 21 days of exposure. This study also analyzed the effects of oxyfluorfen on the total fatty acid profile. The results showed that CAT activity was higher in tilapia exposed to oxyfluorfen at the sampling days, except at the highest concentration after 21 days. Similarly, the enhancing effect of the herbicide was observed on the GR activity. However, its effect was moderate at the highest dose. On the contrary, fish treated with oxyfluorfen at both doses displayed a decrease in the SOD activity. After 7 days of treatment at both concentrations tilapia showed a significant increase in GST levels, although the enzymatic activity decreased at 14 and 21 days of exposition when compared with the control. The major saturated fatty acids measured in tilapia liver were the palmitic acid (C16:0;17.9%) and stearic acid (C18:0; 8.7%). The exposure to oxyfluorfen caused a significant increase of the oleic acid (C18:1), whereas the amount of nervonic acid (C24:1) increased at all sampling data. The results of the present study should be taken in account when using tilapia as an environmental indicator species in studies of xenobiotic biotransformation and biomarker response, as well as in monitoring programmes.

In this context, the azole pesticides have earned special attention due to their cytochrome P450 aromatase inhibition potential. Cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19) catalyses the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into oestrone and oestradiol, respectively. Thus, aromatase modulates the oestrogenic balance essential not only for females, but also for male physiology, including gonadal function. Its inhibition affects reproductive organs, fertility and sexual behaviour in humans and wildlife species. Several studies have shown that azole pesticides are able to inhibit human and fish aromatases but the information on birds is lacking. Consequently, it appeared to be of interest to estimate the aromatase inhibition of azoles in three different avian species, namely Gallus gallus, Coturnix coturnix japonica and Taeniopygia guttata. In the absence of the crystal structure of the aromatase enzyme in these bird species, homology models for the individual avian species were constructed using the crystal structure of human aromatase (hAr) (pdb: 3EQM) that showed high sequence similarity for G. gallus (82.0%), T. guttata (81.9%) and C. japonica (81.2%). A homology model with Oncorhynchus mykiss (81.9%) was also designed for comparison purpose. The homology-modelled aromatase for each avian and fish species and crystal structure of human aromatase were selected for docking 46 structurally diverse azoles and related compounds. We showed that the docking behaviour of the chemicals on the different aromatases was broadly the same. We also demonstrated that there was an acceptable level of correlation between the binding score values and the available aromatase inhibition data. This means that the homology models derived on bird and fish species can be used to approximate the potential inhibitory effects of azoles on their aromatase.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  86,10.1080/1062936X.2015.1090749     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Homology modelling;aromatase;azole pesticides;human;bird;fish;endocrine disruptors;ACUTE ORAL TOXICITY;SEXUAL-DIFFERENTIATION;MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS;TERRITORIAL AGGRESSION;ESTROGEN SYNTHESIS;BRAIN AROMATASE;EXPOSURE;FUNGICIDES;LETROZOLE;FADROZOLE;Pesticides;Danazol;Aromatase,NA,NA,modelling inhibition of avian aromatase by azole pesticides

The developed assay was used for identifying zebrafish Mate 7 interactors and discerning the type of interaction. A series of 89 diverse environmental contaminants, including industrial chemicals, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, was tested and highly effective Mate7 interactors were identified in all of the aforementioned groups. Some of the inhibitors identified could be of environmental concern because they may potentially impair Mate7 efflux function, lowering the fish defence capacity against environmental contaminants, or interfering with transport of yet unidentified physiological substrates.

As a result, the ability to characterize dynamic hydrologic properties at adequate temporal and spatial scales has greatly improved. These advances have led to improved statistical and mechanistic modeling in monitoring of water quality trends at local, watershed and regional scales for freshwater, estuarine and marine ecosystems. In addition, they have greatly enhanced rapid (e.g., real-time) detection of hydrologic variability, recognized as a critical need for early warning systems and rapid response to harmful algal bloom events. Here, we present some of the landmark developments and technological achievements that led to the advent of real-time remote monitors for hydrologic properties.

A prospective study in a Faroese birth cohort documented subtle deficits of several functional domains at prenatal MeHg exposure levels previously thought to be safe. Recent additional studies also showed neurobehavioral deficits associated with exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with concomitant MeHg poisoning. In contrast, a prospective study in the Seychelles did not detect a similar association between MeHg exposure and neurodevelopmental deficits; children of the highest MeHg exposure group showed better scores in some developmental tests than those of the lower exposure groups for both prenatal and postnatal MeHg exposures. This paradoxical difference between both studies is summarized herein. The primary source of human exposure to MeHg is fish. Since a considerable number of pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides, are also present in fish, and since some organochemical substances including PCBs are also well documented to be neurotoxic to the developing brain from epidemiological studies, the combined effects of these pollutants should be considered in discussing the neurotoxicity of MeHg.

These results indicated that H-NS acted cooperatively to form extended nucleoprotein filaments on target DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis of H-NS further showed that R86 played an essential role in T6SS gene binding.

In the present study, comparative analysis for the transcriptomes of T. rubripes, T. flavidus and Jiyan-1 was performed aiming to reveal the possible mechanisms of heterosis in pufferfish. Whole transcriptomes were sequenced using the SOLiD4 platform, and a total of 44,305 transcripts corresponding to 18,164 genes were identified collectively. A total of 14,148 transcripts were differentially expressed. By comparing the gene expression patterns of the three samples, the coexistence of overdominance, dominance, underdominance and additivity was observed in the gene action modes of Jiyan-1. There were 2,237 transcripts in the intersection of the differentially expressed transcripts from Jiyan-1 versus T. rubripes and Jiyan-1 versus T. flavidus, among which 213 transcripts were also in the T. rubripes versus T. flavidus. The potential functions of the remaining 2,024 transcripts were mainly associated with metabolic process, nucleotide binding and catalytic activity. The enrichment results indicated metabolism was the most activated biological function in the heterosis. In addition, 35 KEGG pathways were retrieved as affiliated with more than three differentially expressed transcripts and 8,579 potentially novel transcript isoforms were identified for Jiyan-1. The present study revealed the coexistence of multiple gene actions in the hybrid puffer, indicated the importance of metabolism, ion binding function and kinase activity, as well as provided a list of candidate genes and pathways for heterosis.

However, little information is available especially regarding the characteristics and influencing factors of breeding sites of An. sinensis in Yongcheng City, a representative region of unstable malaria transmission in the Huang-Huai River region of central China. The aims of this study were to determine the breeding site characteristics of An. sinensis and related environmental and physicochemical parameters, to find out which breeding site characteristics could best explain the presence of An. sinensis larvae, and to determine whether the breeding habit of An. sinensis has changed or not.        Methods: Random repeated cross sectional study was undertaken in six villages of the Yongcheng city characterized by different levels of the historical incidence of P. vivax malaria. The potential breeding sites of An. sinensis larvae in each village were examined twice per month both in the household courtyards and the village surroundings. The larval sampling was done by the standard dipping method. Some important breeding site characterizations were recorded and characterized. The anopheline mosquito larvae and emerged adults were identified to the species level morphologically and to sub-species by the ribosomal DNA PCR technique. Chi-square analysis and logistic regression analysis were applied to determine the importance of factors for explaining the presence or absence of An. sinensis larvae.        Results: According to the ribosomal DNA PCR assay, all sampled anopheline mosquito larvae and emerged adults belonged to An. sinensis. Only 3 containers that were sampled from the household courtyards were found to contain An. sinensis larvae. There were no differences in the species composition of mosquito larvae among containers that contained water in the household courtyards (P > 0.05). An. sinensis larvae were shown to be present in a total of 60 breeding sites in the village surroundings, this included 8 (13.3%) river fringes, 26 (43.3%) ponds, 23 (38.3%) puddles, and 3 (5.0%) irrigation/drainage ditches. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the breeding site type, water depth, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen, and sulphate were found to be the key factors determining the presence of An. sinensis larvae. Approximately 94.9% of An. sinensis larvae inhabited relatively large and medium-sized water bodies, with depths between 0.5 m and 1.0 m (73.3%), COD lower than 2 mg/L (75%), ammonia nitrogen lower than 0.4 mg/L (86.7%), and sulphate lower than 150 mg/L (58.3%), respectively.        Conclusion: These results indicate that the majority of An. sinensis larval breeding sites were relatively large and medium-sized water bodies with depths between 0.5 m and 1.0 m, and containing low levels of COD, ammonia nitrogen, and sulphate, respectively. For effective An. sinensis larval control, the type of breeding site, water depth, COD, ammonia nitrogen, and sulphate should be given higher priority over other factors in areas where it is the primary vector.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  32     Total Times Cited:  37     Cited Reference Count:  75,10.1186/1756-3305-5-58     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Breeding site;Characterization;Mosquito;Anopheles vectors;Ecology;Malaria elimination;WESTERN KENYA HIGHLANDS;SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION;MOSQUITO LARVAE;MALARIA CONTROL;HABITAT CHARACTERIZATION;DIPTERA-CULICIDAE;PLASMODIUM-VIVAX;CLIMATE-CHANGE;INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE;GAMBIAE COMPLEX;Cesarean Section;Breeding;Cross-Sectional Studies;China;Taiwan,NA,NA,random repeated cross sectional study on breeding site characterization of <i>anopheles sinensis<i> larvae in distinct villages of yongcheng city peoples republic of china
rayyan-1227193180,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triadimenol,2008,10,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,10,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Triadimenol is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triadimenol in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 29 May 2006. The peer review was initiated on 30 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer Crop Science AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the attached list of endpoints.        Since clarification is required with respect to certain impurities, the specification for the technical material as a whole should be regarded as provisional for the moment.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Bayfidan EC 250"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 250 g/L triadimenol and ""Baytan FS 094"" a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) containing 75 g/L triadimenol, 9 g/L fuberidazole and 10 g/L imazalil.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor triadimenol residues in food/feed of plant origin, soil, water and air.        In mammals, triadimenol is harmful to rats via the oral route (R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" proposed); it is not acutely toxic via the dermal and inhalation routes, nor is a skin or eye irritant; it is not a skin sensitiser. In repeated dose studies liver is the target, with enlargement of the liver and related clinical chemistry changes. The relevant short term toxicity NOAELs are 9 and 15 mg/kg bw/day, in rats and dogs, respectively, whereas the relevant long term toxicity and carcinogenicity NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day. Triadimenol does not have genotoxic and carcinogenic potential. The relevant parental and reproductive NOAEL in multigeneration studies is 6 mg/kg bw/day, and the relevant offspring NOAEL 9 mg/kg bw/day. Reduced pup survival in the multigeneration study during lactation period was noted. Furthermore, a decrease in fertility index was noted in all matings (all generations) in one study, possibly linked to the aromatase inhibition seen in an in vitro study. Therefore R64 ""May cause harm to breastfed babies"" and R62 ""Possible risk of impaired fertility"" were considered as appropriate (to be confirmed by EChA). As for developmental toxicity, in several rat developmental toxicity studies inconsistent effects which could be considered adverse were found (e.g. cervical and lumbar extra ribs). Placental weight was increased in the rats indicating that the substance might be an endocrine disruptor. A range of skeletal findings was seen at slight maternal toxic dose levels. R63? ""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed for consideration by EChA. Relevant maternal NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day and 25 mg/kg bw/day in rat and rabbit, respectively, and relevant developmental toxicity NOAEL is 15 mg/kg bw/day and 40 mg/kg bw/day (rat and rabbit). Based on similar neurotoxic potential of triadimenol and triadimefon2, data from the latter were used, showing a NOAEL of 2 mg/kg bw for acute exposure (reversible hyperactivity and increased motor and locomotor activity in rats, no neuropathological changes), and a subchronic NOAEL of 3.4 mg/kg bw/day. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.05 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.05 mg/kg bw (based on an overall NOAEL of 5 mg/kg bw/day, SF 100). The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure to the EC and the FS formulations is below the AOEL even without the use of PPE.        The metabolism of triadimenol in plant was investigated following foliar applications on grapes, cereals and sugar beet and seed treatment on cereals. After foliar or seed treatments triadimenol was found to be the major compound in grapes, cereal grains and straw and sugar beet leaves and roots, accounting for 23 to 73% of the TRR. Hexose conjugate of the parent and the hydroxy metabolite M103 as free or conjugated were also detected in levels above 10%. Together these metabolites are present in amounts similar to or lower than the parent. Triazole Derivative Metabolites (TDMs) were also detected in cereal grains and straw following seed treatment and in cereals sown as rotational crops. Considering the significant proportion of the parent compound in the different plant parts investigated, the residue definition for monitoring was limited to triadimenol. For risk assessment, it was proposed to include in the residue definition the parent triadimenol, the metabolite M10 and their conjugates. Taking into account the proportions of the parent and of the metabolites, a conversion factor of 2 was proposed for the risk assessment for cereals only.        Concerning the TDMs, the meeting of experts was of the opinion not to include these metabolites in the triadimenol residue definitions since TDMs are not specific to triadimenol and there is currently no EU approach on how to consider these common triazole metabolites in the risk assessment. A separate residue definition has to be set and a separate risk assessment has to be performed for TDMs taking into account all the active substances of the triazole chemical class. This issue should be reconsidered when a general approach on triazole compounds and their triazole derivative metabolites is defined.        Supervised residue trials on grapes and cereals have been submitted. Residues were analysed for triadimenol only and no information was provided on the possible residue levels of the hydroxy metabolite M10 or the TDMs. Sufficient data were provided to propose a Maximum Residue Level (MRL) on wine and table grapes. On cereals, a provisional MRL was proposed for barley and oat only, awaiting additional residue data on barley in southern EU and in northern and southern EU for wheat. Triadimenol was stable under standard hydrolytic conditions and processing studies on grape showed a limited transfer of residues to wine. The submitted rotational crop studies, not performed in compliance with the requested standards, indicated that residues of the parent compound and its triazole derivative metabolites may be expected to be above the limit of quantification (LOQ). The experts' meeting was of the opinion that a new field study on rotational crops conforming to the current guidelines is required, where crops should be analysed for triadimenol and TDMs residues. Moreover, the residue situation in rotational crops should be reconsidered with regard to a global approach on TDMs.        Metabolism studies in goats and hens were carried out with the active substance triadimefon. Nevertheless and given that the major metabolic pathway of triadimefon in animals consists as a first step in producing triadimenol, these studies were considered as fully acceptable for the understanding of the triadimenol metabolism in animals The metabolism of triadimenol in livestock is extensive and proceeds mainly via oxidation of the tertiary butyl group to the hydroxy metabolite M10 and the carboxy metabolite M024, both being subjected to conjugation with sulphate or glucuronic acid respectively. In hens, an additional pathway consisting of desmethylation was identified. The meeting of experts concluded that triadimenol could not be a valid marker for animal products since it was observed in significant levels in ruminant liver and in poultry fat and eggs only. Therefore, the animal residue definition for risk assessment was proposed as triadimenol plus metabolite M10 and M02 and their conjugates and metabolite M28(5). For monitoring the residue definition was proposed as triadimenol plus metabolite M10 and their conjugates and metabolite M28. Considering the limited transfer observed in the animal feeding studies and the low potential exposure to triadimenol residues through the consumption of treated food items (cereals), the meeting was of the opinion that there is no need to set MRLs for products of animal origin at this stage.        As for plants, the possible inclusion of the TDMs in the animal residue definition has been discussed. It was concluded that no significant TDMs residues resulting from the direct intake of triadimefon/triadimenol are expected in products of animal origin. Nevertheless the animal dietary burden should also take into account the additional exposure arising from TDMs residues present in feeding commodities from both, primary and rotational crops (especially in cereal straw and cereal grains). As for plants, this issue will need to be reconsidered at a later stage when a global EU approach on TDMs is defined.        The consumer risk assessment has been performed through the residues of triadimenol only and according to the residue definition proposed for plants. The contribution of the TDMs residues in primary crops, rotational crops and products of animal origin resulting from the use of triadimenol has not been evaluated and not been taken into account in the consumer risk assessment awaiting the definition of a global EU approach concerning these metabolites which are common to all active substances of the triazole chemical class. Taking into account the above considerations, the chronic and acute consumer exposures performed using the EFSA model and the proposed MRLs for cereals and grape were found to be less than 3% of the ADI and 27% of the ARfD.        In soil under aerobic conditions triadimenol exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the soil metabolite M046 (accounting for up to 8.2% of applied radioactivity (AR) in a lysimeter study) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of the triazole ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 3.8-41% AR after 100 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 4.5-22.3 % AR after 100 days. Triadimenol exhibits low to very high mobility in soil, M04 exhibits high to very high mobility in soil. It was concluded that it was unlikely that adsorption of triadimenol was pH dependent. The adsorption of M04 was not pH dependent.        In dark laboratory natural sediment water systems triadimenol exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 3.7 % AR after 13 weeks. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were performed for triadimenol (up to FOCUS step 3 calculations) and for M04 (with appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations). These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by triadimenol and 1,2,4triazole above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all the FOCUS groundwater scenarios relevant to the intended uses applied for. The atmospheric half life estimated for triadimenol (2.5 hours) gives an indication that it has not the potential to be subject to long range transport to areas where it has not been used, via the atmosphere.        Whereas the acute and short-term risk to birds from spray use in cereals indicated a low risk at Tier 1, the long-term assessment required further refinements. Use of field residue data, PD refinements and focal species in a refined assessment, indicated a low risk for large herbivorous birds. Further refinements were however required to identify a low risk to skylark feeding on insects. For vine use (spray application) the risk assessment indicated a low risk to birds, except for the long-term risk to insectivorous birds in South Europe. Refinements of PT with Chaffinch, Blue tit and Robin as focal species were derived from UK orchard studies. It was concluded in the meeting of experts that further data were required to support the use of UK orchard data to refine the long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds in South Europe. For seed treatment use a low acute risk was identified for birds. The short-term risk assessment required further refinements. The meeting of experts did not accept the PT refinements suggested for yellowhammer, wood pigeon and skylark as focal species, and further data to substantiate the refinements were required. The long-term risk to birds was considered to be negligible, due to lack of exposure in the breeding season. EFSA however, noted that the breeding season for birds may extend into the season for use of triadimenol as a seed treatment in South Europe.        The acute risk assessment for small herbivorous and insectivorous mammals indicated a low risk for spray use in cereals. Low risk was also identified for small herbivorous mammals in the long-term assessment, after refinement of residue data. For spray use in vine the acute risk was considered as low for both North Europe and South Europe. The long-term risk assessment for both North Europe and South Europe required further refinements of interception, dissipation rate and TWA concentration in ground vegetation before a low risk was identified. For seed treatment uses, the acute risk to mammals was concluded to be low after refinement of PD. The long-term risk assessment, however, needed to be refined further. No exposure to contaminated drinking water was expected and the risk from secondary poisoning was considered to be low. The potential endocrine disrupting effects on birds may require further assessment.        Triadimenol should be classified as R51/53 ""Toxic to aquatic organisms, may cause long term adverse effects in the aquatic environment."" and the risk assessment for aquatic organisms indicated a low risk for all uses, based on FOCUS PECsw estimations up to Step 3. The risk to aquatic organisms from triadimenol metabolites was found to be low, as was the potential for bioaccumulation of triadimenol and its metabolites. The potential for endocrine effects on fish was not assessed in the DAR, as no relevant studies were available. A fish early life study (ELS) and a fish screening assay (FSA) were carried out by the applicant during the peer-review process to address potential endocrine effects. However they were not eligible for submission in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007.        The risk assessment for bees indicated a low risk for all uses. As triadimenol is systemic, the risk assessment for seed treatment use was based on the assumption that the concentration in the honey dew would correspond to the concentration in the plant.        The risk to non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro and macro organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.        No studies using the formulated products Baytan FS 094 for seed treatment were available. In consequence the risk to non-target organisms from the use of Baytan FS 094 could not be concluded since this product, besides triadimenol, also contains fuberidazole and imazalil.

The liver is the detoxification organ of the body and TMT exposure accumulates in the liver. Tea polyphenol (TP) is a natural antioxidant extracted from tea leaves and has been widely used as a food and feed additive. To investigate the mechanism of toxicity caused by TMT exposure on grass carp hepatocytes (L8824 cells) and the mitigating effect of TP, we established a hepatocyte model of TMT toxicity and/or TP treatment. L8824 cells were treated with 0.5 mu M of TMT and/or 4 mu g/mL of TP for 24 h and assayed for relevant indices. The results showed that TMT exposure caused oxidative stress, resulting in increased intracellular ROS content, resulting in intracellular ROS accumulation and increased MDA content, and inhibiting the activities of T-AOC, SOD, CAT, and GSH. Meanwhile, TMT exposure activated the endoplasmic reticulum apoptotic signaling pathway, resulting in abnormal expression of GRP78, ATF-6, IRE1, PERK, Caspase3 and Caspase-12. In addition, TMT exposure also led to up-regulation of cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and decreased expression of IL-2, IFN-gamma, and antimicrobial peptides Hepcidin, beta-defensin, and LEAP2. However, the addition of TP could mitigate the above changes. In conclusion, TP can alleviate TMT exposure-mediated hepatotoxicity by inhibiting ROS/ER stress in L8824 cells.

In this work, we generated mutants of V. anguillarum defective in FrpA and analyzed their ability to use piscibactin as iron source. The results showed that inactivation of frpA completely disables piscibactin utilization, and the original phenotype could be restored by gene complementation, confirming that FrpA is the OMT that mediates ferri-Pcb uptake. Additionally, the ability of several Pcb thiazole analogues, with different configurations at positions 9, 10, and 13, to be internalized through FrpA, was evaluated measuring their ability to promote growth under iron deficiency of several indicator strains. The results showed that while those analogues with a thiazole ring maintain almost the same activity as Pcb, the maintenance of the hydroxyl group present in natural piscibactin configuration at position C-13 is crucial for Fe3+ chelation and, in consequence, for the recognition of the ferri-siderophore by the cognate OMT.

In particular, by combining analysis of gut microbiota and metabolites, we noticed acetate, a key metabolite, which decreased sharply after exposure to high concentration of CPZ. Expectedly, after supplementing with Bifidobacterium (a core bacterium that produces acetate), we noticed that the acetate content was quickly restored. Further, we also verified that the increase in acetate content after Bifidobacterium supplementation at least partially promoted IL-22 secretion, which in turn stimulated the secretion of beta-defensins (zfbd-1, zfbd-2, zfbd-3), thereby repairing the intestinal damage.

In our previous study, we found that neburon has strong aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist activity, but whether it causes reproductive toxicity is not clear. In the present study, zebrafish were conducted as a model organism to evaluate whether environmental concentrations of neburon (0.1, 1 and 10 pg/L) induce reproductive disorder in males. After exposure to neburon for 150 days from embryo to adult, that the average spawning egg number in high concentration group was 106.40, which was significantly lower than 193.00 in control group. This result was mainly due to the abnormal male reproductive behavior caused by abnormal transcription of genes associated with reproductive behavior in the brain, such as secretogranin-2a. The proportions of spermatozoa in the medium and high concentration groups were 82.40% and 83.84%, respectively, which were significantly lower than 89.45% in control group. This result was mainly caused by hormonal disturbances and an increased proportion of apoptotic cells. The hormonal disruption was due to the significant changes in the transcription levels of key genes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis following neburon treatment. Neburon treatment also significantly activated the AhR signaling pathway, causing oxidative stress damage and eventually leading to a significant increase in apoptosis in the exposed group. Together, these data filled the currently more vacant profile of neburon toxicity and might provide information to assess the ecotoxicity of neburon on male reproduction at environmentally relevant concentrations.

Posttranscriptional gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi), when established in a high throughput system is a potential method for evaluation of molecular targets for new medical compounds or vaccine antigens. Successful use of RNAi has been reported in several stages of salmon lice. However, when we employed a previously described protocol for planktonic stages, no reproducible down-regulation of target genes was gained. In the present study, we describe a robust method for RNAi, where nauplius larvae are soaked in seawater added double stranded RNA (dsRNA). In order to test for when dsRNA may be introduced, and for the efficacy and duration of RNAi, we performed a series of experiments on accurately age determined larvae, ranging from the hatching egg to the copepodid with a salmon louse coatomer and a putative prostaglandin E synthase gene. Presumptive knock-down was monitored by real time PCR. Significant gene silencing was obtained only when nauplius I larvae were exposed to dsRNA during the period in which they molted to nauplius II. A knock down effect could be detected 2 days after soaking, and it remained stable until the last measurement, on day 12. Soaking nauplius I larvae, knock-down was verified for six additional genes with a putative role in molting. For one chitinase, a loss-of-function phenotype with abnormal swimming was obtained. Hence, RNAi, induced in the nauplius, may facilitate studies of the molecular biology of the louse, such as the function of specific genes in developmental processes and physiology, host recognition, host-parasite interaction, and, in extension, the engineering of novel medicines.

Nonetheless, few studies on the antibacterial mechanism of hepcidin in golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) have been reported. In this study, we synthesized a derived peptide, TroHepc2-22, from the mature peptide of T. ovatus hepcidin2. Our results showed that TroHepc2-22 has superior antibacterial abilities against both Gram-negative (Vibrio harveyi and Edwardsiella piscicida) and Grampositive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae) bacteria. Based on the results of a bacterial membrane depolarization assay and propidium iodide (PI) staining assay in vitro, TroHepc2-22 displayed antimicrobial activity by inducing the bacterial membrane depolarization and changing the bacterial membrane permeability. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) visualization illustrated that TroHepc2-22 brought about membrane rupturing and the leakage of the cytoplasm for the bacteria. In addition, TroHepc2-22 was verified to have hydrolytic activity on bacterial genomic DNA in view of the results of the gel retardation assay. In terms of the in vivo assay, the bacterial loads of V. harveyi in the tested immune tissues (liver, spleen, and head kidney) were significantly reduced in T. ovatus, revealing that TroHepc2-22 significantly enhanced the resistance against V. harveyi infection. Furthermore, the expressions of immune-related genes, including tumor necrosis factor-ff (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 1-beta (IL-beta b), IL-6, Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1), and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) were significantly increased, indicating that TroHepc2-22 might regulate inflammatory cytokines and activate immune-related signaling pathways. To summarize, TroHepc2-22 possesses appreciable antimicrobial activity and plays a vital role in resisting bacterial infection.

However, neurobehavioral effects associated with exposure have not been characterized in detail. We investigated the behavioral effects of FM 550 in zebrafish to facilitate the integration of the cellular and molecular effects of FM 550 with its behavioral consequences. The effects of developmental FM 550 exposure on zebrafish larvae swimming shortly after the end of exposure as well as the persisting effects of this exposure on adolescent behavior were studied. In addition, the acute effects of FM 550 on behavior with exposure during adolescence in zebrafish were studied. Methods: Developmental exposure to 0, 0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion spanned 0-5 days post fertilization, with larval testing on day 6 and adolescent testing on days 40-45. Acute adolescent (45 dpf) exposure was to 0, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/L of FM 550 via immersion, for 24 h, with testing 2 h or 1 week later. The vehicle condition was colony tank water with .0004% (developmental) or .0012% (adolescent) DMSO. Zebrafish behavior was characterized across several domains including learning, social affiliation, sensorimotor function, predator escape, and novel environment exploration. Results: Persisting effects of developmental FM 550 exposure included a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in social behavior among all dose groups. Acute FM 550 exposure during adolescence caused hypoactivity and reduced social behavior (p's < 0.05) when the fish were tested 2 h after exposure. These effects were attenuated at the 1 week post exposure testing point. Discussion: Taken together, these data indicate that FM 550 may cause persisting neurobehavioral alterations to social behavior in the absence of perturbations along other behavioral domains and that developmental exposure is more costly to the organism than acute adolescent exposure. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 31; Correspondence Address: E.D.

We examined the effects of brown trout removal using rotenone on zooplankton and phytoplankton community composition in the Upper Karori Reservoir, New Zealand. Significant shifts were observed in zooplankton and phytoplankton composition following removal of brown trout from the reservoir. Shifts in zooplankton community composition did not occur immediately following trout removal (February), but instead followed the likely timing of galaxiid spawning (July). The removal of brown trout likely resulted in reduced predation pressure on galaxiids. A major change occurred in the zooplankton community with the dominance shifting from larger crustaceans to smaller rotifers, indicating an increased predation pressure from the larval native galaxiid. A delayed response in zooplankton community composition change indicates rotenone was not the direct cause of this. A major shift in phytoplankton community composition occurred immediately following trout removal.

Pesticides are important chemicals recurrently applied for enhancing crop yields in agriculture and also for amelioration of vector-borne diseases. Rampant use of these chemicals has led to serious health implications to man and his environment. In developing nations (like India), 76 % of the total pesticide used is harmful insecticide as against just 44 % in the developed countries. This difference in the pesticide usage pattern evidently affects the total cost-benefit ratio between these nations. It is commonly believed by the general public that ‘if little is good, a lot more will be better’. This unchecked and unwise use of pesticides leads to deposition of 95 % of pesticides in soil, water and atmosphere as well as in nontarget organisms. Consequently, pesticide residues have been found in raw as well as processed fruits and vegetables. Pesticides not only kill insects and weeds but also are toxic to a variety of other nontarget organisms like birds, fish, beneficial insects and plants. Soil microflora has also been adversely affected by treatment of soil with pesticides. Xenobiotics, such as pesticides, trigger a defence response in plants. The mechanism by which pesticide is perceived and the signalling is transmitted within plant cells still remains elusive. Various xenobiotics induce oxidative stress and often activate cell signalling pathways, leading to production of stress proteins and upregulation of antioxidants. These changes include the evolution of new metabolic pathways, generation/accumulation of low molecular weight metabolites, synthesis of special proteins, detoxification mechanisms and reduction/elevation in phytohormone levels. Comparison of metabolic pathways, detoxification mechanisms and variance in tolerance level of different plants to pesticides can aid us in designing efficient and cheap vegetative treatment systems for decontaminating soil and water containing pesticide residues. Thus, understanding metabolism of pesticides in plants is necessary for developing strategies for amelioration of their harmful effects in nontarget organisms and also for remediation of contaminated soil, water and atmosphere. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2016.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: S.M.

Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russian Federation""]","One of the most important breakthroughs in the history of genetics and plant breeding was the development of plant cytology and experimental mutagenesis, which later brought about plant cytogenetics and mutation breeding and now they have entered in functional biology era with the unprecedented development of plant molecular cytogenetics, genetics, and functional genomics. Application of cell biology particularly chromosome biology in the fields of plant genome structure and function has ushered the development of plant cytogenomics. Development of advanced technology like DNA base-specific fluorescence banding, GISH, and FISH-based chromosome painting has greatly facilitated the identification, localization, and mapping of chromosome-specific markers in plants, which is of high importance in plant molecular systematics, species identification, detection of hybrid nature, alien chromosomes and chromosomal aberrations, analysis of somaclonal variations, and diversity analysis. The dynamism of chromatin architecture and cell cycle, representing chromosome functional biology, is another important part of plant cytogenomics. On the other hand, mutagenomics is defined as applied mutation breeding, in which genomic information and tools are utilized in the designing of breeding strategies, screening, selection and verification/authentication of natural and induced mutants, and the utilization of desirable mutations in the breeding processes. Considerable progress has been made in recent times in breeding of cereals, legumes, oil seeds, vegetables, horticultural crops, spices and condiments, fiber-yielding plants, and medicinal and aromatic plants for diverse types of desirable agronomic and functional traits including disease and abiotic stress resistance/tolerance; herbicide resistance; lowering of anti-nutritional factors; enhancement of proteins, minerals, vitamins, essential amino acids, flavonoids, antioxidants, and dietary fibers; enrichment of soil nutrition; enhancement of ornamental, medicinal, and aromatic values; and development of functional and therapeutic foods and other diverse traits related to nutritional quality and high yield. This can be found in a mutant population which carries variant forms of potentially each and every gene present in a particular genome. The functionality of mutagenomics is greatly enhanced due to integration of classical mutagenesis with modern “omics” technology through the development of desirable diploid mutants, recombinant inbred lines, and aneuploid and polyploid lines as effective cytogenetic tools, utilizable in genome mapping and analysis. Functional sets of aneuploid tools are now available in different edible plants, through which several morphological, biochemical, and molecular traits/markers have been assigned on definite chromosomes to construct linkage maps. Recently, induced mutations showing alterations in antioxidant defense response have been identified and tested against diverse types of abiotic stresses to reveal intrinsic cellular and metabolic events toward sensitivity of seed plants to salinity, drought, metal toxicity, and other stresses. These mutations are giving vital inputs, which can be used in formulating effective breeding strategies in different agroclimatic conditions. Mutagenized population has revealed altered pattern of genome response and can also be exploited in enhancing production of natural plant products like antioxidants and flavonoids. Furthermore, these large mutant populations have the potential in reverse genetics approach by employing various techniques, particularly “Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomics (TILLING)” technology to better understand gene functions through high-throughput mutation screening, and have been successfully used in major crop plants along with model plant Arabidopsis. The development of mutagenomic approach, thus, provides a cost-effective, clean, and easy-to-use functional tool to increase the genetic diversity and in utilization of this diversity in plant molecular mutation breeding through modern genomic methods. © Springer India 2015.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 12,10.1007/978-81-322-2172-2_5,Breeding,NA,NA,cytogenomics and mutagenomics in plant functional biology and breeding

The growth curves of nematodes were similar to those of controls, suggesting that sesamin did not induce prolongevity effects through dietary restriction. Notably, sesamin made the worms more resistant to infection by Legionella pneumophila and more resistant to oxidative stressors such as paraquat and hydrogen peroxide and prolonged the lifespan of a mev-1 mutant that produces abundant superoxide anions. However, the accumulation of protein carbonyls and lipofuscin was similar in sesamin-exposed and control worms, suggesting that sesamin is unlikely to work simply as an antioxidant. Sesamin supplementation failed to extend the lifespan of loss-of-function mutants of daf-2, daf-16, pmk-1, and skn-1.; Conclusions: Sesamin enhances the host defense of C. elegans and increases the average lifespan via activation of both skn-1 (encoding a component of the p38 MAPK pathway) and daf-16 (encoding a component of the IGF-1 pathway).; Purpose: Nutritional control has been proposed as a potential therapy for slowing the senescence of immune function and decreasing mortality. This study investigated whether sesamin could modify host defense systems and extend the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.; Methods: Nematodes were fed standard food (the bacterium Escherichia coli strain OP50) supplemented with various doses of sesamin/γ-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds starting from young adulthood. The mean lifespan, muscle function, lipofuscin accumulation, protein carbonyl content, and stress resistance of the worms were examined. Then, C. elegans mutants harboring loss-of-function lesions in longevity- and host defense-related signaling pathways were supplemented with sesamin to identify the genes involved in the longevity effects. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 30; CODEN: EJNUF,10.1007/s00394-014-0671-6,"Aging;Host defense;Longevity;Nematodes;Sesamin;Administration, Oral;Animals;Antioxidants;Caenorhabditis elegans;Dioxoles;Escherichia coli;gamma-Cyclodextrins;Insulin-Like Growth Factor I;Legionella pneumophila;Lignans;Oxidative Stress;p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases;Protein Carbonylation;Salmonella enterica;Signal Transduction;Animalia;Bacteria (microorganisms);Nematoda;1,3 dioxolane derivative;antioxidant;gamma cyclodextrin derivative;gamma-cyclodextrin;lignan;mitogen activated protein kinase p38;sesamin;somatomedin C;animal;drug effects;genetics;longevity;metabolism;oral drug administration;oxidative stress;physiology;protein carbonylation;signal transduction",NA,NA,influence of oral supplementation with sesamin on longevity of caenorhabditis elegans and the host defense

Some strains have proven effective as biological control agents and plant-growth promoters, while other strains have been implicated in diseases of a broad range of plant hosts and humans. By analysing the pan-genome of eight sequenced P. ananatis strains isolated from different sources we identified factors potentially underlying its ability to colonize and interact with hosts in both the plant and animal Kingdoms.Results: The pan-genome of the eight compared P. ananatis strains consisted of a core genome comprised of 3,876 protein coding sequences (CDSs) and a sizeable accessory genome consisting of 1,690 CDSs. We estimate that ~106 unique CDSs would be added to the pan-genome with each additional P. ananatis genome sequenced in the future. The accessory fraction is derived mainly from integrated prophages and codes mostly for proteins of unknown function. Comparison of the translated CDSs on the P. ananatis pan-genome with the proteins encoded on all sequenced bacterial genomes currently available revealed that P. ananatis carries a number of CDSs with orthologs restricted to bacteria associated with distinct hosts, namely plant-, animal- and insect-associated bacteria. These CDSs encode proteins with putative roles in transport and metabolism of carbohydrate and amino acid substrates, adherence to host tissues, protection against plant and animal defense mechanisms and the biosynthesis of potential pathogenicity determinants including insecticidal peptides, phytotoxins and type VI secretion system effectors.Conclusions: P. ananatis has an 'open' pan-genome typical of bacterial species that colonize several different environments. The pan-genome incorporates a large number of genes encoding proteins that may enable P. ananatis to colonize, persist in and potentially cause disease symptoms in a wide range of plant and animal hosts. © 2014 De Maayer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 91; Correspondence Address: P.

Propagation was based on stripping of spawners after hormonal induction and rearing of fry in artificial ponds. Fish were injected with acetone-dried carp pituitary extract at a dose of 4.0 mg/kg homogenized in a fish physiological saline. When ovulation was detected, the eggs were stripped and weighed. Eggs were collected from each ovulated female and fertilized with milt from the male. Stickiness of zander eggs was removed before transferring them into Zuger jars. Data collected from four consecutive spawning seasons were analyzed statistically calculating individual and group-based pseudogonadosomatic index (PGSI) values. Reproduction capacity assays were grouped on the basis of three aspects: (1) examination of differences between years, (2) within a reproductive season, and (3) examination of the effects of females’ size. During the four-year trial period eggs were gained from 121 hormonally treated females, 64.7% of the total 187. Based on the data of the investigated period the mean PGSI was 10.7%. At 95% significance level PGSI data of different years were considered to be similar. There were no significant differences between PGSI data collected from different periods of the reproductive season. Previous findings on the positive correlation between the amount of stripped eggs and body weight of females were confirmed (r2=0.103). Correlation was not justified between PGSI and body weight (r2=0.002). Advanced rearing of zander fry in a 2.0 hectare pond was carried out in six consecutive years. Before stocking the nutrient level of the pond was increased by organic manuring and the Copepods were eliminated by insecticides. To prevent cannibalism, four weeks after stocking the advanced fry of zander were harvested. On the basis of the results from six consecutive years, after rearing of advanced fry in a shallow, 2.0 hectare rearing pond for four weeks, the mean survival rate was 13.4 ± 4.37% (mean±SD). By considering our results, breeders can calculate their hatchery's and pond’s production in advance. These results will also be helpful in calculating the total weight of broodstock which must be held in order to produce a specific number of advanced fry. © Published by Central Fisheries Research Institute (CFRI) Trabzon, Turkey.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: T.

Pollutants can affect chemical communication at several levels: production, detection and transmission, and behavioral responses to odors. Several studies using electrophysiological techniques (i.e., EOG and EEG) have demonstrated disturbances in the function of the olfactory receptor cells. In the majority of these studies, the olfactory epithelium was exposed to organic pesticides or heavy metal ions followed by olfactory stimulation with amino acids. Several pesticides and metals decreased electrical responses of the olfactory receptor cells. Another set of studies has addressed effects of pollutants on olfactory-mediated behaviors, and many of these have found effects on social behaviors. Examples also exist of the effects of pollutants on the transmission of odors and resulting effects on behavior responses to alarm cues, conspecific juvenile attractants, and endocrine priming pheromones. Although many fish are dependent on an intact olfactory sense to mediate social interactions, reproduce, detect predators, migrate, and find food, our knowledge of the effects of pollutants is unfortunately very limited. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 5,10.1002/9781118794739.ch10,Behavioral effects;Copper;Cue chemistry;Endocrine disrupting chemicals;Endocrine responsiveness;Manufactured humic acids;Organic pesticides;PH;Receptor sensitivity;Cues,NA,NA,effects of pollutants on olfactory detection and responses to chemical cues including pheromones in fish

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the introduced fish species Gambusia affinis as a bioindicator of environmental pollution in the middle-lower basin of the Suquía River. The assessment was performed by measuring biomarkers at different levels of biological organization, at two sampling sites (before and after Córdoba city), and at dry and wet seasons. Water quality evaluation was made through a water-quality index (based on physico-chemical parameters), heavy-metals and pesticides concentrations in water. The water quality varied between sampling sites, showing the most degraded conditions downstream Córdoba city. The same pattern of variation was detected in the biomarkers studied, mainly in: gill and liver histopathological indexes, copulatory organ (gonopodium) morphology and vitellogenin expression in males and females. The present study characterized the environmental conditions in the middle-lower basin of the Suquía River and revealed the low freshwater quality at the most polluted site. Although G. affinis is an introduced species, it could be considered a good sentinel of water resource quality of invaded Neotropical basins.

Yemen is still in the control phase without sustainable reduction in the proportion of malaria cases. A cross-sectional household survey was carried out in different districts in the southeast of the country to determine malaria prevalence and identify factors that impede progress of the elimination phase.; Methods. Blood specimens were collected from 735 individuals aged 1-66 years. Plasmodium species were detected and identified by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears. A household-based questionnaire was used to collect demographic, socioeconomic and environmental data.; Results: The overall prevalence of malaria was 18.8% with Plasmodium falciparum as the predominant species (99.3%), with a low rate of Plasmodium vivax detected (0.7%). The infection rate was higher in Al-Raydah and Qusyer districts (21.8%) compared to Hajer district (11.8%). Fifty-two percent of the persons positive for Plasmodium were asymptomatic with low parasite density. The adults had a higher infection rate as compared to children. Univariate analysis identified those whose household's head are fishermen (OR = 11.3, 95% CI: 3.13 - 40.5) and farmers (OR = 4.84, 95% CI: 1.73 - 13.6) as high-risk groups. A higher number of positive smears were observed in people living in houses with uncemented brick walls (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.32 - 3.30), without access to toilets (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.05 - 2.32), without a fridge (OR = 1. 6, 95% CI: 1.05 - 2.30), or without TV (OR = 1. 6, (95% CI: 1.05 - 2.30). People living in houses with water collection points located less than 200 meters away were also at higher risk of acquiring malaria (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.05 - 2.30). Knowledge about the importance of using insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) for prevention of malaria was 7% and 2%, respectively.; Conclusions: Several environmental, socioeconomic and behavioral issues were discovered to be the contributing factors to the high prevalence of malaria in southeast Yemen. Novel strategies adapted to the local situations need to be established in order to improve the effectiveness of malaria control. © 2014Bamaga et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 24,10.1186/1756-3305-7-351,"Epidemiology;Hadhramout;KAP;Malaria;Plasmodium;Yemen;Adolescent;Adult;Child;Child, Preschool;Data Collection;Female;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Humans;Malaria, Falciparum;Malaria, Vivax;Male;Questionnaires;Risk Factors;adolescent;adult;aged;agricultural worker;Article;attitude;bed net;blood smear;child;cross-sectional study;demography;environmental factor;female;fisherman;geographic distribution;health education;health survey;high risk population;human;indoor residual spraying;major clinical study;malaria;malaria control;male;microorganism detection;Plasmodium falciparum;Plasmodium vivax;prevalence;questionnaire;risk factor;social status;attitude to health;information processing;preschool child;Prevalence;Southeastern United States",NA,NA,malaria in hadhramout a southeast province of yemen prevalence risk factors knowledge attitude and practices kaps

This allows for subsequent monitoring and evaluation of the project impact on malaria vectors. This study aimed at assessing the vectorial system and malaria transmission in two ecologically different villages of the South-Cameroon forest bloc targeted for the creation of an agro-industrial complex. For four consecutive seasons in 2013, adult mosquitoes were captured using Human Landing Catch in NDELLE village (located along a main road in a degraded forest with many fish ponds) and KOMBO village (located 5km far from the main road in a darker forest and crossed by the Mvobo River). Morpho-taxonomic techniques were used alongside molecular techniques for the identification of mosquito species. ELISA test was used for the detection of circumsporozoite protein antigen of Plasmodium falciparum. Mosquito biting rate was higher in NDELLE than in KOMBO (28.18 versus 17.34 bites per person per night). Mosquitoes had a strong tendency to endophagy both in NDELLE (73.57%) and KOMBO (70.21%). Three anophelines species were identified; An. gambiae, An. funestus s.s and An. moucheti s.s.. An. gambiae and An. funestus s.s. represented the bulk of aggressive mosquitoes in NDELLE (n=10,891; 96.62%). An. gambiae was responsible for 62.6% and 77.72% of malaria transmission in KOMBO and NDELLE respectively. Mean entomological inoculation rate recorded in KOMBO and NDELLE were 4.82 and 2.02 infective bites per person per night respectively. Vector control was mainly based on the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying. The degraded forest environment added to the presence of fishponds resulted in the increase of aggressive mosquito density but not of malaria transmission. The managers should use these data for monitoring and evaluation of the impact of their project; malaria control strategies should be included in their project in order to mitigate the risk of increased malaria transmission as a result of the implementation of their projects. © P.

Fish were divided into 8 groups and treated with NO alone or in combination with CN, vitamin E and clean water. NO interfered with the antioxidant defense system of O. niloticus, as there was a decrease in GST, CAT and SOD activities in all studied organs as compared to control group. These alterations in antioxidants activities were accompanied with the occurrence of histological lesions and damage in gills, liver and posterior kidney tissues. The addition of CN and Vitamin E in fish diets could protect the fish O. niloticus against NO-induced oxidative damage and histopathological changes showing recovery of fish organs.

Abnormal behaviour was observed in fish exposed to 70 μg/l from Day 14. Histological alterations were noticed only in liver in the groups exposed to 40 and 70 μg/l. Significant changes (P < 0.05) in almost all haematological indices were found, especially in the group exposed to the highest concentration of copper (70 μg/l). Biochemical analysis revealed various significant (P < 0.05) differences among the tested groups. Significant differences in copper tissue concentration (P < 0.05) among groups were found in liver, gills and kidney. Among antioxidative enzymes, significant changes were revealed mainly in catalase and glutathione-S-transferase activity (P < 0.05). In gills, metallothionein content increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the group exposed to the highest copper concentration (70 μg/l) compared with the other tested groups, including the control. A significant (P < 0.05) change in total glutathione content was recorded in liver and gills, although the reduced/oxidised ratio was not affected. Oxidative damage to lipids increased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing copper concentration in liver and kidney.

The aim of this study was to explore the potential relationships between organic contaminants accumulated in the soft tissues of juvenile oysters, defence responses and physiological condition. Oysters were transplanted during summer and winter periods in different sites in the Marennes-Oléron Bay, the first area of oyster production in France, and in the Gironde Estuary, the biggest estuary in Occidental Europe. Amongst the battery of biochemical and physiological biomarkers applied in the present work [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondyaldehyde (MDA), catecholase, laccase and lysozyme in gills, digestive glands, mantle and haemolymph, glycogen, proteins and lipids in the digestive gland and the condition index at the whole-organism level], MDA and lysozyme in the digestive gland and SOD, GPx and laccase in plasma contributed in order to significantly discriminate the sites in which oysters bioaccumulated different levels of heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HPAHs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polybromodiphenylethers (PBDEs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and lindane. These results strengthen the hypothesis that it is possible to differentiate sites depending on their contamination levels and biological effects by carrying out studies with transplanted juvenile oysters. In addition, correlations were found between antioxidant and immune-defence responses, and PAH and DDT body burdens in the first area of oyster production in France (the Marennes-Oléron Bay) and where considerable oyster mortalities have been reported. This result suggests that the presence of organic chemical contaminants in the Marennes-Oléron Bay may influence defence responses in juveniles of C. gigas, and, therefore, could influence their ability to resist infectious diseases. gigas. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 36; CODEN: STEVA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.050,"Active biomonitoring;Crassostrea gigas;Immune humoral defences;Oxidative stress;Persistent organic pollutants;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;Animals;Bays;Catalase;Crassostrea;Environmental Monitoring;Estuaries;France;Gills;Glutathione Peroxidase;Hazardous Substances;Malondialdehyde;Muramidase;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic;Seawater;Water Pollutants, Chemical;Aromatic compounds;Aromatic hydrocarbons;Contamination;Enzymes;Hydrocarbons;Impurities;Marine pollution;Molluscs;Organic chemicals;Oxygen;Physiological models;Physiology;Pollution;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Shellfish;catalase;catechol oxidase;chlorphenotane;glutathione peroxidase;glycogen;laccase;lindane;lipid;lysozyme;malonaldehyde;polybromodiphenyl ether;polychlorinated biphenyl;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon;superoxide dismutase;unclassified drug;dangerous goods;sea water;water pollutant;Chemical contaminants;Glutathione peroxidase;Persistent organic pollutant (POP);Physiological biomarkers;Physiological condition;animal tissue;Article;bioaccumulation;biological monitoring;body burden;environmental impact;exocrine gland;gill;hemolymph;host resistance;innate immunity;juvenile animal;nonhuman;organic pollution;physiological process;pollution monitoring;priority journal;tissue distribution;water contamination;animal;bay;environmental monitoring;estuary;metabolism;Organic pollutants;Military Personnel",NA,NA,persistent organic pollutants in a marine bivalve on the marennesoléron bay and the gironde estuary french atlantic coastpart 2 potential biological effects

In aquatic toxicology, fishes have been developed as established models for studying toxic responses of xenobiotics including pesticides. Pendimethalin (PD), an herbicide, is widely present in the aquatic environment, but little is known regarding its potential neurotoxicity in fish. The present study was conducted on Channa punctata Bloch exposed to sub-lethal doses of PD (0.5 and 0.8 ppb) for 96 h. The exposure resulted in alterations in epinephrine levels in the fish brain. Epinephrine levels decreased significantly in a dose dependent manner with increase in the PD exposure. A marked decrease in the activity of acetylcholinesterase along with reduction in Na+-K+-ATPase and monoamine oxidase activity was also observed. In comparison with the corresponding controls, the sub-lethal doses of PD also caused significant changes in the oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxidation and carbonyl derivatives of protein oxidative destruction levels) and antioxidant defenses (reduced glutathione levels, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase activity) in brain tissue. Our results reflect that a detailed investigation is warranted regarding the toxicity potential of PD. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Biocide treatment to eradicate unwanted populations has been tried on small water bodies in the UK and a few other countries. It needs to be applied to the whole water body occupied by crayfish, so partial dewatering may reduce the cost of biocide. The whole population must be in the submerged dosed area, because if some individuals remain in exposed areas they may avoid treatment and hence eradication will not be achieved. This study looks at the response of signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus to exposure of occupied burrows, in tanks and in the banks of a dewatered pond. Some crayfish emerged from exposed burrows by day (34% in tanks, 9% in field); the rest remained in burrows until after dark. In tanks, 96% of crayfish vacated exposed burrows on the first night when submerged burrows were available, but when all burrows were exposed, poorer-quality submerged refuges (open-ended tubes) and competition between crayfish kept subordinate individuals in the damp exposed burrows (32.5%). Subordinates did not vacate exposed burrows until dominant crayfish were removed. In the field, most crayfish emerged in 1-2 nights, but 0.5% remained alive in burrows six nights after exposure. In tank and field, about half of the crayfish climbed up onto dry exposed areas. In light of these findings, we recommend that if dewatering is a precursor to biocide treatment, exposed areas should be tested for presence of crayfish. If dewatering is for other management the potential for terrestrial roaming to other sites should be considered. © 2014 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: S.

To further study this toxin, alpha-Lp1.1 was chemically synthesized and refolded into its globular disulfide isomer. The synthetic Lp1.1 induced seizure and paralysis on freshwater goldfish and selectively reversibly inhibited ACh-evoked currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing rat alpha 3 beta 2 and alpha 6 alpha 3 beta 2 nAChRs.

In this study, we investigated the role of Sting in bacterial infections by successfully creating a sting-deficient (sting((-/-)) with a 4-bp deletion) knockout zebrafish model using CRISPR/Cas9. The transcriptional modulation of genes downstream of cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase)-Sting pathway-related genes was analyzed in seven-day-old wild-type (WT) and sting((-/-)) embryos, as well as in four-day-old LPS-stimulated embryos. The expression of downstream genes was higher in sting(-/-) than in healthy WT fish. The late response was observed in sting((-/-)) larvae following LPS treatment, demonstrating the importance of Sting-induced immunity during bacterial infection by activating the cGAS-STING pathway. Furthermore, adult sting((-/-)) fish had a high mortality rate and significantly downregulated cGAS-STING pathway-related genes during Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida) infection. In addition, we assessed NF-kappa B pathway genes following E. piscicida infection. Our results show fluctuating patterns of interleukin-6 (il6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf alpha) expression, which is likely due to the influence of other NF-kappa B pathway-related immune genes.

The fungus Beauveria bassiana is a biological pesticide that is pathogenic to mosquitoes but harmless to the environment.Results We found a microRNA (miRNA) that can modulate the antifungal immunity of Aedes aegypti by inhibiting its cognate serine protease. Fungal infection can induce the expression of modular serine protease (ModSP), and ModSP knockdown mosquitoes were more sensitive to B. bassiana infection. The novel miRNA-novel-53 is linked to antifungal immune response and was greatly diminished in infected mosquitoes. The miRNA-novel-53 could bind to the coding sequences of ModSP and impede its expression. Double fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that this inhibition occurred in the cytoplasm. The amount of miRNA-novel-53 increased after miRNA agomir injection. This resulted in a significant decrease in ModSP transcript and a significant increase in mortality after fungal infection. An opposite effect was produced after antagomir injection. The miRNA-novel-53 was also knocked out using CRISPR-Cas9, which increased mosquito resistance to the fungus B. bassiana. Moreover, mosquito novel-circ-930 can affect ModSP mRNA by interacting with miRNA-novel-53 during transfection with siRNA or overexpression plasmid.Conclusions Novel-circ-930 affects the expression level of ModSP by a novel-circ-930/miRNA-novel-53/ModSP mechanism to modulate antifungal immunity, revealing new information on innate immunity in insects.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  74,10.1186/s12915-024-01811-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),miRNA;ModSP;Antifungal immunity;Beauveria bassiana;Aedes aegypti;CONSERVED MICRORNA MIR-8;TOLL PATHWAY;HEMOLYMPH PROTEINASE-14;RECOGNITION PROTEIN;PROTEOLYTIC CASCADE;INITIATION ENZYME;MESSENGER-RNAS;CIRCULAR RNAS;ACTIVATION;EXPRESSION;Serine;Fungi,NA,NA,the accumulation of modular serine protease mediated by a novel circrna sponging mirna increases <i>aedes aegypti<i> immunity to fungus

Propagation was based on stripping of spawners after hormonal induction and rearing of fry in artificial ponds. Fish were injected with acetone-dried carp pituitary extract at a dose of 4.0 mg/kg homogenized in a fish physiological saline. When ovulation was detected, the eggs were stripped and weighed. Eggs were collected from each ovulated female and fertilized with milt from the male. Stickiness of zander eggs was removed before transferring them into Zuger jars. Data collected from four consecutive spawning seasons were analyzed statistically calculating individual and group-based pseudo-gonadosomatic index (PGSI) values. Reproduction capacity assays were grouped on the basis of three aspects: (1) examination of differences between years, (2) within a reproductive season, and (3) examination of the effects of females' size. During the four-year trial period eggs were gained from 121 hormonally treated females, 64.7% of the total 187. Based on the data of the investigated period the mean PGSI was 10.7%. At 95% significance level PGSI data of different years were considered to be similar. There were no significant differences between PGSI data collected from different periods of the reproductive season. Previous findings on the positive correlation between the amount of stripped eggs and body weight of females were confirmed (r(2)=0.103). Correlation was not justified between PGSI and body weight (r(2)=0.002). Advanced rearing of zander fry in a 2.0 hectare pond was carried out in six consecutive years.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a broad spectrum insecticide, composed of a mixture of organophosphate plus pyrethroids (fenitrothion 25%, lambda cyhalothrin 2.5% and piperonyl butoxide 6%), on antioxidant status and oxidative stress biomarkers in rat brain. Different insecticide concentrations (0, 0.1,1, 10, 100 and 1000 mM) were incubated with brain homogenate at 37 degrees C for time intervals (0, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min). Exposure to insecticide mixture resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), which might be associated with decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase activities and beside protein content in rat brain. However, a significant induction of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities was observed. The response was concentration and time dependent. Results showed that the used insecticides had the propensity to cause significant oxidative damage in rat brain, which is associated with marked perturbations in antioxidant defense system in addition to antioxidant enzymes can be used as potential biomarkers of toxicity associated with pesticides exposure.

Microplastic (MP) and nanoplastic (NP) particles are pollutants that are present in the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at virtually every level of the food chain. Moreover, recently, airborne microplastic particles have been shown to reach and potentially damage respiratory systems. Microplastics and nanoplastics have been shown to cause increased oxidative stress, inflammation, altered metabolism leading to cellular damage, which ultimately affects tissue and organismal homeostasis in numerous animal species and human cells. However, the full impact of these plastic particles on living organisms is not completely understood. The ability of MPs/NPs to carry contaminants, toxic chemicals, pesticides, and bioactive compounds, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals, present an additional risk to animal and human health. This review will discusses the current knowledge on pathways by which microplastic and nanoplastic particles impact reproduction and reproductive behaviors from the level of the whole organism down to plastics-induced cellular defects, while also identifying gaps in current knowledge regarding mechanisms of action.

Results show that exposure to I nmol/L to 100 nmol/L of MC-LR decreased sperm motility and number of sperm cells and increased the sperm abnormality rate, whose values were significantly different from those of the control (P < 0.01). Moreover, the same dosage of MC-LR increased reactive oxygen species production and malondialdehyde content. At the same time, antioxidant enzyme (catalase and glutathione S-transferase) activity and glutathione reduced content rapidly increased, whereas antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase activity significantly decreased. These results imply that the defense system of the testes quickly responds to oxidative stress. Ultrastructural observation shows distention of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus and changes in the mitochondrial matrix color, cristae number, and morphology. Moreover, using real-time PCR, increased relative expressions of P450 aromatase and SF-1 genes were observed.

In this study, C. albicans infection model was developed in zebrafish to understand the host-pathogen interactions for straightforward anticandidal drug screening. Methods To develop the infection, 1 x 10(6 )cells of C. albicans suspended in phosphate-buffered saline were deposited in zebrafish dorsal muscle by manually operated syringe. The infection progression was externally assessed by a scale of wound-healing events, based on visible changes of yeast deposited in the muscle tissues. Chemotherapy was carried out with known antifungal drugs (fluconazole, nystatin, and amphotericin B) and a potential antifungal agent, chitosan silver nanocomposites (CAgNC), after the infection as direct exposure in the water. Histopathological analysis was performed to identify the pathogen virulence and the host-pathogen interaction during the infection. Results The light microscopic observations and histopathological analysis revealed the yeast-hyphae transition at the site of infection (at 72 hpi) and progression of the infection in the host tissues. The larval survival rate under fluconazole (up to 80 mu g mL(-1)) and nystatin (up to 20 mu g mL(-1)) was > 90% and for CAgNC it was 40% at 36 h post-exposure (hpe). The infection progression was suppressed with the fungicidal treatments. Among inflammatory genes, il-1 beta has been highly upregulated (14.68-fold) at 24 h post infection (hpi). Both il-1 beta and tnf-alpha were moderately upregulated in infected fish gills at 72 hpi. Among the C. albicans antioxidant genes, cat1 and sod2 have been upregulated during the infection, and relative expression folds were increased from low to moderate levels with the time.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloro-ethane (DDT) and its metabolites (DDX), hexachlorbenzene (HCB) and isomers of hexachlocyklohexane (HCHs) have been monitored in the breast milk of nursing mothers in the Czech Republic since 1994 as a part of The Environmental Health Monitoring System. Knowledge about long-term POPs distribution and accumulation in the human body is crucial to understanding uptake, degradation and subsequent effects as well as to conduct risk assessments. The main aim of this study is to evaluate 15-years long-term trends of selected POPs in human milk in the Czech Republic and to elucidate the questionnaire information about the age, parity and social habits, to the final concentrations. This effectiveness evaluation of POPs restriction is quite precisely after 15-years monitoring campaigns.        The human milk samples (4,753 samples) were analysed for a number of chlorinated organic chemicals including PCBs and selected chlorinated pesticides (OCPs, HCB, HCHs, DDX). The relative change of concentration per year for all chemicals was analysed. The remaining percentages of POPs in breast milk in comparison to 1994 are also expressed. Czech population half-lives of POPs in breast milk, derived from either linear or exponential models were computed.        The long-term data indicates a continuation of a decreasing trend of POPs concentrations on breast milk. Our study did not confirm lactation and parity as an important outflux resulting in the decrease in concentrations in mothers, which is in the antagonism with most of the studies.

Leukocytes were separated from the head kidney and peripheral blood using Percoll density centrifugation. A flow cytometric analysis revealed that GBP binds with many cells and a variety of cell types including lymphocytes, granulocytes and thrombocytes. Intracellular calcium flux of the peripheral blood leukocytes induced by stimulation with GBP was confirmed by counting the fluo-3 loaded cells whose fluorescence increased after the stimulation using flow cytometry. The percentage of cells in which a calcium flux was induced peaked 1 min after the stimulation. Approximately 6% of the cells specifically responded I min after the stimulation. The proliferation response was determined by the level of BrdU uptake by the leukocytes after the stimulation. Cell proliferation was observed 2, 4 and 6 days after stimulation with GBP. The expression of cytokines IL-1beta and TGF-beta1 in the peripheral blood leukocytes, after the stimulation was evaluated by a semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Increased expression of IL-1beta was observed 4 h after stimulation with GBP. Variation of TGF-beta1 expression under the same conditions was not observed. The kinetics of intracellular calcium flux and the level of IL-1beta expression induced by GBP stimulation were different front those induced by phytohemagglutinin stimulation. These results confirmed that GBP is a pathogenic microbial component that can induce cell activation. GBP seems to induce the inflammatory response observed in the Aphanomyces infection.

In this study, we systematically deleted all of the 9 established T3SS effectors in E. piscicida (aka 9 Delta) and the rpoS gene encoding the alternative sigma factor, the esrB repressor (10 Delta), then we overexpressed esrB and T3SS in E. piscicida to obtain the recombinant strain 10 Delta/esrB(OE). The modified strains 10 Delta and 10 Delta/esrB(OE) exhibited severe attenuation and in vivo colonization defects. Additionally, vaccination by intraperitoneal injection with 10 Delta and 10 Delta/esrB(OE) could significantly upregulate the expression of the antigen recognition related gene (TLR5) and the adaptive immune response-related gene (MHC II) in the spleen/kidney of turbot fish, and it also enhanced the hosts' serum bactericidal capacity. Finally, vaccination with 10 Delta/esrB(OE) led to increased immune protection against the challenge of wild type E. piscicida EIB202 in turbot fish.

In this study, using RNA-seq technology, we globally found and identified sRNA candidates expressed from E. piscicida grown in normal LB medium, acid pressure, iron deficiency stress, and oxidation pressure. A total of 148 sRNAs were found, including 19 previously annotated sRNAs and 129 novel sRNA candidates by searching against the Rfam database. Compared in normal condition, the expression of 103 sRNAs (DEsRNA, differentially expressed sRNA) and 1615 mRNAs (DEmRNAs, differentially expressed mRNA) showed significant differences in three stress sample. Based on the prediction by IntaRNA and relational analysis between DEsRNAs and DEmRNAs, 103 DEsRNAs were predicted to regulate 769 target mRNAs. Pleiotropic function of target DEmRNAs indicated that sRNAs extensively participated in a variety of physiological processes, including response to adversity and pathogenicity, the latter was further confirmed by infection experiment. A large number transcription factors appeared in target genes of sRNAs, which suggested that sRNAs likely deeply interlaced within complex gene regulatory networks of E. piscicida. Moreover, 49 Hfq-associated sRNAs were also identified in this study. In summary, we globally discovered sRNAs for the first time in pathogenic bacteria of fish, and our findings indicated that sRNAs in E. piscicida have important roles in adaptation to environmental stress and pathogenicity.

The studies were compared against each other, and against comparable data from other geographic locales.  A total of seven major categories of exposure sequelae were evaluated.  These ranged from the effects of primary exposure to contaminants upon maternal health status, to effects from secondary intrauterine fetal exposure, including alterations in birth size and gestational age, changes in neonatal health status, and effects persisting into early infancy.  Results of the evaluations suggest that the causal hypothesis may be strongly affirmed for the relationship between PCB exposure and transplacental passage of PCB molecules.  The relationship between PCB exposure and alterations in both neonatal health status and in health status in early infancy may be affirmed with reasonable certainty.  While the evidence from the Michigan Maternal/Infant Cohort related to maternal exposure to PCB and infant size at birth and gestational age affirms the causal hypothesis, studies from other geographic locales tend only to be supportive.  Analytic differences are likely responsible for this variation, but epidemiologically, the composite rating must be regarded as indeterminate.  The relationship with observed alterations in maternal health status, composite activity ranking, and McCarthy Memory Scale deficits were also classified as indeterminate.

Animals were exposed for 24 and 96 h to the following nominal concentrations of chlorothalonil: 0.1, 10.0 and 100.0 mu g/L. The antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and the activity of the enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and propionylcholinesterase (PChE) were evaluated in whole-body tissue. In addition, the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPO), glycogen and lactate levels were also analyzed. A reduction in ACAP levels was observed in animals exposed to the higher chlorothalonil concentration, concomitantly with an induction of GST activity as well as diminution in GSH content in these animals. This disturbance in the redox state of animal tissues leads to an oxidative stress situation, resulting in an induction in LPO levels. It was also demonstrated that chlorothalonil exposure causes alteration in AChE activity, possibly related to damage to membrane lipids.

Their residues and transformed products, released in the environment are toxic to both terrestrial and aquatic life. This necessitates remediation of wastewaters containing such hazardous chemicals to reduce threat to human health and environment. Bioremediation technologies using microorganisms become the present day choice. High Melting Explosive (HMX) is one of the nitroexplosives produced by nitration of hexamine using ammonium nitrate and acetic anhydride and hence the wastewater bears high concentration of nitrate and acetate. The present investigation describes potential of a soil isolate of yeast Pichia sydowiorum MCM Y-3, for remediation of HMX wastewater in fixed film bioreactor (FFBR). The flask culture studies showed appreciable growth of the organism in HMX wastewater under shake culture condition within 5-6 days of incubation at ambient temperature (28 +/- A 2A degrees C). The FFBR process operated in both batch and continuous mode, with Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) of 1 week resulted in 50-55% removal in nitrate, 70-88% in acetate, 50-66% in COD, and 28-50% in HMX content. Continuous operation of the reactor showed better removal of nitrate as compared to that in the batch operation, while removal of acetate and COD was comparable in both the modes of operation of the reactor. Insertion of baffles in the reactor increased efficiency of the reactor. Thus, FFBR developed with baffles and operated in continuous mode will be beneficial for bioremediation of high nitrate and acetate containing wastewater using the culture of P. sydowiorum.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  33,10.1007/s10295-008-0493-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Bioremediation;Pichia sydowiorum;Fixed film bioreactor;Nitrate;Nitroexplosive;MARINE SEDIMENT;BIODEGRADATION;OCTAHYDRO-1,3,5,7-TETRANITRO-1,3,5,7-TETRAZOCINE;EXPLOSIVES;BACTERIA;HMX;HEXAHYDRO-1,3,5-TRINITRO-1,3,5-TRIAZINE;REMEDIATION;DEGRADATION;METABOLISM;Yeasts",NA,NA,bioremediation of nitroexplosive wastewater by an yeast isolate <i>pichia sydowiorum<i> mcm y3 in fixed film bioreactor

Environmental exposure to contaminants may affect their capacity to respond to challenging conditions, to progress in a normal ontogenesis, and finally to survive and succeed in completing metamorphosis. We studied the effects of the exposure to two anticholinesterase agents, the carbamate carbaryl and the organophosphate azinphos methyl, on the antioxidant defenses of developing embryos of the toad Rhinella (Bufo) arenarum. Reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were increased early by carbaryl, but were decreased by both pesticides at the end of embryonic development. The GSH-dependent enzymes glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidases showed oscillating activity patterns that could be attributed to an induction of activity in response to oxidative stress and inactivation by excess of reactive oxygen species. Glutathione-S-transferases, which may participate in the conjugation of lipid peroxide products in addition to pesticide detoxification, showed an increase of activity at the beginning and at the end of development. Catalase also showed variations in the activity suggesting, successively, induction and inactivation in response to pesticide exposure-induced oxidative stress. Superoxide dismutase activity was increased by carbaryl and transiently decreased by azinphos methyl exposure. judging from the depletion in GSH levels and glutathione reductase inhibition at the end of embryonic development, the oxidative stress caused by azinphos methyl seemed to be greater than that caused by carbaryl, which might be in turn related with a higher number of developmental alterations caused by the organophosphate. GSH content is a good biomarker of oxidative stress in the developing embryos exposed to pesticides. The antioxidant enzymes are in turn revealing the balance between their protective capacity and the oxidative damage to the enzyme molecules, decreasing their activity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It can exert several actions on the immune system, growth and cellular metabolism, establishing a fine-tune regulation stress response and cross-talk interactions with other regulatory pathways. In this study, we investigated a causal relationship between high levels of glucocorticoids and susceptibility to pathogens and modification of gene expression profiles in Senegalese sole. For this purpose, we carried out two experiments using post-metamorphic individuals (21 days after hatching) that were exposed to dexamethasone (DXM), a potent glucocorticoid, in order to mimic cortisol effects. We quantified transcript levels of a wide set of genes involved in innate immune system (g-type lysozyme and hepcidin (hamp1)), HPI axis (crf, crfbp, pomc alpha, pomc beta, gr1 and gr2), HPT axis (tgb), cellular stress defense system (hsp70 and hsp90a), GH/IGF axis (igf-I and igf-Ir) and the neuropeptide trh. Short-term exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 ppm DXM provoked a reduction of pomc beta transcripts and an increase of crfbp mRNAs in a dose-dependent manner at 48 and 72 h after treatment. Moreover, g-type lysozyme transcript levels decreased significantly at 72 h whereas ham p I mRNA levels increased at 48 h after exposure. Long-term DXM treatment (10 ppm DXM) affected negatively weight of soles (similar to 20% lower than controls). Moreover, reduced mRNA levels were observed for pomcg after 1 week and igf-I and hampl after 2 weeks. In contrast, crfbp and crf increased mRNA levels after 2 weeks. hsp70 exhibited a dual response increasing transcript levels at 1 week after treatment and reducing thereafter. No significant changes in gene expression were observed at any time during this study for tgb, trh, hsp90a, pomca, gr1 and gr2. Finally, a challenge experiment using the pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp piscicida confirmed earlier and higher mortalities in DXM-treated animals. Taken together, these data indicate that a prolonged exposure to DXM increases the susceptibility to pathogens and reduces growth. Moreover, DXM can trigger a wide cellular response modulating the expression of genes involved in the innate immune system, HPI and GH/IGF axes as well as cellular stress defense. These results are highly valuable to evaluate responses associated to aquaculture stressful conditions and discriminate specific glucocorticoid-mediated effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The deletion (DEL) assay scoring for DNA deletions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to detect a wide range of carcinogens. Among approximately 60 compounds of known carcinogenic activity, the DEL assay detected 86% correctly whereas the Ames Salmonella assay detected only 30% correctly [R.J. Brennan, R.H. Schiestl, Detecting carcinogens with the yeast DEL assay, Methods Mol. Biol. 262 (2004) 111- 124]. Since the DEL assay is highly inducible by DNA double strand breaks, this study examined the utility of the DEL assay for detecting clastogens. Ten model compounds, with varied mechanisms of genotoxicity, were examined for their effect on the frequency of DNA deletions with the DEL assay. The compounds tested were: actinomycin D, camptothecin, methotrexate and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, which are anticancer agents, noscapine and furosemide are therapeutics, acridine, methyl acrylate and resorcinol are industrial chemicals and diazinon is an insecticide. The in vitro micronucleus assay (IVMN) in CHO cells, a commonly used tool for detection of clastogens, was performed on the same compounds and the results of the two assays were compared. The results of our study show that there is 70% concordance in the presence of metabolic activation (rat liver S9) and 80% concordance in the absence of metabolic activation between the DEL assay and the standard in vitro micronucleus assay. The lack of cytotoxicity observed for four of the ten compounds examined indicates limited diffusion of lipophilic compounds across the yeast cell wall. Thus, the development of a more permeable yeast tester strain is expected to greatly improve concordance of the DEL assay with the IVMN assay. The yeast DEL assay is inexpensive, amenable to automation and requires less expertise to perform than the IVMN. Thus, it has a strong potential as a robust, fast and economical screen for detecting clastogens in vitro. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The most serious parasite of Penaeus spp. is Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (Microsporidia: Enterocytozoonidae). Apostome ciliates are negatively impacting Pandalus borealis of the northeastern United States (Synophrya sp. that causes ""white eggs"" or Black Spot Gill Syndrome) and Penaeus spp. from the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Hyalophysa lynni that causes shrimp black gill). In freshwater fish, the larvae of the nematode Eustrongylides spp. Jagerskiold, 1909 (Nematoda: Dioctophymidae) absorbed lead (Pb), mercury, and cadmium, when the metal levels were close to zero in water and sediment. The concentration of Pb in the larvae was approximately 17 times higher than in the fish. Like the antioxidant defense reactions in the parasitized A. parthenogenetica exposed to As, an improved antioxidant defense system may be available in parasitized fish, limiting oxidative damage caused by metals. This study presents baseline concentrations of 30 metals in wild Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931 from Ecuador and other species, as well as the current taxonomy for selected shellfish species and their parasites. Research is needed to assess the relationship of metals in parasites and host tissues, and oxidative stress in shellfish. The tools of One Health including molecular ecology, population genomics, proteomics, and epigenetic epidemiology should be used to detect parasites and environmental pollution indicators that could threaten aquatic species from freshwater and marine ecosystems, particularly considering climate change and pollution threats.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  203,10.2983/035.040.0313     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),parasites;metals;Eustrongylides spp. larvae;Penaeus spp.;Pandalus borealis;Crassostrea virginica;Crassostrea gigas;shrimp black gill;Hyalophysa lynni;black spot gill syndrome;Synophrya sp.;Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei;Haplosporidium nelsoni;Perkinsus marinus;pollution indicators;GLYPHOSATE-BASED HERBICIDE;HEAVY-METALS;HEMATODINIUM-PEREZI;BLACK GILL;HISTOPATHOLOGICAL SURVEY;POMPHORHYNCHUS-LAEVIS;RISK-ASSESSMENT;SHRIMP;FISH;CADMIUM;Military Personnel,NA,NA,a comparative study on metals and parasites in shellfish of freshwater and marine ecosystems

The isolated strain was identified as Pseudoalteromonas ruthenica. In vivo experiments were con-ducted with P. ruthenica-immersed larvae and P. ruthenica-enriched Artemia fed to adult zebrafish. Disease tolerance of larval zebrafish against Edwardsiella piscicida was demonstrated by 66.34% cumulative per cent survival (CPS) in the P. ruthenica-exposed group, which was higher than the CPS of the control (46.67%) at 72 h post challenge (hpc). Heat-stressed larvae had 55% CPS in the P. ruthenica-immersed group, while the control had 30% CPS at 60 hpc. Immune-stress response gene transcripts (muc5.1, muc5.2, muc5.3, alpi2, alpi3, hsp70, and hsp90a) were induced, while pro-inflammatory genes (tnf alpha, il1b, and il6) were downregulated in P. ruthenica- immersed larvae compared to the control. This trend was confirmed by low pro-inflammatory and high stress -responsive protein expression levels in P. ruthenica-exposed larvae. Adult zebrafish had higher CPS (27.2%) in the P. ruthenica-fed group than the control (9.52%) upon E. piscicida challenge, suggesting increased disease tolerance. Histological analysis demonstrated modulation of goblet cell density and average villus height in the P. ruthenica-supplemented group. Metagenomics analysis clearly indicated modulation of alpha diversity indices and the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in the P. ruthenica-supplemented zebrafish gut. Furthermore, increased Firmicutes colonisation and reduced Bacteroidetes abundance in the gut were observed upon P. ruthenica supplementation.

Its potential toxicological effects have received extensive attention but remain to be poorly understood. In this study, changes in NDEA precursors in drinking water treatment process were studied using the trial of its formation potential (FP), and the toxicity induced by NDEA to adult zebrafish was investigated. NDEA FP in the raw water of Taihu Lake ranged from 46.9 to 68.3 ng/L. The NDEA precursors were removed effectively by O-3/BAC process. Hydrophilic fraction and low-molecular-weight fraction (<1 kDa) had the highest NDEA FP. The toxicity results demonstrated that the acute lethal concentration of NDEA causing 50% mortality in 96 h (96-h LC50) was 210.4 mg/L, and NDEA was more likely to be accumulated in kidney, followed by liver and gill. NDEA induced oxidative stress and antioxidant defense to zebrafish metabolism system at concentrations over 5 mu g/L. After a 42-day exposure, a significant DNA damage was observed in zebrafish liver cells at NDEA concentrations beyond 500 a.

The period of sexual differentiation of gonads, brain, and behavior is probably the most sensitive to the influence of endocrine modulation. Exposure to small quantities of exogenous hormones during the critical periods for sexual differentiation can result in severe and permanent alterations in gonad and brain development and in subsequent adult reproductive behavior. Relatively great concentrations of organochlorine chemicals are generally required to illicit effects that are less dramatic than those caused by exogenous hormones. Female-female pairings and low male/female ratios in some gull populations may be related to endocrine disruption by environmental contaminants, but any mechanism that could cause differential male mortality in gull populations may be a viable alternate explanation. The mechanism by which some organochlorine contaminants cause eggshell thinning is complex and may vary among sensitive avian species. The modulation of calcium homeostasis may be involved, as the transport of calcium from the eggshell gland mucosa to the lumen fluid has been implicated as a proximate cause of eggshell thinning. The modulation of thyroid hormone homeostasis by xenobiotics is a possible cause of goiter in some wildlife populations. The histological presentation of goiter can vary depending upon the etiologic agent responsible. Histological criteria were used to rule out polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as a possible cause of goiter in a population of Great Lakes herring gulls.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  0,,Xenobiotics,NA,NA,xenobiotic modulation of endocrine function in birds

The evolution of resistance (a heritable decrease in susceptibility to Bt toxins) can pose a threat to sustained control of target pests, but a high-dose refuge (HDR) management strategy has been key to delaying countervailing evolution of Bt resistance. The HDR strategy relies on the mating frequency between susceptible and resistant individuals, so either partial dominance of resistant alleles or nonrandom mating in the pest population itself could elevate the pace of resistance evolution. Using classic Wright-Fisher genetic models, we investigated the impact of deviations from standard refuge model assumptions on resistance evolution in the pest populations. We show that when Bt selection is strong, even deviations from random mating and/or strictly recessive resistance that are below the threshold of detection can yield dramatic increases in the pace of resistance evolution. Resistance evolution is hastened whenever the order of magnitude of model violations exceeds the initial frequency of resistant alleles. We also show that the existence of a fitness cost for resistant individuals on the refuge crop cannot easily overcome the effect of violated HDR assumptions. We propose a parametrically explicit framework that enables both comparison of various field situations and model inference.

Recent phylogenomic investigations have determined that bacteria historically classified as Edwardsiella tarda actually represent three genetically distinct yet phenotypically ambiguous taxa with various degrees of pathogenicity in different hosts. Previous recognition of these taxa was hampered by the lack of a distinguishing phenotypic character. Commercial test panel configurations are relatively constant over time, and as new species are defined, appropriate discriminatory tests may not be present in current test panel arrangements. While phenobiochemical tests fail to discriminate between these taxa, data presented here revealed discriminatory peaks for each Edwardsiella species using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) methodology, suggesting that MALDI-TOF can offer rapid, reliable identification in line with current systematic classifications. Furthermore, a multiplex PCR assay was validated for rapid molecular differentiation of the Edwardsiella spp. affecting fish. Moreover, the limitations of relying on partial 16S rRNA for discrimination of Edwardsiella spp. and advantages of employing alternative single-copy genes gyrB and sodB for molecular identification and classification of Edwardsiella were demonstrated.

This article proposes two contributions: (i) a metric learning algorithm and (ii) a representation of images as object probability maps, that are both optimized for detection. We show experimentally that these two contributions are crucial to DDD, do not require costly additional operations, and in some cases yield comparable or better results than state-of-the-art detectors despite conceptual simplicity and increased speed.

Acute toxicity of 2,4-D herbicide was investigated through its effects on guppies (Poecilia vivipara Bloch et Schneider 1801). Fish were exposed to the herbicide at concentrations of 10, 20 and 40μl per liter of water for 24 hours to determine its effects on gills and liver epithelia. The estimated LC50 was 34.64μl of 2,4-D per liter of water. Histochemical analyses and Feulgen's reaction were conducted to detect glycoconjugates and DNA, respectively, in gills and liver epithelia. Histochemistry revealed qualitative variations of glycoconjugates present on mucous cells and granules. The four types of mucous cells contained neutral granules, acids, or both. Increasing amounts of syalomucins were observed from the control group to the group exposed to the highest concentration of 2,4-D, suggesting increased mucous viscosity and the formation of plaques that could inhibit gas exchange and osmoregulation. Lamellar fusion observed in the group exposed to 40μl of 2,4-D suggests a defense mechanism. Hepatocytes showed vacuolization in the 10 and 20μl/L groups. The 40 μl/L group showed normal hepatocytes as well as changed ones, many Ito cells, micronuclei, and nuclear swelling. These effects may be associated with toxicity or adaptative processes to cellular stress. The data from this study indicates the importance of assessing similar risks to aquatic species and suggests that Poecilia vivipara is an adequate biological model for analysis of environmental contamination.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 22; Correspondence Address: A.F.

The survival capacity of P. putida stems from its frequent exposure to various endogenous and exogenous oxidative stresses. Oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of interactions with various reactive oxygen species (ROS)-inducing agents existing in various niches. ROS could facilitate the evolution of bacteria by mutating genomes. Aerobic bacteria maintain defense mechanisms against oxidative stress throughout their evolution. To overcome the detrimental effects of oxidative stress, P. putida has developed defensive cellular systems involving induction of stress-sensing proteins and detoxification enzymes as well as regulation of oxidative stress response networks. Genetic responses to oxidative stress in P. putida differ markedly from those observed in Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. Two major redox-sensing transcriptional regulators, SoxR and OxyR, are present and functional in the genome of P. putida. However, the novel regulators FinR and HexR control many genes belonging to the E. coli SoxR regulon. Oxidative stress can be generated by exposure to antibiotics, and iron homeostasis in P. putida is crucial for bacterial cell survival during treatment with antibiotics. This review highlights and summarizes current knowledge of oxidative stress in P. putida, as a model soil bacterium, together with recent studies from molecular genetics perspectives. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 87; Correspondence Address: W.

Two districts from each Regional State, 4 peasant associations (PAs) from each district and 10 households from each PA were purposively selected based on availability and recognition in the area of M. ferruginea. Data were collected using questionnaire. The period from February to May was reported as critical feed shortage seasons and SNNPRS respondents noted M. ferruginea as a feed resource was used to balance deficits during times of feed shortage. All respondents from SNNPRS and about 41% from ANRS used M. ferruginea as livestock feed. Some respondents from ANRS were however, unaware of the use of M. ferruginea as animal feed. Leaves, flowers and twigs of M. ferruginea were mentioned as edible parts of the plant by cattle, sheep and goats. Feeding M. ferruginea in mixture with other feedstuffs is a common practice in SNNPRS, while the sole M. ferruginea is fed in ANRS. All respondents from SNNPRS had a positive impression on the feeding value of M. ferruginea and indicated improved growth and milk output, no abortion, health problem and deaths of animals was observed due to M. ferruginea feeding. Conversely, the level of understanding of the feeding value of M. ferruginea in ANRS appeared to be low.

With the advance in various technologies, food production has dramatically increased in quantity but not necessarily in quality. The public has become more concerned about the risks from food hazards in recent years. So it is important to assess the level of awareness and food safety concerns amongst the public and to study how they perceived the risk aspects of several food safety issues. A survey was carried out on the general public (550 respondents) in the Klang Valley region, stratified according to their occupation classification by Malaysian Standard Classification of Occupations 1998. Risk perception was measured using self-developed questionnaires with seven point Likert scales. The Malaysian public was found to be highly attentive to food safety issues, but they only have moderate knowledge on food safety and divided on how to choose quality food. The level of awareness towards several food safety issues varies. Only food preservatives and pesticide residues were perceived as familiar. All six food safety issues were perceived as risky by the respondents and need high level of regulation. The level of perceived benefits and encouragement differed across food safety issues. GM palm oil and GM soybean were the only food safety issues perceived as beneficial and were moderately encouraged. The level of confidence towards Malaysian regulatory body related to food safety among the respondents who were aware about its existence was moderate. It can be concluded that the public perceived and assessed food risks as a complex and sensitive expressions of their value system as well as multi-dimensional. Results from this study provide some insights into the social acceptance of food-related technologies in developing countries that can be adopted by food scientists, food industries and government regulatory bodies in developing suitable risk communication strategies.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: L.

The upper Sacramento River bloom was dominated by chlorophytes, but biomass and photosynthetic efficiency (based on variable fluorescence, Fv/Fm) precipitously declined downstream when cells were exposed to sewage effluent and NH4+ levels>70μM-N. Further downriver, substantial rates of nitrification occurred, based on increasing levels of NO3- and NO2- in proportion to decreasing NH4+ concentrations, reducing NH4+ levels to <10μM-N. The other major tributary, the San Joaquin River, had extremely high nutrient levels (NO3->400μM-N, PO43->13μM-P, but NH4+~2μM-N), very low chlorophyll a levels (~3μgL-1) and low Fv/Fm values, but elevated bacterial production, suggesting presence of an algal inhibitor, possibly an herbicide. Both rivers converge above Suisun Bay, where elevated NO3- (>50μM-N), sufficient PO43- (>3μM-P), and reduced NH4+ levels (as low as 6μM-N), and reduced flow created conditions conducive to a spatially large and physiologically healthy (elevated Fv/Fm) diatom bloom dominated by the species Entomoneis sp. We conceptualize this bloom as a ""window of opportunity"" response by these diatoms to multiple factors promoted by the drought, including longer residence time for cell growth and biomass accumulation, and longer time for in-river nitrification to occur, reducing sewage-derived NH4+ to a level where diatoms could access NO3- for uptake and growth. We suggest that management practices that favor higher rates of flow may narrow the ""window of opportunity"" for phytoplankton growth, potentially leading to low productivity and food limitation for fish. Under high flow, a condition of ""washout"" may develop where both chlorophyll and unassimilated nutrients are transported out of the bay, and the phytoplankton that do develop are less favorable in terms of community composition for supporting the upper food web. © 2014.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 42; Correspondence Address: P.M.

The CASMATZ simulates the daily production of 20 periphyton and 6 aquatic vascular plant species. The modeled consumer community consists of 17 functionally defined species of zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, bacteria, and fish. Daily values of population biomass (grams of carbon per square meter) are calculated as nonlinear functions of population bioenergetics, physical-chemical environmental parameters, grazing/predator-prey interactions, and population-specific direct and indirect responses to atrazine. The CASMATZ uses Monte Carlo methods to characterize the implications of phenotypic variability, environmental variability, and uncertainty associated with atrazine toxicity data in estimating the potential impacts of time-varying atrazine exposures on population biomass and community structure. Comparisons of modeled biomass values for plants and consumers with published data indicate that the generic reference simulation realistically describes ecological production in lower-order midwestern streams. Probabilistic assessments were conducted using the CASMATZ to evaluate potential modeled changes in plant community structure resulting from measured atrazine exposure profiles in 3 midwestern US streams representing watersheds highly vulnerable to runoff. Deviation in the median values of maximum 30-d average Steinhaus similarity index ranged from 0.09% to 2.52% from the reference simulation. The CASMATZ could therefore be used for the purposes of risk assessment by comparison of site monitoring-based model output to a biologically relevant Steinhaus similarity index level of concern. Used as a generic screening technology or in site-specific applications, the CASMATZ provides an effective, coherent, and transparent modeling framework for assessing ecological risks posed by pesticides in lower-order streams. © 2013 SETAC.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: S.M.

In this article, the effect of methyl parathion on the fighting behaviour of male Siamese fighting fish was investigated. The frequency and duration of opercular erection were taken as indicators of male aggressiveness towards another male. All male fish were housed in glass jars for 1-2 weeks prior to experiments. Sixteen naive males were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: methyl parathion (5 mg/L) and control. Males were placed in their respective treatment jars for 24 h, and then, each male was paired with another male of matching size in an 30x25x25 cm aquarium. The aquarium had an opaque divider to keep the two males separate for 10 min of acclimation period. The divider was then removed and behavioural measurements were taken for another 10 min. The results showed that fish placed in methyl parathion had significantly lower aggressive behavlour, as indicated by lower frequency and shorter duration of opercular erection.

Various stressors have been implicated as contributory factors, including increased bottom temperatures, extensive eutrophication with commensurate hypoxia, storm-induced thermal destratification, possible exposures to pesticides and metals, and fishery-induced stressors. Such stressors increase host susceptibility by weakening the host immune defenses and act to increase the transmission and severity of pathogens. The lobster mortality in western LIS in 1999 was linked to Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis, but a complex of stressors resulted in outright mortality from hypoxia or consequent immune suppression that increased susceptibility to the ameba. Similar stressors have been implicated in the etiology of epizootic shell disease and calcinosis. The role of environmental stressors has been hard to delineate, but recent declines in landings indicate that epizootic shell disease has had a negative impact on the lobster population in LIS. Calcinosis, blindness, and hepatopancreatitis are indicators of continued exposure to anthropogenic stressors, but their etiologies remain undetermined. More research is needed to understand emerging diseases, their complex etiologies, and their effects on the lobster population.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 45; Correspondence Address: J.

In order to realize quantitative and directional spraying, weed identification using image-processing technology is one of the focus problems in the precision-agriculture field.

The performance of any dimension-reduction method will directly affect the recognition results. The traditional dimension reduction method is a linear method, so it is very difficult to grasp the nonlinear nature of the original data. Locally linear embedding (LLE) is one kind of emerging manifold method. Compared with the traditional method, it is a nonlinear method, but it still has some limitations. The locally linear embedding is essentially an unsupervised method, and it cannot utilize the category information of the train samples. The traditional locally linear embedding method has defects in dealing with the classification problem, so the recognition accuracy is not satisfactory. In order to overcome this defects above, a supervised locally linear embedding method based on Fisher projection (FS-LLE) was chosen to reduce the feature dimension. The samples are projected by Fisher transformation first. Then, the projection coordinates are obtained, and projection distances are computed. The Euclidean distance is used to select the sample points' neighbors in the traditional locally linear embedding. Compared with the Euclidean distance, the Fisher projection distances can characterize the category attributes between different types of samples, so it is chosen to determine the neighborhood structure. In order to verify the effectiveness of this dimension reduction method, the experiment is designed as follows. The weed images are collected from the field, and the grayscale features are obtained. The influence of land background is excluded by super green characteristics at first, then the individual green plant region is selected by a morphological method. The gray scale data ensemble of each region is the feature whose dimension will be reduced. For comparison, dimension reduction was accomplished by PCA (principal component analysis), LLE (locally linear embedding), WLLE (weighted locally linear embedding) and FS-LLE (supervised locally linear embedding based on the Fisher projection), respectively. Through second visual dimension reduction results, it can be found clearly that the FS-LLE method achieves better low-dimensional data-clustering effects. This illustrates that the method proposed in this article finds the samples' intrinsic class features at the same time it reduces feature dimension. This virtue is more conducive to solve identification problems. At last the task of classification for recognition is fulfilled by the support vector machine. Further comparison and analysis of the identification results obtained by different dimension reduction methods, the average recognition rate of corn of this method reaches 97.2%, while the average recognition rates of PCA, LLE, and WLLE were 70.1%, 77.1% and 86.8%, respectively. In the same way, the average recognition rate of weed of this method reaches 77.8%, while the average recognition rates of PCA, LLE, and WLLE were 38.4%, 61.2% and 60.4%, respectively. Therefore, the method proposed by this article is a significant improvement over the other traditional methods. This result also shows that the method has certain advantages in solving the classification problem.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: D.

After surviving near extinction driven by DDT and other contaminants from the 1940s through the early 1970s, the cormorant has made an unprecedented comeback from mere dozens to a population in the millions, bringing the bird again into direct conflict with humans. Hated for its colonial nesting behavior; the changes it brings to landscapes; and especially its competition with commercial and sports fishers, fisheries, and fish farmers throughout the Great Lakes and Mississippi Delta regions, the cormorant continues to be persecuted by various means, including the shotgun. In The Double-Crested Cormorant, Dennis Wild brings together the biological, social, legal, and international aspects of the cormorant's world to give a complete and balanced view of one of the Great Lakes' and perhaps North America's most misunderstood species. In addition to taking a detailed look at the complex natural history of the cormorant, the book explores the implications of congressional acts and international treaties, the workings and philosophies of state and federal wildlife agencies, the unrelenting efforts of aquaculture and fishing interests to ""cull"" cormorant numbers to ""acceptable"" levels, and the reactions and visions of conservation groups. Wild examines both popular preconceptions about cormorants (what kinds of fish they eat and how much) and the effectiveness of ongoing efforts to control the cormorant population. Finally, the book delves into the question of climate and terrain changes, their consequences for cormorants, the new territories to which the birds must adapt, and the conflicts this species is likely to face going forward. © by the University of Michigan 2012.

We analyzed data from 126 recovery strategies implemented under Canada's nascent (2002) Species at Risk Act (SARA) to determine how lead agency, Federal Court rulings, and the proportion of independent team members influenced identification of critical habitat. Only 17% of strategies led by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans included critical habitat, compared with 63% of strategies led by Environment Canada, indicating that aquatic species at risk are much less likely to have critical habitat identified. A 50% increase in recovery strategies that identified critical habitat following precedent-setting court judgments suggests that legal action by nongovernmental organizations played a key role in the evolution of recovery policy for species at risk in Canada.

The objective of this study was to compare systematically the relative sensitivity of amphibians and fish to chemicals. Acute and chronic toxicity data were obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) ECOTOX database and were supplemented with data from the scientific and regulatory literature. The overall outcome is that fish and amphibian toxicity data are highly correlated and that fish are more sensitive (both acute and chronic) than amphibians. In terms of acute sensitivity, amphibians were between 10- and 100-fold more sensitive than fish for only four of 55 chemicals and more than 100-fold more sensitive for only two chemicals. However, a detailed inspection of these cases showed a similar acute sensitivity of fish and amphibians. Chronic toxicity data for fish were available for 52 chemicals. Amphibians were between 10- and 100-fold more sensitive than fish for only two substances (carbaryl and dexamethasone) and greater than 100-fold more sensitive for only a single chemical (sodium perchlorate). The comparison for carbaryl was subsequently determined to be unreliable and that for sodium perchlorate is a potential artifact of the exposure medium. Only a substance such as dexamethasone, which interferes with a specific aspect of amphibian metamorphosis, might not be detected using fish tests. However, several other compounds known to influence amphibian metamorphosis were included in the analysis, and these did not affect amphibians disproportionately. These analyses suggest that additional amphibian testing is not necessary during chemical risk assessment. © 2013 SETAC.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 75; Correspondence Address: P.

We monitored site use by waterbirds at Lake Chapala, the largest lake in Mexico and recently designated Ramsar site, to evaluate the potential influence of water hyacinth cover on species composition and aggregate measures of the waterbird community, including waterbird density, species richness, and Simpson's index of diversity. We examined the response of waterbirds to changes in percent water hyacinth cover at 22 independent sites around the lake during six study seasons from May 2006 to February 2008. We found little evidence to suggest that percent water hyacinth cover affected aggregate community measures; however, multivariate analysis of relative species composition suggested that water hyacinth cover corresponded with seasonal species composition (Canonical Correspondence r 0.66, P 0.007) when seasonal site cover averaged 17.7 ± 4.67 (winter 2007). Several migratory species were not observed during this season, which could suggest that some small-bodied migratory species avoided Lake Chapala during the winter of high water hyacinth cover. We suspect that observed changes in the waterbird community are in response to species-specific tolerances for water hyacinth and indirect abiotic and biotic effects of its presence (e.g., invertebrate and fish composition). Nomenclature: Glyphosate, water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms. Management Implications: Water hyacinth is among the most widespread aquatic invasive plants in the world. Yet despite its global recognition, our understanding of how nonnative ecosystems and animal communities, specifically waterbirds, respond to the establishment of this species is relatively weak, which hinders our ability to choose the best potential management strategy. The waterbird community comprises herbivores as well as secondary and tertiary consumers; therefore, changes in community composition and abundance can greatly affect food web structure and energy flows within an affected ecosystem. In addition to their ecological role, waterbirds are the source of cultural and economic values in many regions. A shift in waterbird community composition resulting from water hyacinth establishment has the potential to enhance or reduce socioeconomic values associated with freshwater ecosystems. By understanding how waterbirds respond to water hyacinth, field practitioners (e.g., researchers, managers, and decision-makers) will be better informed when developing research and management priorities. Our results suggest that water hyacinth cover had little effect on aggregate measures of the waterbird community at Lake Chapala, including waterbird density, species richness, and diversity (Simpson's index of diversity), but that some small-bodied, migratory species might avoid sites and/or entire ecosystems with water hyacinth. Although the decision to control water hyacinth and other invasive plants is surely based on a wide assortment of socioeconomic objectives and desired benefits (i.e., protection of municipal water supply), we believe that the ecological response to nonnative plants and potential control methods should be evaluated. Our results suggest a benign relationship between water hyacinth and waterbirds, with the potential exception of some small-bodied, migratory species. Understanding the waterbird response to water hyacinth provides critical pieces in the ecological and socioeconomic puzzle of invasive plant science and management and can help managers evaluate the benefits and costs of control more holistically. © Weed Science Society of America.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: A.M.

We classified the women into three exposure groups by type of residence: unsprayed village (n = 175), IRS village in household with a low likelihood of DDT use (non-DDT IRS household, n = 106), IRS village in household with a high likelihood of DDT use (DDT IRS household, n = 100). We used multivariable models of natural log-transformed DDT plasma levels (in micrograms per liter) and DDE (in micrograms per liter) to identify predictors for each group. Results: Median levels of DDT and DDE among women in unsprayed villages were 0.3 [interquartile range (IQR): 0.1-0.9] and 1.7 (IQR: 0.7-5.5), respectively. Median levels of DDT and DDE among women in DDT IRS households were 2.6 (IQR: 1.1-6.6) and 8.5 (IQR: 4.7-18.0), respectively. In unsprayed villages, women with water piped to the yard, rather than a public tap, had 73% lower DDT (95% CI: -83, -57%) and 61% lower DDE (95% CI: -74, -40%) levels. In DDT IRS households, women who reported taking more than six actions to prepare their home before IRS (e.g., covering water and food) had 40% lower DDT levels (95% CI: -63, -0.3%) than women who took fewer than four actions. Conclusion: The predictors of DDT and DDE plasma levels identified in the present study may inform interventions aimed at decreasing exposure. Among households where DDT is likely to be used for IRS, education regarding home preparations may provide an interventional target.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 21; Correspondence Address: K.

A nine-year study of parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) from Pacific Canada indicates that adaptive changes in parasite management on salmon farms have yielded positive conservation outcomes. After four years of sea lice epizootics and wild salmon population decline, parasiticide application on salmon farms was adapted to the timing of wild salmon migrations. Winter treatment of farm fish with parasiticides, prior to the out-migration of wild juvenile salmon, has reduced epizootics of wild salmon without significantly increasing the annual number of treatments. Levels of parasites on wild juvenile salmon significantly influence the growth rate of affected salmon populations, suggesting that these changes in management have had positive outcomes for wild salmon populations. These adaptive changes have not occurred through formal adaptive management, but rather, through multi-stakeholder processes arising from a contentious scientific and public debate. Despite the apparent success of parasite control on salmon farms in the study region, there remain concerns about the long-term sustainability of this approach because of the unknown ecological effects of parasticides and the potential for parasite resistance to chemical treatments. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 34; CODEN: ECAPE,10.1890/12-0519.1,Adaptive management;Aquaculture;Host-parasite;Lepeophtheirus salmonis;Migration;Pacific Canada;Parasiticide;Salmon;Sea lice;adaptation;adaptive management;aquaculture;crustacean;disease prevalence;growth rate;host-parasite interaction;juvenile;migration;parasitic disease;pesticide;physiological response;population decline;salmonid;sustainability;wild population,NA,NA,cessation of a salmon decline with control of parasites

These inconsistent results may stem from the fact that exposure typically occurs in the context of fish consumption, which is also associated with cardioprotective factors such as omega-3 fatty acids. Mechanistic information may help to understand whether MeHg represents a risk to cardiovascular health. MeHg is a pro-oxidant that inactivates protein sulfhydryls. These biochemical effects may diminish critical antioxidant defense mechanism(s) involved in protecting against atherosclerosis. One such defense mechanism is paraoxonase-1 (PON1), an enzyme present on high-density lipoproteins and that prevents the oxidation of blood lipids and their deposition in vascular endothelium. PON1 is potentially useful as a clinical biomarker of cardiovascular risk, as well as a critical enzyme in the detoxification of certain organophosphate oxons. MeHg and other metals are known to inhibit PON1 activity in vitro. MeHg is associated with lowered serum PON1 activity in a fish-eating population. The implications of lowering PON1 are evaluated by predicting the shift in PON1 population distribution induced by various doses of MeHg. An MeHg dose of 0.3 g/kg/d is estimated to decrease the population average PON1 level by 6.1% and to increase population risk of acute cardiovascular events by 9.7%. This evaluation provides a plausible mechanism for MeHg-induced cardiovascular risk and suggests means to quantify the risk. This case study exemplifies the use of upstream disease biomarkers to evaluate the additive effect of chemical toxicity with background disease processes in assessing human risk.

Methods: In 2006-2007, 111 French ophthalmologists prospectively enrolled 339 cases of POAG and 339 age-matched controls with OHT. After a clinical examination with assessment of ocular risk factors, the ophthalmologist filled, during face-to-face interview, a detailed questionnaire developed by nutritionists and epidemiologist on lifestyle and environmental risk factors, including socio-demographic variables, dietary habits related to omega-3 fatty acids intake, smoking and alcohol drinking and professional exposure to pesticides and other chemicals. Associations of POAG with risk factors were estimated using conditional logistic regression, with adjustment for age, gender and duration of disease. Results: In the final multivariate model, by comparison with OHT, POAG was significantly associated with more frequent use of pesticides during the professional life [OR = 2.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-6.78, p = 0.04] and with low consumption of fatty fish (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.10-4.17, p = 0.02) and walnuts (OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.18-3.47, p = 0.01). POAG was also associated with higher frequency of heavy smoking (40 pack-years or more, OR = 3.93, 95% CI: 1.12-13.80, p = 0.03) but not with moderate (20-40 pack-years) and light smoking (<20 pack-years). Conclusions: These exploratory observations suggest a protective effect of omega-3 fatty acids and a deleterious effect of heavy smoking and professional exposure to pesticides in POAG.

Recent developments in efficient computer-based video analyses have allowed testing pesticide effects on model species such as the zebrafish. However, these new techniques have not yet been applied to amphibians and directly to conservation issues. i.e., to assess toxicological risks on threatened species. We used video-tracking analyses to test a quantitative effect of an environmental contaminant on the locomotion of amphibian tadpoles (Rana temporaria) by taking into account cumulative effects. Because recent research has demonstrated effects of de-icing salts on survival and community structure, we used sodium chloride in our experimental design (25 replicates, 4 concentrations, 4 times) to test for an effect at the scale of behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations. Analysis of 372 1-h video-tracks (5 samples/s) showed a complex action of salts on behavioral patterns with a dose and cumulative response over time. Although no effects were found on mortality or growth, the highest salt concentrations reduced the speed and movement of tadpoles in comparison with control treatments. The reduced locomotor performance could have detrimental consequences in terms of tadpoles' responses to competition and predation and may be an indicator of the low concentration effect of the contaminant. On one hand, this study demonstrates the usefulness of examining behavior to address conservation issues and understand the complex action of environmental factors and, more particularly, pollutants on organisms. On the other hand, our results highlight the need of new computerized techniques to quantitatively analyze these patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Among others, the non-LEE encoded T3SS effector protein NleC of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a Zn-dependent metalloprotease and suppresses innate immune responses by directly targeting the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Many pathogenic bacteria release potent bacterial toxins of the A-B type, which-in contrast to the direct cytoplasmic injection of T3SS effector proteins-are released first into the environment. In this study, we found that NleC displays characteristics of bacterial A-B toxins, when applied to eukaryotic cells as a recombinant protein. Although lacking a B subunit, that typically mediates the uptake of toxins, recombinant NleC (rNleC) induces endocytosis via lipid rafts and follows the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. The conformation of rNleC is altered by low pH to facilitate its escape from acidified endosomes. This is reminiscent of the homologous A-B toxin AIP56 of the fish pathogen Photobacterium damselae piscicida (Phdp). The recombinant protease NleC is functional inside eukaryotic cells and cleaves p65 of the NF-kappa B pathway. Here, we describe the endocytic uptake mechanism of rNleC, characterize its intracellular trafficking and demonstrate that its specific activity of cleaving p65 requires activation of host cells e.g., by IL1 beta. Further, we propose an evolutionary link between some T3SS effector proteins and bacterial toxins from apparently unrelated bacteria. In summary, these properties might suggest rNleC as an interesting candidate for future applications as a potential therapeutic against immune disorders.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  88,10.3389/fcimb.2017.00119     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),T3SS effectors;NleC;A-B toxins;EPEC;endocytosis;NF-kappa B signaling;endosomal escape;CELL-PENETRATING PEPTIDES;III SECRETION SYSTEM;HOST INNATE IMMUNE;HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS;DAMSELAE SUBSP PISCICIDA;INTRACELLULAR TRAFFICKING;RETROGRADE TRANSPORT;CHOLERA-TOXIN;SHIGA TOXIN;SUBSTRATE RECOGNITION;Escherichia coli,NA,NA,t3ssindependent uptake of the shorttrip toxinrelated recombinant nlec effector of enteropathogenic <i>escherichia coli<i> leads to nfκb p65 cleavage

Water samples were taken in order to determine the river's physicochemical profile. An integrative approach was applied using a biomarker index.        The bioassay involved the use of laboratory culture adult animals, acclimatized in moderately hard water (MHW) and fed ad libitum. A semi-static 96 h bioassay was conducted and the experimental groups were as follows: [1] river water (Rg); [2] river water + 2 mg/L Cd (RgCd); [3] MHW + 2 mg/L Cadmium (Cd), positive metal control; [4] MHW + 5 mg/L Cydophosphamide (positive genotoxicity control-CP); [5] MWH, negative control (NC). At the end of the exposure time fishes were sectioned and the following biomarkers were determined: 1) condition factor rate (CF); 2) for the anterior section (A) (head): glutathione (GSH) and protein (Pr) content; 3) for the body midsection (M) (viscera): Pr, GSH, Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Blood samples were also taken from the fish specimens to estimate the frequency of micronuclei (MN) as well as other nuclear abnormalities (NA).        The physicochemical profile of the river water sample indicated high Copper concentrations. CAT and SOD activity and total Pr content did not show any significant changes. GST activity decreased in fish exposed to Rg, while GSH content decreased significantly for all treatments compared to controls in MHW. These results would seem to point to a reduction in cell defense capability as a result of the depletion antioxidants such as GSH. The NA frequency increased significantly in all treated groups while MN frequency was increased only in Cd and CP groups.        Using some the biomarkers measured, a biomarker index was estimated which revealed that fish exposed to Rg were 90% affected or highly affected, while those exposed to RgCd were 80% and Cd 68% affected or highly affected.

Moreover, the critical residues presumably involved in catalytic mechanism of Gdh and SpnG were functionally evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis. The information gained from this study has provided important insight into molecular recognition and mechanism of the enzymes, especially SpnG.

To defend host-generated oxidants, Salmonella encodes primary antioxidants and protein repair enzymes. Methionine (Met) residues are highly prone to oxidation and convert into methionine sulfoxide (Met-SO) which compromises protein functions and subsequently cellular survival. However, by reducing Met-SO to Met, methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) enhance cellular survival under stress conditions. Salmonella encodes five Msrs which are specific for particular Met-SO (free/protein bound), and 'R'/'S' types. Earlier studies assessed the effect of deletions of one or two msrs on the stress physiology of S. Typhimurium. We generated a pan msr gene deletion (Delta 5msr) strain in S. Typhimurium. The Delta 5msr mutant strain shows an initial lag in in vitro growth. However, the Delta 5msr mutant strain depicts very high sensitivity (p < 0.0001) to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), chloramine T (ChT) and superoxide-generating oxidant paraquat. Further, the Delta 5msr mutant strain shows high levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls, and protein aggregation. On the other side, the Delta 5msr mutant strain exhibits lower levels of free amines. Further, the Delta 5msr mutant strain is highly susceptible to neutrophils and shows defective fitness in the spleen and liver of mice. The results of the current study suggest that the deletions of all msrs render S.

American-Indian/Alaska-Native (AI/AN) children may have a disproportionate burden of stressors from their built and natural environments when compared to children from other races/ethnicities. Our objectives were to identify chemical and non-chemical stressors from AI/AN children's built and natural environments and evaluate their linkages with health and wellbeing outcomes from the peer reviewed literature. Library databases (e.g. PubMed) were searched to identify studies focused on these stressors. References were excluded if they: did not discuss AI/AN children or they were not the primary cohort; discussed tribes outside the United States (U.S.); were reviews or intervention studies; or did not discuss stressors from the built/natural environments. Out of 2539 references, 35 remained. Sample populations were predominantly (70%) in New York (NY) and Alaska (AK); 14 studies reported on the same cohort. Studies with matching stressors and outcomes were few, ruling out a quantitative review. Respiratory and developmental outcomes were the main outcomes evaluated. Primary nonchemical stressors were residential proximity to polluted landscapes, lack of indoor plumbing, and indoor use of wood for heating or cooking. The main chemical stressors were volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM 2.5), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p, p'-DDE, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), lead, and mercury. Our qualitative review was suggestive of a potential increase in respiratory illness from indoor wood use or no plumbing, which can be used as a guide to promote healthy environments for AI/AN children. We identified limited studies (< 40), demonstrating this population as understudied. Future studies need to consider: sample populations from other tribes in the U.S., stressors outside the household, other elements of the natural environment, and an evaluation of stressors from AI/AN children's total environment (built, natural, and social).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  58,10.1515/reveh-2018-0034     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Alaska Native;American Indian;built environment;children;natural environment;RESPIRATORY-TRACT INFECTION;WOOD-BURNING STOVES;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS;FISH CONSUMPTION;MOHAWK WOMEN;PCB CONCENTRATIONS;INDIAN-CHILDREN;BIRTH OUTCOMES;OPEN DUMPSITES;FARM INJURIES;Only Child;Indians, North American;Child",NA,NA,review of built and natural environment stressors impacting americanindianalaskanative children

However, the mechanism of alachlor-induced oxidative stress is poorly understood. We found that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide anions were increased only after long-term exposure to alachlor, suggesting that alachlor is not a pro-oxidant. It is likely that alachlor-induced oxidative stress may result from protein denaturation because alachlor rapidly induced an increased protein aggregation, leading to upregulation of SSA4 and HSP82 genes encoding heat shock proteins (Hsp) of Hsp70 and Hsp90 family, respectively. Although only SOD1 encoding Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), but not SOD2 encoding Mn-SOD, is essential for alachlor tolerance, both SODs play a crucial role in reducing alachlor-induced ROS. We found that, after alachlor exposure, glutathione production was inhibited while its utilization was increased, suggesting the role of glutathione in protecting cells against alachlor, which becomes more important when lacking Cu/Zn-SOD. Based on our results, it seems that alachlor primarily causes damages to cellular macromolecules such as proteins, leading to an induction of endogenous oxidative stress, of which intracellular antioxidant defense systems are required for elimination.

Initial tracer-dye, water-quality, potentiometric surface, and biologic data collection centered around Shelta Cave, the historic type locality in northwest Huntsville (now considered an extirpated population), and in caves, sinks, springs, and wells within the presumed recharge area for Bobcat Cave, the only known population location since 1975. Based on historical and collected data on the hydrologic characteristics of the present and extirpated population habitats, USFWS expanded the study area to include other aquifer systems and karst areas in north Alabama. Additional cave shrimp populations were discovered in three hydrologically connected caves in southeast Madison County. Geologic and hydrologic regimes differ between the three areas of known populations. Water quality and the presence of karstic ""windows"" to lower aquifer levels appear to be key to species survival and continued sustainability. The presence of residual pesticides, particularly termite treatment chemicals, in soils and ground water in and surrounding Shelta Cave indicate that water quality may be the primary factor in the extirpation of the Alabama cave shrimp and the severe reduction of other aquatic species in this ground-water system. Continued hydrologic and biologic monitoring of Bobcat Cave shows the presence of single, brief pollution events, but little indication of increasing water-quality degradation. The isolated location on Redstone Arsenal (RSA) and the restricted, anomalous, north-trending recharge area of Bobcat Cave may offer additional protection from environmental impacts. The continued sustainability of cave shrimp populations in the dynamic karst system in southeast Madison County is more at risk from environmental impacts, such as water-quality degradation, loss of habitat, and potential decrease in seasonal flows, due to rapid residential development and increased agro-economic activities (timber harvesting) in this area. Additional tracer-dye studies and modeling of the karst hydrology may be needed to make educated decisions about the future coexistence of increasing development and the present cave shrimp habitats in this area.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  22,,,NA,NA,characterizing potential environmental impacts to an endangered species habitat in karst waters

Interestingly, analysis of degradation pathways showed a major influence of photolysis process and oxidation due to hydrogen peroxide for the CBF degradation, while the synergistic combination between both of them played the most relevant role during IPR degradation. A mixture of both pesticides was also submitted to UV/H2O2 action in which a lower rate was observed for IPR elimination while CBF was not affected. A 90 % of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed and 75 % of mineralization was achieved after the treatment of the mixture. Almost 92 % of the toxicity was eliminated making this technique a promising process to treat toxic mixtures of these pesticides.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  33,10.1007/s11270-016-2903-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Synergistic effect;UV/H2O2;Degradation pathways;Toxicity;Mineralization;SOLAR PHOTO-FENTON;PILOT-SCALE;EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN;WASTE;WATER;OXIDATION;FUNGICIDE;REMOVAL;TIO2;Pesticides,NA,NA,degradation of a toxic mixture of the pesticides carbofuran and iprodione by uvh<sub>2<sub>o<sub>2<sub> evaluation of parameters and implications of the degradation pathways on the synergistic effects

Acta,107,4,263-270,"NEUWINGER, HD",,English,,,"Fishing with the aid of plant toxins was formerly very common in tropical Africa. Today this easy method of fishing is still practised in remote areas. The method is simple: the poisonous ingredients are pounded and thrown into a pool or dammed-up sections of a small river. After a short time the fish begin to rise to the surface and can then readily be taken by hand. The fish can be eaten without health problems. The main active compounds are saponins, rotenoids and diterpene esters. Such biologically active plants are of great interest to scientists of various disciplines. Some of these plants provide important insecticides, many play an important part in traditional medicine and in preparation or arrow poisons.        258 fish-poisoning plants are presented, based on 25 years of field research by the author in tropical Africa and evaluations of herbarium notes. 10-20 per cent of the fishing poisons are probably still unknown. They are spread among 167 plant genera and 60 families. The evaluation shows a clear dominance of the Leguminosae (Caesalpiniaceae, Mimosaceae, Papilionaceae) in the hierarchy of the fish poisoning plants. It is also remarkable that a great proportion are in the Euphorbiaceae.

Various approaches were examined to produce affinity, mixed mode, and hydrophobic charge induction type adsorbents. In clean monocomponent systems affinity supports created by direct attachment of glucose or maltose to amine-terminated iron oxide particles could bind concanavalin A at levels of up to approximate to 280 mg g(-1) support with high affinity (approximate to 1 muM dissociation constants). However, the best performance was delivered by adsorbents featuring coupled tentacular dextran chains displaying a maximum binding capacity of 238 mg g(-1) and a dissociation constant of 0.13 muM. Adsorbents derivatized with mixed mode or hydrophobic charge induction ligands likewise demonstrated very high capacities for both concanavalin A and Lens culinaris agglutinin (greater than or equal to 250 mg g(-1)) with dissociation constants in the micromolar range, though neither of these systems showed any selectivity for lectins in leguminous extracts.        When the affinity supports were applied to carbohydrate containing legume extracts only the dextran-linked adsorbents supplied sufficient competition to dissolved sugars to selectively bind concanavalin A in an extract of jack beans. The dextran-linked supports were employed in a high-gradient magnetic fishing experiment, in which concanavalin A was purified to near homogeneity from a crude, unclarified extract of jack beans.

To evaluate the impact of available DNT studies on individual chemical risk assessments, the ways in which data from these studies are being used in pesticide risk assessment were investigated. In addition, the neurobehavioral and neuropathological parameters affected at the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for each study were evaluated to ascertain whether some types of endpoints were consistently more sensitive than others. As of December 2008, final OPP reviews of DNT studies for 72 pesticide chemicals were available; elimination of studies with major deficiencies resulted in a total of 69 that were included in this analysis. Of those studies, 15 had been used to determine the point of departure for one or more risk assessment scenarios, and an additional 13 were determined to have the potential for use as a point of departure for future risk assessments (selection is dependent upon review of the entire database available at the time of reassessment). Analysis of parameters affected at the study LOAELs indicated that no single parameter was consistently more sensitive than another. Early assessment time points (e.g., postnatal day (PND) 11/21) tended to be more sensitive than later time points (e.g., PND 60). These results demonstrate that data generated using the current guideline DNT study protocol are useful in providing points of departure for risk assessments. The results of these studies also affirm the importance of evaluating a spectrum of behavioral and neuropathological endpoints, in both young and adult animals, to improve the detection of the potential for a chemical to cause developmental neurotoxicity.

Growth performance and immune responses were evaluated after 85 days of feeding trial. Sole (IBW = 16.07 +/- 0.11 g) were fed six experimental diets, a control diet (CTRL, without the dietary probiotic supplementation), and five diets supplemented with probiotic bacteria: PB1 (Shewanella hafniensis), PB2 (Enterococcus raffinosus), PB3 (Shewanella hafniensis + Arthrobacter soli), PB4 (Pseudomonas protegens + Arthrobacter soli) and PB5 (Shewanella hafniensis + Arthrobacter soli + Enterococcus raffinosus). All bacteria were selected based on their in vitro antimicrobial activity. After the growth trial, fish were submitted to a stress factor (transport) and then each dietary group was divided in two additional groups: non-infected (placebo) and infected with Photobacteriutn damselae subsp. piscicida. Immune and antioxidant responses were evaluated at day 10 post-infection. In infection trial A, fish were infected on the same day of transport, whereas in trial B fish were infected after a 7-day recovery from the transport stress. At the end of the feeding trial, fish fed with PB2 and PB4 showed lower final body weight when compared with the other dietary groups. Respiratory burst activity and nitric oxide production were not affected by probiotic supplementation. Fish fed with PB5 presented lower peroxidase activity compared to CTRL. Lysozyme and alternative complement pathway activity (ACH50) showed no significant differences between treatments. The innate immune responses were significantly affected after handling stress and bacterial infection. In trial A, the ACH50 levels of infected fish were significantly lower than the placebo groups. On the other hand, in trial B fish infected with Pdp demonstrated higher ACH50 levels when compared to placebos. Peroxidase levels were strongly modulated by bacterial infection and handling stress. In trials A and B, infection had a clear downgrade effect in peroxidase levels. Lipid peroxidation, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase were altered by both bacterial infection and transport.

Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of prometryne (0.51, 8, and 80 mu g/l) for 14, 30, and 60 days. Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR), as well as levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) were assessed in brain, gill, intestine, liver, and muscle. After 14 days exposure, decreased GR activity in brain was observed for all prometryne-exposed groups compared with the controls. Changes were observed in SOD activity in brain and gill after 30 days in all exposure groups. Changes in CAT activity were observed only at the highest concentration (80 mu g/l) in liver and intestine after 60 days. The observed effects on carp antioxidant systems may be a defense against oxidative damage. The study demonstrated changes in antioxidant parameters and the importance of evaluating the potential long-term risk to fish of prometryne, at environmentally realistic concentrations (0.51 mu g/l).

This Regulation required the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 16 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 10 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force, which originally consisted of Dow AgroScience B. V. and BASF Agro B. V. BASF sold the business of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene to Kanesho Soil Treatment BVBA on 17 December 2003 and therefore was replaced in the Task Force. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 8 November 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.        A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 February 2006 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 12 May 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 72).        Following the Commission Decision of 20 September 2007 (2007/619/EC) 6 concerning the noninclusion of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicants, Dow AgroScience B. V. and Kanesho Soil Treatment BVBA made a resubmission application for the inclusion of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene in Annex I, in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20087. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report (European Commission, 2007) as follows:.        A finalised assessment of consumer exposure.        The environmental fate and ecotoxicology of the substance.        Lack of data on the persistency, toxicological behaviour, uptake from crops, accumulation, metabolic fate and residue level of certain polychlorinated impurities        and concerns were identified with regard to:.        The potential contamination of groundwater.        The consumer exposure.        The risk to birds, mammals and aquatic organisms.        Its possible impact on non-target organisms        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Spain, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene in the format of an Additional Report (Spain, 2009a). The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 15 April 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 20 April 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 25 May 2009. At the same time the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 2 July 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days.        The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS' evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific telephone conferences with Member State experts in September 2009.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in all areas.        The original conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a nematicide as proposed by the applicants. The application to bare soil comprises either introduction of the formulated product into the drip irrigation system ("" EF-1478"") or soil injection at 15-20 cm depth ("" XRM-5048"") to control nematodes in soil where tomatoes or peppers will be grown. The application rates are up to 283 kg (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene per hectare ("" EF-1478"") and up to 224 kg per hectare ("" XRM-5048""), respectively. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene can be used as nematicide, insecticide, fungicide and herbicide, depending on the dose rate used. In general, an application of (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene by soil injection and/or drip irrigation is followed by partial sterilisation of the soil. It should be noted that the applicants stated that only the use as a nematicide would be supported in the EU review programme. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative use as a nematicide.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation under the resubmission were the same as for the original submission, ` Telone EC Drip (EF-1478)', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Southern European countries, and ` Telone Injected (XRM-5048)' a liquid formulation (AL), registered under different trade names in the EU.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible.        (EZ)-1,3-dichloropopene is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised in the rat. The acute oral and dermal toxicity is high and the inhalatory toxicity is moderate, proposed classification and risk phrases are T; R24/25 "" Toxic in contact with and if swallowed"" and R20 "" Harmful by inhalation"". It is a skin irritant and sensitizer, proposed classification and risk phrases are R38 "" Irritant to skin"" and R43 "" May cause sensitization by skin contact"". According to medical data 1,3-dichloropopene should also be classified as irritant to eyes and to the respiratory system, proposed classification and risk phrases are R36/R37 "" Irritating to eyes and respiratory system"" and R65 "" May cause lung damage if swallowed"". The Technical Committee for Classification and Labelling in 2005 agreed not to classify 1,3-D as mutagenic or carcinogenic, unless epichlorhydrin (a known carcinogen) had been used as a stabiliser. The applicants confirmed that the current product is not stabilised with epichlorhydrin. No reproduction toxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. The metabolites (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol8 and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid9 are both toxic. Dependent on the identity on the polychlorinated impurities, it might be necessary to require new toxicological studies. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.025 mg/kg bw/day, with the use of the safety factor of 100. The systemic Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100. As inhalation exposure is the main route of exposure and all data from operator exposure are expressed as atmospheric concentration (mg/m3), an additional inhalatory human AOEC was assigned which is 0.45 mg/m3. The ARfD is 0.2 mg/kg bw, with the safety factor of 100 added. The operator and worker exposure during drip irrigation activities is below the AOEL with the use of PPE and RPE; the estimated exposure levels for a bystander at > 7 m from the site of application are below the AOEC, however at closer distances estimated exposure levels exceed the AOEC. During soil injection activities the operator, worker and bystander exposure estimates show levels below the AOEC (operator and worker wearing PPE and RPE).        The degradation and metabolism of 1,3-D has been studied comparatively in fruit (tomatoes and citrus), root vegetables (sugar beet), pulses and oilseeds (soybeans) following application of radiolabelled material to the soil surrounding the tree, or to the soil in which seeds were planted. Additional information from succeeding crop studies is given on leafy crops (lettuce) and cereals (wheat).        Even though a high amount of applied 1,3-D is expected to volatilise from soil, the results of the available studies indicate that 1,3-D is also absorbed into plants, translocated and degraded. Naturally occurring plant constituents contained the majority of radioactivity recovered in edible plant parts, indicating complete metabolism of 1,3-D. Consequently, no 1,3-D residues above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are expected to be present in primary or succeeding crops. This was confirmed by supervised residue trials data.        In the resubmission dossier of 2009 a number of additional residue trials were provided to allow some further clarification with regard to manufacturing process impurities that are applied to the soil in high amounts when 1,3-D is used at the notified application rate.        1,3-D and six impurities (1, 2, 3, 5b, 5c and 8a) were analysed. 1,3-D and its six studied impurities did not leave detectable residues in the crop.        However, even though potential chronic and acute dietary exposure to residues of 1,3-D per se from tomatoes and peppers is well below the ADI (< 10%) and ARfD (< 2%), respectively the consumer risk assessment cannot be considered as finalised in relation to 11 manufacturing process impurities. The consumer risk assessment is pending a conclusion on the fate and behaviour of these 11 identified impurities in the environment, and/or with regard to toxicological data on manufacturing process impurities in the updated specification in the section on mammalian toxicology.        (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene is a volatile liquid, so even though it is injected below the soil surface or applied via drip irrigation systems, the major route of dissipation from soil is volatilisation to the air. In aerobic laboratory soil studies it exhibited low to moderate persistence and formed the major (> 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid which exhibited very low to moderate persistence and the minor (< 10% AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited very low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 11-37% AR at 49-77 days. At these times unextracted soil residue accounted for 9-28% AR.        In laboratory soil batch adsorption studies (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene exhibited very high to high mobility. (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid exhibited very high soil mobility.        In a laboratory study on a natural sediment water system (25 degrees C) with dosing under the water surface, volatilisation was again the major route of dissipation of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene from the systems. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene exhibited low persistence and formed the minor (< 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation products (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid and (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 57% AR at 21 days. At this time unextracted sediment residues accounted for 14% AR. Acceptable surface aquatic system PEC are only available.        FOCUS groundwater 'tier I' modelling indicates that at the spatial scale usually assessed of the treated field, there is a very high potential for the contamination of groundwater by parent (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid. The results from an extensive targeted EU groundwater monitoring program are available. With the exception of the monitored areas in France, where critical details regarding the program are missing, this program indicates for the historical intensity of use of 1,3-D in the monitored areas, at the points of drinking water abstraction that were sampled, groundwater contamination by parent (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene > 0.1 mu g/L had not occurred. Contamination above this level by (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid had occurred but rarely (2 samples from different wells out of the 50 taken in the Spanish region of Caceres where the concentrations were 0.116 and 0.413 mu g/L). In all other monitored wells (92) (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid was < 0.1 mu g/L. It has been concluded that there is information missing that is needed to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment in relation to 11 manufacturing process impurities.        (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene volatilises from soil even though it is applied below the soil surface. The flux losses from the soil have been measured in field studies in the USA that have been assessed as being representative for EU conditions. Member State experts' and the EFSA considered sufficient information has been provided to conclude that the (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene that will reach the upper atmosphere will degrade relatively rapidly and that this compound and its potential atmospheric degradation products are unlikely to have an adverse effect on the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, as they will be relatively short lived in this environmental compartment. For 10 manufacturing process impurities, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) calculations, on the rate of photo-oxidative reactions with hydroxyl radicals in the upper atmosphere, indicate that these impurities could be subject to long range transport through the atmosphere.        Studies to address the data gaps identified in the EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 72 were provided for the resubmission. Confirmatory data on the compliance of the ecotoxicological test batches to the new specifications are still missing. The indoor use in glasshouse is defined as a permanent structure to which entry of birds and mammals is limited and hence the risk to birds and mammals for the indoor uses is regarded to be low. A high acute risk to earthworm-eating and insectivorous birds and mammals and a long-term risk to earthworm-eating and insectivorous mammals was identified for the outdoor uses. The risk was addressed in a refined risk assessment for herbivorous, insectivorous and earthworm-eating birds and mammals, based on worst case concentrations from residue studies in plants, insects and earthworms. All TER values for acute, short-term and long-term risk meet Annex VI triggers, indicating a low risk to birds and mammals from the intended outdoor use.        Available data indicated a similar level of aquatic toxicity for (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene and 3chloroallyl alcohol to fish and Daphnia which was higher that the toxicity of 3-chloroacrylic acid. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene was however less toxic to algae and Lemna than the two metabolites, which had a similar toxicity. Based on the acute endpoints both the active substance and the metabolites should be classified as very toxic to the aquatic environment. The EFSA Scientific Report (2006) concluded that the acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms from the indoor use via drip irrigation could be regarded as low without the need for risk mitigation measures. The risk associated with this use will therefore not be considered further. For the outdoor use the risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low based on CHAIN-2D CODE model exposure data including 3 m buffer zones for (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene, 3-chloroallyl alcohol and 3-chloroacrylic acid.        Extended laboratory studies on Folsomia candida, Hypoaspis aculeifer, Poecilus cupreus, Pardosa spp. and Aleochara bilineata are available but have several deficiencies (exposure method, late introduction of test species and lack of positive control product). In addition a field study was considered to inadequate (poor test design). A new field study from North Italy assessing the effect of telone II on arthropods and earthworms indicated no significant effects on arthropods. Transient effects on earthworms were observed, lasting less than 6 months post-treatment. Several shortcomings in the field study were however identified (e. g. use of other pesticides, low collection rate of collembolan and earthworms). Member state experts agreed that the new field study should only be used to refine the risk assessment for the intended use (tomatoes and soil injection) and only in case the statistical power of the field study could be confirmed.        A high acute risk to earthworms was observed. The risk may be addressed by the field study mentioned above. However, the statistical power of the study still needs to be confirmed. The applicant provided a supportive study on abundance and diversity of earthworms in South Europe. Field surveys in November and February indicated low number of earthworms in fields potential treated with soil fumigants.        The risk to non-target soil micro-organisms was assessed as low based on higher tier field studies. Buffer zones of 3 m were required to address the risk to non-target plants. It could not be excluded that 1,3-D might be harmful if the waste water goes to sewage treatment plants. A concern was raised that washing water from cleaning tools should not be disposed into surface water due to effects on activated sludge.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  0,10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1341     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),"(EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;nematicide;Pesticides;Risk Assessment",NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance <i>ez<i>13dichloropropene european food safety authority

Nevertheless, there are only few studies that assess the effects of these xenobiotics on amphibians. Clomazone is an herbicide widely used in rice fields, where amphibian species live. Thus, those species may be threatened by non-target exposure. However, nanoparticles are being developed to be used as a carrier system for the agrochemicals. Such nanoparticles release the herbicide in a modified way, and are considered to be more efficient and less harmful to the environment. The aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate the effect of clomazone in its free form and associated with nanoparticles, in the liver of bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) when submitted to acute exposure for 96 h. According to semi-quantitative analysis, there was an increase in the frequency of melanomacrophage centres, in the accumulation of eosinophils and in lipidosis in the liver of experimental groups exposed to clomazone in its free form and associated with nanoparticles in comparison with the control group, and the nanotoxicity of chitosan-alginate nanoparticles. The increase of melanomacrophage centres in all exposed groups was significant (P < 0.0001) in comparison to control group. Therefore, the results of this research have shown that exposure to sublethal doses of the herbicide and nanoparticles triggered hepatic responses. Moreover, these results provided important data about the effect of the clomazone herbicide and organic nanoparticles, which act as carriers of agrochemicals, on the bullfrog tadpole liver.

Yet, little information is known regarding its impact onmicroalgae. We investigated the uptake and toxicity of TPhP on two freshwater microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (CV) and Scenedesmus obliquus (SO) after exposure to 10 mu g/l-10 mg/l for 5 days. The presence of microalgae significantly enhanced TPhP degradation, with the final concentrations dropped to 5.5-35.1% of the original concentrations. Most of the medium TPhP were sorbed and transformed by microalgae in just one day. Growth of CV was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas growth of SO were only inhibited significantly at 10 mg/l TPhP exposure. Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics revealed concentration- and species-dependent metabolic responses. Exposure to TPhP in CV resulted in enhanced respiration (increase of fumarate and malate) and osmoregulation (increase of sucrose and myo-inositol), synthesis of membrane lipids (accumulation of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), decrease of lysoglycerolipids, fatty acids, and glyceryl-glucoside). Exposure to TPhP in SO resulted in enhanced osmoregulation (increase of valine, proline, and raffinose) and lipolysis (decrease of MGDG, accumulation of fatty acids, lysophospholipids, and glycerol phosphate). Although chlorophyll a and b contents did not change significantly, decrease of chlorophyll derivatives was observed in both CV and SO at high exposure concentrations. Further bioassays confirmed that CV exhibited enhanced membrane integrity and decreased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) possibly as a defense strategy, whereas SO showed disruption of membrane integrity and induction of ROS at 10 mg/l exposure. This study demonstrated the potential of microalgae to remove TPhP in water, and offered new insights for the risk assessment of TPhP on freshwater microalgae using metabolomics.

Despite importance, the function of CosR remains completely unknown mainly because of cell death caused by its knockout mutation. To overcome this technical limitation, in this study, antisense technology was used to investigate the regulatory function of CosR by modulating the level of CosR expression. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) was performed to identify the CosR regulon either by suppressing CosR expression with antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) or by overexpressing CosR in C. jejuni. According to the results of 2DGE, CosR regulated 32 proteins involved in various cellular processes. Notably, CosR negatively regulated a few key proteins of the oxidative stress response of C. jejuni, such as SodB, Dps, Rrc and LuxS, whereas CosR positively controlled AhpC. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that CosR directly bound to the promoter region of the oxidative stress genes. DNase I footprinting assays identified 21-bp CosR binding sequences in the sodB and ahpC promoters, suggesting CosR specifically recognizes and binds to the regulated genes. Interestingly, the level of CosR protein was significantly reduced by paraquat (a superoxide generator) but not by hydrogen peroxide. Consistent with the overall negative regulation of oxidative stress defense proteins by CosR, the CosR knockdown by antisense rendered C. jejuni more resistant to oxidative stress compared to the wild type.

All LC50 values of fluralaner to zebrafish were higher than 10 mg L-1 at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. To study the bioconcentration and elimination, the zebrafish were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of fluralaner (2.00 and 0.20 mg L-1) for 15 d and then held 6 d in clean water. The results showed medium BCF of fluralaner with values of 12.06 (48 h) and 21.34 (144 h) after exposure to 2.00 and 0.20 mg L-1 fluralaner, respectively. In the elimination process, a concentration of only 0.113 mg kg(-1) was found in zebrafish on the 6th day after removal to clean water. After exposure in 2.00 mg L-1 fluralaner, the enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GST, GSH-PX, CarE and content of MDA were measured. Only CAT and CarE activities were significantly regulated and the others stayed at a stable level compared to the control group. Meanwhile, transcriptional expression of CYP1C2, CYP1D1, CYP11A were significantly down-regulated at 12 h exposed to 2.00 mg L-1 of fluralaner. Except CYP1D1, others CYPs were up-regulated at different time during exposure periods.        Fluralaner and its formulated product (BRAVECTO (R)) are of low toxicity to zebrafish and are rapidly concentrated in zebrafish and eliminated after exposure in clean water. Antioxidant defense and metabolic systems were involved in the fluralaner-induced toxicity.

Herein, we have proposed a photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor based on two-dimensional (2D)/3D organic-inorganic heterojunction for the efficient detection of Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium). The heterojunction was established via the in situ growth of copper (II) selenide (CuSe) nanosheets around the photoactive triazine covalent-organic polymer (COP) nanospheres, which was synthesized using 2,4,6-Tris(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-Triazine (TAPT) and 2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetricarbaldehyde (Tp) as building blocks (denoted as TAPT-Tp-COP@CuSe). Integrating the features of TAPT-Tp-COP (such as large specific surface and pore size, multi-functionality, and rich defects) and CuSe (such as high photoabsorption ability, fast electron transfer and effective separation of the photo-generated charge carrier) not only can accelerate the photoelectric transformation efficiency, but also can promote the aptamer immobilization. Consequently, the constructed PEC aptasensor based on TAPT-Tp-COP@CuSe illustrated a low detection limit of 3.4 CFU mL-1 with a linear range from 1 x 101 to 1 x 105 CFU mL-1 toward S. typhimurium.

Using an 87-compound library provided by the National Toxicology Program, consisting of known and suspected neurotoxicants, including drugs, flame retardants, industrial chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and presumptive negative controls, we further evaluate the benefits and limitations of the system for medium-throughput screening, focusing on the technical aspects of the system. We show that, in the context of this library, planarians are the most sensitive to pesticides with 16/16 compounds causing toxicity and the least sensitive to PAHs, with only 5/17 causing toxicity. Furthermore, while none of the presumptive negative controls were bioactive in adult planarians, 2/5, acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid, were bioactive in regenerating worms. Notably, these compounds were previously reported as developmentally toxic in mammalian studies.

The levels of the two antioxidant enzyme activities revealed that they are species-dependent with mullet's livers showing higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) (13.2 +/- 0.5 U/mg protein) and catalase (CAT) (15.5 +/- 1.0 mmol/min/mg protein) activities than flounder (SOD: 7.9 +/- 0.9 U/mg protein; CAT: 11.1 +/- 0.8 mmol/min/mg protein). After I month in captivity the antioxidant enzymes activities in liver decreased in mullets. while for flounders the responses were not consistent because during the experimental period flounders did not ate and responses of antioxidant enzymes and oxidative damages were dependent on the fasting condition. The liver oxidative damages were evaluated by estimating oxidised lipids and proteins. Both species showed similar levels for these two parameters, The hepatic lipid peroxidation in flounder increased after 1 month in captivity, while in mullet an increase was observed only in summer and autumn. The oxidised protein content increased for both species after the depuration period.        This study reveals differences between species under oxidative stress when exposed to pollutants. In a clean evironment, the mullet's primary antioxidant defences decreased indicating that the animals living in Douro estuary were facing an oxidative stress. The data indicate that. namely in mullet, the presence of pollutants induce oxidative stress responses. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we identified four homologous AraC/XylS regulators, Rob, SoxS, PliA, and OpiA, from the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora Ea1189. Previous studies have shown that the regulators MarA, Rob, and SoxS from Escherichia coli mediate multiple-antibiotic resistance, primarily by upregulating the AcrAB-TolC efflux system. However, none of the four AraC/XylS regulators from E. amylovora was able to induce a multidrug resistance phenotype in the plant pathogen. Overexpression of rob led to a 2-fold increased expression of the acrA gene. However, the rob-overexpressing strain showed increased resistance to only a limited number of antibiotics. Furthermore, Rob was able to induce tolerance to organic solvents in E. amylovora by mechanisms other than efflux. We demonstrated that SoxS from E. amylovora is involved in superoxide resistance. A soxS-deficient mutant of Ea1189 was not able to grow on agar plates supplemented with the superoxide-generating agent paraquat. Furthermore, expression of soxS was induced by redox cycling agents. We identified two novel members of the AraC/XylS family in E. amylovora. PliA was highly upregulated during the early infection phase in apple rootstock and immature pear fruits. Multiple compounds were able to induce the expression of pliA, including apple leaf extracts, phenolic compounds, redox cycling agents, heavy metals, and decanoate.

In the current study, we have cloned a nitroreductase gene, Salmonella typhimurium nitroreductase A (snrA), from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA1535, and characterized the purified gene product. SnrA is 240 amino acids in length and shares 87% sequence identity to the Escherichia coli homolog, E. coli nitroreductase A (NfsA). SnrA is the major nitroreductase in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA1535 and catalyzes nitroreduction through a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism in a NADPH and flavine mononucleotide (FMN) dependent manner. SmA exhibits extremely low levels of FMN reductase activity but the nitroreductase activity of SmA is competitively inhibited by exogenously added FMN. Treatment of TA 1535 with paraquat resulted in induction of nitroreductase activity, suggesting that SnrA is a member of the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SoxRS regulon associated with cellular defense against oxidative damage. Examination of the microbial genomes databases shows that SmA homologs are widely distributed in the microbial world, being present in isolates of both Archea and Eubacteria. Southern hybridization and PCR failed to detect the snrA gene in the closely related S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain TA 1538. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains TA1535 and TA1538 and their derivatives are commonly used in mutagenicity testing.

The in vitro germination and growth of the propagules of the EUS pathogen, Aphanomyces invadans (=A. piscicida), were assessed in the presence of the head-kidney macrophages, serum, and serum heated to inactivate complement proteins, of three EUS-susceptible and one resistant fish species. The susceptible species were: striped snakehead (Channa striata), giant gourami (Osphronemus gouramy) and silver barb [Barbodes (= Puntius) gonionotus], and the resistant species was Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish of all species were acclimatised to either low temperature (20 degreesC +/- 1.6) at which EUS is known to occur, or to high temperature (32 degrees C +/- 5.0) at which EUS does not occur, except for giant gouramis which were only studied at low temperature. The respiratory burst of the macrophages was assessed in the presence of A. invadans or the stimulant phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and compared to that of controls. Anti-A. invadans antibody concentrations were assessed in all species except silver barbs. All assays were carried out at the same temperature, regardless of the temperature that the fish were kept at.        Macrophages of all species other than snakeheads inhibited fungal germination at both temperatures, though only silver barb and gourami macrophages could inhibit germling growth. PMA increased the respiratory burst in nearly all cases. The respiratory burst in the presence of A. invadans was consistently lower than that of controls, though the difference was only significant in the case of snakeheads. The respiratory burst of all macrophage treatments was higher at a low temperature. Except in the case of PMA-stimulated macrophages, regressions between respiratory burst and inhibitory action were only found in susceptible species, suggesting that the respiratory burst is important in those species, but is unable to prevent the proliferation of A. invadans.        Serum inhibited fungal germination in all cases other than low temperature tilapia, indicating that the EUS resistance of tilapia is not due to the serum. Inhibition of germling growth by serum only occurred in silver barbs and gourami. Heated serum did not inhibit germination in any case except that of high temperature snakehead, and in fact stimulated germination in the case of tilapia. Heating serum did not affect the growth inhibiting activity of silver barbs and gouramis, but it stimulated growth in some groups. At high temperatures snakeheads had high anti-A. invadans antibody concentrations, which may explain the inhibitory activity of their heated serum. A role for complement and antibodies in defence against A. invadans in susceptible species is suggested.

Public perception of seriousness of risk for themselves, and for other people was examined for different types of uncertainty, for each of five different food hazards. The results indicated that participants responded to the different types of uncertainty in a uniform way, suggesting that perception of risk associated with uncertainty is not affected by the 'type' of uncertainty. The results further indicated that the seriousness of risk, in the presence of statements of uncertainty, was perceived to be greater for pesticides and genetic modification compared to BSE, high fat diets and Salmonella. It was argued that this could be due to the perceptions of low personal control, and high societal responsibility to protect people and societal control over exposure to the potential risks of pesticides and genetic modification. Under circumstances where people feel they have little personal control over their exposure to a particular hazard, and those social institutions that are perceived to be in control of protecting the public indicate that there is uncertainty associated with risk estimates, the hazard may appear to be 'out of control', which is associated with a perception of serious risk.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  100     Total Times Cited:  112     Cited Reference Count:  33,10.1080/1366987032000088883     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),uncertainty;food hazards;public perception;communication;UNREALISTIC OPTIMISM;RISK INFORMATION;PERSONAL RISK;COMMUNICATION;INTERVENTIONS,NA,NA,public perception of scientific uncertainty in relation to food hazards

A cultural model is a simplified way of understanding a complex system, shared by members of a culture. Eighty-eight percent of respondents understood Pfiesteria using one of four previously existing cultural models: a disease in fish, a parasite in fish, a water pollutant, and a toxin or poison. These models are not used by marine biologists, who are more likely to refer to Pfiesteria taxonomically or, in its fish killing form, to call it a predator. Our survey shows that the cultural model a respondent holds is correlated significantly with his or her believed pathway of human harm (e.g., eating fish versus swimming) and is correlated significantly but weakly with his or her behavioral responses. We conclude that existing cultural models, as the public has applied them to Pfiesteria, have led people to avoid a range of coastal activities and seafoods, in virtually all cases unnecessarily. Cultural models appear to explain public reaction better than previously hypothesized factors such as inaccurate media coverage.

In this study pesticide levels in water, metal body burdens and up to 12 different biochemical markers were monitored in gills and digestive glands of oysters transplanted from May to June in 2008 and 2009. Biochemical responses evidenced clear differences in oysters from 2008 and 2009. Oysters transplanted in 2009 showed their antioxidant defenses unaffected from May to June and consequently increased levels of tissue damage measured as lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks and of mortality rates. Conversely oysters transplanted in 2008 increase their antioxidant defenses from May to June, had low levels of lipid peroxidation and DNA damage and low mortality rates. Some pesticides in water such as bentazone and propanil together with high temperatures and salinity levels were related with tissue damage in oyster transplanted in 2008 but the observed large differences between years indicate that abiotic factors alone could not explain the high mortalities observed in 2009.

Tritici) and powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) are two serious diseases that severely intimidated yield and grain quality of winter wheat around the world. Since the preferable habitat conditions of them are similar, there is a high possibility that both diseases occurred in field simultaneously. To facilitate a differentiation of control procedures (i.e. using different fungicide), the discrimination of yellow rust and powdery mildew is a necessity. As a fast and nondestructive technique in obtaining the plant status information in real time, remote sensing has been successfully applied in the monitoring of crop diseases in several cases. However, studies addressing the discrimination of different crop diseases are rare. The aim of the present work was to assess the capability of remote sensing in discriminating yellow rust and powdery mildew at leaf level. For each disease, a total of 30 leaf samples were collected for spectral measurement, including both infected and non-infected leaves. Prior to the analysis, the spectral data were undertaken a normalization, to minimize the spectral difference caused by the cultivars. The spectra of normal leaves were compared with that of both infected ones (yellow rust and powdery mildew) through an independent t-test. Within the bands that were significantly different between normal and diseased leaves, a further band selection was conducted to differentiate powdery mildew from yellow rust using the same independent t-test. Only those disease sensitive bands that have the discriminative power were retained. Their discriminative capability was examined by a fisher linear discrimination analysis (FLDA). It turned out that the discrimination model yielded satisfactory estimation of sample categories, with an overall accuracy over 0.9. Therefore, it is evident that the hyperspectral remote sensing is a promising way to discriminate yellow rust and powdery mildew. © 2012 IEEE.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4; Conference name: 1st International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics, Agro-Geoinformatics 2012; Conference date: 2 August 2012 through 4 August 2012; Conference code: 93794",10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2012.6311599,fisher linear discrimination analysis;independent t-test;powdery mildew;winter wheat;yellow rust;Crops;Face recognition;Remote sensing;Fisher Linear Discrimination;Powdery mildew;Winter wheat;Yellow rust;Fungi;Discrimination (Psychology),NA,NA,discrimination of yellow rust and powdery mildew in wheat at leaf level using spectral signatures

Nevertheless, we report here that HD6 affords protection against invasion by enteric bacterial pathogens in vitro and in vivo. After stochastic binding to bacterial surface proteins, HD6 undergoes ordered self-assembly to form fibrils and nanonets that surround and entangle bacteria. This self-assembly mechanism occurs in vivo, requires histidine-27, and is consistent with x-ray crystallography data.

This review is restricted to human studies with at least 50 cases of ASD, having a valid comparison group, conducted within the past decade and focusing on maternal lifestyle or environmental chemicals.Results: Higher maternal intake of certain nutrients and supplements has been associated with reduction in ASD risk, with the strongest evidence for periconceptional folic acid supplements. Although many investigations have suggested no impact of maternal smoking and alcohol use on ASD, more rigorous exposure assessment is needed. A number of studies have demonstrated significant increases in ASD risk with estimated exposure to air pollution during the prenatal period, particularly for heavy metals and particulate matter. Little research has assessed other persistent and non-persistent organic pollutants in association with ASD specifically.Conclusions: More work is needed to examine fats, vitamins and other maternal nutrients, as well as endocrine-disrupting chemicals and pesticides, in association with ASD, given sound biological plausibility and evidence regarding other neurodevelopmental deficits. The field can be advanced by large-scale epidemiological studies, attention to critical aetiological windows and how these vary by exposure, and use of biomarkers and other means to understand underlying mechanisms. © The Author 2014; all rights reserved.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 283; Correspondence Address: K.

Self-sustaining populations now exist in almost every region to which they have been imported. In Australia, since their introduction in the 1970s, O. mossambicus have become established in catchments along the east and west coasts and have the potential to colonise other adjacent drainages.

Currently, there are major gaps in our understanding of the molecular interactions between S. homoeocarpa and creeping bentgrass. In this study, 454 sequencing technology was used in the de novo assembly of S. homoeocarpa and creeping bentgrass transcriptomes. Transcript sequence data obtained using Illumina's first generation sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) were mapped to the transcriptome assemblies to estimate transcript representation in different SBS libraries. SBS libraries included a S. homoeocarpa culture control, a creeping bentgrass uninoculated control, and a library for creeping bentgrass inoculated with S. homoeocarpa and incubated for 96 h. A Fisher's exact test was performed to determine transcripts that were significantly different during creeping bentgrass infection with S. homoeocarpa. Fungal transcripts of interest included glycosyl hydrolases, proteases, and ABC transporters. Of particular interest were the large number of glycosyl hydrolase transcripts that target a wide range of plant cell wall compounds, corroborating the suggested wide host range and saprophytic abilities of S. homoeocarpa. Several of the multidrug resistance ABC transporters may be important for resistance to both fungicides and plant defense compounds. Creeping bentgrass transcripts of interest included germins, ubiquitin transcripts involved in proteasome degradation, and cinnamoyl reductase, which is involved in lignin production. This analysis provides an extensive overview of the S. homoeocarpa-turfgrass pathosystem and provides a starting point for the characterization of potential virulence factors and host defense responses. In particular, determination of important host defense responses may assist in the development of highly resistant creeping bentgrass varieties. © 2012 Orshinsky et al.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 36; Correspondence Address: A.

Among the systems, the chemical defense system is of special interest for the food industry. Some of these compounds are toxic to specific microorganisms, insects, birds, and mammals, but most of those are toxic to humans and can give rise to chronic or acute symptoms of poisoning. Though some of the compounds occur in very low concentrations, the compounds have a cumulative harmful effect if they constitute a part of the normal diet over a prolonged period. Besides, food materials might be contaminated by exogenous toxins. Intrinsic toxins and contaminants have been recognized as the major components that affect food safety. This chapter introduces the occurrence and properties of the most important toxicants in foods, including allergens, toxic glycosides, toxic amino acids, lectins, saponins, toxins in aquatic organisms, various antinutrients, heavy metals, pesticide residues, dioxins, veterinary and fish drug residues, benzopyrenes as well as heterocyclic amines.

In vitro studies confirmed that both technical toxaphene and degraded toxaphene inhibit gap junctional intercellular communication that correlates with the mechanistic potential to cause tumor promotion. In vivo rat studies established the NOAEL for degraded and technical toxaphene at the highest dose tested in the bioassay. Toxaphene residue intakes from European fishery products were estimated and compared to the provisional tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) from various regulatory agencies including Canada, the United States, and Germany. The estimated intake was also compared to a new calculated provisionalMATT pTDI. TheMATT pTDI is based on new toxicological information (in vivo rat studies) developed on a model for environmental toxaphene residues rather than technical toxaphene. A MATT pTDI (1.08mg total toxaphene for a person of 60 kg) for tumor promotion potency was adopted for use in Europe and is referred to here as the MATT pTDI. These new data result in a better estimate of safety and a higher TDI than previously used. Based on realistic fish consumption data and recent baseline concentration data of toxaphene in European fishery products, the toxaphene intake for the consumers of Germany, Ireland, Norway, and the Netherlands was estimated. For an average adult fish consumer, the average daily intake of toxaphene was estimated to be 1.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.2 μg for the consumers of Norway, Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands, respectively. The toxaphene intake of these average fish consumers was far below the MATT pTDI of 1.08 mg/60 kg bw. In conclusion, based on the most relevant toxicological studies and the most realistic estimates of fish consumption and recent concentrations of toxaphene in European fishery products, adverse health effects are unlikely for the average European consumer of fishery products. In no case is the MATT pTDI exceeded. © 2011 SETAC.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: P.E.G.

The present study highlights trichlorofon-induced toxicity and the protective role of T2HCA in the liver, kidney, and brain of female Wistar rats. The rats were given a single dose of trichlorofon (150 mg / kg bw) and pre- and post-treatment T2HCA (50 mg / kg bw) for seven days. Trichlorofon enhanced oxidative stress in liver, kidney, and brain of the rats, which was evident from the elevation of lipid peroxidation (LPO). The reduced level of non-enzymatic antioxidant glutathione (GSH) also indicated the presence of an oxidative insult. The activity of enzymatic antioxidants like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-s-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was significantly decreased on trichlorfon administration. Pre and post treatment with T2HCA decreased the LPO level and increased SOD, CAT, GST, GR, GPx, and GSH in the brain, liver, and kidney. Trichlorfon-induced reduction in acelylcholinestrase was also ameliorated with T2HCA treatment.

This mechanism is also active in aquatic organisms such as mussels, fish, and their larvae. Modulation of this resistance mechanism by chemical agents occurring in the environment could result in either higher or lower internal concentrations of toxic or endogenous compounds in cells. The aim of the present study was to explore and quantify the inhibition of the P-gp efflux pumps by several ubiquitous aquatic contaminants. The calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM) assay commonly used in pharmacological research was established with P-gp-overexpressing Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCKII-MDR1) in a 96-well plate, avoiding extra washing, centrifugation, and lysis steps. This calcein-AM-based P-gp cellular efflux pump inhibition assay (CEPIA) was used to study the inhibition by commonly occurring environmental contaminants. Among others, the compounds pentachlorophenol, perfluorooctane sulfonate, and perfluorooctanoate strongly inhibited the P-gp-mediated efflux of calcein-AM while the chloninated alkanes did not seem to interact with the transporter. The fact that common pollutants can be potent modulators of the efflux transporters is a motive to further study whether this increases the toxicity of other contaminants present in the same matrices.

Earlier studies showed some biofungicides could inhibit growth and reduce the disease in vitro. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of commercial biofungicides on in vivo disease development and plant growth on four nursery species when inoculated with three isolates representing each of the NA1, NA2 and EU1 lineages of the pathogen. The plant species were Gaultheria shallon, Rubus spectabilis, Rhododendron caucasicum x R. ponticum var. album and Cornus sericea. Prior to pathogen inoculation, plants were pretreated with Aliette® (standard fungicide), Actigard 50WG Plant Activator®, Actinovate® SP, Sonata®, Serenade®, Plant Helper®, SoilGard® 12G and Pro Mix BX Biofungicide™. A suspension containing 7000 sporangia ml-1 was used to inoculate plants. Disease severity and foliar biomass were recorded 14 days after inoculation. Actinovate was the only product able to reduce disease severity by about 50% and improve plant growth of the susceptible hosts. Its effectiveness differed by isolate. Several other biofungicides and the standard fungicide provided suppression of disease and improved plant growth but their effectiveness was dependent on host species, product and isolate. None of the products prevented disease and generally the level of control obtained was lower than would be acceptable for a commercial nursery. In addition to assessing the disease control products, it was also observed that rhododendron, salal and salmonberry were highly susceptible hosts of P. ramorum with PR05-001 (NA2) being the most aggressive isolate on them. © 2012 Copyright Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Canada.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: K.

The agricultural frontier of Argentina is spreading out, and this phenomenon has involved a significant increase in the use of biocides. Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethylglycine, PMG) is the most widely used herbicide in this country. Particularly the application of formulated glyphosate increased from 70 million kg in 1999 to more than 210 million in 2011. Although this herbicide is considered as ""environmentally friendly"" with moderate persistence, the mobility and fate will be conditioned by the chemical and biological profile of the environment, and regarding that, several authors have determined environmentally relevant levels of glyphosate and its metabolites in surface water. The risk associated with the use of PMG, could be assessed by the evaluation of the impact on a non-target species: Cnesterodon decemmaculatus, a Neotropical endemic teleost, widely distributed in the region. Experimental results would indicate that glyphosate (active ingredient, analytical grade, acid form) does not present a high level of toxicity (LC50-96h > 100 mg.L-1) on C. decemmaculatus. However, the toxicity of one of the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation was found to be significantly higher (LC50-96h = 29 mg.L-1). These results are consistent with other evidences that indicate a remarkable increase in the toxicity of formulations regarding to the active ingredient in freshwater teleosts. Several scientists have focused their research on the identification of biomarkers of environmental stress in non-target species. These could be specific and early signals of the toxic-organism interaction. In this regard, the utility of morphological and biochemical parameters as quantitative bioindicators of xenobiotic exposure has been shown. Within this framework, we measured the impact of sublethal exposure of Cnesterodon decemmaculatus to PMG on antioxidant defenses (catalase activity) and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase activity). After acute exposure, PMG caused changes in the enzyme activities: an increase in the activity of catalase and an inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase activity. These results are the first report indicating that sublethal PMG affect these biomarkers in a native teleost species. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Our previous studies have demonstrated the antibacterial property of piscine H2A variants against gram-negative bacteria Edwardsiella piscicida and Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae. In this study, we show the function and mechanism of piscine H2A in the negative regulation of RLR signaling pathway and host innate immune response against spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) infection. SVCV infection significantly inhibits the expression of histone H2A during an early stage of infection, but induces the expression of histone H2A during the late stage of infection such as at 48 and 72 hpi. Under normal physiological conditions, histone H2A is nuclear-localized. However, SVCV infection promotes the migration of histone H2A from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The in vivo studies revealed that histone H2A overexpression led to the increased expression of SVCV gene and decreased survival rate. The overexpression of histone H2A also significantly impaired the expression levels of those genes involved in RLR antiviral signaling pathway. Furthermore, histone H2A targeted TBK1 and IRF3 to promote their protein degradation via the lysosomal pathway and impair the formation of TBK1-IRF3 functional complex. Importantly, histone H2A completely abolished TBK1-mediated antiviral activity and enormously impaired the protein expression of IRF3, especially nuclear IRF3. Further analysis demonstrated that the inhibition of histone H2A nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking could relieve the protein degradation of TBK1 and IRF3, and blocked the negative regulation of histone H2A on the SVCV infection. Collectively, our results suggest that histone H2A nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking is essential for negative regulation of RLR signaling pathway and antiviral immune response in response to SVCV infection.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  41,10.3389/fimmu.2021.771277     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),histone H2A;nuclear;cytoplasmic trafficking;negative regulation;RLR signaling;SVCV infection;RIG-I;STIMULATED GENES;RECOGNITION;INTERFERON;RECEPTORS;IFN;CONTRIBUTE;CHROMATIN;VARIANTS;INJURY;Histones,NA,NA,histone h2a nuclearcytoplasmic trafficking is essential for negative regulation of antiviral immune response and lysosomal degradation of tbk1 and irf3

Although studies look into xenobiotic biotransformation by Tsukamurella isolates, the relevant enzymes remain uncharacterized. We investigated the arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzyme family, known for its role in the xenobiotic metabolism of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Xenobiotic sensitivity of Tsukamurella paurometabola type strain DSM 20162(T) was assessed, followed by cloning, recombinant expression and functional characterization of its single NAT homolog (TSUPD)NAT1. The bacterium appeared quite robust against chloroanilines, but more sensitive to 4-anisidine and 2-aminophenol. However, metabolic activity was not evident towards those compounds, presumably due to mechanisms protecting cells from xenobiotic entry. Of the pharmaceutical arylhydrazines tested, hydralazine was toxic, but the bacterium was less sensitive to isoniazid, a drug targeting mycolic acid biosynthesis in mycobacteria. Although (TSUPD)NAT1 protein has an atypical Cys-His-Glu (instead of the expected Cys-His-Asp) catalytic triad, it is enzymatically active, suggesting that this deviation is likely due to evolutionary adaptation potentially serving a different function. The protein was indeed found to use malonyl-CoA, instead of the archetypal acetyl-CoA, as its preferred donor substrate. Malonyl-CoA is important for microbial biosynthesis of fatty acids (including mycolic acids) and polyketide chains, and the corresponding enzymatic systems have common evolutionary histories, also linked to xenobiotic metabolism.

Two cultured isolates of Alexandrium, exhibiting markedly different PSP toxin compositions and specific toxicities, were used independently to determine the kinetics of toxin accumulation and loss, as well as the potential for biotransformation of individual PSP toxins in certain tissues. Clams readily ingested and absorbed a monospecific diet of the low toxicity A. tamarense isolate GtLI22. They also ingested cells of the high toxicity A. fundyense isolate GtCA29, but at a lower rate, and only when the diet was supplemented with a nontoxic diatom, Thalassiosira weissflogii. As natural populations of M. mercenaria rarely accumulate a substantial PSP toxin load, this suggests the existence of a toxin recognition mechanism. Maximum toxicities in clam tissues, attained within 2 wk of exposure to either toxic dinoflagellate, exceeded the regulatory harvest closure level (80-mu-g STXeq 100 g-1) by several orders of magnitude. Detoxification to levels acceptable for human consumption occurred within 3 to 6 wk. HPLC analyses revealed significant differences between the toxic profile of the dinoflagellates and that accumulated in various clam tissues. Clams toxified with isolate GtLI22, a strain rich in low potency C-toxins, showed: (1) de novo appearance of STX, (2) significant reduction in the proportion of C-toxins, and (3) reciprocal increase in the proportion of the gonyautoxins GTX2+3. Significant relative enrichment in STX also occurred in tissues of clams fed upon GtCA29, an isolate rich in the more potent carbamate toxins.

Throughout most of its range it has not been well studied, and in southern China very little is known of its biology. The goal of the present study was to provide scientific information needed for the long-term conservation and management of the population that occurs in Hong-Kong waters. From September 1997 to November 1998, 38,105 km of systematic line transect surveys were conducted throughout marine waters of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and adjacent waters to provide data on distribution and abundance. Photo-identification of individual dolphins allowed for examination of movement patterns, home ranges, and social organization. Collection of stranded dolphin carcasses and detailed neeropsies provided information on causes of death as well as samples for life history studies, such as feeding habits, growth and reproduction, ecotoxicology, and stock structure.        The dolphin population appears to be centered around the Pearl River Estuary, and Hong Kong waters represent the eastern portion of the range, which extends far into mainland Chinese waters (Lingding Bay) and covers at least 1,800 km(2). Within Hong Kong, dolphins only occur in western waters around Lantau Island. The area north of Lantau Island is heavily used throughout the year and represents by far the most important habitat in Hong Kong. Line transect analyses indicate that between 88 (spring) and 145 (summer) dolphins occur in Hong Kong. Based on 27,6000 photographs taken, 213 individual dolphins were identified. The total size of the Pearl River breeding population is unknown, but is estimated to consist of at least 1,028 dolphins, based on line transect analysis. An apparent decline in the number of dolphins in the North Lantau area over the period from 1996-1998 was not statistically significant. Individual dolphins have overlapping home ranges of about 30-400 km(2) in different sections of the population's overall range. Groups of dolphins in Hong Kong number up to 23 animals, with an average group size of 3.8 +/- s.d. 3.63 animals. There is no significant seasonal variation in group size, but groups feeding behind pair trawl fishing vessels (mean = 8.3 +/- s.d. 7.84) are significantly larger than those in Hong Kong. Groups are very fluid and change composition frequently, with association indices ranging from 0-0.333. Behavioral patterns are similar to those of other coastal dolphins, but Hong Kong hump-backed dolphins only rarely ride bow waves. Following pair trawlers represents an important feeding strategy for some individuals. Construction work on an airport fuel facility in the dolphins' main habitat appears to have caused some disturbance (indicated by increased swimming speeds) and possibly temporary evacuation of the surrounding area.        There is a great deal of developmental variation in the color pattern of southern Chinese hump-backed dolphins, with a general lightening from newborn to adult stages. Males appear to retain more spots in adulthood than females. Length at birth appears to be about 100 cm, and postnatal development is characterized by rapid growth in the first year and a levelling-off of the growth curve after reaching adulthood. Asymptotic length is reached at around 243 cm. Length and weight are related exponentially, with the maximum weight about 250 kg. Calving occurs throughout the year, but most young are born from January through August, with a peak in spring/summer. Scant evidence suggests that sexual maturity in females is reached at about 9-10 years of age. Dolphins feed mainly on several demersal and pelagic fish species that are often associated with estuaries. There is a lack of evidence for long-distance movements (on the order of hundreds of linear kilometers), and this presumably results in isolation of groups around major Chinese river mouths. Thus it appears that there may be at least 8 separate populations of hump-backed dolphins along the coast of southern China. The Pearl River Estuary, including Hong Kong, is apparently inhabited by one of these populations, although preliminary genetic work has shown only equivocal evidence of population separation from dolphins in the Xiamen area. Human-related causes of mortality include entanglement in fishing nets and vessel collisions. Some environmental contaminants (especially the heavy metal mercury and the pesticide DDT) were found in high levels in some dolphins, and preliminary evidence suggests that these may be affecting the health of the animals.        A series of recommendations for management and for further research have been made to aid in the conservation of these animals. Principles for the conservation of wild living resources should be followed, and information from both the natural and social sciences are needed for proper management. Research and long-term monitoring of the population must continue for management strategies to be evaluated and refined. Overall, the population of hump-backed dolphins that occurs in Hong Kong waters appears to be viable and should be able to survive with appropriate conservation efforts.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  177     Total Times Cited:  223     Cited Reference Count:  141,,abundance;behavior;conservation status;distribution;Hong Kong;human interactions;IndoPacific hump-backed dolphin;life history;mortality;reproduction;social organization;Sousa chinensis;BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS;TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS;MARINE MAMMALS;PERSISTENT ORGANOCHLORINES;SOUSA-CHINENSIS;SMALL CETACEANS;COASTAL WATERS;BELUGA WHALES;SOUTH-AFRICA;EAST COAST;Back,NA,NA,population biology of the indopacific humpbacked dolphin in hong kong waters
rayyan-1227193458,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance penconazole,2008,10,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,10,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Penconazole is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on penconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 19 June 2007. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 1 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July-August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on cucurbits and grapes. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Topas 10 EC"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC).        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues of penconazole in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of penconazole. A data gap was identified for a confirmatory method for surface water. It is noted that the residue definition for soil and water is provisional.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. It is noted however, that further validation data are required for the impurity method and that there is no supported technical specification.        The toxicological studies on the metabolism of penconazole have shown an extensive oral absorption, a wide distribution in the body and an excretion mainly via urine. According to the results of acute oral toxicity testing, the agreed classification was Xn, R22 Harmful if swallowed. The main target organ in short term toxicity studies was the liver, and the dog was the most sensitive species. No genotoxic potential was observed during in vitro or in vivo tests, and no carcinogenicity was observed in rats or mice after long term exposure. In the reproductive toxicity studies, an increased incidence of dystocia was considered as an effect already observed with other triazoles, and to be forwarded to EChA for a decision upon classification (R62?- ""Possible risk of impaired fertility""). Developmental effects were observed in the teratogenicity studies, and the classification Reprotoxic Category 3 R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child was proposed by the experts. Several plant metabolites were considered to be of the same or lower toxicity than penconazole. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) were both 0.03 mg/kg bw/day based on the combined 90-day/1- year dog study. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.5 mg/kg bw based on early bodyweight changes in the rabbit developmental study. These reference values were all derived with the use of a safety factor of 100. The dermal absorption values were 5% for the dilution and 1% for the concentrate. The exposure estimates in different scenarios (field or greenhouse use) were all below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment.        The metabolism of penconazole was tested in grapes, tomatoes and apples where triazole and phenyl labelled compound was applied. The meeting of experts considered that the grape data were not acceptable and they were not considered further. The apple and tomato data were acceptable and showed the same metabolic profile. The main metabolism route is oxidation at the 1, 2 and 3 positions on the alkyl chain. The triazole moiety metabolites are an issue for all the triazole fungicides and will be dealt with in a separate exercise. For completeness, a general data gap was identified for this issue which has been used in other triazole conclusions. No phenyl-ring-only metabolites were seen. The significant residues at harvest consisted of CGA 132465(2), CGA 190503(3), CGA 127841(4) and their glucoside conjugates as well as penconazole. It was agreed that the provisional residue definition for risk assessment (fruit crops only) should be penconazole and free and conjugated CGA 132465, CGA 190503 and CGA 127841 expressed as penconazole.        The residue definition for monitoring is penconazole with a conversion factor of 6 between monitoring and risk assessment residue definitions. The residue trial data set was complete for grapes but a data gap for outdoor cucurbits in the North of Europe was identified. The stability of residues was demonstrated in freezer storage for a period of 16 months. Appropriate processing data are available. Two rotational crop metabolism studies conducted at exaggerated rates showed that no significant residue would be expected in rotational crops. No livestock metabolism studies were supplied or required, as according to current guidance the representative crops under consideration are not fed to animals.        The chronic risk assessment showed a maximum intake of 2.9 % of the ADI for the French diet using the EFSA model. For the acute risk the highest intake was 13 % of the ARID from the consumption of table grapes for the German diet using the EFSA model. The proposed MRLs are 0.2 mg/kg for grapes and 0.1 mg/kg for cucurbits.        In soil under aerobic conditions penconazole exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolites CGA 179944(5) (accounting for up to 18.9% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence and CGA 71019(6) (accounting for up to 38.6% of AR) which also exhibited low persistence. Mineralisation of both the phenyl and triazole rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 65 and 27 % of AR respectively after 546 and 364 days. The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 22 and 47 % of AR respectively after 364 and 336 days. A data gap was identified for the identification/characterisation of the unknown radioactivity Ul found in the aerobic soil degradation up to 17.3% of the applied radioactivity.        Penconazole is strongly adsorbed to soils and is unlikely to leach in soil. Column leaching studies have confirmed this, demonstrating that the parent compound is only recovered from the upper layers of the columns. Metabolite CGA 179944 exhibits very high mobility in soil and CGA 71019 exhibits very high to medium mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of penconazole or that of its soil metabolites was pH dependent.        Penconazole does not degrade significantly via either hydrolysis or photolysis. The metabolites CGA 179944 and CGA 71019 were shown to be stable to hydrolysis under environmentally relevant conditions. The fate of penconazole in the aquatic environment therefore, will be principally determined by adsorption to the sediments and slow degradation therein. The terminal metabolite, carbon dioxide was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 4.6-8.4% of AR at 678-706 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 18-19 % of AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for penconazole and metabolites CGA 179944 and CGA 71019 at steps 1-2. Additional FOCUSsw calculations for penconazole confirmed that the maximum Step 3 PECs are 85% (water) and 70% (sediment) lower than the Step 2 derived values.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by penconazole, CGA 71019 and CGA 179944 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low for the intended uses covering only neutral and alkaline soil conditions. In addition, an assessment of the potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses on vines with highest rates and numbers of applications for some FOCUS scenarios is not available. For unknown Ul, a data gap was identified for a groundwater exposure assessment. A second modelling with FOCUS PEARL model is also necessary. It was concluded that penconazole is unlikely to be subject to long range atmospheric transport as a consequence of its likely indirect photooxidation intermediated transformation (half life estimated at 15.9 hours).        The representative uses of penconazole are applications to cucurbits and grapes. The first tier risk assessment indicated that a low risk is expected to birds and mammals. TERs for earthworm eating birds and mammals meet the Annex VI trigger value of 5. The risk to birds and mammals from intake of contaminated drinking water from surface water or puddles was considered to be low.        The meeting agreed with the use of the toxicity data for the triazole metabolites from the report from PRAPeR 13 for the ecotoxicology and from the report from PRAPeR 14 for the mammalian endpoint.        The penconazole avian and mammalian databases were reviewed for effects indicative of potential endocrine activity. There are no relevant mediated effects below the threshold established by the current endpoints for the mammals. The expert meeting PRAPeR 48 agrees that some uncertainties remain on potential delayed reproductive effects on birds since these effects are not covered on the basis of the currently stated data requirements of Council Directive 91/414/EEC. More information should be requested at MS level. Based on the information available penconazole is proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms.        The first tier risk assessment indicated a low long term risk to fish and also a low acute risk to aquatic invertebrates, algae and sediment dwelling organisms. However, tier I risk assessment also indicated that there is a high acute risk to fish and a high long term risk to aquatic invertebrates and aquatic plants. The Annex VI triggers for acute and long term risk are met with the PECsw from FOCUS Step 2. The higher tier risk assessment indicated a low risk for all aquatic organisms, except for the long term risk to aquatic invertebrates. However, with FOCUS Step 3 PECsw the TER value was above the Annex VI trigger values. The applicant and the RMS proposed that an appropriate FSDT study was required to address the potential endocrine-mediated effect in DMI fungicides since the FSDT will cover the sensitive time windows with respect to effect triggering and effect manifestation. The member state experts agreed with this proposal and also noted that member states should have the opportunity to ask for an appropriate test to address the endocrine effects.        The BCF of 320 was derived from a study with bluegill sunfish (Lepomis machrochirus). The first tier risk assessment for metabolites indicated a low acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms for both metabolites CGA 71019 and CGA 179944.        Penconazole is of low toxicity to bees. Hazard Quotients (HQ) for oral and contact exposure were determined to be below the trigger values indicating a low risk for bees.        The risk to non-target arthropods was assessed as high for the in-field areas, however a potential for recolonisation from the off field areas had been demonstrated.        The acute and chronic TER values for penconazole and for both metabolites CGA 71019 and CGA 179944 were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating that the risk to earthworms is low.        Penconazole and the metabolite CGA 71019 were tested with Folsomia candida, and the active substance was tested for effects in a litter bag study. In conclusion, the risk of penconazole and the metabolite CGA 71019 to other non-target macro-organisms was considered to be low.        The results of the assessment of ""Topas 10 EC"" as well as the soil metabolites CGA 71019 and CGA 179944 indicate no adverse impact on soil non target organisms.        In a preliminary screening test ""Topas 10 EC"" had only a slight effect (< 50 % effect) on seedling emergence and vegetative vigour in 3 monocotyledons and 3 dicotyledons at rates up to 30 g a.s./ha. EFSA notes that the dose used in the screening test, 30 g a.s./ha, has not covered the higher proposed intended uses of 50 g a.s./ha.        No inhibitory effects of penconazole to respiration rates of activated sludge were observed up to 100 mg /L.

During infection, AIP56 spreads systemically and depletes phagocytes by postapoptotic secondary necrosis, impairing the host phagocytic defense and contributing to the genesis of infection-associated necrotic lesions. Here we show that mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDM) intoxicated by AIP56 undergo NF-kappa B p65 depletion and apoptosis. Similarly to what was reported for sea bass phagocytes, intoxication of mBMDM involves interaction of AIP56 C-terminal region with cell surface components, suggesting the existence of a conserved receptor. Biochemical approaches and confocal microscopy revealed that AIP56 undergoes clathrin-dependent endocytosis, reaches early endosomes, and follows the recycling pathway. Translocation of AIP56 into the cytosol requires endosome acidification, and an acidic pulse triggers translocation of cell surface-bound AIP56 into the cytosol. Accordingly, at acidic pH, AIP56 becomes more hydrophobic, interacting with artificial lipid bilayer membranes. Altogether, these data indicate that AIP56 is a short-trip toxin that reaches the cytosol using an acidic-pH-dependent mechanism, probably from early endosomes. Usually, for short-trip AB toxins, a minor pool reaches the cytosol by translocating from endosomes, whereas the rest is routed to lysosomes for degradation. Here we demonstrate that part of endocytosed AIP56 is recycled back and released extracellularly through a mechanism requiring phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity but independent of endosome acidification. So far, we have been unable to detect biological activity of recycled AIP56, thereby bringing into question its biological relevance as well as the importance of the recycling pathway.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  93,10.1128/IAI.02623-14     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),SEABREAM SPARUS-AURATA;BOTULINUM C2 TOXIN;DIPHTHERIA-TOXIN;EXTRACELLULAR PRODUCTS;ENDOCYTIC PATHWAY;MOUSE MACROPHAGES;CELL PENETRATION;MEMBRANE;DYNAMIN;RICIN,NA,NA,intracellular trafficking of aip56 an nfκbcleaving toxin from <i>photobacterium damselae<i> subsp <i>piscicida<i>

PBDE concentrations in organisms from Bohai Bay (Sigma PBDEs: 0.15-32.8 ng/g lipid weight) were low compared with other marine organisms worldwide, and BDE-47 was the predominant compound in most samples, followed by BDE-28, BDE-99/BDE-100, and BDE-119.

It was found that most of the identified characteristics and concerns were unique to specific food hazards, though some were shared. The findings were supported in a validation study using a more representative sample of the public.

Rev.,9,4,525-535,"Vale, P",,English,,"INRB L IPIMAR, P-1449006 Lisbon, Portugal","Scientific study of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSTs) started in the early XXth century. In the 1920s it was understood the link between the toxicity observed in mussels with certain microalgae species. The poison was eventually purified from the clam Saxidomus giganteus, taking its name from it: saxitoxin (STX). Along the 1970s and 1980s it was understood that other STX analogues existed, both in dinoflagellates and bivalves. These were grouped into three major occurring families: the carbamate, N-sulfocarbamoyl and decarbamoyl, depending on the variation of the side chain of the tetrahydropurine core. The deoxydecarbamoyl family was additionally recognised in the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum. Chemical research into these STX analogues was conducted worldwide during the 1990s mainly by HPLC with pre- or post-column oxidation and fluorescence detection. Implementation of fluorescence detection with spectral capabilities and mass spectrometry detection during the 2000s led to the recognition of new analogues. Metabolites originated by single or double hydroxylation at C11 position were found in mussels, and later suspected in other bivalves. Designated M1-M4, these present very low fluorescence, and can only be studied resorting to HILIC-MS. Three hydroxybenzoate analogues were characterised as an important toxin fraction of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum, and named GC1-GC3. Later, many more analogues were suspected: the corresponding N1-hydroxyl variants of GC1-GC3 (GC4-GC6), di-hydroxybenzoate variants (GC1a-GC6a), and sulphate-benzoate variants (GC1b-GC6b). In bivalves, carbamoylase activity renders these analogues into decarbamoyl analogues. Other compounds with PST-like characteristics have been detected in bivalves from Angola, Argentina and Vietnam. Today, the range of naturally occurring STX derivatives, both in marine and freshwater environments, accounts to more than fifty structural variants. This poses a problem for carrying out food safety analysis based solely in chemical methods. Fortunately, most modifications to the side chain of the tetrahydropurine core result in diminished toxicity.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  34     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.1007/s11101-010-9196-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Saxitoxin;Hydroxybenzoate;M toxin;PSP;Gymnodinium catenatum;Bivalves;PARALYTIC SHELLFISH TOXINS;DINOFLAGELLATE GYMNODINIUM-CATENATUM;ALEXANDRIUM-MINUTUM DINOPHYCEAE;SINGLE-LABORATORY VALIDATION;POISONING TOXINS;LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY;FLUORESCENCE DETECTION;MASS-SPECTROMETRY;TRANSFORMING ENZYME;SODIUM-CHANNEL;Biotransformation;Military Personnel,NA,NA,new saxitoxin analogues in the marine environment developments in toxin chemistry detection and biotransformation during the 2000s

Traditional methods for detection of fungicide resistance are time-consuming, which are routinely based on tedious operation, reliance on expensive equipment, and specially trained people. Therefore, it is important to establish efficient methods for field detection of benzimidazole resistance in V. carpophila to make suitable management strategies and ensure food safety. Based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with CRISPR/Cas12a, a rapid one-pot assay ORCas12a-BRVc (one-pot RPA-CRISPR/Cas12 platform) was established for the detection of benzimidazole resistance in V. carpophila. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay enabled one-pot detection by adding components at the bottom and wall of the tube separately, solving the problems of aerosol contamination and decreased sensitivity caused by competing DNA substrates between Cas12a cleavage and RPA amplification. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay could accomplish the detection with a minimum of 7.82 x 10(3) fg mu L-1 V. carpophila genomic DNA in 45 min at 37 degrees C. Meanwhile, this assay showed excellent specificity due to the specific recognition ability of the Cas12a-crRNA complex. Further, we combined a method that could rapidly extract DNA from V. carpophila within 2 min with the ORCas12a-BRVc to achieve more rapid and simple detection of V. carpophila with benzimidazole resistance in fields. The ORCas12a-BRVc assay has the advantages of simplicity, rapidity, high sensitivity, high specificity, and ease of operation without the need for precision instruments and the need to isolate and culture pathogens. This assay is the first application of the one-pot platform based on the combination of RPA and CRISPR/Cas12a in fungicide resistance detection and can be used for monitoring of resistant populations in fields, providing guidance on making suitable management strategies for peach scab.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  39,10.1021/acs.jafc.2c06549,fungicide resistance;one-pot detection;MBC fungicides;Venturia carpophila;RPA;CRISPR/Cas12a;MEDIATED ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION;BETA-TUBULIN GENE;BOTRYTIS-CINEREA;CARBENDAZIM;CHINA;DNA;SENSITIVITY;FUNGICIDES;MUTATIONS;Benzimidazoles,NA,NA,onepot assay for rapid detection of benzimidazole resistance in <i>venturia carpophila<i> by combining rpa and crisprcas12a

The results indicated that RCTLR9 cDNA contains 3141 bp. It encodes 1047 amino acids containing 16 typical structures of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) including an LRRTYP, LRRCT and a motif involved in PAMP binding was identified at position 240-253 amino acid. Broad expression of RCTLR9 was found in larval, juvenile and adult stages irrespective of the tissues. In larval stage, RCTLR9 mRNA expression decreased at 5 d and then increased at 10 dph. At juvenile stage cobia, the expression was significantly high (p < 0.05) in spleen and intestine compared to gill, kidney, liver and skin. However, at adult stage, the significant high expression was found in gill and intestine. Cobia challenged with P. damselae subsp. piscicida showed significant increase in RCTLR9 expression at 24 h post challenge in intestine, spleen and liver, while in kidney the expression was peak at 12 h and later it decreased at 24 h. The highest expression was 40 fold increase in spleen and the lowest expression was similar to 3.6 fold increase in liver. Cobia stimulated with CpG oligonucleotides showed that the induction of these genes was CpG ODN type and time dependent. In spleen and liver, CpG ODNs 1668 and 2006 injected group showed high expression of RCTLR9, IL-1 beta, chemokine CC compared to other groups.

They affect enantioseparations in ways that are not understood for the lack of systematic studies, which makes the scale-up of preparative separations difficult to predict. Once a column has been exposed to these modifiers, the selectivity of certain pairs of enantiomers may change, for the better or the worse. Numerous molecules that are affected by this phenomenon are listed in the literature. We selected five of them, the selectivity of which changes as more acidic or basic solutions are percolated through the column. The selectivity of ketoprofen, 4-chlorophenylalanine methyl and ethyl esters improves as a solution of Ethanesulfonic Acid is percolated through the column. The selectivity of Propranolol HCl and Trdger's base increases as a solution of diisopropylamine is percolated through the column. Each one of these five compounds is inversely affected by the percolation of the opposite acid/base solution. We used trans-Stilbene Oxide (tso) as a ""standard"" to determine the columns stability because no Memory Effect is observed for it (its retention, enantioselectivity, and resolution remain constant). Karl Fisher titrations showed that only slight changes in the water content of the mobile phase occurred, and that a unique water to polymer moiety ratio is important. Analytical studies of the stationary phase suggest that slow protonation/deprotonation of water attached to the carbamate moiety may be responsible for the acid/base Memory Effect. Finally, we showed that the Memory Effect can be minimized by percolating through the column a sufficiently concentrated solution of the appropriate acid or base. Thus, columns that were unreliable for method development, due to the Memory Effect, can now be used. As a result, the need to store several CHIRALPAK AD columns, specific for each condition of the Memory Effect, is eliminated. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

rayyan-1227193469,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triazoxide Issued on 30 September 2008,2009,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Triazoxide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triazoxide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 25 June 2007. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and to the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprises seed treatment in barley against several agriculturally important diseases. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached endpoints. The specification for the technical material as a whole should currently be regarded as provisional (September 2008).        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Raxil S FS 040"", a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) containing 20 g/L triazoxide and 20 g/L tebuconazole.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant and animal origin, soil and water, however for air, a method validated to LOQ of 0.6 mu g a.s./m(3) is required.        With regard to its toxicological properties, triazoxide was rapidly and extensively absorbed but only partly bioavailable (50%) to the target organ (blood system) due to its biokinetic properties. After single exposure, it was shown to be toxic after oral or inhalative administration, but was not irritant or skin sensitizer. Consequently, the proposed classification for acute toxicity was T, R23/25 Toxic by inhalation and if swallowed.        After repeated oral or inhalative administration, the critical effect was the induction of haemolytic anaemia, with secondary effects in the spleen, liver and kidneys. The possible classification with Xn; R48/22 or T; R48/25 (Harmful or Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed) could not be agreed by the experts, but the classification T, R48/23 Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure through inhalation was proposed. Triazoxide did not show any genotoxic or carcinogenic properties in the available studies. No specific adverse effects on fertility were observed in the multi-generation rat study, but the classification R64 May cause harm to breastfed babies was proposed based on reduced pup survival during lactation, that could be expected to result from the presence of triazoxide in milk. No developmental toxicity or teratogenic activity was observed in rats and rabbits.        The agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI) was 0.00005 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year rat study and using a safety factor of 100, increased by an additional safety factor of 10. This was justified by the use of a lowest observed adverse effect level, the shallow dose-response in the study and the absence of mechanistic information. The agreed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.001 mg/kg bw/ day based on the 90-day rat study, using a safety factor of 100 and a correction for bioavailability (50%). The agreed acute reference dose (ARfD) was 0.015 mg/kg bw based on the 4-week rat study and applying a safety factor of 100.        The agreed dermal absorption values to be used in the risk assessment were 2.4% for the concentrate and 2% for the contaminated grain dust. The operator exposure estimate during the seed treatment was above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but realistic field studies showed an exposure level up to 21% of the AOEL. Similarly, the exposure estimates for the worker loading and sowing treated seed was above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but below the AOEL with a field study (26%).        With regard to consumer exposure assessment, the nature and magnitude of residues in plant and animal commodities could not be sufficiently clarified by the submitted data on triazoxide applied as a seed treatment to barley.        Taking into account the toxicological profile of triazoxide and its metabolites, the meeting of experts in residues agreed on data gaps with regard to the nature of residues in the plant. No final residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment could therefore be agreed. In the submitted residue trials no residues of triazoxide were found above the LOQ of 0.05 mg/kg in grain and straw. However, it was agreed that the analytical method used in these trials was not validated at a sufficiently low LOQ to ensure that an exceedance of the ADI could be definitively excluded, and therefore new trials with a lower LOQ were required. Assuming residues of triazoxide were present in barley grain at the LOQ level of 0.05 mg/kg, the ADI was exceeded for one Member State diet in the EFSA PRAPeR model. The potential for residues being present in food of animal origin due to carry-over from treated straw has not been addressed, since no data on livestock was submitted due to residues being below the LOQ of 0.05 mg/kg in grain and straw in residue trials. However, given the very low ADI of triazoxide and its metabolites, and given the presence of total residues of 0.04 mg/kg in straw, the experts had concerns that transfer of toxicologically relevant residues from straw into livestock matrices may occur, even though at very low levels. An indicative exposure assessment, using the default residue value of 0.01 mg/kg for milk, showed that the ADI would be significantly exceeded for a number of European national and regional diets, and therefore further consideration of the issue of residues in animal products is required.        No concerns were identified with regard to residues in rotational crops, provided rotated cereals will be addressed with the required new data for the primary cereal crop.        In conclusion, the available metabolism and residue data are not considered appropriate to conduct a robust consumer exposure and risk assessment due to the uncertainties identified with regard to the nature of residues in plant commodities, and with regard to possible transfer of residues in animal products, and the need for a lower LOQ of the analytical method for the relevant analytes in studies on the magnitude of residues.        Triazoxide may be considered to be high to very high persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DT50 (lab (biphasic kinetic, overall)) = 208 - 278 days). Degradation of triazoxide proceeds either through reduction to desoxy-triazoxide (M01)(2), or through production of triazoxide-amine (M02)(3). Assessment based on the decline from the peak observed indicate that M01 was moderate persistent in soil (DissT(50) (lab) = 32.4 - 56.7 days), and M02 could be considered high to very high persistent (decline M02 DissT(50 field) = 239 - 447 days; excluding UK field trial where no decline is observed). A kinetic assessment of laboratory data allowed the applicant to derive kinetic half-lives for M01, that are associated with a formation fraction of 1. Unextracted residues amounted up to a maximum of 29.8 % AR after 120 days (end of the study). Mineralization was practically negligible in the four soils tested.        Photolysis slightly enhances degradation of triazoxide in soil, but it is not expected to contribute significantly to its environmental dissipation.        Field studies are available, with some of them including measurements of the soil metabolites. Kinetic analysis of the field data presented by the applicant was discussed by the meeting of experts. The kinetic analysis was not fully accepted, and the need of considering formation fractions of 1 for further modelling based on this analysis was agreed. Analysis of the data based on the decline of M02 has been performed by the RMS, and the resulting half-lives (decline M02 DissT(50) (field) = 239 - 447 days; excluding UK field trial where no decline is observed) may be used in conjunction with the maximum observed of 18.7 % for exposure risk assessment. PECs soil presented in the DAR were calculated by the RMS for triazoxide and its soil major metabolites following standard procedures. Updated PECs soil with parameters agreed by the meeting of experts are reported in addendum 2 and do not result in a change of the risk assessment already performed.        According to the available studies, triazoxide may be considered as low to medium mobile in soil (K-foc = 245 - 1743 mL/g), desoxy-triazoxide (M01) may be considered slightly mobile (K-foc = 2053 4148 mL/g), and triazoxide-amine (M02) may be considered low to medium mobile (K-foc = 385.6 - 1709.0 mL/g). The RMS noted the narrow range of pH and the ionisable character of the metabolite triazoxide-amine (M02). Whereas a large margin of safety is considered to exist for the representative use proposed, further data could be needed if other uses at significant higher application rates are applied for in the future.        Triazoxide was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, practically stable at pH 7, and readily hydrolysed at pH 9 (DT50 = 6.6 days). The main hydrolysis metabolite was triazoxide-oxone (M04)(4). Triazoxide is rapidly photolysed in water (DT50 = 24.4 hours equivalent to 3.5 natural solar days at 33 degrees N). An additional study indicates that photolysis half-life of triazoxide in water is expected to range from 1.7 to 9.7 days depending on the season and the latitude (30 - 50 degrees N).        No ready biodegradability study is available, and therefore triazoxide is considered not readily biodegradable.        In aquatic water / sediment systems, triazoxide dissipated rapidly from water to sediment phase, and broke down to form the metabolites M01 and triazoxide-desoxyamino (M05)(5). Unextractable residues in the sediment amounted up to 55.7 % AR in the sediment after 91 days). Mineralization was negligible in both systems. The limited sampling regime of these experiments prevents the calculation of reliable kinetic parameters. However, a simple non-linear kinetic analysis was presented by the applicant to derive dissipation and degradation rates of triazoxide and desoxy-triazoxide in the water sediment systems. This kinetic analysis was only partially validated by the RMS (only whole system results for the Lienden system were confirmed). For the IJzendoorn system, no reliable whole system half-lives for the parent compound and M01 were obtained due to poor fit. Worst-case whole system half-lives of 4.3 days and 323 days were estimated for triazoxide and triazoxide-desoxy, respectively, based on results of Lienden system.        Input parameters to be used for FOCUS PECSW were discussed and agreed in the meeting of experts. After the meeting, the RMS has presented an addendum with new FOCUS SW (Step 1 and Step 2) for metabolite M01 and M02 following the approach agreed by the meeting. However, the new PECs calculated do not alter the outcome of the risk assessment already presented by the RMS in the DAR. Three different approaches based on FOCUS GW to calculate PEC GW were presented in the DAR. The meeting of experts agreed on the approach presented under B.8.6.d for the parent compound, but disagreed with the formation fractions assumed for metabolites M01 and M02, for which a formation fraction of 1 had to be used. After the meeting the RMS presented a new groundwater assessment based on FOCUS PEARL v.3.3.3, and the input parameters agreed by the meeting of experts. Neither the parent compound, nor its major soil metabolites (M01 and M02) exceeded the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L when the EU representative use (cereals seed treatment, 6 g a.s./ha) is simulated. However, due to the low ADI determined for this substance, 10% of the ADI would be reached for adults, toddlers and bottle fed infants, if residue levels of 0.05 mu g/L, 0.017 mu g/L and 0.011 mu g/L, respectively, of each component (triazoxide, M01 and M02) were present in the water. These levels were not exceeded in any of the scenarios simulated for the representative use in cereal seeds. Nevertheless, reliability and predictive capacity of FOCUS GW models is expected to be lower in this low range of concentrations. Triazoxide is not expected to significantly volatilize or to be subject to long range transport in air.        The first-tier short-term TER values for granivorous birds were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating a low risk. The margin of safety (TER=23.5) was considered to cover the uncertainty related to the derivation of a short-term toxicity endpoint, due to food avoidance (endpoint based on consumption in group where there was 30% mortality). Further refinements were required to address the acute and long-term risk to birds. Based on Yellowhammer as focal species, the acute TER value was calculated to be 9.1. Yellowhammer would have to consume 159 (including a 10-fold uncertainty factor) seeds on an acute time scale to breach the Annex VI trigger. This number of seeds would cover approximately 3.45 m(2) of a field, and the number of seeds would cover 90% of the daily food requirement of a Yellowhammer. Furthermore, worst case field studies indicated that Yellowhammer could consume 1/3 of the critical number of seeds in one feeding event. Given these facts, in addition to the indication of food avoidance behaviour detected in the short-term dietary study, it was concluded that the risk to granivorous birds from consumption of treated seeds could be considered to be low on an acute time scale. The conclusion was supported by an additional assessment for a fast feeding granivorous bird, like the woodpigeon. In order to reach the LD50, woodpigeons would have to consume 2940 seeds (includes a 10-fold uncertainty factor). A long-term risk assessment on reproductive birds was considered relevant for the spring use of triazoxide as seed treatment (the autumn use may also be reproductively relevant for birds in some southern Member States). A refined long-term TER of 2.23 was calculated based on residue decline data for triazoxide in barley seed on soil surface. Further refinements were needed to address the long-term risk to granivorous birds from spring use.        The tier 1 acute risk assessment for granivorous mammals was found to be low. Further refinements were required to identify a low long-term risk to granivorous mammals. Refinements were based on wood mouse as focal species and on use of measured residue data (see birds above), resulting in a TER value of 0.64. Further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to granivorous mammals. Risk assessment of secondary poisoning and consumption of contaminated drinking water was considered not relevant.        Triazoxide is proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute risk to aquatic organisms was assessed to be low. Further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to fish. The risk to sediment-dwellers from the metabolite M01, M02 and M05 was assessed as low.        The acute risk to earthworms was considered to be low. The long-term risk to earthworms needs further refinements to fully address the potential toxicity of residues in the soil matrix. As for other soil non-target macro-organisms, the risk to springtails was low for all potential soil residues, but it still remains to address the potential risk to soil litter degrading processes from triazoxide and the soil metabolites M01 and M02.        The risk to bees and non-target arthropods was assessed to be low, as was the risk to soil non-target micro-organisms, biological methods of sewage treatment and non-target plants.

rayyan-1227193470,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triazoxide European Food Safety Authority,2011,3,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,9,3,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"EFSA, Parma, Italy","Triazoxide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triazoxide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 25 June 2007. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR to the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG, and on 5 November 2007 to the Member States for consultation. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 30 September 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 193).        Following the Commission Decision of 30 November 2009 (2009/860/ EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of triazoxide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Bayer CropScience AG made a resubmission application for the inclusion of triazoxide in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/216/08 - rev. 0) as follows:        the information available was insufficient to satisfy the requirements set out in Annex II and Annex III of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to:        the available metabolism and residue data were not considered appropriate to conduct a robust consumer risk assessment due to the uncertainties identified with regard to the nature of residues in plant commodities and the possible transfer of residues in animal products        the long-term risk for granivorous bird        the long-term risk for granivorous mammals        the long-term risk to fish        the long-term risk to earthworms        and concerns were identified with regard to:        the consumer exposure        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the United Kingdom, being the designated RMS in the resubmission procedure, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 10 June 2010.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 16 June 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 30 July 2010.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focussed peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on triazoxide.        The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide as proposed by the applicant, which comprise seed treatment in barley against several agriculturally important diseases. The conclusions of the resubmission were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report.        Data gaps were identified in the section on identity and analytical methods. The specification for the technical material should currently be regarded as provisional.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Raxil S FS 040', a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS), containing 20 g/L triazoxide and 20 g/L tebuconazole.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant origin, soil and water, however for air a method validated to a LOQ of 0.3 mu g a.s./m(3) was identified as a data gap.        With regard to its toxicological properties, triazoxide was rapidly and extensively absorbed, but only partly bioavailable (50 %) to the target organ (blood system) due to its biokinetic properties. After single exposure it was shown to be toxic after oral or inhalative administration, but was not irritant or skin sensitizer. Consequently, the proposed classification for acute toxicity was T, R23/25 'Toxic by inhalation and if swallowed'.        After repeated oral or inhalative administration, the critical effect was the induction of haemolytic anaemia, with secondary effects in the spleen, liver, kidneys and bone marrow. The possible classification with Xn; R48/22 or T; R48/25 ('Harmful or Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed') could not be agreed by the experts, but the classification T, R48/23 'Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure through inhalation' was proposed. Triazoxide did not show genotoxic or carcinogenic properties in the available studies.        No specific adverse effects on fertility were observed in the multi-generation rat study, but the classification R64 'May cause harm to breastfed babies' was proposed based on reduced pup survival during lactation that could be expected to result from the presence of triazoxide in milk. No developmental toxicity or teratogenic activity was observed in rats or rabbits.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 2-year rat study and using a safety factor of 100, increased by an additional safety factor of 3. This was justified by the use of a lowest observed adverse effect level, the steep dose-response in the study and the absence of mechanistic information. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 90-day rat study, using a safety factor of 100 and a correction for bioavailability (50 %). The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.015 mg/kg bw, based on the 4-week rat study and applying a safety factor of 100.        The dermal absorption values to be used in the risk assessment are 2.4 % for the concentrate and 2 % for the contaminated grain dust. The operator exposure estimates during the seed treatment are above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but realistic field studies show an exposure level up to 21 % of the AOEL with the use of coverall and gloves. Similarly, the exposure estimates for the worker loading and sowing treated seed are above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but below the AOEL considering a field study (26 %), with the use of long-sleeved shirt and long trousers. Bystander exposure is not expected to exceed the exposure of workers involved in loading/sowing treated seed (i.e. 26 % of the AOEL).        Based on the new metabolism study conducted on barley with seeds treated at dose rates of 3 and 30 g a.s./100 kg seeds (N and 10N studies when compared to the critical GAP), the residue was defined as triazoxide alone for monitoring and as sum of triazoxide, desoxy-triazoxide (M01) and triazoxideamino (M02) for risk assessment. A conversion factor of 6 was proposed for risk assessment derived from the metabolism study, taking into account the respective percentage at which each compound was detected in straw.        A new residue data set was submitted where samples were analysed using an analytical method achieving a LOQ of 0.001 mg/kg, and the MRL for barley grain was proposed at the LOQ value. Such an unusually low value was proposed, given the low ADI agreed for the parent compound. The residue data are supported by the storage stability study showing triazoxide residues to be stable up to 2 years when stored frozen at -18 degrees C. Processing studies were not submitted and are not required. The available data are sufficient to conclude that significant residues are not expected to be present in rotational crops.        Estimated intakes by animals were calculated to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM. A goat metabolism study was however provided in order to confirm that transfer of residues in animal matrices is not expected at levels that could be of concern for the consumers. Since the total radioactive residues (TRRs) in goat matrices were shown to be below 0.0005 mg/kg when expressed on a 1N rate basis, the setting of a residue definition and proposing MRLs for animal matrices were considered not necessary.        No chronic or acute risks were identified for the consumers, with the TMDI being less that 4 % of the ADI and the IESTI less that 0.1 % of the ARfD when calculations are performed using the EFSA PRIMo model, the proposed MRL of 0.001 mg/kg for barley, and the conversion factor of 6.        Triazoxide may be considered to be highly to very highly persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DT50 (lab) ((biphasic kinetic, overall)) = 208 - 278 days). The degradation of triazoxide proceeds either through reduction to M01, or through production of M02. The assessment based on the decline from the peak observed indicated that metabolite M01 was moderately persistent in soil (DissT(50) (lab) = 32.4 - 56.7 days), and metabolite M02 could be considered highly persistent (decline M02 DissT(50 field) = 239 - 313 days; excluding the UK field trial where no decline is observed).        Unextracted residues amounted to a maximum of 29.8 % AR after 120 days (end of the study). Mineralization was practically negligible in the four soils tested.        Photolysis slightly enhances degradation of triazoxide in soil, but it is not expected to contribute significantly to its environmental dissipation.        According to the available studies, triazoxide may be considered as low to medium mobile in soil (K-foc = 245 - 1743 mL / g), metabolite M01 may be considered slightly mobile (K-foc = 2053 - 4148 mL / g), and metabolite M02 may be considered low to medium mobile (K-foc = 385.6 - 1709.0 mL / g). The narrow range of pH and the ionisable character of the metabolite M02 were noted. Whereas a large margin of safety is considered to exist for the representative use, further data could be needed if other uses at significantly higher application rates are applied for in the future.        Triazoxide was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, practically stable at pH 7, and readily hydrolysed at pH 9 (DT50 = 6.6 days). The main hydrolysis metabolite was M04. Triazoxide is rapidly photolysed in water (DT50 = 24.4 hours equivalent to 3.5 natural solar days at 33 degrees N). An additional study indicated that the photolysis half-life of triazoxide in water is expected to range from 1.7 to 9.7 days, depending on the season and the latitude (30 - 50 degrees N).        No ready biodegradability study is available and therefore triazoxide is considered not readily biodegradable.        In aquatic water / sediment systems, triazoxide dissipated rapidly from water to sediment phase, and broke down to form the metabolites M01 and M05. Unextractable residues in the sediment amounted up to 55.7 % AR in the sediment after 91 days). Mineralization was negligible in both systems. The limited sampling regime of these experiments prevents the calculation of reliable kinetic parameters. However, a simple non-linear kinetic analysis was presented by the applicant to derive dissipation and degradation rates of triazoxide and metabolite M01 in the water sediment systems. This kinetic analysis was only partially validated (only whole system results for the Lienden system were confirmed). For the IJzendoorn system, no reliable whole system half-lives for the parent compound and metabolite M01 were obtained due to poor fit. Worst-case whole system half-lives of 4.3 days and 323 days were estimated for triazoxide and metabolite M01, respectively, based on results of the Lienden system.        The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments (Predicted environmental concentrations (PEC)) were carried out for triazoxide as well as the metabolites M01, M02 and M05 using the FOCUS step 1, step 2 and step 3 approach. For the metabolites M01 and M05 the available step 1 and step 2 values are relied on for the risk assessment. Detailed information about model parameterisation is provided in the list of end points in Appendix A.        The necessary groundwater exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using FOCUS scenarios and the models PEARL 3.3.3 and PELMO 3.3.2 for the active substance triazoxide and the metabolites M01 and M02. To assess the risk associated with preferential transport through structured soils the Chateaudun scenarios were also simulated using the MACRO model. Detailed information about model parameterisation is provided in the list of end points in Appendix A. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses for these compounds above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations represented by all relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        Triazoxide is not expected to significantly volatilize or to be subject to long-range transport in air.        The first-tier short-term TER values for granivorous birds were above the Annex VI trigger values, indicating a low risk. The margin of safety (TER=23.5) was considered to cover the uncertainty related to the derivation of a short-term toxicity end point, due to food avoidance (end point based on consumption in group where there was 30 % mortality). Further refinements were required to address the acute and long-term risk to birds. Based on yellowhammer as focal species, the acute TER value was calculated to be 9.1. Yellowhammer would have to consume 159 (including a 10-fold uncertainty factor) seeds on an acute time scale to breach the Annex VI trigger. This number of seeds would cover approximately 3.45 m(2) of a field, and the number of seeds would cover 90 % of the daily food requirement of a yellowhammer. Furthermore, worst-case field studies indicated that yellowhammer could consume 1/3 of the critical number of seeds in one feeding event. Given these facts, in addition to the indication of food avoidance behaviour detected in the short-term dietary study, it was concluded that the risk to granivorous birds from consumption of treated seeds could be considered to be low on an acute timescale. The conclusion was supported by an additional assessment for a fast-feeding granivorous bird like the woodpigeon. A long-term risk assessment on reproductive birds was considered relevant for the spring use of triazoxide as a seed treatment. A refined long-term TER of 2.23 was calculated based on residue decline data for triazoxide in barley seed on soil surface. Further refinements were needed to address the long-term risk to granivorous birds from the spring use. Following the initial risk assessment, further data and refinements were considered during the resubmission. Four species were identified as focal species (skylark, chaffinch, woodpigeon and yellowhammer) in the Additional Report. Further information was provided supporting the proportion of the food obtained in the treated area (PT) for each focal species as well as the proportion of food types obtained from the treated crop (PD). The refined TER values were above the Annex VI trigger values for all representative focal species, therefore the long-term risk to granivorous birds for both the use in autumn and spring sown barley was assessed as low.        The tier 1 acute risk assessment for granivorous mammals was found to be low. Further refinements were required with regard to the long-term risk assessment for granivorous mammals. The refinements in the original review were based on wood mouse as focal species and on use of measured residue data, however they were considered as not satisfactory and further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to granivorous mammals. During the resubmission application further data were provided to refine the risk assessment. However, the higher tier risk assessment gave a TERlt below the Annex VI trigger value, indicating a potential high long-term risk. Therefore, the long-term risk assessment to granivorous mammals needs further refinements and a data gap remains. The issue has been indicated as a critical area of concern.        Risk assessment of secondary poisoning and consumption of contaminated water was considered not relevant.        Triazoxide is proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute and chronic risk to aquatic organisms was considered to be low. Furthermore, the risk to sediment-dwelling organisms from the metabolites M01, M02 and M05 was considered as low.        The acute risk to earthworms was considered to be low. The long-term risk from triazoxide and the soil metabolites M01 and M02 to earthworms was considered as low. Concerning other soil non-target macro-organisms, the risk to springtails was considered low for all potential soil residues. In addition, the potential risk from triazoxide and its metabolites to soil litter degradation processes was assessed as low.        The risk to bees and non-target arthropods was assessed to be low, as was the risk to soil non-target micro-organisms, biological methods of sewage treatment, and non-target plants.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  19,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2018     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Triazoxide;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;fungicide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triazoxide european food safety authority

Secondly, LC exposure resulted in excessively damaged mitochondrial and mtROS, diminished mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, which could be improved by MA. Thirdly, MA upregulated the levels of mitophagy-related regulatory factors (Beclin1, LC3, ATG5, Tom20 and Lamp2) induced by LC. Importantly, MA decreased the levels of pyroptosis-related genes treated with LC, including NLRP3, Cas-4, GSDMD and active Cas-1. Further study indicated that LC treatment caused excessive miRNA-194-5p and reduced levels of FoxO1, PINK1 and Parkin, which was inhibited by MA treatment. Overall, we concluded that MA could enhance damaged mitochondrial elimination by promoting the miRNA-194-5p-FoxO1-PINK1/Parkinmitophagy in lymphocytes, which reduced mtROS accumulation and alleviated pyroptosis.

Integrated analysis of biochemical, histopathological and genetic parameters in fish exposed to Malathion insecticide provide information on the toxicity mechanisms of this pesticide, which is classified as a probable carcinogen for humans. The present study assessed the biological responses of Colossoma macropomum after exposure to Malathion. We started determining the lethal concentration, which is the concentration capable of killing 50% of the subjects in an acute toxicity test (LC50-96 h), which was 15.77 +/- 3.30 mgL(-1). The fish were, then, exposed to Malathion during 96 h at a sublethal concentration, 7.30 mgL(-1). Overall, we observed an increased activity of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes, which reduced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species after 96 h exposure, as well as kept constant the mitochondrial respiration, Acetylcholinesterase activity and DNA damage. However, fish exposed to insecticide presented severe gill histopathological damage and increased expression of proto-oncogene ras. Taken together, the results suggest that, after four days of exposure to the Malathion, C. macropomum efficiently activates its defense mechanisms, suggesting that the basal response mechanisms are responsive. On the other hand, histopathologic damages evidenced the adverse effects of Malathion on fish, since it promoted gill necrosis and increased the expression of ras oncogene that is directly related to tumorigenesis events.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111340     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Insecticide;Antioxidant;Oxidative damage;Carcinogenesis;Malathion;CARPIO PROTECTIVE ROLE;DNA-DAMAGE;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY;ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES;HERMAPHRODITIC FISH;RAS ONCOGENE;R-RAS;EXPRESSION;GENE;GILLS,NA,NA,severe damages caused by malathion exposure in <i>colossoma macropomum<i>

After 28 d of CYP exposure, the levels of Immunoglobulin M (IgM), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) after treatment with 1.5 mu g/L CYP. Moreover, an induction of inflammatory cytokine transcripts (tnfa, il-6, il-8, and il-12) was observed (p < 0.05) after treatment with 1.5 mu g/L CYP.

This work aimed to evaluate acute and chronic toxic effects of benzoylurea pesticide (lufenuron) on biological parameters of Colossoma macropomum (Tambaqui). In the acute test, juveniles of Tambaqui were divided into control group and five experimental groups with exposure from 0.1 to 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron for 96 h. Animals were also submitted to chronic toxicity test for four months in concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/L of lufenuron, the concentration used in the treatment of ectoparasites in fish and 50% of LC50 96 h, respectively. The presence of hemorrhages was observed in eyes, fins and operculum of fish exposed to 0.7 and 0.9 mg/L of lufenuron. Histological analysis showed changes in the morphology of fish gills submitted to acute toxicity test, as lamellar aneurysm and blood congestion inside lamellae. Lufenuron promoted damage in fish retina as in ability to respond to stimuli in photo-receptors and in ON-bipolar cells in acute test. In chronic test, blood glucose analysis and morphometric parameters showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). In general, Tambaqui exhibited behaviors associated with stress when exposed to lufenuron. Thus, lufenuron showed several toxic effects in relation to biological parameters in Tambaqui.

rayyan-1227193483,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Tetraconazole,2008,10,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,10,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Tetraconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tetraconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 5 February 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant ISAGRO S.p.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March- April 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June - July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Eminent 40 ME"", a micro-emulsion (ME) containing 40 g/L tetraconazole.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor tetraconazole residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin, soil and water; however additional ILV and confirmatory methods are required. There is no acceptable monitoring method for air.        Mammalian toxicology of tetraconazole has been assessed in a series of tests. It is absorbed rapidly orally to an extent of about 80%. It is widely distributed in the body. It does not accumulate and is excreted rapidly and completely. It is extensively metabolised. Tetraconazole is of moderate acute toxicity by the oral and of low toxicity by the dermal and inhalation route. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant and has no skin sensitising properties. A classification as Xn; R22 ""Harmful; Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed. In several short-term dietary studies liver and kidneys were the target organs of toxicity (the lowest NOAEL of 2.95 mg/kg bw/d was found in dogs). Tetraconazole is not genotoxic. In a chronic rat study liver effects and at higher doses also effects on bones and incisors (fluorosis) and thyroid tumours were seen. In a carcinogenicity study with mice liver tumours were observed. Neither the thyroid tumours in rats nor the liver tumours in mice were considered relevant for human risk assessment. In a two-generation study dystocia and prolonged gestation periods were observed in dams and classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R62 ""Harmful; Possible risk of impaired fertility"" was proposed. In a developmental study with rats extra ribs, hydrourether and hydronephrosis occurred in the pups and classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R63 ""Harmful; Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was set at 0.004 mg/kg bw/d, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was fixed at 0.03 mg/kg bw/d and the ARfD was set at of 0.05 mg/kg bw. Using the worst case scenario of all suggested uses for preparation EMINENT 40 ME (tractor mounted/trailed boom sprayer; hydraulic nozzles on sugar beet and wheat) the calculated exposures were 305.13% and 48.17% and 51.26% and 39.56% with and without PPE (personal protective equipment) respectively of the AOEL in the UK POEM and in the German model. Estimated maximum exposure using worst case scenarios amount to 5.5% of the AOEL for bystanders and to 28% of the AOEL for re-entry workers.        The metabolism of tetraconazole in plants was investigated upon foliar application to wheat, sugar beet and grapes and in carrots, lettuce and wheat planted as succeeding crops. Based on the studies a residue definition including tetraconazole and the triazole derivative metabolites (triazole alanine, triazole acetic acid) has been provisionally established. A final plant residue definition for risk assessment is pending the clarification on the toxicological properties of metabolite triazole hydroxypropionic acid. This metabolite had not been identified in metabolism studies with other triazole pesticide compounds assessed in the peer review.        The nature of the residue is not altered by processing. From processing studies transfer factors to juice, wine and dry apple pomace could be derived.        A sufficient number of supervised residue trials are only available to cover the representative uses in wheat and sugar beets in all Europe and hence MRLs can be proposed for these crops. The representative uses in grapes and apples were initially not supported by residue trials matching the notified GAP criteria. Trials submitted during the peer review process could not be considered in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007.        Uptake of soil residues by rotational crops is not expected to lead to residues of tetraconazole per se above the LOQ. In contrast, a significant uptake of triazole derivative metabolites is expected, but the available field studies were not considered sufficient to address residues in following crops. Hence a data gap for a new field rotational crop study has been set.        Feed commodities may represent a significant source of exposure to tetraconazole residues for animals. Metabolism studies in lactating goats and laying hens are available, and based on the metabolic pattern in animal tissues a residue definition was proposed. However, due to data gaps the livestock dietary intake estimates cannot be finalised and thus appropriate MRLs for animal products can currently not be proposed.        The consumer risk assessment for the notified representative uses can currently not be finalised. Excluding the uses on apples and grapes and only considering residues of tetraconazole alone, the RMS has submitted a provisional and none-peer reviewed chronic and acute consumer risk assessment indicating consumer exposure being below the toxicological reference values for tetraconazole. A robust conclusion on the consumer risk will only be possible when the identified data gaps are addressed and sufficient data and information regarding the assessment of triazole derivative metabolites in primary crops, rotational crops, and products of animal origin is available.        Degradation of tetraconazole in soil under dark aerobic laboratory conditions was negligible. Photolysis of tetraconazole in soil was negligible.        Degradation of tetraconazole was also investigated in three soils under aerobic outdoor conditions, exposed to sunlight. The applicant attributed degradation to a combined effect of photochemical and microbial degradation. RMS considered the reliability of the study doubtful since no clear mechanism may explain degradation. The experts considered that further experiments investigating effect of higher temperatures in dark under controlled moisture conditions and indirect aqueous photochemical studies could help to understand the mechanism of degradation prevailing in the environment.        Therefore, a data gap was identified for these additional studies.        Dissipation of tetraconazole under field conditions was investigated in five sites (4 in Germany and 1 Northern Italy). In the five soils dissipation followed biphasic behaviour. Tetraconazole was high to very high persistent during the second phase. The meeting of experts agreed that the field half lives cannot be used in FOCUS modelling with the current lack of understanding of the mechanism causing loss. For PEC soil the meeting of experts agreed that the longest second phase field DT50 of 1688 d should be used. Potential accumulation of tetraconazole may not be excluded since about 20 40 % AR remains as tetraconazole one year after application. Assuming yearly application and tillage, EFSA calculated a plateau background concentration over the 20 cm horizon after 36 years and peak concentration after last application. Tetraconazole is low mobile in acidic soils. Adsorption / desorption of potential metabolites M 14360-acid and TAA were investigated in different studies. Metabolite M 14360-acid may be considered high to very high mobile in soil and TAA very high mobile in soil. Potential metabolite M 14360-alcohol may be considered very high mobile in soil.        A two years lysimeter study with two soil monoliths was performed in Switzerland. Product containing labelled tetraconazole was applied the first year. No product was applied the second year. Residue leachate concentrations observed were 0.53 0.54 mu g / L and 0.27 mu g / L parent equivalents for the first and second year respectively. The two major fractions were M11 (47 % - 66 % of radioactivity in the leachate; corresponding to 0.11 - 0.18 1.1 mu g/L) and M10 (15 - 21 % of the radioactivity in the leachate; corresponding to 0.03 - 0.08 1.1 mu g/L). A data gap was identified for the characterization of tetraconazole lysimeter metabolites M10 and Mll and to address its potential for ground water contamination.        Tetraconazole is stable to hydrolysis and is not expected to be degraded by photolysis in water. Tetraconazole is not readily biodegradable.        A dissipation study of tetraconzole in two water/sediment systems under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C is available. Degradation only occurs in the sediment by formation of non extractable residue. Virtually no degradation product was observed. Mineralization was negligible over the duration of the study (100 d). Tetraconazole was very high persistent in both systems (DT50 whole system = 310 372 d). New PEC SW values calculated according FOCUS SW and FOCUS kinetics were presented in the Addendum 1 to the DAR. These PECSW are based on FOCUS SW Step 2 and were agreed by the meeting of experts. However, some MSs may require Step 3 calculations. With respect to PECSED a data gap to address the potential accumulation of tetraconazole in the sediment was identified.        FOCUS GW calculations presented for the parent compound in Addendum 2 were agreed by the meeting of experts. None of the uses and scenarios simulated resulted in 80th percentile annual average leachate concentration above the trigger of 0.1 mu g / L. For the metabolites the meeting of experts did not agree on the calculations presented. Lysimeter metabolite Mll exceed 0.1 mu g parent eq / L the year of application and the subsequent year. Lysimeter metabolite M10 reach concentrations slightly below the trigger (0.08 mu g parent eq / L) the year of application; since the substance has been applied only one season, it may not be excluded that this metabolite also exceeds the trigger of 0.1 mu g parent eq / L when tetraconazole is applied in successive seasons. On basis of the vapour pressure (1.8 10(-4) Pa) and the water solubility (196 mg /L) a Henry's Law constant of 3.6 . 10(-4) Pa m(3) mol(-1) was calculated. Half life in the troposphere due to photochemical reaction with OH. radicals was calculated to be of 1.16 d.        The acute risk assessment to insectivorous birds in orchards and sugar beets indicated a low risk, where as the acute risk to insectivorous birds in cereals and herbivorous birds in sugar beets was assessed to be high and calls for further refinements. The short-term risk to birds from all intended uses was considered to be low, whereas the long-term risk to birds from all intended uses was found to be high. A refined long-term risk assessment for birds for all intended uses was required, taking into account the recommendations from the expert meeting. Only the long-term risk assessment to mammals was provided in the DAR, as the acute toxicity endpoint for mammals was found not to be valid by RMS. However, the mammalian toxicity experts agreed that the acute study was valid, and EFSA subsequently calculated acute TER values for mammals The risk was found to be low for all uses. The long-term risk assessment to mammals indicated a low risk to insectivorous mammals from use in cereals and a high risk to herbivorous mammals from uses in sugar beets, grapes and apples.        Refinements were required to address the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals for uses in sugar beets, grapes and apples. The risk assessment for secondary poisoning indicated a low risk to fish eating birds and mammals and earthworm-eating mammals. The risk to earthworm-eating birds was found to be high and further refinements were required. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was considered to be low for birds and mammals. A data gap to address the risk for potential endocrine effects on birds was identified.        Tetraconazole is very toxic to aquatic organisms. However, acute and chronic TER values were far above the Annex VI trigger for all organisms included in the aquatic risk assessment, based on FOCUSsw Step 2 South European calculation for the worst case sugar beet application. A data gap was identified for the applicant to address the potential risk of endocrine disrupting effects in fish.        Standard glass plate tests were provided for Aphidius rhopalosiphi, Typhlodromus pyri, Crysoperla carnea and Poecilus cupreus. No effects were found in the two latter species. The study with T pyri was considered insufficient to address the risk due to high escape rates during the study. Even though in-field and off-field HQ indicated at low risk to A. rhopalosiphi, reproductive effects above 50% were derived in extended laboratory study with A. rhopalosiphi at exposure rates comparable to infield uses. Aged residue studies, however, indicated that the effects on mortality and reproduction never exceeded 50% even at day 0 of ageing. Field studies covering all intended uses indicated a low risk to T pyri. The expert meeting agreed to require an extended lab study (with fresh residues) with T pyri to conduct an off-field risk assessment in order to see if the off-field risk to mites/spiders will be addressed also for species with longer reproductive cycles than T pyri (i.e. species with lower capacity to re-colonise the in-field area).        The formulation Eminent 125 EW had no significant effect on organic matter decomposition over a six months period in a litter bag test with worst a case application rate        The risk from tetraconazole to bees, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.        As uncertainties remains for potential soil metabolites, no final conclusion can be drawn for the risk from metabolites to aquatic organisms, earthworms, soil non-target micro- and macro organisms.

The unwitting casualties of this battle are the millions of birds, fish, and other wildlife that have been killed, and the hundreds of protected species put at risk of extinction. This battle has intensified in recent years, as environmental organizations have sued the United States Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") for its continued failure to comply with the Endangered Species Act (""ESA""). In response, EPA has invoked numerous legal and regulatory strategies, becoming further entrenched in its position of non-compliance. EPA's reluctance to conform to the ESA is due in part to its institutional bias in favor of registering pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (""FIFRA""), and its generic bureaucratic inertia. A significant cause of the non-compliance, however, is the catch-22 in which EPA finds itself due to inherent conflicts between FIFRA and the ESA.        This Article begins by describing the extent of the harm to wildlife, including threatened and endangered species, caused by current pesticide usage and EPA's failure to comply with wildlife protection laws. After providing an overview of the major federal species protection statutes, this Article chronicles the historic tension between those statutes, discussing the resulting litigation, EPA's regulatory actions and inaction, and the legislative response. The picture that emerges is one of unresolved crisis and massive noncompliance with federal mandates. The Article then turns to examine the sources of tension between the statutes: their conflicting goals, standards, geographic and temporal focuses, and risk reduction methods. Based on this exposition of the fundamental tensions, the Article concludes by suggesting legislative reforms intended to eliminate or at least alleviate the conflict and to reconcile the goals of wildlife protection and availability of socially useful pesticides.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  31,,BIRD TREATY ACT;Pesticides,NA,NA,the killing fields reducing the casualties in the battle between us species protection law and us pesticide law

A sublethal fenthion concentration (0.45 mg/L) was applied for 24, 48, and 96 In together with injection with BSO or NAC; following treatment, recovery periods for 24, 48, and 96 h were allowed. Total glutathione (tGSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), lipid peroxidation, protein level, and GSH-related enzyme activities were analyzed by using spectrophotometric methods. Fenthion in applied concentration did not change GSH levels, but increased GSSG levels. BSO application in fenthion exposure caused a depletion in GSH, while increasing the GSSG levels. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx; EC 1.11.1.9) specific activity increased in fenthion-applied groups at 24-h treatment. gamma-Glutamylcysteinyl synthetase (gamma-GCS; EC 6.3.2.2) was not detected in the brain.

The 24 It LC50 of neem leaf extract for juveniles P lineatus was estimated as 4.8 g L-1; the fish were then exposed for 24 h to 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 g L-1 or only clean water (control). Plasma glucose levels were higher in fish exposed to 2.5 g L-1 and 5.0 g L-1 neem extract, relative to control, indicating a typical stress response. Neem extract did not interfere with the osmoregulating capacity of the fish, as their plasma sodium, chloride, total protein and osmolarity did not change. The presence of the biopesticide interfered with the antioxidant defense system of P. lineatus, as there was a decrease in liver catalase activity at all neem concentrations and the detoxifying enzyme glutathione-S-transferase was activated in fish exposed to 5.0 g L-1. Fish exposed to all neem extract concentrations exhibited damaged gill and kidney tissue.

rayyan-1227193488,"Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance 1,3-dichloropropene",2006,6,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,6,,ESFA,,English,,,"1,3-Dichloropropene is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on 1,3-dichloropropene in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 16 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 10 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force originally consisted of Dow AgroScience B. V. and BASF Agro B. V. BASF sold the business of 1,3-dichloropropene to Kanesho Soil Treatment BVBA on 17 December 2003 and therefore was replaced in the Task Force. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 8 November 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as nematicide as proposed by the applicants. The application to bare soil comprise either introduction of the formulated product into the drip irrigation system (""EF-1478"") or soil injection at 15-20 cm depth (""XRM-5048"") to control nematodes in soil where tomatoes or peppers will be grew. The application rates are up to 283 kg 1,3-dichloropropene per hectare (""EF-1478"") and up to 224 kg per hectare (""XRM-5048""), respectively. 1,3-dichloropropene can be used as nematicide, insecticide, fungicide and herbicide, depending on the dose rate used. In general, an application of 1,3-dichloropropene by soil injection and/or drip irrigation is followed by partial sterilisation of the soil. It should be noted that the applicants stated that only the use as nematicide will be supported in the EU review programme.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Telone EC Drip"" (""EF-1478""), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Greece, Italy and Spain and ""Telone Injected"" (""XRM-5048"") registered under different trade names in some Member States of the EU. The formulation ""Telone Injected"" (""XRM-5048"") is coded as "" any other liquid"" (AL).        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        The toxicological risk assessment (and reference values) is considered to be inconclusive due to uncertainties in relation to the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. 1,3-dichloropopene is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised in the rat. The acute oral and dermal toxicity is high and the inhalatory toxicity is moderate, proposed classification and risk phrases are T; R24/25 ""Toxic by dermal exposure and if swallowed"" and R20 "" Harmful by inhalation"". It is a skin irritant and sensitizer, proposed classification and risk phrases are R38 ""Irritant to skin"" and R43 ""May cause sensitization by skin contact"". According to medical data 1,3-dichloropopene should be classified as irritant to eyes too and to the respiratory system, proposed classification and risk phrases are R36/R37 "" Irritating to eyes and respiratory system"".        The weight of evidence indicates that 1,3-dichloropropene is an in vivo genotoxic agent for somatic cells, acting directly or after activation by cytochrome P450, and glutathione protects against the genotoxicity. The classification of Mutagenic Category 3, R68 is proposed.        1,3-dichloropropene induced benign tumours in the liver of rats and in both urinary bladder epithelium and lung of mice. In addition, one hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in rats. However, the mechanism of action for tumour formation has not been yet identified. Although, results indicate that 1,3-dichloropopene can be mutagenic, the relevance of these results to mammalian tumour formation is uncertain owing to the high concentrations or doses used. The issue was to be forwarded to the PPR panel. The classification as possible human carcinogenic Category 3, R40? is highlighted. No reproduction toxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. The metabolites 3chloroallyl alcohol and 3-chloroacrylic acid are both toxic.        Dependent on the identity on the polychlorinated imp, it might be necessary to require new toxicological studies.        According to medical data, 1,3-dichloropropene should be classified as irritating to eyes (R36) and to irritating to respiratory system (R37). Furthermore, it is proposed to classify as R65 "" Harmful, may cause lung damage if swallowed"" due observed the adverse effects,        The provisional Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) ADI is 0.0125 mg/kg bw/day, with the use of the safety factor of 200. The additional safety factor of 2 was added in order to have at least 1000 between the ADI and the dose level where tumours are evident. The provisional systemic Acceptable Operator Level (AOEL) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100.        As inhalation exposure is the main route of exposition and all data from operator exposure are expressed as atmospheric concentration (mg/m(3)), an additional inhalatory human AOEC was assigned which is 0.066 ppm, equivalent to 0.30 mg/m(3) however should be considered as provisional. The ARfD is 0.2 mg/kg bw, with the safety factor of 100 added.        The 1,3-dichloropropene is applied to bare soil and consisted of two scenarios. The estimations are based on field measurements. However, the estimated operator exposure should be considered only as indicative due to the uncertainties in relation to the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. For both uses drip irrigation and soil injection, PPE (gloves and coverall) and RPE (respiratory mask with filter for organic vapours) is needed in order not to exceed the AOEL (16% and 38%, respectively). The exposure for workers and bystanders should be negligible.        The degradation and metabolism of 1,3-D has been studied comparatively in fruit (tomatoes and citrus), root vegetables (sugar beets), and pulses and oilseeds (soybeans) following application of radio labelled material to the soil surrounding the tree or to the soil in which seeds were planted. Additional information from succeeding crop studies is given on leafy crops (lettuce) and cereals (wheat).        Even though a high amount of applied 1,3-D is expected to volatilise from soil, the results of the available studies indicate that 1,3-D is also absorbed into plants, translocated and degraded. Naturally occurring plant constituents contained the majority of radioactivity recovered in edible plant parts, indicating complete metabolism of 1,3-D. Consequently, no 1,3-D residues above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are expected to be present in primary or succeeding crops. This was confirmed by supervised residue trials data.        However, it is stressed that the available studies don't provide any information regarding the residue behaviour of the chlorinated impurities present in the technical material that are added to soil at a high level (up to ca 6 kg/ha) when applying 1,3-D at the intended rate. There is no information on possible persistency, uptake, accumulation or metabolic fate and residue level of those chlorinated impurities, whether of known or unknown type, and moreover data on their toxicological properties are not available. This lack of data gives rise to concern in respect of consumer safety, even though potential chronic and acute dietary exposure to residues of 1,3 D per se from tomatoes and peppers is well below (< 1%) the ADI and ARfD, respectively.        1,3-dichloropropene is a volatile liquid, so even though it is injected below the soil surface or applied via drip irrigation systems, the major route of dissipation from soil is volatilisation to the air. In aerobic laboratory soil studies it exhibited low to moderate persistence and formed the major (> 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid which exhibited very low to moderate persistence and the minor (< 10% AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited very low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 11-37% AR at 49-77 days. At these times unextracted soil residue accounted for 9-28% AR.        In laboratory soil batch adsorption studies 1,3-dichloropropene exhibited very high to high mobility. (EZ)-3-chloroaryl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid exhibited very high soil mobility.        In a laboratory study on a natural sediment water system (25 degrees C) with dosing under the water surface, volatilisation was again the major route of dissipation of 1,3-dichloropropene from the systems. 1,3dichloropropene exhibited low persistence and formed the minor (< 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation products (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid and (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 57% AR at 21 days. At this time unextracted sediment residues accounted for 14% AR. Acceptable surface aquatic system PEC are only available for the drip irrigation application in glasshouses. There is a data gap for acceptable concentration estimates from the outdoor uses, where the exposure from the drainage and runoff routes of entry need to be appropriately assessed. Member State experts' considered that potential deposition from the air to surface water should also be considered by the notifier when providing aquatic PEC from the outdoor uses notified.        FOCUS groundwater tier I' modelling indicates that at the spatial scale usually assessed of the treated field, there is a very high potential for the contamination of groundwater by parent (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid. The results from an extensive targeted EU groundwater monitoring program are available. However data requirements for further information regarding aspects of this monitoring have been identified. These identified deficiencies should be addressed before this monitoring work is used for regulatory decision making.        1,3-dichloropropene volatilises from soil even though it is applied below the soil surface. The flux losses from the soil have been measured in field studies in the USA. There is a data gap identified to provide information that these measured flux losses under American geoclimatic conditions are also pertinent to EU geoclimatic conditions. Member State experts' and the EFSA considered sufficient information has been provided to conclude that the 1,3-dichloropropene that will reach the upper atmosphere will degrade relatively rapidly and that this compound and its potential atmospheric degradation products are unlikely to have an adverse effect on the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, as they will be relatively short lived in this environmental compartment.        Bridging studies are needed if new impurities are identified in the new five batch analysis which are not covered by the batches tested in the section on ecotoxicology. As the relevance of the impurity 1,2-dichloropropane was not discussed during the peer review process, the EFSA proposes the applicant to addresses the ecotoxicological relevance of this impurity. The levels of 1,2dichloropropane in the ecotoxicological studies must be confirmed if considered relevant.        The indoor use in glasshouse is defined as a permanent structure to which entry of birds and mammals is limited and hence the risk to birds and mammals for the indoor uses is regarded to be low. A high acute risk to earthworm eating and insectivorous birds and mammals and a long term risk to earthworm eating and insectivorous mammals is identified for the outdoor uses. Data to address these risks is still awaited. No long term toxicity study with birds is available. A residue study on plants is awaited to assess the risk to herbivorous birds and mammals. The risk to birds and mammals for the outdoor uses can only be concluded once the outstanding data requirements become available. The EPCO expert's meeting set a data requirement for the applicant to submit the endpoints for algae based on biomass. Once these become available the risk assessment needs to be revised based on the lowest endpoint. Algae and Lemna gibba are more sensitive to the metabolites (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid than to the parent compound. Long term studies with the metabolite (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid on fish and Daphnia magna are requested as this metabolite has been identified and requires further consideration based on potential levels in ground and surface water. The acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms from the indoor use via drip irrigation can be regarded as low without the need for risk mitigation measures. The risk to aquatic organisms from the direct soil injection method of application indoors and outdoors, can only be concluded once the PEC in surface water become available (see 4.2.1 and 5.2). Given the high application rate (up to 224 kg a. s./ha) and aquatic endpoints below 1 mg a. s./L risk mitigation measures might become necessary. The risk for bioconcentration in fish for 1,3-dichloropropene and metabolites (EZ)-3chloroallyl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid is considered to be low.        An inhalation study with bees and a calculation of relevant PEC values to conduct the risk assessment for the inhalation toxicity to bees is requested as the active substance can be found in the air even at distances of 800 m from the treated field.        Observed effects 1 day after treatment (DAT) were below 30% for H. aculeifer, P. cupreus, A. bilineata and Pardosa spp. 1 DAT 78% effect on mortality was observed for F. candida. No adverse effects of Telone II treated soil were observed when F. candida was introduced 22 days after treatment of the soil. Given the observed effects on Folsomia candida the rapporteur Member State asked the applicant to further address the risk to non-target arthropods for the outdoor uses.        A high acute risk to earthworms was observed. The announced new field study in UK potato fields is still awaited to address several comments which were raised on the existing earthworm field study. The long term risk to earthworm from exposure to 7 day old treated soil can be regarded as low. The acute and long term risk to earthworms exposed to freshly treated soil can only be concluded once the outstanding field data become available. The rapporteur Member State considers that this data gap only applies to the outdoor uses.        Effects from 40.23% to 96.9% on soil microbial respiration and nitrogen transformation were observed on day 90 at the end of the study while the test soils were incubated with fresh untreated soil on day 49. A field study to address this concern was discussed at the EPCO experts' meeting and the meeting identified the need for a new field study to address this risk which should also cover the concern for the effects from the soil metabolites. The rapporteur Member State considers that this data gap only applies to the outdoor uses.        Regarding the indoor uses, the EFSA would like to point out that earthworms, soil micro-organisms, F. candida and other soil non-target arthropods are likely to come into contact with 1,3dichloropropene as the product is applied to full soil. This could affect the function of the soil indoors.        A potential risk to non-target plants was identified. The EPCO Expert's meeting decided that the risk should be more quantified and TER values at a few metres from the field should be calculated. The risk to non-target plants can only be concluded once this risk assessment becomes available. It cannot be excluded that 1,3-D might be harmful if the waste water goes to sewage treatment plants.

Each of these studies is a longitudinal prospective study, in which women were recruited during pregnancy and the children are being followed for at least several years after birth. The study from which the largest body of data has been published to date is being performed in the Netherlands, in which exposure to PCBs and related compounds is through the general food supply. Mother-infant pairs were recruited in two cities. Half of the infants were bottle-fed and half breast-fed in each city. Four PCB congeners (118, 138, 153, 180) were assessed in maternal and cord plasma, breast milk, and plasma of the child at 3.5 years. TEQ in breast milk was calculated based on PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs. Various measures of in utero exposure were associated with suboptimal neurological status during infancy, whereas maternal plasma PCB concentration was associated with cognitive deficits (Kaufman scores) at 3.5 years of age. The child's concurrent plasma PCB levels and maternal PCB plasma levels independently predicted performance on various aspects of a vigilance task, and maternal and cord plasma levels predicted impairment of complex play behavior. Poor scores on behavioral ratings were associated with concurrent blood PCB concentrations in the child. A study in Oswego in Lake Ontario fish eaters includes mothers who never ate Great Lakes fish and mothers who consumed greater than 40 PCB-equivalent pounds of Lake Ontario fish over their lifetime. Sixty-eight PCB congeners were measured in cord blood. Suboptimal neurological status during infancy was associated with maternal fish consumption and highly chlorinated cord PCB levels, whereas deficits in short-term memory at 6 months and 1 year of age were associated with total chlorinated cord PCB levels. In a study in Germany of 171 mother-infant pairs, PCB congeners 138, 153, and 180 were measured in cord plasma and milk 2 weeks after birth; both measures are considered markers of in utero exposure. Suboptimal neurological status during infancy, decrements in Bayley scores at 30 months and Kaufman scores at 42 months were associated with PCBs in milk but not cord plasma. These studies, combined with data from previous studies, reveal a consistent relationship between PCB exposure and suboptimal neurological status during infancy, and cognitive deficits associated with in utero exposure. Data from the Dutch study revealed effects on other behavioral domains associated with concurrent (postnatal) exposure. Although it is not possible to identify specific congeners or groups of congeners that may be responsible for the neurotoxic effects observed in these studies, the TEQ approach was not particularly predictive for neurotoxic outcomes.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  44,10.1080/20018091094853     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),PCBs;dioxins;behavioral deficits;developmental effects;in utero exposure;cognitive deficits;longitudinal prospective studies;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS PCBS;PRENATAL EXPOSURE;DICHLORODIPHENYL DICHLOROETHENE;MATERNAL CONSUMPTION;RECOGNITION MEMORY;HUMAN-MILK;CHILDREN;IMPAIRMENT;CONGENERS;INFANTS,NA,NA,relationship between measures of exposure to pcbsdioxins and behavioral effects in recent developmental studies

Our group has previously demonstrated that eSBU, purified from seeds, has antifungal properties against phytopathogenic fungi, entomotoxicity against Dysdercus peruvianus, the ability to induce blood platelet aggregation, and these properties are independent of its enzymatic activity. Here we describe the biological properties of apo-uSBU fused to glutathione Stransferase (GST) produced in Escherichia cod. Removal of GST affected apo-uSBU stability. We performed a Response Surface Methodology to optimize GST-uSBU production to 5 mg per liter and then bioassays were carried out. The recombinant protein exhibited inhibitory effects on filamentous fungi and affected fungal secondary metabolism. Candida albicans and C tropicalis were also susceptible to GST-uSBU and formed pseudo-hyphae. The fusion protein was toxic against Rhodnius prolixus, with the toxicity being accompanied by in vivo and in vitro hemocyte aggregation. Rabbit platelet also aggregated in the presence of GST-uSBU. Thus, uSBU displayed similar biological properties as previously described for eSBU even when fused to GST, reinforcing the proposed role of ureases in plant defense. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Direct risks of transgenics include escape and introgression of transgenes into wild populations; weedy invasion by transgenic organisms; toxicity orpathogenicity of engineered organisms and their products; and human error in the field testing and tracking of transgenic organisms. Indirect risks include environmental effects of increased herbicide use; the danger that engineered organisms may aid the development of bioweapons; the likelihood that gene patenting will lead to the privatization of natural resources; and the diversion of support from less glamorous forms of conservation. Formal risk assessments are commonly used to evaluate transgenic procedures, but our incomplete understanding of both ecosystem processes and the action of transgenes renders most of these assessments scientifically and socially unjustified. Nevertheless, a few, low-risk applications of transgenics may be possible: for example, ""super-sterile"" ornamental cultivars. Vertebrate cloning poses little risk to the environment, but it can consume scarce conservation resources, and its chances of success in preserving species seem poor To date, the conservation benefits of transgenics and vertebrate cloning remain entirely theoretical, but many of the risks are known and documented.

Widespread marine pollution such as oil spills, persistent organic pollutants, metals, and ocean plastic pollution has been linked to concerning changes in the ecophysiology and health of Galapagos species. Simultaneously, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are reshaping the composition and structure of endemic and native Galapagos pelagic communities. In this novel review, we discuss the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and their associated ecotoxicological implications for Galapagos species in the face of climate change stressors. We emphasize the importance of considering fishing pressure and marine pollution, in combination with climate-change impacts, when assessing the evolutionary fitness of species inhabiting the Galapagos. For example, the survival of endemic marine iguanas has been negatively affected by organic hydrocarbons introduced via oil spills, and endangered Galapagos sea lions exhibit detectable concentrations of DDT, triggering potential feminization effects and compromising the species' survival. During periods of ocean warming (El Nino events) when endemic species undergo nutritional stress, climate change may increase the vulnerability of these species to the impacts of pollutants, resulting in the species reaching its population tipping point. Marine plastics are emerging as a deleterious and widespread threat to endemic species. The Galapagos is treasured for its historical significance and its unparalleled living laboratory and display of evolutionary processes; however, this unique and iconic paradise will remain in jeopardy until multidisciplinary and comprehensive preventative management plans are put in place to mitigate and eliminate the effects of anthropogenic stressors facing the islands today. We present a critical analysis and synthesis of anthropogenic stressors with some progress from local and international institutional efforts and call to action more precautionary measures along with new management philosophies focused on understanding the processes of change through research to champion the conservation of the Galapagos.

The objective of this study is to determine if integrins are expressed on sea urchin eggs. The alphaB and betaC subunits were cloned using the homology polymerase chain reaction. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were developed against bacterially expressed fragments of the extracellular domains of the betaC subunit and the alphaB subunit. As well, a monoclonal antibody was developed against a synthesized peptide corresponding to part of the cytoplasmic domain of betaC. Analysis of biotinylated egg cortex extracts immunoprecipitated with either anti-betaC or anti-alphaB yields bands of 130 and 225 kDa. Immunoblots confirm that betaC is part of the complex immunoprecipitated with anti-alphaB. Confocal immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy show that betaC is present on the surface of the unfertilized egg at the tips of microvilli and in cortical granules. During the cortical reaction, immunoreactivity with antibodies to the extracellular domains of betaC and alphaB disappears from the egg surface, and microvillar casts on the fertilization envelope become immunoreactive. With antibodies to the cytoplasmic domain of betaC, immunoreactivity is lost from the surface of the egg, but the fertilization envelope does not immediately become immunoreactive. In immunoblots of egg cortex there are immunoreactive bands of the predicted sizes for alphaB and betaC. However, in fertilization envelopes, a second band that is slightly lower in molecular weight is also present. Eggs fertilized in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor have elongated microvilli that remain bound to the elevating fertilization envelope and immunoreactive to anti-betaC antibodies. Eggs fertilized in the presence of an ovoperoxidase inhibitor, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, have a patchy distribution of betaC immunoreactivity in fertilization envelopes. Together, these data suggest that alphaB betaC integrins are expressed on the surface of unfertilized eggs and, during the cortical reaction, the extracellular domains are cleaved by proteases and cross-linked into the fertilization envelope by ovoperoxidase. The alphaB betaC integrin receptors may have several potential functions prior to their removal at fertilization, including attachment of the vitelline envelope to the egg surface and anchoring the cortical cytoskeleton.

This communication reports the use of the mathematical simulation model SliDESim to investigate how best to administer cypermethrin bath treatments on Scottish salmon (Salmon salar L) farms to control the challenge from lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) during a two-year production cycle. It was found that these topical treatments are most effective when administered in pairs approximately six weeks apart. Timing of treatment is critical and depends on the number of treatments administered over the production cycle. For 4, 5 or 6 treatments during a two-year production cycle. SLiDESim indicated that the first pair of treatments is best initiated in autumn of the first year of production with the second pair starting between 13 and 18 weeks later. This strategy can produce considerable gains in the predicted reduction of sea lice levels when compared with those historically observed when using cypermethrin on Scottish farms. The effects of altered efficacy were also explored using the model and indicate that even a moderate reduction in treatment efficacy can have considerable impacts on lice control over a production cycle. The SLiDESim computer model provides a framework to explore the more efficient use of veterinary treatments for the control of sea lice on salmon farms.

Their complex lifecycle, involving freshwater spawning, juveniles (ammocoetes) that remain in freshwater for up to eight years, and adults migrating to sea before returning to reproduce, means native populations in Europe are threatened by multiple stressors, especially migration blockages and habitat loss. This has resulted in population declines across their European range, despite their ecological, evolutionary, and economic significance. Information on their population demography and long-term patterns are also scarce, with focus primarily on their ammocoete freshwater phase. This is inhibiting the development of biological reference points for utilization in population monitoring programs. In the Great Lakes of North America, however, P. marinus is invasive and the high damage caused to commercial fisheries resulted in their populations being controlled through a long-term, multi-method and integrated research and management approach over the last 40 years, with the development and application of a range of novel methods. Successful knowledge transfer to Europe could therefore facilitate the monitoring of threatened populations and develop new conservation actions, including modifying migration blockages to facilitate passage, implementing adult trapping programs, and applying pheromone treatments to manipulate adult movements and behaviors. This reveals the potential utility of using invasive fish populations to inform conservation practices in native ranges, and how pheromone research could further enhance fish conservation and monitoring.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  141,10.1080/23308249.2016.1233166     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Pheromone;trapping;invasion;fish passage;native;non-native;JUVENILE ATLANTIC SALMON;LAMPETRA-PLANERI BLOCH;GREAT-LAKES;CLIMATE-CHANGE;ORGANOCHLORINE CONTAMINANTS;PHEROMONE COMMUNICATION;MIGRATORY PHEROMONE;SPAWNING MIGRATION;REGULATED RIVERS;PACIFIC LAMPREY;Petromyzon,NA,NA,sea lamprey <i>petromyzon marinus<i> biology and management across their native and invasive ranges promoting conservation by knowledge transfer

Electrophysiological recordings from the antennules showed that neural activities in the crayfish antennules were still present 2 h after exposure to diazinon, although at decreased rates. In addition, responses to hydrodynamic stimuli indicated that the mechanosensitivity of crayfish antennules was reduced after exposure to concentrations of as low as 0.5 mg/L. The reduction in mechanosensitivity was larger and more rapid in the lateral flagellum than the medial flagellum. Observations from dye experiments showed that ambient water was more readily absorbed at the lateral flagellum than the medial flagellum probably because of differences in the setal structures of the 2 flagella.

It was found that these topical treatments are most effective when administered in pairs approximately six weeks apart. Timing of treatment is critical and depends on the number of treatments administered over the production cycle. For 4, 5 or 6 treatments during a two-year production cycle, SLiDESim indicated that the first pair of treatments is best initiated in autumn of the first year of production with the second pair starting between 13 and 18. weeks later. This strategy can produce considerable gains in the predicted reduction of sea lice levels when compared with those historically observed when using cypermethrin on Scottish farms. The effects of altered efficacy were also explored using the model and indicate that even a moderate reduction in treatment efficacy can have considerable impacts on lice control over a production cycle.

According to the influence coefficient and sensitivity coefficient, manufacturing, construction and the tertiary sectors played a dominant role in promoting economic growth in this area. Furthermore, mining, water-electricity-gas production and supply, construction sectors were highly sensitive to the economic growth.

Risk-benefit assessments of fish consumption have frequently focused on methylmercury and omega-3 fatty acids, not persistent pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls, and none have evaluated Great Lakes fish consumption. Objectives: The risks and benefits of fish consumption have been established primarily for marine fish. Here, we examine whether sufficient data are available to evaluate the risks and benefits of eating freshwater fish from the Great Lakes. Methods: We used a scoping review to integrate information from multiple state, provincial, and federal agency sources regarding the contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and fish consumers, consumption rates and fish consumption advisories, and health effects of contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids. Data synthesis: Great Lakes fish contain persistent contaminants-many of which have documented adverse health effects -that accumulate in humans consuming them. In contrast, data are sparse on omega-3 fatty acids in the fish and their consumers. Moreover, few studies have documented the social and cultural benefits of Great Lakes fish consumption, particularly for subsistence fishers and native communities. At this time, federal and state/provincial governments provide fish consumption advisories based solely on risk. Conclusions: Our knowledge of Great Lakes fish has critical gaps, particularly regarding the benefits of consumption. A risk-benefit analysis requires more information than is currently available on the concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and their absorption by fish eaters in addition to more information on the social, cultural, and health consequences of changes in the amount of fish consumed.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 102; Correspondence Address: M.

The questions that concern us are the following: how can one minimize energy consumption in the chemical industry and reduce waste formation in chemical reactions, and can we transform this industry from one based primarily on petroleum to one that utilizes renewable feedstocks? In this chapter we will see how this “greening” of this major industrial and energy sector will require the use of catalysis and development of new catalysts. Synopsis Thomas Jefferson stated that “the earth belongs in usufruct to the living.” This premise is the basis of present recognition that, if the natural capacity of planet Earth to deal with pollution and waste is exceeded, then our lifestyle will become unsustainable. In this context, it is difficult to imagine life in the twenty-first century without accounting for the role the chemical industry plays in our modern society. For example, in the transportation sector, the most obvious aspect is the production of efficient fuels from petroleum, but one also should consider catalytic converters that reduce toxic emissions, and engineering polymers and plastics that reduce vehicle weight and therefore reduce fuel consumption. In daily consumer life we use chemicals in products such as paints, DVDs, synthetic carpets, refrigerants, packaging, inks and toners, liquid-crystal displays, and synthetic fibers. Pesticides and fertilizers are needed in order to increase agricultural productivity and pharmaceuticals to keep us healthy. In this chapter we will try to understand the aspects involved in the sustainability of the chemical industry. We will describe how to measure and control environmental performance and then define what we mean by green processing in the chemical industry, specifying green process metrics, introducing key concepts such as atom economy, E-factors, and effective mass yields. With these concepts together with the evaluation raw material costs, waste treatment, and unit processes needed for production of a chemical one can appreciate the “greenness” of a chemical process. The second part of this chapter will describe the role catalysis has in chemical transformations and how catalysis is used to reduce energy consumption and waste formation, together leading to increased sustainability. Examples will be given for a spectrum of applications ranging over oil refining, ammonia production, manufacture of important chemical intermediates and materials, and use of catalysis for the production of commodity chemicals. Finally, we will discuss the role catalysis may play in the replacement of fossil-fuel feedstocks with renewable ones, and how catalysis may contribute to our search for solar fuels. © Materials Research Society 2012.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 0,10.1017/CBO9780511718786.045,Automobile manufacture;Catalysis;Catalytic converters;Chemical compounds;Chemical industry;Chemical reactions;Earth (planet);Environmental management;Feedstocks;Fossil fuels;Fuels;Indicators (chemical);Industrial chemicals;Liquid crystal displays;Manufacture;Petroleum industry;Petroleum transportation;Productivity;Sustainable development;Waste treatment;Agricultural productivity;Chemical intermediates;Chemical transformations;Environmental performance;Environmental sustainability;Reduce energy consumption;Renewable feedstocks;Transportation sector;Energy utilization,NA,NA,green processing catalysis

DESIGN: Early developmental stages of fish, from embryo to larvae, were exposed to terbuthylazine at concentrations of 0.9, 160, 520, and 820 μg L-1, and metribuzin at concentrations of 0.9, 4, 14, and 32 mg L-1 for 30 days and compared to the non-treated control group. For assessment of free radical defence the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured; the lipid peroxidation (TBARS) level was determined as a marker of free radical damage. RESULTS: Terbuthylazine had no significant effect (p>0.05) at any tested concentrations on GST activity. Terbuthylazine caused an increase (p<0.05) in GR activity at the concentration of 520 μg L-1. We found a non-significant (p>0.05) effect of terbuthylazine exposure on TBARS level. In metribuzin treated groups, the activity of GST was increased (p<0.05) in all experimental groups, with the highest at the concentration of 32 mg L-1. GR activity was increased in the 0.9, 4, and 14 mg L-1 groups and the TBARS levels were the highest in the 0.9 mg L-1 group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that terbuthylazine and metribuzin induced oxidative stress in embryo-larval stages of common carp.

The authors compared these drugs with regard to their efficacy and tolerability in the initial monotherapy for epilepsy. Methods: A randomised, open-label, controlled, parallel group, multicenter trial was conducted to test the superiority of the LEV arm over the LTG arm. The primary endpoint was the rate of seizure-free patients in the first 6 weeks (two-sided Fisher's exact test, α=0.05, intent-to-treat set). Furthermore, efficacy, tolerability and quality of life were evaluated. The authors included 409 patients aged ≥12 years with newly diagnosed focal or generalised epilepsy defined by either two or more unprovoked seizures or one first seizure with high risk for recurrence. Patients were titrated to 2000 mg/day of LEV or 200 mg/day of LTG reached on day 22 or 71, respectively. Two dose adjustments by 500/50 mg were allowed. Results: The proportions of seizure-free patients were 67.5% (LEV) versus 64.0% (LTG) 6 weeks after randomisation (p=0.47), and 45.2% (LEV) versus 47.8% (LTG) during the whole treatment period of 26 weeks. The HR (LEV vs LTG) for seizure-free time was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.22). Adverse events occurred in 74.5% (LEV) versus 70.6% (LTG) of the patients (p=0.38). Adverse events associated with study discontinuation occurred in 17/204 (LEV) versus 8/201 (LTG) patients (p=0.07).

Two runs each reactor were carried out at operating conditions VL=4.22L, Q=1-1.5vvm, T=22°C. The culture broth apparent viscosity changed from 2 to 12mPas determining global changes in both hydrodynamics (expressed as the dimensionless Reynolds number, Re) and oxygen transfer conditions (expressed as the kLa coefficient). Such changes were 170<Re<3080; 1.9<kLa (10-2s-1)<3.5 for R1 experiments, and 400<Re<10,060; 1.9<kLa (10-2s-1)<3.5, for R2 experiments. Infective juvenile stage (IJ) concentrations of 250,000/mL were achieved in R2 experiments whereas notably lower ones were obtained in R1 experiments (110,000IJ/mL, approximately). The hydrodynamic conditions in both riser and downcomer sections of R2 experiments involved higher inertial forces than the corresponding ones to R1 runs, implying values of (ReR2/ReR1)riser from 2.3 to 3.3 and (ReR2/ReR1)downcomer from 1.8 to 2.5. These results suggest that higher inertial forces would promote the mating process among the vigorous adult nematodes of the first generation, probably due to encourage female-male encounters in response to a better mixing of the culture broth. Further, the nematode reproduction appeared to be greatly influenced by the reactor geometry. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: N.

Rich (Fabaceae) leaves used by herbalists from the Lake Victoria region, Kenya. The extract was tested against four strains of mycobacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium smegmatis) using BACTEC Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 system and the proportional method. Standard procedures were used to determine the zones of inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations (MBCs/MFCs) for Candida albicans, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The extract showed activity against some mycobacteria strains, especially M. tuberculosis. It also showed strong antimicrobial activity (zones of inhibition were between 9.00 and 14.10 mm) against C. albicans, Sa. typhi, and St. aureus. The extract gave a better zone of inhibition against C. albicans than fluconazole whose zone of inhibition was 13.00 mm. The MICs and MBCs for C. albicans and Sa. typhi were good. The crude extracts were also analyzed for the presence of phytochemicals. Phytochemical screening indicated that the extract most abundantly contained tannins, saponins, and flavonoids. The data suggest that the methanolic leaves extract of E. abysinnica could be a rich source of antimicrobial agents, especially antifungals. The results further show that there is some merit in the use of the plant in alternative medical practices.

Compensation for fisheries decline, creation of new jobs and source of financial windfall are the most important benefits. However, similar to most of the human food-production activities, aquaculture raised several issues related to the environmental welfare and consumer safety. An effort to record the aquaculture-environment and -human safety interactions with regard to the Mediterranean mariculture, is attempted herein. We focused on this geographical area due to its individualities in both the hydrological and physicochemical characteristics and the forms of aquaculture activities. The cage farming of euryhaline marine fish species and more recently of bluefin tuna and mollusk farming are the dominating aquaculture activities. The impacts of these activities to the environment, through wastes offloads, introduction of alien species, genetic interactions, disease transfer, release of chemicals, use of wild recourses, alterations of coastal habitats and disturbance of wildlife, are analytically considered. Also the consumer safety issues related to the farming are assessed, including generation of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, contaminants transferred to humans though food chain and other hazards from consumption of aquacultured items. Within these, the major literature findings are critically examined and suggestions for scientific areas that need further development are made. The major tasks for future aquaculture development in this region are: (i) to ensure sustainability and (ii) to balance the risks to public or environmental health with the substantial economical benefits. In regard with monitoring, tools must be created or adapted to predict the environmental costs and estimate consumer impact.

The aim of this study was to determine factors that influence the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in three rural communities of Côte d'Ivoire, two of which benefited from recent interventions. Methods. The study was carried out in 957 households in three villages (Bozi, N'Dakonankro and Yoho) located in central Côte d'Ivoire. Indicators of socioeconomic position (SEP), malaria knowledge and practice, placing special emphasis on LLINs, were investigated during a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Principal component analysis was used to calculate the SEP of households by means of a list of household assets ownership. The concentration index was used to assess the direction of the association between SEP and a given variable. To compare groups or means, Fisher's exact test, 2 and Kruskal-Wallis test were used, as appropriate. Results: Significant differences were found between SEP and reported malaria symptoms, such as fever or hot body, convulsion, anaemia and jaundice (yellow eyes). Individuals from the least poor group cited more often the use of bed nets and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) compared to poorer groups. The mean number of individuals reporting the use of bed nets and LLINs was different between groups with different educational level. Moreover, the mean number of LLINs in a household was influenced by the presence of children below five years of age. Conclusion: The study not only confirmed that education and SEP play important roles in the prevention and control of malaria and promotion of health in general, but pointed at the basic essential knowledge and the key behavioural elements that should guide education and learning processes among the poorer segments of the population. In turn, such knowledge may change behaviour and lead to an increased utilization of LLINs. © 2011 Ouattara et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: B.G.

Prochloraz has known effects on a number of key HPG molecules, including antagonism of Cyp17 and Cyp19 (aromatase). Twenty-eight proteins were shown to be differentially expressed in the brains of females and 22 in males. Proteins were identified using LC-MS/MS and identities were examined relative to brain function in the context of changing steroid hormone levels. There was little overlap between sexes in proteins exhibiting differential expression. Proteins with known roles in metabolism, learning, neuroprotection, and calcium regulation were determined to be differentially regulated. Relationships between identified proteins were also examined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and females were shown to exhibit enrichment of several metabolic pathways. We used differentially expressed proteins to establish a putative classifier consisting of three proteins that was able to discriminate prochloraz-exposed from control females.

Methods and results: The antifungal activity of 21 different AMPs and CPPs was investigated by microdilution assay and plate counting to determine the number of colony forming units. Five CPPs and one AMP showed fungicidal activity at submicromolar concentrations. Importantly, no membrane damage on human keratinocytes was detected after peptide treatment. Conclusions: Several CPPs, while being nontoxic to mammalian cells, possess growth inhibitory activity on the very stringent yeast M. sympodialis. Significance and impact of study: Our findings that five CPPs and one AMP that are harmless towards mammalian cells act as antifungal agents against M. sympodialis opens up the possibility to use these in the treatment for AE, SE and dandruff.

Due to its extensive use, it has been widely detected in aquatic ecosystems representing a potential threat to non-target organisms, including fish. Despite the negative impact of this commercial formulation in fish, as described in literature, the scarcity of studies assessing its genotoxicity and underlying mechanisms is evident. Therefore, as a novel approach, this study evaluated the genotoxic potential of Roundup® to blood cells of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) following short-term (1 and 3 days) exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations (58 and 116 μg/l), addressing also the possible association with oxidative stress. Thus, comet and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) assays were adopted, as genotoxic end points, reflecting different types of genetic damage. The pro-oxidant state was assessed through enzymatic (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase) and non-enzymatic (total glutathione content) antioxidants, as well as by lipid peroxidation (LPO) measurements. The Roundup® potential to induce DNA strand breaks for both concentrations was demonstrated by the comet assay. The induction of chromosome breakage and/or segregational abnormalities was also demonstrated through the ENA assay, though only after 3-day exposure to both tested concentrations. In addition, the two genotoxic indicators were positively correlated. Antioxidant defences were unresponsive to Roundup®. LPO levels increased only for the high concentration after the first day of exposure, indicating that oxidative stress caused by this agrochemical in blood was not severe.

Codling moth control is currently achieved using pheromone dispensers (handapplied or puffers) supplemented with reduced-risk insecticides as determined by monitoring. The reduction in the use of organophosphate insecticides has resulted in the decrease of pear psylla, Cacopsylla pyricola, and twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, populations through increased activity of beneficial insects. This has led to reductions in pesticide use specific to these two pests. During the transition period, two secondary pests, pear rust mite, Epitrimerus pyri, and oblique-banded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana, caused significant damage. By developing monitoring techniques and treatment thresholds these two pests are now controlled with appropriately timed insecticides. Pear sawfly, Caliroa cerasi, lygus bug, Lygus hesperus, and Western spotted cucumber beetle, Diabrotica undecimpunctata, are very sporadic secondary pests that occasionally need to be controlled with welltimed insecticides. Katydids, previously not considered a pest on pears, were observed feeding on maturing fruit in North Coast orchards. The Mediterranean katydid, Phaneroptera nana, an exotic species present in California since 1940s, was found to be responsible for the feeding damage. This species overwinters as eggs on vines and the nymphs migrate to the edge of pear orchards as the fruit ripens. Presently the secondary pests of major concern, for which studies are still ongoing, are Western boxelder bug, Boisea rubrolineata and consperse stink bug, Euschistus conspersus. Western boxelder bug is also a pest at the edge of orchards adjacent to the riparian corridor where this insect overwinters. Damage from consperse stink bug can be observed throughout the orchard. We will present monitoring techniques developed for these secondary pests and results of insecticide trials for the most effective timing and control.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4,10.17660/ActaHortic.2011.909.64,Boisea rubrolineata;Caliroa cerasi;Choristoneura rosaceana;Diabrotica undecimpunctata;Euschistus conspersus;Lygus hesperus;Phaneroptera nana;Acari;Araneae;Cacopsylla pyri;Cacopsylla pyricola;Coleoptera;Cucumis sativus;Cydia pomonella;Diabrotica undecimpunctata undecimpunctata;Hexapoda;Lepidoptera;Pentatomidae;Pyrus;Tetranychidae;Tetranychus urticae;Tetraodontidae;Tettigoniidae;California,NA,NA,evolution of secondary pests in california pear orchards under mating disruption for codling moth control

In conjunction with refuges of non-Bt host plants, fitness costs can delay the evolution of resistance. Furthermore, fitness costs often vary with ecological conditions, suggesting that agricultural landscapes can be manipulated to magnify fitness costs and thereby prolong the efficacy of Bt crops. In the current study, we tested the effects of four species of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) on the magnitude and dominance of fitness costs of resistance to Bt toxin CrylAc in pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). For more than a decade, field populations of pink bollworm in the United States have remained susceptible to Bt cotton Gossypium hirsutum L. producing CrylAc; however, we used laboratory strains that had a mixture of susceptible and resistant individuals. In laboratory experiments, dominant fitness costs were imposed by the nematode Steinernema riobrave Cabanillas, Poinar, and Raulston but no fitness costs were imposed by Steinernema carpocapsae Weiser, Steinernema sp. (ML18 strain), or Heterorhabditis sonorensis Stock, Rivera-Orduo, and Flores-Lara. In computer simulations, evolution of resistance to CrylAc by pink bollworm was substantially delayed by treating some non-Bt cotton refuge fields with nematodes that imposed a dominant fitness cost, similar to the cost observed in laboratory experiments with S. riobrave. Based on the results here and in related studies, we conclude that entomopathogenic nematodes could bolster insect resistance management, but the success of this approach will depend on selecting the appropriate species of nematode and environment, as fitness costs were magnified by only two of five species evaluated and also depended on environmental factors. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: A.

Water withdrawal from their tributaries is one and in many cases main reason for that. Since prehistoric times, the size and shape of the Aral Sea changed depending on the amount of water arriving at the lake. The Aral Sea system is in equilibrium when the amount of water flowing in equals the amount of water evaporating over the year. During the 1950s, the government of the former USSR decided to increase the areas used for agriculture in the river valleys of the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya. To this end, water was and still is deviated from the rivers by thousands of open trenches being unsealed and leading to a massive loss of water by evaporation and seepage. In consequence, less water was and is arriving at the Aral Sea and its size is shrinking dramatically. Especially on its eastern shoreline even a small decrease in the water level leads to the exposition of large areas of former sea bottom because the lake is very shallow. Cities like Aralsk and Munyak formally located directly on the seaside are now completely surrounded by the steppe far away from the water. Although the shrinking of the Aral Sea was an economic disaster for the population living on the coast, the population in the river valleys increased significantly. Today, the major part of Uzbekistan's population is working in this area, and in Kazakhstan there are also millions of people depending on the irrigation water taken from the tributaries of the Aral Sea. The area around the Aral Sea was declared to be a ‘zone of ecological disaster,’ and small subsidies are (still) paid to its inhabitants. Most of the former fishermen moved away to other lakes. In consequence of the brakedown of the economic background the social structure in the population changed completely and people are suffering from unemployment and the lack of any economic perspective. However, studies performed up to now could not prove the assumption that the health of the local population impaired because of environmental pollutants having their origin in the river valleys of the Aral Seas tributaries. There is no doubt that the health of inhabitants of the area is severely affected by the environmental conditions, but not by single contaminants. People living in the Syr Darya valley and, most probably, in the Amu Darya valley suffer much more from pesticide pollution than those living in the former shoreline area of the Aral Sea. Owing to the use of certain pesticides, high concentrations of dioxins and dibenzofurans have been detected in their bodies. Water is a valuable resource and probably the most important economic factor in the countries of Central Asia. The problems of the Aral Sea cannot be solved in the short term. The problems are a result of economic decisions made in the 1950s within a different political context on the basis of a Soviet Union-wide organized economy. Now that small countries are struggling for survival of their local economies, there is, at least in the non-oil producing countries, not enough economic power for a rapid change. However, the area of the Aral Sea will enlarge with an increasing amount of water left over in the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya, even if the Aral Sea probably will not regain its former size during the next generation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Two studies showed inverse associations between PCBs and IQ in cohorts of children whose mothers consumed Great Lakes fish contaminated with PCBs and other organochlorines (Jacobson & Jacobson 1996; Stewart et al. 2008). Another study from the general US population, where women were exposed to background levels of PCBs, showed no association between PCBs and IQ (Gray et al. 2005). The current report examines two potential sources of inconsistency across studies: 1) confounding with non-PCB organochlorines [Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and Mirex]; and 2) the presence of negative confounding (i.e., suppressor variables). The former could confound PCBs and lead to spurious associations (Type I errors), while the latter could suppress PCB associations and obscure true associations (Type II errors). These issues were explored through the analysis of associations between placental levels of organochlorines and IQ in children at 9 and 11. years of age in the Oswego study. Neither DDE nor mirex was related to lower IQ at either age; PCBs predicted lower IQ at both ages; and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) appeared as a significant predictor of IQ at the 11-year assessment. However, analysis of the IQ data set as a whole showed that both PCBs and HCB predicted lower IQ in a generally independent fashion. There was, however, overlap in the variance in some cases, and the pattern of findings between the two was remarkably similar. These results may provide some evidence for the potential involvement of non-PCB organochlorines in the Oswego study. To explore negative confounding, we analyzed the relationships between PCB exposure and demographic variables as well as the unadjusted and adjusted relationships between PCB and IQ. Results revealed that placental PCB levels were associated with older mothers who were more educated and came from higher socioeconomic strata. Due to this fact, unadjusted relationships between PCBs and IQ appeared null or slightly positive. After control for confounders, several significant negative associations between PCBs and IQ were revealed. These data might suggest that inadequate control for confounders in PCB studies, where negative confounding is present, may bias results toward the null (Type II error) rather than spurious associations (Type I error). This pattern of confounding with PCB exposure in the Oswego study also has implications for the assessment of risk. The most highly exposed children came from families with somewhat higher socioeconomic status, and tended to score in the average to above-average range, well above IQ scores that are considered ""at risk."" Further, such children were exposed prenatally to PCBs through maternal consumption of PCB-contaminated Great Lakes fish in the early 1990s, when PCB levels were higher than today. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: P.W.

Although human-made, these chemicals are not completely alien to living systems. A large number of natural organohalogens, part of the secondary metabolism, are involved in chemical trophic interactions. Surprisingly, the relationship between organisms' trophic position and synthetic organohalogen biotransformation capability has not been investigated. We studied the case for polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDE), a group of flame-retardants of widespread use in the recent years, in aquatic food webs from remote mountain lakes. These relatively simple ecosystems only receive pollution by atmospheric transport. A large predominance of the PBDE congener currently in use in Europe, BDE-209, largely dominated the PBDE composition of the basal resources of the food web. In contrast, primary consumers (herbivores and detritivores) showed a low proportion of BDE-209, and dominance of several less brominated congeners (e.g. BDE-100, BDE47). Secondary consumers (predators) showed large biomagnification of BDE-209 compare to other congeners. Finally, top predator fish characterized by low total PBDE concentrations. Examination of the bromine stable isotopic composition indicates that primary consumers showed higher PBDE biotransformation capability than secondary consumers. We suggest that the evolutionary response of primary consumers to feeding deterrents would have pre-adapted them for PBDE biotransformation. The observed few exceptions, some insect taxa, can be interpreted in the light of the trophic history of the evolutionary lineage of the organisms. Bromine isotopic composition in fish indicates that low PBDE values are due to not only biotransformation but also to some other process likely related to transport. Our finding illustrates that organohalogen compounds may strongly disturb ecosystems even at low concentrations, since the species lacking or having scarce biotransformation capability may be selectively more exposed to these halogenated hydrophobic semi-volatile organic pollutants due to their high bioaccumulation potential.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  63,10.1371/journal.pone.0041829     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS;RANGE ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT;BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS;HIGH-MOUNTAIN LAKES;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS;DECABROMODIPHENYL ETHER;ORGANOCHLORINE COMPOUNDS;HERBIVORE INTERACTIONS;MARINE WORMS;BIOTRANSFORMATION;Food,NA,NA,pollutant dehalogenation capability may depend on the trophic evolutionary history of the organism pbdes in freshwater food webs

In separate trials with larvae of A. irradians, C. virginica, and M. mercenaria, an aggressive predatory response of three strains of algal- and fish-fed P. shumwayae was observed (exception, algal-fed strain 1024C). Larval mortality resulted primarily from damage inflicted by physical attack of the flagellated cells, and secondarily from Pfiesteria toxin, as demonstrated in larval C virginica exposed to P shumwayae with versus without direct physical contact. Survival of adult shellfish and grazing activity depended upon the species and the cell density, strain, and nutritional history of P. shumwayae. No mortality of the four shellfish species was noted after 24 h of exposure to algal- or fish-fed P. shumwayae (strains 1024C, 1048C, and CCMP2089) in separate trials at <= 5 x 10(3) cells ml(-1), whereas higher densities of fish-fed, but not algal-fed, populations (> 7-8 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)) induced low (<= 15%) but significant mortality. Adults of all four shellfish species sustained > 90% mortality when exposed to fish-fed strain 270A1 (8 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)). In contrast, adult M. mercenaria and P viridis exposed to a similar density of fish-fed strain 2172C sustained < 15% mortality, and there was no mortality of A. irradians and C. virginica exposed to that strain. In mouse bioassays with tissue homogenates (adductor muscle, mantle, and whole animals) of A. irradians and M. mercenaria that had been exposed to R shumwayae (three strains, separate trials), mice experienced several minutes of disorientation followed by recovery. Mice injected with tissue extracts from control animals fed cryptomonads showed no response. Grazing rates of adult shellfish on P. shumwayae (mean cell length +/- 1 standard error [S.E.], 9 +/- 1 mu m) generally were significantly lower when fed fish-fed (toxic) populations than when fed populations that previously had been maintained on algal prey, and grazing rates were highest with the nontoxic cryptomonad, Storeatula major (cell length 7 +/- 1 mu m). Abundant cysts of P. shumwayae were found in fecal strands of all shellfish species tested, and <= 45% of the feces produced viable flagellated cells when placed into favorable culture conditions. These findings were supported by a field study wherein fecal strands collected from field-collected adult shellfish (C virginica, M. mercenaria, and ribbed mussels, Geukensia demissa) were confirmed to contain cysts of P. shumwayae, and these cysts produced fish-killing flagellated populations in standardized fish bioassays. Thus, predatory feeding by flagellated cells of R shumwayae can adversely affect survival of larval bivalve molluscs, and grazing can be depressed when adult shellfish are fed P. shumwayae. The data suggest that R shumwayae could affect recruitment of larval shellfish in estuaries and aquaculture facilities; shellfish can be adversely affected via reduced filtration rates; and adult shellfish may be vectors of toxic P shumwayae when shellfish are transported from one geographic location to another.

Antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9), glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2), superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6)), redox status of glutathione and lipid peroxidation were measured at first in the gills and the digestive glands of mussels after exposure to copper (30 mu g l(-1)) or/and thiram (100 mu g l(-1)) for 3 days. The effects of a complex industrial effluent on the antioxidant system were investigated afterwards in a held study: encaged mussels were placed in a river upstream and downstream from a pollution source consisting of the effluent of a cokery for 1 week. These studies demonstrated that in both experimental exposures, the most sensitive parameters were selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity (SeGPx), reduced glutathione levels (GSH) and especially glutathione reductase activity (GRd) which significantly decreased. Decreases in SeGPX and GRd activities were more pronounced in the gills under coexposure to copper and thiram, with 74% and 78% of reduced activity, respectively (P < 0.01); reduction of GSH levels was 50% in this case. In the field study, the activities could be reduced by 35% and 72% in the gills for SeGPx and GRd, respectively; reduction of GSH levels could reach 45%. In contrast, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities remained generally constant in all the treatment groups compared with controls. Lipid peroxidation, as expressed by malonaldehyde content measured by HPLC, was slightly enhanced in experiment with copper+thiram and this increase (from 1.8 to 2.8 fold) was concomitant with a depletion of antioxidant defences. The responses of antioxidant parameters were overall greater in the gills than in the digestive glands of exposed mussels. These results suggest that among antioxidant defence systems, SeGPx, GSH levels and particularly GRd, could represent biomarkers of interest for the estimation of the effects of environmental contamination on freshwater invertebrates.

Here, Pseudoalteromonas piscicida WCPW15003 as a probiotic effectively antagonized dominant pathogenic V. harveyi in a mariculture, with a growth-of-inhibition ratio of 6.3 h(-1). The antagonistic activities of cells and intracellular components of WCPW15003 made a greater contribution to the antagonistic process than did extracellular metabolites and caused the dominance of WCPW15003 during the antagonistic process in vitro. WCPW15003 was safe for the pearl gentian grouper (female Epinephelus fuscoguttatus x male Epinephelus lanceolatus) and, as a consequence of the antagonistic effect on V. harveyi, protected the fish from an immune response in vivo. A comprehensive combined proteomics and metabolomics analysis of antagonistic WCPW15003 and pathogenic V. harveyi in a coculture compared to a monoculture was performed to investigate the antagonistic molecular mechanisms. The results showed that during the antagonistic process, WCPW15003 in a coculture had significantly downregulated metabolic pathways for histidine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism, and upregulated glycerophospholipid metabolism, leading to a competitive advantage against the cooccurring species, V. harveyi. This defined a mechanism by which multi-costimulatory pathways drove P. piscicida WCPW15003 against V. harveyi.        IMPORTANCE V. harveyi as a dominant pathogen has become a major hazard in mariculture development and seafood safety, and biocontrol of this pathogen using antagonistic probiotic agents is a long-standing biological challenge. P. piscicida WCPW15003 has promise as a novel, safe, and effective bioagent for specifically inhibiting dominant pathogenic V. harveyi and protects mariculture animals from infection by this pathogen by moderating the host immune response, which is heavily driven by multi-costimulatory pathways in a coculture of WCPW15003 and V. harveyi. This work identified a direction for comprehensively elucidating the molecular mechanism of WCPW15003 antagonism against the dominant pathogen in mariculture using modern molecular biology techniques and provided deep insights into the advantages and potential of this antagonistic probiotic against V. harveyi for the construction of an environmentally friendly, recirculating mariculture system.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  45,10.1128/spectrum.02444-22,pathogenic Vibrio harveyi;antagonistic bacteria;immune response;proteomic combined metabolomic analysis;costimulatory pathway;recirculating-mariculture system;PSEUDOMONAS-PUTIDA;IDENTIFICATION;BACTERIA;GROWTH;DISEASE;SHRIMP;LARVAE;FISH;SPP.;Proteomics;Proteome,NA,NA,multicostimulatory pathways drive the antagonistic <i>pseudoalteromonas piscicida<i> against the dominant pathogenic <i>vibrio harveyi<i> in mariculture insights from proteomics and metabolomics

This review deals chiefly with the FAD-dependent, biosynthetic enzymes which readily catalyze the formation of acetohydroxybutyrate from pyruvate and 2-oxobutyrate, as well as of acetolactate from two molecules of pyruvate (the ALS/AHAS group). These enzymes are generally susceptible to inhibition by one or more of the branched-chain amino acids which are ultimate products of the acetohydroxyacids, as well as by several classes of herbicides (sulfonylureas, imidazolinones and others). Some ALS/AHASs also catalyze the (non-physiological) oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, leading to peracetic acid; the possible relationship of this process to oxygen toxicity is considered. The bacterial ALS/AHAS which have been well characterized consist of catalytic subunits (around 60 kDa) and smaller regulatory subunits in an alpha(2)beta(2) structure. In the case of Escherichia coli isozyme III, assembly and dissociation of the holoenzyme has been studied. The quaternary structure of the eukaryotic enzymes is less clear and in plants and yeast only catalytic polypeptides (homologous to those of bacteria) have been clearly identified. The presence of regulatory polypeptides in these organisms cannot be ruled out, however, and genes which encode putative ALS/AHAS regulatory subunits have been identified in some cases. A consensus sequence can be constructed from the 21 sequences which have been shown experimentally to represent ALS/AHAS catalytic polypeptides. Many other sequences fit this consensus, but some genes identified as putative 'acetolactate synthase genes' are almost certainly not ALS/AHAS. The solution of the crystal structures of several thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes which are homologous to ALS/AHAS, together with the availability of many amino acid sequences for the latter enzymes, has made it possible for two laboratories to propose similar, reasonable models for a dimer of catalytic subunits of an ALS/AHAS. A number of characteristics of these enzymes can now be better understood on the basis of such models: the nature of the herbicide binding site, the structural role of FAD and the binding of ThDP-Mg2+. The models are also guides for experimental testing of ideas concerning structure-function relationships in these enzymes, e.g. the nature of the substrate recognition site. Among the important remaining questions is how the enzyme suppresses alternative reactions of the intrinsically reactive hydroxyethyl ThDP enamine formed by the decarboxylation of the first substrate molecule and specifically promotes its condensation with 2-oxobutyrate or pyruvate. 0 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Gharb district and particularly the Sebou river basin are among the most heavily polluted regions in Morocco.        Oued Sebou collecting basin is 40,000 km(2), situated in north-western Morocco. Its water flows from the north-western slopes of the Middle Atlas range to the Atlantic Ocean. Its tributaries collect waters from the Rif range (Oued Ouerrha) and from central Morocco (Oued Beht). It is the main purveyor of water of the Gharb plain, a major agricultural region in Morocco, where fertilizers and pesticides are widely used. Along its banks, various industries (paper mills, sugar plants, tanneries, food industries, wool mills, chemical plants, etc.) have settled and contribute to the development of large towns which are not equipped with facilities for the treatment of either industrial or domestic waters. It is a real example of water pollution in a developing country.        In order to assess the actual water quality of lower Sebou and to monitor both the effect of the release of pollutants and the influence of other factors, a wide pluridisciplinary research program on the biological, ecotoxicological and microbiological situation is in progress. Eleven stations have been selected: one on Oued Ouerrha (S1), one on Oued Beht (S6), one on Oued R'dom (S5) and eight on Oued Sebou, distributed along about 230 km (Fig. 1). The following paper reports on the physico-chemical quality of surface waters of lower Sebou, submitted to domestic, agricultural and industrial pollution and to tidal movements. Samples were analyzed for 17 parameters following AFNOR norms; 5 were determined on site (temperature, oxygen, pH, conductivity and salt content) while the others (DBO, DCO, MES, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, Cl-, SO42-, PO42-, Ca2+, total hardness and alkalinity) were determined in the laboratory.        Temperature does not vary significantly between different stations. Suspended matters levels were mainly dependent on hydrologic sequences of the rivers (low or high waters) and showed a wide range of seasonal changes. Because of decantation, the levels decreased from upstream to downstream, but after Kenitra, they increased again, because of solid wastes from the town and of a strong bottom tidal flow that pulls out deposited solid matter.        Organic pollution is severe. Means of BOD5 vary from 19 to 76 mg/L and of COD from 39 to 180 mg/L. They can reach 135 mg/L for BOD5 and 834 mg/L for COD. The worst situation is found downstream to Sidi Allal Tazi sugar plant. For dissolved oxygen, the lowest levels were found downstream to the town of Sidi Slimane (22%) and to Sidi Allal Tazi sugar plant (38%).        Ammonium was mostly low (0-0.09 mg/L) while at downstream stations (8, 9, 10, 11) there was a small increase, as well as at S6 (downstream to Sidi Slimane town). The presence of ammonium nitrogen is usually considered as figuring an uncompleted degradation of organic matter (Rodier, 1984). Nitrites followed the variations of ammonium. Nitrates showed a wide range of variations, possibly because of strong turbulence enhancing locally the oxygenation.        In order to determine which were the main parameters that drove the ecosystem dynamics, a main components analysis was performed on the matrix given by the results of 8 campaigns at 11 sampling stations. The results are given in Table 1 and Fig. 5. It appears that tidal movements, and thus salt levels, are main factors upstream to Kenitra and downstream to Sidi Allal Tazi. The tidal phenomenon has been specifically studied (Fig. 5D and E). The confrontation of fresh and sea water in the Sebou mouth gives birth to a physical stopper which prevents polluted water from reaching the ocean and thus slows the improvement of water quality.        Oued Sebou gives a good example under Mediterranean weather conditions of a severe pollution due to hydrochemical conditions strongly influenced by municipal and industrial wastes. Most of the physico-chemical parameters are higher than the values given by Nisbet and Verneaux (1970). Moreover, downstream, tidal influence contributes to further damage water quality. Efforts should be made to reduce toxic substances release in the Gharb plain.

Thus, monitoring chemical concentrations in biota are widely and increasingly used for assessing the chemical status of aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, various scientific and regulatory aspects of bioaccumulation in aquatic systems and the relevant critical issues are discussed. Monitoring chemical concentrations in biota can be used for compliance checking with regulatory directives, for identification of chemical sources or event-related environmental risk assessment. Assessing bioaccumulation in the field is challenging since many factors have to be considered that can affect the accumulation of a chemical in an organism. Passive sampling can complement biota monitoring since samplers with standardised partition properties can be used over a wide temporal and geographical range. Bioaccumulation is also assessed for regulation of chemicals of environmental concern whereby mainly data from laboratory studies on fish bioaccumulation are used. Field data can, however, provide additional important information for regulators. Strategies for bioaccumulation assessment still need to be harmonised for different regulations and groups of chemicals. To create awareness for critical issues and to mutually benefit from technical expertise and scientific findings, communication between risk assessment and monitoring communities needs to be improved. Scientists can support the establishment of new monitoring programs for bioaccumulation, e.g. in the frame of the amended European Environmental Quality Standard Directive.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  48     Total Times Cited:  52     Cited Reference Count:  55,10.1186/s12302-014-0036-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS;TROPHIC MAGNIFICATION FACTORS;PASSIVE SAMPLING DEVICES;DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA;PRIORITY SUBSTANCES;PESTICIDES;BIPHENYLS;MERCURY;METALS;TRENDS,NA,NA,bioaccumulation in aquatic systems methodological approaches monitoring and assessment

rayyan-1227193568,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance tri-allate Issued on 26 September 2008,2009,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Tri-allate is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tri-allate in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 August 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Gowan Comercio Internacional e Servicos. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July - August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide in barley and wheat for the control of wild oat, black-grass and meadow-grass as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached endpoints.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Avadex 15G' ('Mon 7966'), a granule (GR) containing 150 g/kg tri-allate.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor residues given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant origin and in environmental matrices, however a data gap was set for a monitoring method for residues in food of animal origin.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, tri-allate was rapidly but incompletely absorbed after oral administration. It was evenly distributed and extensively metabolised, showing no potential for accumulation. According to the precautionary principle, classification of tri-allate as Xn, R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" was proposed, however acute dermal and inhalation toxicity were low. Tri-allate was not a skin or eye irritant; classification with risk phrase R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" was proposed according to the results of a Magnusson & Kligman test.        Decreased body weight and clinical signs of neurotoxicity were the most common effects found in rats, dogs and hamsters upon short-term administration. Reversible anaemia and liver toxicity were also found in these species, while the liver was the main target organ in mice. Upon long-term exposure, reduced body weight and liver toxicity were still evident, but no potential for carcinogenicity was observed in rat, mouse or hamster.        Although some in vitro tests (mainly Ames tests and a Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay) gave positive results, based on the weight of evidence, tri- allate was considered to have no genotoxic potential in vivo.        Reproduction toxicity studies reflected the same kind of effects in parents, as in short-term studies. In the two generation study, reduced pregnancy rate was associated with parental toxicity and in the developmental study in rat; decreased foetal weight and retarded ossification were linked to maternal toxicity. In rabbit an apparent increase in the incidence of fused sternebrae was observed without maternal toxicity, this finding gave rise to an intense debate by the experts, but considering the low severity of the effect, the meeting agreed not to propose a classification related to developmental toxicity for tri-allate.        No sign indicative of delayed neurotoxicity was found in acute and short-term neurotoxicity studies in hen. Clear signs of neurobehavioural toxicity were seen in an acute and a short-term neurotoxicity studies in rat. No inhibition of cholinesterase activity was detected, but a special investigation showed a strong correlation between the presence of axonal degeneration in the brain and CNS-like behavioural effects caused by tri- allate leading to a proposal for classification with Xn, R48/22 ""Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"".        A data package of studies was provided on the metabolite TCPSA(2), a major metabolite in plant and the environment, leading to the conclusion that TCPSA is not relevant for groundwater and that the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of tri-allate covers the toxicity of the metabolite.        The ADI of tri-allate was 0.025 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year rat study and applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.032 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day neurotoxicity study in rat, a safety factor of 100 and a correction factor for low oral absorption of 50 %; and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.6 mg/kg bw based on the acute neurotoxicity study in rat and applying a safety factor of 100. Dermal absorption was 12 % for the concentrate and in-use spray dilution, based on an in vivo study in monkeys. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation 'Avadex 15G', at a maximum dose rate of 2.25 kg tri-allate/ha was below the AOEL according to selected data from the Pesticide Handler's Exposure Database (PHED), considering the use of gloves during loading and application of the granules. Worker exposure was not considered relevant for the representative use of tri-allate. Estimated bystander and residential exposure resulting from the use of 'Avadex 15G' was below the AOEL.        Metabolism studies of tri-allate labelled in the allyl position were considered in the DAR which showed that residues consisted primarily of metabolites TCPSA, M14(3) and M15(4). A provisional residue definition for risk assessment of tri-allate, TCPSA and the glycoside conjugates (M14 and M15) expressed as tri-allate was proposed by the residues expert meeting. The residue definition proposed in the DAR did not include the glycoside conjugates. In addition, the expert meeting concluded the metabolism could not be finalised because there is a data gap for a wheat study of tri-allate labelled in the diisopropylamine moiety. The meeting identified this data gap to address a concern about the potential formation of nitrosamines from the diisopropylamine moiety in plants. It should be noted that in wheat grain, total metabolites were 0.008 mg/kg (5.10 % of TRR).        In radio-labelled rotational crop studies the residue was made up of tri-allate and TCPSA but it was questioned why M14 and M15 were not looked for. In addition, it was considered that, on the basis of the residue levels in radish roots (at 30 days after application) in these studies, a data gap should be identified for field studies. The primary crop residue trials data in wheat and barley presented analysis for tri-allate and TCPSA. No accurate conversion factor is available to enable levels of glycoside conjugates to be accounted for.        Residues were seen to be stable in frozen storage for up to 56 months. The need for processing studies is not currently triggered. Intakes by livestock triggered the need for animal metabolism data for ruminants. A goat metabolism study showed the majority of radioactivity was incorporated into natural compounds. The only possible compounds of significance were tri-allate and TCPSA, and the feeding studies confirmed this.        The risk assessment could not be finalised because of the inclusion of 'glycoside conjugates' in the residue definition. Additionally, the theoretical concern over the formation of nitrosamines has resulted in a data gap for a wheat metabolism study. On this basis no maximum residue levels (MRL) were proposed by the expert meeting.        The risk assessment can not be finalised because of the rotational crop issue amongst others.        Only studies with tri-allate labelled in the allylic position are available in the fate and behaviour section. The need for addressing the metabolites that may result from the diisopropylamine moiety was identified during the peer review and discussed in the PRAPeR meeting. The applicant provided a position paper to clarify this issue. This position paper made use of public scientific literature to select the input parameters for modelling and as part of the consideration for estimating the formation of nitrosamines potentially produced by water treatment. These scientific papers had not been previously submitted in the dossier. In view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to the EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. However the meeting considered that the issue needs to be addressed and therefore identified a data gap to address the potential formation of diisopropylamine(5) in soil and contamination of ground water.        Tri-allate exhibited moderate to medium persistence in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DissT(50) = 35 - 61 d); however these rates may only be considered as dissipation rates since volatilization contributed to a great extent to the losses observed. Data were reanalyzed by the applicant with ModelMaker (V.4.0.) to separate the degradation and volatilization processes. The calculated degradation rates were in the range of DT50 = 38.4 - 75.2 d.        Of the six or seven minor metabolites identified, only TCPSA (max. 3.74 % AR by HPLC and max. 7.38 % AR by TLC) was fully characterized and further addressed for environmental risk assessment. TCPSA exhibited low to moderate persistence under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C in soil.        Volatiles collected in the organic traps (max. 16.17 % AR after 120 d) of the aerobic degradation experiments were not characterized but were assumed to be tri-allate. Unextractable radioactivity amounted to max. 25.3 % AR at the end of the study (120 days after treatment). Radioactivity found in the ethanolamine trap (max. 21.2 % AR after 120 d) was assumed to be CO2. The need for further identification of potentially volatile tri-allate soil metabolites and the characterization of soil metabolites found in the available study had been identified during the peer review. The majority of experts agreed with the rapporteur Member State that it is reasonable to assume that the non-characterised radioactivity in the volatile traps is the active substance. The EU risk assessment of the representative use proposed could therefore be acceptably concluded without further regard to the characterisation of the volatiles. However some experts considered that it is necessary to confirm the complete route of degradation for national risk assessments and therefore a data gap was identified for a study to investigate the aerobic degradation in soil including identification of residues in volatile organic traps and adequate identification of soil metabolites.        Tri-allate was very highly persistent in soil under anaerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. Photolysis in soil of tri-allate is almost negligible when compared with aerobic degradation. A field dissipation study with trials at four different United Kingdom sites is available. Tri-allate exhibited low to high persistence in these trials. The rapporteur Member State assessed the studies as scientifically valid and representative of Northern European conditions. However they proposed using data obtained from laboratory degradation studies for environmental modelling for EU risk assessment due to the potential effect of volatilization on the results of these trials. The DT90's observed in some of the field dissipation studies were above 1 yr and triggered the need to assess potential of accumulation of tri-allate in soil. PEC in soil and accumulation of tri-allate in soil were estimated on the basis of the worst case field half-life of 205 d. For TCPSA the PEC in soil was estimated on basis of the maximum observed in the laboratory studies determined by TLC. Tri-allate may be considered immobile to slightly mobile in soil according the available study. Metabolite TCPSA may be considered very highly mobile in soil according to the available study.        Tri-allate was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4 and 7 at 50 degrees C, however it hydrolyses under alkaline conditions. The half-life at 25 degrees C in the aqueous pH 9 solution was 52 d. Aqueous photolysis is not expected to contribute to the environmental degradation of tri-allate on basis of the lack of UV absorption at wavelengths above 290 nm. Biodegradability studies available show that tri-allate is not readily biodegradable.        In the water sediment systems, tri-allate dissipated relatively rapidly from water by partition to the sediment and volatilization. Half-lives of tri-allate in the whole system are 52.8 - 62.0 d. No major metabolites were identified either in the water or in the sediment phases. Mineralization and unextractable residues in the sediment are practically negligible (CO2 = 1.51 - 4.35 % AR; unextractable in sediment = 2.77 - 3.26 % AR).        PECSW/SED were calculated for tri-allate and its soil metabolite TCPSA on the basis of the FOCUS SW scheme and models for the scenarios relevant to cereals in Northern EU (D1-D5, R1). Since the product is a granular formulation, the applicant proposed spray drift values for the granules based on a specific study. The approach was considered acceptable by the rapporteur Member State and reported as Step 3 calculations. Additional FOCUS Step 4 calculations included spray drift mitigation by buffer zones and run off mitigation by vegetative buffer strips. The method used to implement runoff mitigation is not agreed in the latest FOCUS Landscape and mitigation guidance document and therefore the rapporteur Member State recalculated the Step 4 FOCUS SW without run off mitigation.        Potential ground water contamination by tri-allate and its soil metabolite TCPSA was addressed by modelling calculations with FOCUS PELMO 3.3.2. The rapporteur Member State calculations resulted in 80th percentile annual average concentrations in the leachate at 1 m depth below 0.001 mu g/L for tri-allate and in the range of 0.76 - 15.42 mu g/L for metabolite TCPSA. The metabolite TCPSA has a clear potential to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L in ground water and requires assessment of its toxicological and ecotoxicological relevance including consumers risk assessment. Relevance of TCPSA was assessed during the peer review following the step-wise procedure set out in the guidance document for relevance of metabolites in ground water (see sections 2.8, 3.3 and 5.2). Tri-allate is a volatile organic compound and studies available indicate that tri-allate displays significant volatilisation from soil surfaces. However on the basis of the atmospheric half-life calculated (DT50 = 3.8 h), it is considered unlikely that tri-allate may be subjected to long-range transport.        The first tier risk assessment for direct consumption of granules results in values above the trigger values, indicating low acute, short-term and long-term risk for small seed-eating birds and mammals. The risk to grazing birds and mammals from consumption of residues of tri-allate in the young cereal shoots was estimated using the residues data presented in the DAR. The acute, short-term and long-term TER estimated for birds and the acute and long-term TER values estimated for mammals were above the Annex VI trigger values, indicating a low risk for birds and mammals.        Potential for bioaccumulation was considered since tri-allate has a log P-ow of 4.06. The first tier TER values estimated for earthworm-eating birds was above the Annex VI trigger value, however the TER value for earthworm-eating mammals was below the Annex VI trigger value. After a refinement process the risk to earthworm-eating mammals was considered as low. The first tier TER values for fish-eating birds and mammals were 7 and 1.9, respectively, indicating a low risk for fish-eating birds. A potential high risk for fish-eating mammals was identified. A data gap was identified by the EFSA after the PRAPeR 48 meeting to ask to the applicant to submit a new refinement of the potential high risk for fish-eating mammals.        Based on the available studies, tri-allate was considered very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute and chronic TER values based on the used of PECSW from FOCUS step 4 with a 10 m non spray buffer zone were above the Annex VI trigger values. Risk mitigation measures similar to 10 m non spray buffer zone are needed in Member States. The risk of the TCPSA metabolite for aquatic organisms is low.        Since tri-allate has a log P-ow of 4.06 the potential for bioconcentration should be considered. The BCF = 1400 was derived from a study with Lepomis macrochirus. The EFSA noted after the meeting that tri-allate has a BCF > 1000 and a field soil DT90 > 100 days. For these reasons the EFSA identified a data gap to assess the potential for biomagnification of tri-allate through aquatic food chains.        A low acute risk was identified for earthworms. The long-term risk to earthworms needs further refinement. It is proposed by the rapporteur Member State in the DAR that further information is required on the long-term risk to earthworms. Further information is required to fully address the potential risk of tri-allate to other non-target macro-organisms. A data gap was proposed for the submission of a litter bag study.        Risk mitigation such as an in-field no spray buffer zone of 10 m was considered necessary for the non-target plants.        The risk was considered to be low to bees, non-target arthropods, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment.

The crude extract was tested against various bacterial and fungal pathogens, and its protein content and profile were analyzed. Purification steps, including gel filtration chromatography, were employed to isolate the most active fraction (peak IV), which was further identified via liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. The results revealed varying degrees of antimicrobial activity of the crude extract against different bacterial and fungal strains, with Leclercia adecarboxylata, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis showing the highest susceptibility. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated the existence of multiple low molecular weight protein bands in the crude extract, while fraction IV obtained from gel filtration chromatography exhibited the strongest antimicrobial activity. Peak IV displayed a range of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values against the tested pathogens, spanning from 0.038 to 4.960 mg/mL. Further investigation identified the purified peptide derived from peak IV as G-type lysozyme 2, characterized by a molecular weight of 21 kDa. These findings shed light on the existence of a highly effective antimicrobial peptide, G-type lysozyme 2, within the mucus of Cyprinus carpio.

Sequences of MCSF have been identified in multiple teleost species, however, the functional investigations of MCSF were documented in only a few species. In this study, we examined the biological activity and the immunomodulatory property of a MCSF homologue, PoMCSF, from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Structural analysis showed that PoMCSF possesses conserved structural characteristics of MCSF proteins, including a signal peptide, a CSF-1 domain, and a transmembrane region closed to the C-terminal. Under normal physiological condition, PoMCSF expression distributes in all the examined tissues, the highest three tissues are blood, muscle, and head kidney. When infected by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and viral pathogen, the PoMCSF expression patterns vary with different types of microbial pathogens infection and different immune tissues. In vitro experiment showed recombinant PoMCSF promoted the activity of macrophage. In vivo experiment indicated that PoMCSF overexpression boosted the defensive ability of flounder against Edwardsiella piscicida, a severe fish pathogen that infects multiple species of economically important fish, and regulated the expression of multiple immune-related genes. To explore the relationship between PoMCSF and its receptor PoMCSFR, anti-PoMCSFR antibody was prepared and PoMCSFR knockdown was conducted. The neutralization assay showed that when PoMCSFR was neutralized by its antibody, the role of PoMCSF on host defense against E. piscicida was weakened. Knockdown of PoMCSFR impaired the phagocytic capacity of macrophages.

It induces neurotoxicity by inhibiting acetyl cholinesterase enzyme and elevating oxidative stress. Curcumin, dietary polyphenol, well known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which could elicit protective effect against monocrotophos induced neurobehavioural abnormalities. Therefore this study is aimed to investigate ameliorative effect of curcumin loaded Nanoparticles on monocrotophos induced neurotoxicity.        Curcumin loaded PLGA nanoformulation was prepared using nanoprecipitation technique and was characterized using zeta sizer, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. For in-vivo study, 30 male rats were utilized. Exposure of monocrotophos was done at 2 mg/kg (p.o.) for 28 days. Curcumin bulk and cucurmin loaded Nanoparticles were administered with or without monocrotophos. Effect of monocrotophos exposure on behavioural changes was assessed by analysing spontaneous locomotor activity, motor coordination in rotarod WA and contextual fear memory in passive shock avoidance paradigm. Effect on biochemical alteration in blood and brain were estimated.        The average particle size of Curcumin loaded Nanoparticles was 114.9 nm and in-vitro release study suggested suitable release of Curcumin in simulated intestinal fluid. Results of in-vivo study indicated, monocrotophos exposure caused a significant increase in reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and intracellular free calcium levels along with altered behavioural abnormalities in locomotor activity, motor coordination, learning and memory. Decline in antioxidant defence level might suggest reduced host defence response. Treatment with curcumin alone did not significantly reversed monocrotophos induced neurotoxicity in rats. Whilst, treatment with curcumin loaded nanoparticles significantly reduced monocrotophos induced behavioural and biochemical alteration in rat brain.

These sources of contamination are numerous and include herbicides, which represent a large group of toxic chemicals. Quinclorac, an herbicide widely applied in agriculture, induces oxidative stress due to free radical generation and changes in the antioxidant defense system. The aim of this study was to assess if dietary diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)(2) has a protective effect in tissues of fish species Cyprinus carpio exposed to the quinclorac herbicide. The fish were fed with either a standard or a diet containing 3.0 mg/Kg of diphenyl diselenide for 60 d. After were exposed to 1 mg/L of Facet (quinclorac commercial formulation) for 192 h. At the end of the experimental period, parameters as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels (TBARS), protein carbonyl, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), nonprotein thiols (NPSH) and ascorbic acid in the liver, gills, brain and muscle were evaluated in Cyprinus carpio. In fish exposed to quinclorac and feeding with standard diet TBARS levels increased in liver and gills. However, SOD activity decreases in liver whereas no alterations were observed in catalase activity in this tissue. Quinclorac also decrease GST activity in liver and brain, NPSH in brain and muscle and ascorbic acid in muscle. Concerning protein carbonyl exposed to herbicide the fish did not show any alterations. The diphenyl diselenide supplemented diet reversed these effects, preventing increases in TBARS levels in liver and gills. CST activity was recovered to control values in liver. NPSH levels in brain and muscle increased remain near to control values. These results indicated that dietary diphenyl diselenide protects tissues against quinclorac induced oxidative stress ameliorating the antioxidant properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

DESIGN: Early developmental stages of fish, from embryo to larvae, were exposed to terbuthylazine at concentrations of 0.9, 160, 520, and 820 mu g L-1, and metribuzin at concentrations of 0.9, 4, 14, and 32 mg L-1 for 30 days and compared to the non-treated control group. For assessment of free radical defence the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured; the lipid peroxidation (TBARS) level was determined as a marker of free radical damage.        RESULTS: Terbuthylazine had no significant effect (p>0.05) at any tested concentrations on GST activity. Terbuthylazine caused an increase (p<0.05) in GR activity at the concentration of 520 mu g L-1. We found a non-significant (p>0.05) effect of terbuthylazine exposure on TBARS level.        In metribuzin treated groups, the activity of GST was increased (p<0.05) in all experimental groups, with the highest at the concentration of 32 mg L-1. GR activity was increased in the 0.9, 4, and 14 mg L-1 groups and the TBARS levels were the highest in the 0.9 mg L-1 group.        CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that terbuthylazine and metribuzin induced oxidative stress in embryo-larval stages of common carp.

In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by Ireland, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of fluquinconazole in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC.        Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of fluquinconazole in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant BASF Aktiengesellschaft made a resubmission application for the inclusion of fluquinconazole in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR and during the PRAPeR expert meetings.        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Ireland being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 13 April 2010.        In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 26 April 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 9 June 2010.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on fluquinconazole.        The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use of fluquinconazole as a fungicide on wheat, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative use can be found in Appendix A to this report.        A data gap was identified in the section analytical methods.        A conclusion on whether the batches used in the key toxicological studies cover the technical specification cannot be drawn from the available information, leading to a critical area of concern and a data gap. Further data gaps were identified on the relevance of the impurities present in the technical specification and for toxicological information on the triazole derivative plant metabolites (1,2,4-triazole, triazolyl alanine and triazolyl acetic acid).        The consumer exposure assessment was not finalised. Data gaps are identified in the residue section to provide fluquinconazole supervised residue trials on wheat for southern Europe to complete the residue database and to address the contribution of the potential residues of metabolite dione in rotational crops and also the contribution of the Triazole Derivate Metabolites (TDMs) present in primary crops, processed products, rotational crops and ruminant matrices to the overall consumer exposure.        The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative use assessed. The potential for groundwater contamination above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L from this use was assessed as low for fluquinconazole and its breakdown product 1,2,4-triazole. For the relevant breakdown product dione, contamination of groundwater might be expected in vulnerable situations as represented by the Hamburg, Kremsmanster, Okehampton and Piacenza FOCUS scenarios (FOCUS annual average recharge concentrations leaving the top 1m soil layer were estimated to be 0.283 to 0.615 mu g/L). Concentrations of this breakdown product were < 0.1 mu g/L at the remaining 5 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Fluquinconazole that enters the atmosphere by the formation of aerosols at the time of spraying may be subject to long range atmospheric transport to remote areas, as it has an atmospheric half-life estimated at longer than 2 days.        The acute risk to insectivorous mammals (i. e. wood mouse) needs to be further addressed. A high long-term risk to insectivorous and herbivorous birds and mammals was indicated for the representative use, therefore a data gap and a critical area of concern was identified. A low risk to aquatic organisms was assessed. The potential for endocrine disruptive effects on fish were considered calculating the TER based on the ELS endpoint with an assessment factor of 50. However, a data gap was identified to submit the finalised FFLC study. The risk was considered low for bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil-macro and micro-organisms, non-target plants and methods for sewage treatment plants.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  15,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2096     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Fluquinconazole;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;fungicide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fluquinconazole
rayyan-1227193589,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bromuconazole European Food Safety Authority,2010,8,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,8,8,,European Food Safety Authority,,English,,"European Food Safety Author, Parma, Italy","Bromuconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bromuconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 14 November 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 5 May 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience (later Sumitomo Chemical Agro Europe SAS). Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed during a written procedure in February - March 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in July and October 2007.        A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 26 March 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 136).        Following the Commission Decision of 3 November 2008 (2008/832/EC)4 concerning the non-inclusion of bromuconazole in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Sumitomo Chemical Agro Europe S.A. made a resubmission application for the inclusion of bromuconazole in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(5). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report (SANCO/120/08) as follows:        the potential for contamination of surface water and groundwater;        the high toxicity to aquatic organisms.        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Belgium, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on bromuconazole in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 8 October 2009.        In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 20 October 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 7 December 2009.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the area of ecotoxicology and to deliver its conclusions on bromuconazole.        The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a fungicide on wheat. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the same representative use. Full details of the representative use can be found in Appendix A to this report.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, Granit 200 SC."", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC).        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of bromuconazole. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        In mammals, bromuconazole oral LD50 is 328 mg/kg bw (classification as, harmful if swallowed. (Xn; R22), proposed). The acute toxicity by the dermal and inhalation routes is low (LD50>2000 mg/kg bw and LC50 > 5 mg/L). Bromuconazole is neither a skin nor an eye irritant. It is not a skin sensitiser. In repeated dose toxicity studies, the liver is the target organ. In subchronic tests, the dog is the most sensitive species, with an overall relevant NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kg bw/day, whereas in rat the NOAEL is 13.8 mg/kg bw/day. In genotoxicity testing there was some indication of weak clastogenicity in vitro, however there was no indication of positive results in vivo, neither in the micronucleus assay nor in the UDS assay. Overall, bromuconazole was considered devoid of genotoxic potential.        The relevant NOAEL for long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity in rat is 0.88 mg/kg bw/day: treatment-related neoplastic lesions in rodents occurred at high doses: hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinomas in rats and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. In both rats and mice, the tumours were likely caused by liver toxicity and subsequent cell renewal. Overall, it was agreed that bromuconazole does not have carcinogenic potential relevant to humans. Bromuconazole did not show any reproductive toxicity potential: parental and foetal toxicity NOAELs were established at 1.3 mg/kg bw/day, while the reproductive NOAEL was established at 141 mg/kg bw/day. As for developmental toxicity, in the rat the relevant maternal NOAEL is 70 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the developmental NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day, based on a dose-dependent increase of placental weight and ossification delays or supernumerary bones in a number of skeletal structures. It was agreed to propose classification Cat 3, Xn; R63,, May cause harm to unborn child.. The ADI of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day was set based on the relevant long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity NOAEL of 0.88 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study, applying a safety factor (SF) of 100. For the ARfD, the value is based on the developmental NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day from the rat study, with a SF of 100, leading to an ARfD of 0.1 mg/kg bw. The AOEL of 0.025 mg/kg bw/day was set on basis of the NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day dog study (applying a standard SF of 100). The operator exposure assessment showed exposure levels below the AOEL (15.6%) according to the German model with the use of gloves during mixing/loading and application, and coveralls and sturdy footwear during application. The estimated exposure for re-entry activities (scouting) is 4.5% of the AOEL. The bystander exposure is estimated to be 1.6% of the AOEL.        The metabolism of bromuconazole was investigated in wheat. Additional metabolism data were submitted for the category of fruit crops. A metabolic pathway could be established in cereals. At harvest, bromuconazole was still a major part of the terminal residue in cereal matrices, and identified metabolites were individually below 10% of the total residue. However, there was an indication of preferential metabolism of one bromuconazole diastereomer (LS 850647), as a significant shift in the ratio of diastereomers was found in the residues determined in the mature cereal crop when compared to the ratio in the initially applied bromuconazole. Whether the ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer was subject to any shift was not investigated. In rotational crops studies there was uptake of residues from soil into succeeding cereal, oilseed, root and leafy crops. Upon analysis of the residues the two bromuconazole diastereomers were identified as major residue, and similar to the primary cereal metabolism their ratio had been shifted compared to the one in the bromuconazole applied to the soil. No information is available on the ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer.        The submitted livestock metabolism data in ruminants and poultry allows to establish a metabolic pathway, and suggests that no residues in food of animal origin above the limit of quantification are expected when cereals treated according to the cGAP are used in livestock diet. The data imply that there might be preferential metabolism of one diastereomer also in livestock animals. The ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer was not investigated. As plant and livestock residue data indicate that from the representative use no significant consumer exposure to bromuconazole residues is expected, the observed shift of the isomer ratio in the terminal residue is currently not a concern with regard to consumer safety. This may have to be reconsidered when authorisation of uses is sought that lead to consumer exposure to bromuconazole residues above the limit of quantification. The meeting of experts noted that all studies were performed using phenyl-labelled bromuconazole only, and thus the fate of the triazole moiety of the molecule was not investigated. The experts agreed that, based on the available data and information, cleavage of the molecule cannot be excluded and further investigation of the triazole moiety of the molecule is required to address consumer exposure to potential metabolites originating from molecule breakdown, as e.g. triazole derivative metabolites. Until then, the plant and animal residue definition is provisional. Triazole derivative metabolites are considered of concern due to their toxicological profile. In the absence of data investigating the fate of the triazole moiety of the bromuconzole molecule and the magnitude of potentially occurring metabolites originating from the triazole moiety, the consumer exposure cannot be assessed and consequently the consumer risk assessment is not finalised. As a breakdown of the bromuconazole molecule leading to the occurrence of metabolites relevant to consumer safety cannot be excluded, the issue is regarded as a critical area of concern.        In soil under aerobic conditions bromuconazole exhibits moderate to very high persistence forming several minor (< 10% AR) metabolites. Mineralisation was limited accounting for only 1-4.4% AR after 100-120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 5-17.6 % AR after 100-120 days. A laboratory soil photolysis study indicated that photolysis may contribute to the degradation of bromuconazole at the soil surface. As a consequence, the experts agreed that the available field dissipation rates did not represent biodegradation that can be used as input to FOCUS modelling. However, following the resubmission application, field degradation rates normalised to FOCUS reference conditions that excluded photolysis losses were estimated. These estimates are considered appropriate for use as input to FOCUS modelling. Bromuconazole exhibits medium to low mobility in soil. Bromuconazole is essentially stable to hydrolysis, and photolysis is not expected to be a significant process in the breakdown of bromuconazole in natural aquatic systems. In dark natural sediment water systems bromuconazole partitioned from the water column to sediment where it exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 0.9 % AR at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a sink but represented maximum 15% AR at study end. Satisfactory FOCUS surface water exposure estimates were available for use in the EU level aquatic risk assessment, with spray drift and run-off mitigation being accounted for in step 4 calculations. The potential for groundwater contamination resulting from the representative use assessed, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic conditions represented by all 9 pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        Bromuconazole belongs to the group of triazole fungicides that are suspected to have potential endocrine disrupting properties. No information was provided to address this point with regard to the potential effects on birds and fish, and a data gap was identified. No new information on this point was provided in the Additional Report and the data gap remains.        The TER values for herbivorous birds were all above the Annex VI triggers, indicating a low risk for herbivorous birds. Also for insectivorous birds the TER values for acute and short-term exposure were well above the trigger, however the long-term TER was below the trigger of 5, indicating a potential high long-term risk. In the Additional Report higher tier studies (mainly from open literature) were presented to select the focal species and to determine the proportion of different food types (PD) of the focal species. Two different approaches were used to refine the risk assessment. The first approach included the selection of representative focal species, and estimations of PD for these species. The second approach was to include the decline of residues in insects (f(twa) = 0.53) in the first-tier long-term risk assessment. The TERlt values based on the PD refinements, and those based on the use of ftwa of decline of residues in insects, were all above the Annex VI trigger values. Therefore the long-term risk to insectivorous birds was assessed as low. The risk to earthworm- and fish-eating birds was assessed as low.        The acute TERs for herbivorous and insectivorous mammals were above the Annex VI trigger of 10 (including refinement of residues in plant material), however the long-term TERs were below the Annex VI trigger, indicating a high risk. The choice of the long-term end point was discussed again in the experts. meeting (PRAPeR 75), and it was agreed that the NOAEL for mammals of 13.8 mg as/kg bw/d is the relevant ecotoxicological end point. TER calculations for insectivorous mammals based on this NOAEL are provided in the DAR and in the Additional Report and were above the Annex VI trigger value, indicating a low long-term risk for insectivorous mammals. In the resubmission, a higher tier risk assessment for herbivorous mammals was based on the rabbit as focal species in late cereal growth stages. The higher tier risk assessment for herbivorous mammals was discussed in the experts. meeting (PRAPeR 75), and it was concluded that the available information is not sufficient to address the potential high long-term risk for herbivorous mammals. The risk to earthworm- and fish-eating mammals was assessed as low.        Bromuconazole is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The applicant provided a bridging study with the new formulation SCAE0307 and Daphnia magna. The formulation SCAE0307 is less toxic than the previously assessed formulation EXP 10064-B, and has a toxicity comparable to that of the active substance. Member States experts at PRAPeR 75 agreed that the end points for the active substance should be used in the risk assessment. A low long-term risk was identified from the FOCUS step3 PECsw values in the D3 ditch, D4 pond, D4 stream, D5 pond, D5 stream, D6 pond, R1 pond and R1 stream scenarios. However, a potential high long-term risk was indicated for aquatic invertebrates from the FOCUS step3 PECsw values for the D1 ditch, D1 stream, D2 ditch, D2 stream, R3 stream and R4 stream scenarios, and further refinement was needed. The TERs were re-calculated with a 10m no-spray buffer zone for the drainage scenarios and a 10m no-spray buffer zone including a vegetated filter strip to mitigate the run-off. The long-term TER values were above 10 in 2 full FOCUS run-off scenarios (R3 stream and R4 stream). However, the TER values estimated with the drainage scenarios D1 ditch, D1 stream, D2 ditch, D2 stream were below the Annex VI trigger values even with a 10m no-spray buffer zone. Overall, taking into account the FOCUS step 3 and 4 scenarios, it can be concluded that the risk of bromuconazole to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for more than the half of the scenarios.        The risk assessment for non-target arthropods was not in accordance with the ESCORT II scheme. The standard glass plate tests suggest that there will be some adverse effects on sensitive non-target arthropods. Extended laboratory studies gave an indication that the risk to non-target arthropods is low. Concerns were raised with regard to the comparability of the different formulations used in the studies with non-target arthropods. EFSA agrees to the assessment of the RMS that the formulations are sufficiently similar to conclude on the risk to non-target arthropods for the representative use. The applicant informed that a different formulation than Granit will be marketed. It is suggested that a risk assessment for this formulation is conducted at Member State level after the decision on Annex I inclusion.        The formulation Granit had no significant effect on organic matter decomposition over a six months period in a litter bag test at an application rate of 180 g a.s./ha and 500 g a.s./ha. The soil concentration was calculated in the DAR as 0.67 mg a.s./ha. This concentration covers the plateau maximum PECsoil of 0.232 mg a.s./kg soil (2 x 0.200 kg a.s./ha). In conclusion, the risk of bromuconazole to non-target macro-organisms was assessed as low.        Effects of > 25% on nitrogen transformation were observed at an application rate of 400 g a.s./ha (0.53 mg a.s./kg soil). This concentration covers the plateau maximum PECsoil of 0.232 mg a.s./kg soil (2 x 0.200 kg a.s./ha). The risk of bromuconazole to soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed as low.        The risk to bees, earthworms, non-target plants, and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  9,10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1704     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Bromuconazole;peer review;risk assessment;pesticide;fungicide;Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,NA,conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bromuconazole european food safety authority

Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2006 and January 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with Member States in April 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on rice for the control of Echinochloa crus-galli, sedges and broad leaf weeds as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ` penoxsulam DE-638' (GF-657), an oil dispersion (OD) containing 20.4 g/l of penoxsulam.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant origin and for environmental matrices.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, penoxsulam was rapidly and almost completely absorbed upon oral administration. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation. Excretion was rapid, but dose and sex dependent as excretion was primarily observed via faeces in males and primarily excreted in urine in females. Penoxsulam was bio-transformed to a large number of metabolites; however the majority of the radioactivity was eliminated as unchanged parent compound. Plant and environmental metabolites BST4 and BSTCA5 were not identified in the rat metabolism studies. Toxicological information was lacking on the metabolite BSTCA to conclude on its relevance as a plant metabolite, moreover, it cannot be ruled out that BSTCA is also relevant according to the guidance document on the relevance of metabolites in groundwater.        The acute toxicity of penoxsulam was low by the oral, dermal and inhalation route; slight skin and eye irritation were observed, but no potential for skin sensitisation. The dog was found to be the most sensitive species with the kidneys as the main target organ; the overall short-term NOAEL in dogs was 18 mg/kg bw/day. Long-term toxicity reflected the same target organ observed in the short-term studies: the liver in mice and the kidneys in rats. The relevant long-term NOAEL was the dose level of 5 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study. No potential for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed. No effect was seen on the reproductive performance and parameters; no developmental effect was observed either in rats. In rabbits, a slight increase in resorption rate parameters was associated with maternal toxicity, evidenced by gastro-intestinal upset and decreased body weight gain during the middle gestation.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of penoxsulam was 0.05 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL from the 2-year rat study and applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.18 mg/kg bw/day based on the short-term dog studies and a safety factor of 100, no correction factor was needed to account for enteral resorption; no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 10% for both the concentrate and in-use spray dilution of the representative formulation. The level of operator exposure for a maximum application rate of 0.04 kg penoxsulam/ha in rice was below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) according to both the German7 and the UK POEM8 models. Worker and bystander exposure were considered negligible.        A metabolism study in rice demonstrated that following foliar application of penoxsulam the total residues decreased rapidly to insignificant levels present at harvest of the crop. Therefore, the residue definition in rice grain was proposed as penoxsulam by default.        In supervised residue trials penoxsulam was found to be always below the Limit of Quantification of 0.01 mg/kg in rice grain, while in rice straw residues ranged up to 0.08 mg/kg. Consequently, an MRL for grain was proposed at 0.01 mg/kg, which is the lowest validated level of the analytical method. For straw an MRL is not required.        Rice may be grown in monoculture but also in rotation with other crops. A submitted confined crop rotation study showed that after a plant back interval of 90 days low residues could still be found in some crops. Other plant back intervals were not investigated. Moreover, a metabolite BSTCA, identified at significant levels in rotated crops, was neither found in primary crop metabolism nor in rat metabolism. The toxicological relevance of this metabolite for consumer risk assessment could not be addressed. As rotation practices in Member States seem to differ and the submitted data on rotational crops were limited, a final conclusion on the relevance of residues in rotated crops other than cereals could not be reached. Hence the experts agreed that further elaboration on the issue is required. A data requirement for further rotational crop data is proposed.        If only the scenarios of rice grown in monoculture and of rice rotated with other cereals are considered it can be concluded that exposure to livestock is not expected to be significant. Under these conditions, on the basis of the submitted animal metabolism studies, residues in food of animal origin are expected to occur at extremely low levels that would not be appropriate for monitoring. The experts therefore agreed that, for the time being, it would not be necessary to propose a residue definition and MRLs for food of animal origin. However, it should be noted that the assessment is not finalised with regard to potential livestock exposure to residues in rotational crops other than cereals.        Consumer exposure to residues of penoxsulam in rice grain is insignificant and thus in a chronic risk assessment intakes were well below to ADI. No acute assessment was conducted as an ARfD was not allocated. However, the consumer risk assessment cannot be finalised with regard to residues of metabolite BSTCA since a lack of sufficient occurrence data and toxicological data was identified. As BSTCA may also occur in drinking water derived from ground water at a level > 0.1 mu g/L, total consumer exposure to BSTCA has to be assessed in order to conclude on the consumer risk assessment.        Based on the available environmental fate and behaviour studies in soil and 2 field studies in rice paddies, penoxsulam and the breakdown products 5-OH-penoxsulam (max 40.5% applied radioactivity (AR) in soil) and BSTCA (max 53% AR in soil), were concluded as requiring environmental exposure assessments. In a sterilised laboratory aqueous photolysis study TPSA, 2amino-TP and 5-OH-2-amino-TP12 were major metabolites but it was concluded that these did not need to be assessed, as though sought, they were not detected in relevant field studies in rice paddies. Penoxsulam and 5-OH-penoxsulam were characterised as exhibiting moderate persistence in soil with BSTCA exhibiting medium to high persistence. Additionally in aerobic natural sediment water systems the metabolites PCA-5-OH and OH-BSTCA were formed at up to 16% AR (sum of both compounds) in sediment, so exposure assessments were necessary for these metabolites and are available.        In the aerobic laboratory incubations mineralisation of both the phenyl and the 2-triazolopyrimidine rings to carbon dioxide was low accounting for only 0.3-2.4 % AR after 99 to 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 10-16 % AR in aerobic soil (same radiolabels) after 120 days and 21-58 % AR in aerobic natural sediment water studies after 99 days. Penoxsulam was characterised as exhibiting high to medium mobility, 5-OH-penoxsulam high mobility and BSTCA very high to medium mobility. Further details are necessary regarding a refined higher tier surface water exposure assessment that included definitions of novel scenarios, not prescribed by EU MED-Rice (2003) guidance15. It can be concluded that the potential for penoxsulam or its metabolite 5-OH-penoxsulam to contaminate vulnerable groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L from the applied for intended uses is low. For the metabolite BSTCA the potential to contaminate vulnerable groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is low in situations represented by the MED-Rice clay scenario. However in situations represented by the MED-Rice sand scenario, BSTCA may be present in vulnerable groundwater at > 0. 1 mu g/L (calculations indicate concentrations up to 0.23 mu g/L). Therefore a non-relevance assessment for BSTCA was triggered.        In the risk assessment for birds, species representing insectivorous birds (wren), omnivorous birds eating large aquatic insects (mallard), omnivorous birds eating aquatic plants (mallard), large herbivorous birds (geese) and piscivorous birds (heron) were considered. All TER values were well above the relevant Annex VI trigger indicating a low risk to birds from the use of penoxsulam in rice paddies. Water vole (small herbivorous mammal), water shrew (eating aquatic invertebrates) and otter (eating fish and amphibians) were selected as focal species for the "" in-field"" risk assessment for mammals. The lowest TER obtained was 25 for the long-term risk to water vole. Since this was above the relevant Annex VI trigger a low risk was concluded. For both birds and mammals the exposure from intake of contaminated paddy water was included in the estimation of the daily dose by simply adding the drinking water dose to the dietary dose. The log P-ow for penoxsulam is <3 and also the surface water metabolites were considered to have a log P-ow<3, hence the potential for bioaccumulation and secondary poisoning was considered as low.        Penoxsulam was classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The first tier risk assessment for algae and aquatic plants, based on PECsw in the ""off-field"" area, gave TERs of 46 and 2.9, respectively. An assessment was provided for fish and aquatic invertebrates in paddy water. No assessment was provided for algae or higher plants in paddy water, considering the herbicidal activity of penoxsulam.        The lowest acute TER value was 202, which was obtained for Daphnia using the EC50 for the formulation. The lowest long-term TER was 83. It was concluded that the first tier risk to aquatic plants in the ""off-field"" area was high. Refinements based on a higher tier study with Lemna were not accepted in the peer review, and the risk to aquatic plants remains to be addressed. The risk to aquatic organisms from metabolites was addressed, as was the risk from bioaccumulation (log P-ow<3). The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil micro-organisms and non-target plants was assessed as low.

rayyan-1227193591,Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance trifluralin,2009,8,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,8,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Trifluralin is one of the 52 substances of the second stage covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on trifluralin in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 11 July 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 24 July 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier, the European Union Trifluralin Taskforce comprising of Agan Chemical Manufacturers Ltd. and Dintec Agroquimica Produtos Quimicos Lda. at the time of finalisation of the conclusion. Subsequently, the comments received were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 15 January 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April, May and June 2004 (round 1-2 of the EPCO expert meetings).        A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 10 February 2005 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 14 March 2005 (EFSA Scientific Report (2005) 28)        Following the Commission Decision of 20 September 2007 (2007/629/EC) 4 concerning the non-inclusion of trifluralin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant, the European Union Trifluralin Taskforce made a resubmission application for the inclusion of trifluralin in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the European Commission review report as follows:        the high toxicity to aquatic organisms, in particular fish        the high potential for bioaccumulation        the high persistence in soil        the potential for long- range transport via air        In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Greece, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on trifluralin in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 19 January 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 22 January 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 3 March 2009. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table.        In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 24 April 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days.        The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS' evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific meetings and a telephone conference with Member State experts in May 2009.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been reissued to update the risk assessment in the areas of residues, environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology.        The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprised spraying to bare soil to control grass and broad-leaved weeds in oilseed rape, sunflower, cotton and winter cereals at application rate up to 1.2 kg trifluralin per hectare. The use on winter cereals was no longer supported in the resubmission application, and therefore the conclusion has only been updated in relation to the risk assessment for the representative uses presented in the Additional Report, i.e. use only on oilseed rape, sunflower and cotton at an application rate of up to 1.2 kg trifluralin per hectare. The risk assessment presented for winter cereals has not been updated.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'EF-1521' ('Treflan'), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe. For the uses on oilseed rape, sunflower and cotton, incorporation into soil takes place after the application. Trifluralin can be used only as a pre-sowing/pre-emergence herbicide.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, trifluralin is extensively and rapidly metabolised. Within 48 hours, 82 % is absorbed and more than 90 % is excreted within 168 hours mainly via bile. It has a low acute toxicity, but displayed sensitising properties and should be labelled with Xi; R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". The relevant oral no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the short-term studies was 2.4 mg/kg bw/day in the 1-year dog study, based on increased liver weight and some minor changes in the chemistry. The dermal and inhalation toxicity after subchronic exposure was low.        Regarding genotoxic properties of trifluralin it was concluded that trifluralin induces weak clastogenic and aneugenic effects in a number of in vivo and in vitro studies, but this was not confirmed in a more reliable micronucleus test. Trifluralin induced neoplastic changes and carcinogenic effects such as Leydig cell tumours, thyroid tumours, urinary bladder tumours and renal carcinoma in rats. Since no NOAEL could be established, the lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 30 mg/kg bw/day in the rat is assigned as the most relevant effect level. The following risk phrase is proposed Xn; R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"".        There were no direct effects on reproductive performance or fertility observed, and the relevant NOAEL for reproduction was set to 4.5-5.8 mg/kg bw/day in the rat based on haematological changes, decreased maternal body weight during gestation and decreased offspring growth and survival, respectively. Trifluralin did not induce teratogenic or fetotoxic effects at non-maternally toxic doses. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 50 mg/kg bw/day in the rabbit based on decreased foetal weight, post implantation losses and reduced body weight, food consumption, respectively.        The proposed acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the LOAEL in the rat carcinogenicity study with a margin of safety between LOAEL and ADI of 2000, since the ADI is based on a LOAEL value instead of a NOAEL value and that at this dose level tumour formation was evident.        The proposed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.026 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL in the 90-day mechanistic study in rats using a safety factor of 100. No correction for oral absorption is required.        No acute reference dose (ArfD) is allocated.        The outcome of the risk assessment for the plant protection product 'EF-1521' ('Treflan'), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 480 g trifluralin/L showed that the estimated operator exposure levels (according to German model) were below the AOEL only if personal protective equipment (PPE) are used both during mixing/loading (gloves) and application (gloves and coverall). The calculated exposure levels for bystanders were also below the established AOEL. The value of dermal absorption is 10 % for the concentrate and the diluted formulation. There was no need for estimating the worker exposure, since trifluralin is a pre-emergence herbicide applied directly to soil.        The metabolism of trifluralin was investigated in cereals (maize) and oilseed crops (rapeseed, soybean and cotton). In maize, trifluralin was extensively metabolised and residues were shown to consist of numerous compounds, with few being identified due to their low levels.        The uptake was also limited in rapeseed with low radioactive residues at harvest. No parent trifluralin was detected in mature seeds and mature plant samples; the major compound identified (ca 35% of the total radioactive residue) was the metabolite TR-145, mainly as conjugate. However, and considering its absolute low level, the PRAPeR 70 meeting of experts on residues agreed not to include this metabolite in the residue definitions. Finally, it was concluded that the residue definitions for risk assessment and monitoring initially proposed by the EPCO 05 meeting of experts for cereals and limited to the parent trifluralin only, are also applicable to the oilseed crops.        No residues of trifluralin above the limit of quantification (LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg) were detected in any of the grain samples collected in the supervised trials conducted on rapeseed, sunflower and cotton according to the critical GAP in Northern and Southern Europe.        Processing studies were not submitted and were considered not necessary. Livestock studies were not assessed in the framework of the resubmission since no significant residues are expected in oilseed commodities at harvest.        The chronic dietary exposure assessment for consumers based on the EFSA PRIMo rev2 and the proposed maximum residue limits (MRLs) of 0.01* mg/kg for rapeseed, sunflower and cotton leads to estimated intakes less than 0.1% of the proposed ADI for all the European diets included in the model. No ARfD was allocated, thus, no acute risk calculation was performed for trifluralin.        In aerobic conditions degradation of trifluralin in soil did not lead to any major metabolite. Under flooded anaerobic conditions a major metabolite TR-46 is formed. Furthermore, metabolite TR-14 was formed at amounts above 5 % at the end of the study in all three anaerobic soils tested. Due to its potential degradation under aerobic conditions, TR-4 may be addressed by Member States where anaerobic conditions are envisaged to be relevant. Whereas not discussed in particular during the peer review, it is EFSA's opinion that the same conclusion may be reached for metabolite TR-14.        Under aerobic laboratory conditions trifluralin is medium to highly persistent with half- lives between 81 to 356 days at 22 degrees C. The degradation under anaerobic conditions was faster than under aerobic conditions. Data indicate that trifluralin is strongly adsorbed to soil and could be classified as immobile. Trifluralin is hydrolytically stable under environmentally relevant conditions. Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of trifluralin producing metabolites TR-67 and TR-158. Trifluralin is not readily biodegradable. During the peer review, it was agreed that worst case DT50 = 13 days should be employed for the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion, and that a DT50 = 2 days could be used to refine the risk assessment when appropriate. Due to the potential contribution of photolysis to the dissipation of trifluralin in water, the fate and behaviour in the environment EPCO 02 expert meeting confirmed the need of a water sediment study, conducted in the presence of light, that could be used by Member States to refine the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion. In the resubmission dossier new PEC SW/SED values based on step 3 and step 4 FOCUS SW were provided for trifluralin. In spite of the drawbacks of the calculations available, the PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts concluded that the maximum PECSW and PECSED at step 3 would result from a loading to the water body driven by drift, and a reliable risk assessment would be obtained if this maximum value is used for the risk assessment. However, if information on the pattern of exposure at step 3 or step 4 calculations are needed for the assessment, then the calculations available would be not acceptable and/or would be insufficient to finalize the risk assessment. The PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts identified a data gap for FOCUS SW calculations that provide the information needed to finalize the EU risk assessment. Neither trifluralin nor its anaerobic metabolite TR-4 are expected to contaminate ground water at levels above 0.1 mu g/L under the proposed conditions of use.        Trifluralin was designated as a ""priority substance"" under the water framework directive9 but has not been identified as a "" priority hazardous substance"". However, trifluralin was added to the OSPAR (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North- East Atlantic) List of Chemicals for Priority action in 2002, because it is considered to be a 'PBT' substance fulfilling the criteria for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity.        Because of its high volatility, the occurrence of trifluralin in air and transport through air is possible. However, photochemical half-life in air is estimated to be short. A data gap was identified by the PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts for the monitoring data in the Arctic regions reported by Canadian researchers and quoted in the report: 'Trifluralin dossier prepared in support of a proposal of trifluralin to be considered as a candidate for inclusion in the Annex I to the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants (LRTAP Protocol on POPs)'. European Commission, DG, Environment, Brussels, July 2007.        The risk to insectivorous and fish-eating birds and mammals, bees, ground-dwelling arthropods, soil micro-organisms and earthworms is low with respect to trifluralin and the metabolites as far as investigated.        In the original peer review high risks were identified for aquatic organisms, in particular the chronic risk for fish, which requires consideration of appropriate risk mitigation measures. Using the initial predicted environmental concentrations (PEC's) together with the no observed effect level (NOEC) of 0.3 mu g/L leads to a toxicity exposure ratio (TER)-value of 0.38 when a bufferzone of 15 metres is taken into account, which is below the Annex VI trigger value of 10 (without detailed calculations, a bufferzone of 50 m should lead to a TERvalue of approximately 1). Further data were considered necessary to address this risk and enable conclusions on the risk assessment to be drawn.        For the resubmission, a new 35-day static early-life-stage (ELS) study was conducted with fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) in a water-sediment system. In addition to the standard observations (i.e. growth and survival), skeletal irregularity was also analysed. The agreed end point from this study was the NOEC of 3.2 mu g a.s./L. However, since no data on the exposure pattern were available, it was not possible to conclude on the final fish chronic end point to be used for the risk assessment. Therefore, the chronic risk assessment for fish could not be finalised.        Based on the data gap identified at the PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts on environmental fate and behaviour (see section 4.2.1), a data gap was identified to provide a chronic risk assessment for fish based on the most relevant end point and on step 3 and step 4 PECsw values.        The EPCO 08 expert meeting (section ecotoxicology, June 2004) considered the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals as low, based on the TER value reflecting the soil accumulation plateau. EFSA would like to highlight that the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals should be considered further at Member State level when the product is applied after this plateau value is reached. EFSA initially proposed that a new litterbag study should be made available in which the tested dose rate reflects the concentration in the soil after a single application when the accumulation plateau has been reached, as the study which is available at present was performed at a lower dose rate. This data requirement was not discussed in an EPCO expert meeting. No new litterbag study was provided with the resubmission dossier. However, the PRAPeR 68 meeting of experts considered this study no longer necessary. The data gap was therefore not confirmed.        The risk to non-target plants could not be calculated with the appropriate end point (median emergence rate (ER50) value) as this value is not reported in the DAR. Based on a conservative no observed effect concentration (NOEC), the risk to non-target plants can be certainly regarded as low if a bufferzone of 5 metres is taken into account.        Regulation (EC) No 850/2004(10) of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC11 entered into force when the initial peer review of trifluralin was in an advanced stage. For this reason, the original EFSA conclusion finalised on 14 March 2005 (EFSA Scientific Report (2005) 28) did not specifically assess trifluralin against the criteria set in the paragraph 1 of Annex D of the Stockholm Convention(12). In the framework of the resubmission procedure, it was identified that EFSA should compare the agreed end points against the criteria set in the Stockholm Convention. The result of this assessment is presented under the section Conclusions and Recommendations. EFSA acknowledges that the assessment presented in this conclusion only considers a limited range of representative uses on the basis of the information provided by the notifier in the application dossier and the Member States during the peer review. Therefore, other information may need to be considered by the Commission and the Member States when assessing trifluralin with respect to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004.

Fish were exposed to sub-lethal and nominal concentration of fenthion after intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 or 400 mg/kg NAC. Brain tissues were then dissected and homogenized to analyse GSH, GSSG, TBARS, and protein contents. Enzymes that constitute the first line antioxidant defence, namely SOD and CAT, GSH-related enzymes, GR and GST, together with AChE activities were also determined spectrophotometrically. Fenthion did not cause any alteration in SOD and CAT activities while increasing GSH content, GSH/GSSG ratio and GST specific enzyme activity and decreasing GSSG, TBARS, and protein contents. Although, the highest induction in SOD and GST enzymes activities and the highest increase in GSH content were observed in the 0.5 mg/kg NAC-injected fish, their protein contents showed a decrease. 400 mg/kg NAC impeded the activation of the GST enzyme and a higher decrease in lipid peroxidation was observed. Fish were also protected against protein depletion by the higher dose NAC application. AChE activity was not influenced by fenthion exposure. Xenobiotic and GSH transporters may cause mild oxidative stress conditions in brain. Cellular redox status could trigger a series of reactions that result in an increase in SOD activity and a decrease in protein content. Based on the present results, it was suggested that the usefulness of NAC against fenthion depends on applied dose and tissue characteristics. Species-specifity and concentration selection should be taken into consideration in studies dealing with anticholinesterases. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

rayyan-1227193593,Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance myclobutanil (Question No EFSA-Q-2009-00606) Issued on 4 June 2009,2009,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,7,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Myclobutanil is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.(2) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on myclobutanil in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 4 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 29 March 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October - November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 14 November 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises air assisted broadcast spraying to table and wine grapes and apples in the fruit development stage, against powdery mildew, black rot and scab, in Northern and Southern Europe, up to a maximum 4 applications at a maximum individual application rate per spray of 48 g a.s./ha on grapes, and 90 g a.s./ha on apples, with an interval of 10 days between applications.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, 'Systhane 20 EW', an emulsion, oil in water (EW) containing 200 g/L myclobutanil.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method.        In mammals, myclobutanil LD50 is 1600 mg/kg bw ( classification as R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed). It is not toxic via dermal and inhalation routes (LD50 >2000 mg/kg bw and LC50>5.1 mg/L). Myclobutanil is not a skin irritant or a skin sensitiser. The European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) classified myclobutanil with R36 (""Irritating to eyes""). The primary target organ following exposure to myclobutanil is the liver. Myclobutanil induces liver enlargement accompanied by slight induction of biotransformation enzymes (in rats and mice). An overall subchronic NOAEL of 100 ppm was proposed (3.09 mg/kg bw/day). Myclobutanil does not show any genotoxic potential. In long-term studies in rat, the target organ appeared to be the testes (bilateral testicular atrophy and aspermatogenesis). The relevant NOAEL for long-term toxicity is 2.5 mg/kg bw/day from the rat study. Myclobutanil did not show any carcinogenic potential. In a two-generation rat study, myclobutanil, at a dietary concentration of 1000 ppm (80 mg/kg bw/day) produced reduced parental body weight and liver effects and decreased weight gain in pups during lactation; at slight parental toxic doses the number of females delivering litters was reduced and the incidence of stillborn pups increased. The relevant parental, offspring and reproductive NOAEL is 16 mg/kg bw/day. Myclobutanil is already classified as Repr. Cat 3, R63 (""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child""). The relevant parental NOAEL is 94 mg/kg bw/day, while the relevant developmental NOAEL is 31 mg/kg bw/day. No indication of any other neurological effects was found in the toxicological studies. The proposed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is based on the relevant NOAEL from the long-term rat study, applying a safety factor of 100, giving an ADI of 0.025 mg/kg bw/day. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.03 mg/kg bw/day was agreed to be based on the overall NOAEL (90-day and 1-year in dog) of 3.09 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100. The rat developmental toxicity study was considered as the most appropriate to use for setting the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD). An NOAEL of 31.3 mg/kg bw/day was established due to embryotoxic effects (altered viability index). Based on this NOAEL and an assessment factor of 100 the proposed ARfD is 0.31 mg/kg bw. There is a 300-fold margin between the proposed ARfD and the LOAEL for developmental effects in the rat developmental toxicity study. The operator, worker and bystander exposure estimates showed levels below the AOEL even when no PPE is worn (German model).        The metabolism of myclobutanil was investigated in grapes, apples (representative uses) and additionally in wheat. In grapes and apples at harvest, the major components of the residue were myclobutanil and its metabolite RH-9090(3) in free and conjugated form. A metabolic cleavage of the myclobutanil molecule which would generate triazole derivative metabolites was - in contrast to the wheat study - not observed in apples and grapes. Based on the available plant metabolism data for the categories fruit and cereals it was concluded that the metabolism is not comparable amongst different crop groups. As for the representative uses, however, it was agreed that the relevant residue for the category fruit crops should be defined as myclobutanil and its metabolite RH-9090 (free and conjugated). A sufficient number of residue trials in apples and grapes are available; however, there is still evidence required that the submitted trials cover the proposed residue definition. In processing studies it was investigated how the residue levels of myclobutanil and metabolite RH-9090 change when apples and grapes are processed to juice, wine, puree etc. However, a study investigating the effects of processing on the nature of the residues was identified as necessary since under processing conditions significant amounts of one or more degradation products, initially not present in the raw commodities, could be generated.        The investigation of residues in rotational and succeeding crops was considered not relevant since both apples and grapes are perennial crops that are usually not grown in rotation with other crops. However it was highlighted that in the long term the issue of potential uptake of triazole derivative metabolites could become relevant and should be followed up separately as this concern is not specific to the active substance myclobutanil alone but common to a number of triazole pesticides.        Since significant exposure of livestock to residues in feed may occur, a metabolism study in ruminants was triggered. The majority of the experts agreed that the level of identification was insufficient in the available study and thus a robust residue definition for food of animal origin could not be concluded on. Consequently, the relevance of the available feeding study for the assessment and likely necessary MRL proposals for food of animal origin can only be decided on when a residue definition has been concluded.        As a consequence of the identified data gaps, the consumer risk assessment with regard to the notified representative uses on apples and grapes cannot be finalised. Moreover, the risk assessment with regard to the two isomers of myclobutanil was not addressed.        It is noted that in addition to exposure from residues in food, the consumer could be exposed to residues of myclobutanil butyric acid, 4 a potential metabolite from ground water used as drinking water, but currently an assessment of the relevance of the metabolite and consequently of consumer risk is not available. An additional exposure to myclobutanil residues from groundwater used as drinking water can also not be excluded.        In soil under aerobic conditions myclobutanil exhibits high to very high persistence, forming the minor soil metabolite myclobutanil butyric acid (accounting for a maximum of 6% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of both the chlorophenyl and triazole rings to carbon dioxide was limited and accounted for only 0.2 to 1.7% AR after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 4 to 16% AR after 120 days. Myclobutanil exhibits medium to low mobility in soil, myclobutanil butyric acid exhibits very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either myclobutanil or myclobutanil butyric acid was affected significantly by differing soil pH. Data on degradation in soil under anaerobic conditions are not available and it was considered they will be necessary to support the applied for use on apples in some territories of the EU.        In dark natural sediment water systems myclobutanil partitioned from the water column to sediment where it exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 0.3% AR at 105 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a sink but represented only 4.3 to 9.8% AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for myclobutanil at steps 3 and 4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        On the basis of the available reliable information, it cannot be excluded that for the applied for intended uses, groundwater exposure by myclobutanil above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, will not occur over a wide range of European geoclimatic conditions. In addition for the metabolite myclobutanil butyric acid, groundwater exposure above the parametric drinking water limit might be expected and it cannot be excluded that concentrations > 0.75 mu g/L (a key assessment trigger from the groundwater metabolite relevance guidance document) may occur. A groundwater metabolite non relevance assessment is therefore necessary for myclobutanil butyric acid but this assessment is not available.        The risk to birds and mammals was assessed as low except the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals from the use in apple orchards. A refined risk assessment applying interception factors of 65% and 70% resulted in a TER of 5.18 which is above the Annex VI trigger of 5. The risk of secondary poisoning from uptake of contaminated earthworms was assessed as low. A data gap was identified in the experts. meeting for the submission of a risk assessment for fish-eating birds and mammals since it was not possible to exclude that the logP(ow) of myclobunatil is >3. Myclobutanil is very toxic to aquatic invertebrates. The TERs based on FOCUS step 3 PECsw were above the Annex VI triggers for the representative use on grapes. For the use in apple orchards risk mitigation measures such as a no-spray buffer zone of 14 metres is required to achieve TERs above the Annex VI triggers. The assessment of the logPow value was inconclusive. In the expert meeting a data gap for a bioconcentration study with fish was identified since four applications are foreseen and chronic and repeated exposure of fish is expected. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. It was identified that the risk assessment did not address the potential for different myclobutanil isomer ratios to be present in the environment.

The fungicide vinclozolin acts as an anti-androgen and is known to affect affiliative behaviors in rodents, fish and amphibians. To investigate the possible effects of exposure to EDCs on reproductive behavior in a wild population of songbirds, we examined the effects of vinclozolin in wild-caught Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis). For this and many other temperate songbird species, testosterone has powerful activational effects on affiliative behaviors in adulthood. We hypothesized that vinclozolin would affect male behaviors associated with female preference. Male juncos received daily oral gavage for 10 weeks with 2 mM vinclozolin in vehicle or vehicle alone. Juncos were photostimulated (16L:8D) to induce breeding behavior. Each pair of a treated and non-treated male was presented to an estrogen-primed female to assess female preference. Seven of eight females exhibited a strong preference for a male exposed to vinclozolin over a control male (p = 0.01). The only significant difference in measured male behaviors was increased beak wiping in controls (p = 0.006) and there was no difference in gonad size or brain weight (p > 0.05 for each). Our data suggest that estrogen-primed female juncos prefer to associate with male juncos exposed to this anti-androgen. This finding demonstrates that environmentally occurring anti-androgens can affect the social behavior of this species. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that vinclozolin has effects on the social behavior of songbirds. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on paraffin oil (CAS 8042-47-5) in accordance with the provisions of Article 21(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 30 April 2008. The peer review was initiated on 30 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier W. Neudorff GmbH KG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide for use on pome fruit, stone fruit, berry fruits (except strawberry), grapes and ornamentals. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of endpoints.        The representative formulated products for the evaluation were 'Promanal Neu', an oil in water emulsion (EW).        Methods of analysis for food items are currently not required see sections 3. For environmental matrices methods are not required for groundwater and air, for surface water a method is required for alkanes (chain lengths up to C-30). For soil it is not concluded if a method is required or not, see sections 4 and 5.        Sufficient internationally accepted methods e.g. ASTM, ISO are available to characterise the technical material and formulated product. However, at this time the technical specification is not accepted and there is no supporting batch data. Data gaps have been identified for autoflammability, flash point and a shelf-life study.        During the mammalian toxicology meeting, as no technical specification was agreed by the meeting on physical and chemical properties, concerns were raised over relevant impurities generally associated with these compounds. The specification, as proposed by the notifier, could be accepted on toxicological grounds if its high purity is confirmed by the section on physical and chemical properties. However, while this is not demonstrated, paraffin oils have to be classified as T ""Toxic"", carcinogenic category 2, R45 ""May cause cancer"". On this basis, no toxicological studies were required, no ADI, AOEL or ARfD were proposed and no risk assessment of operator, worker and bystander exposure could be conducted as the experts considered that these specifications were not acceptable from the toxicological point of view.        It was noted however that if highly purified paraffin oils were considered (i.e. no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the active substance), then no toxicological concern would be raised for consumers, operators, workers and bystanders. Sources of mineral oil are laxatives in pharmacology or oils are used in food technology as release agents, for lubrication purposes, or as a substitute for fat. Paraffin oils are chemically inert substances, especially the straight chain (n) alkanes and, on ingestion, most of the mineral oil (about 98 % depending on the length of the C-chain) remains unabsorbed and is rapidly excreted, mostly unchanged, via faeces.        Paraffin oil has a low toxicity profile. No toxicological study was submitted, except an acute inhalation toxicity study in the rat. The experts agreed that no acute, short-term, long-term, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity studies would be required, provided that no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the substance. Paraffin oils are not considered to be genotoxic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic or toxic to the reproduction. Also, in line with the low toxicity of paraffin oils (of high purity), no ADI, AOEL or ARfD would be proposed, nor considered necessary, and no risk assessment for operators, workers and bystanders would be required.        The list of endpoint on mammalian toxicology has been filled in considering that the technical material does not contain unacceptable levels of relevant impurities.        No information on potential levels of residues in food or feed items were presented in the DAR.        A consumer risk assessment has not been performed due to the possible high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. If these compounds are present then it would result in a toxicological classification that would mean that these compounds could not be registered as Plant Protection Products. The risk to consumers can therefore not be finalised.        In soil under aerobic conditions this paraffin oil mixture exhibits moderate to medium persistence in terms of the time taken for carbon tetrachloride extracted alkanes to be mineralised. The alkanes in the mixture are classed as immobile in soil on the basis of QSAR estimates, and adsorption is not pH dependent. In a 55 cm deep microcosm study this paraffin oil mixture formed a layer at the water surface (spray application made), where it dissipated rapidly exhibiting low persistence in water. Sediment concentrations were not measured. The mechanism of the dissipation was not identified. Surface water exposure assessments are available using the SWASH drift calculator tool. A data gap is identified regarding the potential for water body associated sediment to be exposed, and information on degradation/dissipation potential of this paraffin oil mixture in sediment. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by alkanes up to C-30 above, the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios.        Based on the available data, paraffin oil was proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. EFSA re-calculated the TERs after the expert meeting, with the new PECsw and included the values in the final list of endpoints. A high potential acute and chronic risk was identified for Daphnia magna for all the intended uses. Risk mitigation measures were applied to refine the risk in the grapevine and ornamental uses. However, even using the widest no-spray buffer zones (25m for streams and ditches for the pome fruit and grapevine uses and 30m for stream and ditches for the use on ornamentals), the acute and chronic TERs for Daphnia did not meet the Annex VI trigger values for all the intended uses, except for the acute TERs estimated for the grapevine use when a 25m no-spray buffer zone was applied. Further information is necessary to address the risk to aquatic invertebrates for all of the intended uses. The TERs for fish and alga exceeded the Annex VI trigger value based on the use of a 20m no-spray buffer zone for the pome fruit use. However, the TERs estimated for fish and alga were above the Annex VI trigger values without the use of no-spray buffer zones. The risk for fish and algae was assessed to be low for the grapevine and ornamental uses. However, mitigation measures equivalent to 20m are necessary to refine the risk for fish and alga with respect to the pome fruit use. The available information did not allow the risk to sediment dwelling organisms to be assessed.        The experts meeting agreed that, in absence of data, mitigation measures should be taken to avoid exposure to bees.        Herbicidal effects of the formulation ""Promanal Neu"" on vegetative vigour were investigated in tests with six plant species. The lowest ER50 value was observed for Allium cepa ER50 > 17.64 kg a.s./ha for vegetative vigour. The TERs were 4.8 and 5.4 for post-emergence treatments based on PECs from spray drift at 3m and 5m no-spray buffer zones, respectively.        There was no valid study evaluated in the DAR to assess the effects of paraffin oil on soil non-target macro-organisms. A data gap for information to address this issue was identified.        The risk to birds and mammals, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target microorganisms and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low.

This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on zeta-cypermethrin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 10 July 2006. The peer review was initiated on 6 October 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant FMC Chemical sprl. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in October 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Fury 10 EW (NP Free)"", an emulsion, oil in water (EW) containing 100 g/L (96.9 g/kg) zeta-cypermethrin.        The technical specification for the active substance was based on pilot scale production and was only partially accepted by the PRAPeR meeting of experts (May 2008).        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant and animal origin, environmental matrices and body fluids and tissues.        As for mammalian toxicology, the dossier submitted contained studies on both zeta-cypermethrin and cypermethrin. Considering the ratio of the most potent isomers between zeta-cypermethrin and cypermethrin and focusing on neurotoxicity (difference using the NOAELs and LOAELs of rat studies), a factor of 2 could be established showing that zeta-cypermethrin is more toxic than cypermethrin. When orally administered, zeta-cypermethrin is toxic (proposed to be classified T, R25 ""toxic if swallowed""). It is harmful for inhalation (Xn, R20). No toxic effects were observed after dermal exposure. It is not irritating to eyes or skin but is a skin sensitizer in a Buehler test (Xi, R43 - ""irritant; may cause sensitisation by skin contact""). Neurotoxicity is the target effect of zeta-cypermethrin for short term exposures. The relevant NOAEL of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day is from the 2-year feeding study in dogs. The classification as R48/22 (""danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure, if swallowed"") was proposed based on mortality in several studies. Overall, it was concluded that zeta-cypermethrin is neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic under experimental conditions (carcinogenicity was tested with cypermethrin). The relevant long term toxicity and carcinogenicity NOAEL of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day is from the 2-year rat study. The relevant parental and offspring NOAEL in multigeneration studies is 5.9 mg/kg bw/day, while the reproductive NOAEL is 22 mg/kg bw/day. Zeta-cypermethrin was negative for developmental toxicity when tested in rats. The relevant maternal NOAEL in rat and rabbit are 12.5 and >= 120 mg/kg bw/day, respectively; the relevant developmental NOAEL are 35 mg/kg bw/day in rat, and >= 120 mg/kg bw/day in rabbit. Zeta-cypermethrin is a neurotoxic agent (acute and subchronic NOAELs 10 mg/kg bw and 5 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, based on the overall cypermethrin NOAEL for dogs of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day and a 100-fold safety factor with an additional factor of 2 for the higher toxicity of zeta-cypermethrin vs. cypermethrin. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.125 mg/kg bw based on the developmental toxicity study in rats supported by the acute neurotoxicity with zeta-cypermethrin, applying a safety factor (SF) of 100. An acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) of 0.02 mg/kg bw/day was based on the overall cypermethrin NOAEL for dogs of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day using a 100-fold safety factor with an additional factor of 2 for the higher toxicity of zeta-cypermethrin and correcting for 50% oral absorption. The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).        In order to support the uses of zeta-cypermethrin the applicant submitted plant metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin. Several groups of plants were investigated; root crops (sugar beet), cereals (maize), pulses/oilseeds (cotton), fruit crops (apples) and leafy crops (lettuce). The major degradation pathway of cypermethrin starts with the cleavage of the parent molecule to yield cis/trans DCVA(2) and the mPBAldehyde(3), this latter metabolite being further oxidised or reduced to the corresponding mPBAcid(4) or mPBAlcohol(5) followed by conjugations. In most of the plant matrices investigated, unchanged cypermethrin was the predominant residue accounting for more than c.a. 50% of the TRR. The meeting discussed whether the plant metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin were relevant for zeta-cypermethrin and if a preferential metabolism may be suspected for some isomers with a special impact on toxicology. A bridging study on maize detailing the respective metabolism of both cypermethrin and zeta-cypermethrin was provided by the applicant, however, in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. However, and taking into account the no residue situation resulting from the intended uses on cereals, maize and peas, the meeting was of the opinion that the possible isomeric conversion from less to more toxic isomers would not be significant and concluded that a residue definition can be proposed based on the metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin. Finally, it was concluded that a global residue definition has to be proposed in order to take into account the various mixtures of cypermethrin isomers available on the market. Thus, for plants, the residue for monitoring and risk assessment was defined as ""cypermethrin, including other mixtures of constituent isomers (sum of isomers)"".        Numerous supervised residue trials performed with zeta-cypermethrin were submitted to propose MRLs. Nevertheless, some of them were rejected since growth stages at application were not in compliance with the critical GAP and/or analytical methods were not sufficiently validated. Finally, MRLs were defined for wheat, triticale and pea without pods and, awaiting the evaluation of additional data provided by the applicant that were not considered during the meeting with regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, provisional MRLs were proposed for maize, barley, oat, pea with pods and pulses. No degradation of residues was observed for zeta-cypermethrin in different plant- and animal matrices when stored under frozen conditions for up to 18 months. Some instability was observed at some time points for the metabolites mPBAcid and cis-DCVA in some animal matrices, but globally, the results were considered acceptable. No processing studies were provided since no significant residues were observed in any commodities supporting the representative uses. However, the EFSA noted that the cypermethrin hydrolysis breakdown product, mPBAldehyde, was found in a tomato processing study, and this compound is suspected of endocrine activity. This concern was considered to be not relevant for the intended uses supported in the DAR but the meeting noted that this point has to be re-considered if additional uses are envisaged.        Lactating cow and laying hen metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin were evaluated. The major route of degradation consisted of the hydrolysis of ester linkage to generate the cis and trans DCVA moiety and the mPBAldehyde that undergoes further oxidation and/or reduction to the corresponding acid (mPBAcid) or alcohol (mPBAlcohol) and their hydroxy products. The metabolism of the cyclopropyl moiety was considered as insufficiently investigated in the ruminant metabolism study as in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the additional data from literature presented in the addendum of May 2008, could not be considered in the peer review. This point remains open and has to be reconsidered. Nevertheless, and taking into account the complete metabolic pathway in poultry, and the data from the rat metabolism study indicating a similar pathway, the meeting of experts concluded that there was enough evidence to propose the residue for monitoring and risk assessment for animal products as ""cypermethrin, including other mixtures of constituent isomers (sum of isomers)"".        Considering the potential livestock exposure to zeta-cypermethrin residues through consumption of treated feed items (maize, cereals, pea and pulses), feeding studies indicate that no measurable residues may be present above the LOQ in the different animal-products and the MRLs for animal commodities were proposed at LOQ values. Considering the representative uses and the toxicological endpoints set for zeta-cypermethrin, no chronic or acute concerns were observed, the theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) being less than 2% of the ADI and the maximum national estimated short term intake (NESTI) less than 1% of ARfD. In addition, the meeting concluded on the need for a global risk assessment taking into account the other sources of exposure resulting from the uses of all other cyprermethrin isomer mixtures available on the market and their respective toxicological reference values.        In soil under aerobic conditions zeta-cypermethrin exhibits low to medium persistence forming the soil metabolites DCVA6 (accounting for up to 24% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low persistence and mPBAcid (accounting for up to 8.4 % AR in the available guideline study or 29.5% AR in a study with limited sampling intervals) which also exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation of both the cyclopropyl- and benzyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 25-27% AR after 91 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 12-26 % AR after 91 days. Isomers of cypermethrin are immobile in soil, DCVA exhibits very high mobility in soil and mPBAcid exhibits high to medium mobility. There was no indication that the soil adsorption of isomers of cypermethrin was pH dependent. There was no clear evidence that the soil adsorption of DCVA or mPBAcid was pH dependant. A data gap was identified for a satisfactory aerobic soil laboratory route of degradation study dosed with zeta-cypermethrin, which is necessary to ensure thatall potential soil metabolites that might reach levels that trigger a groundwater exposure assessment have been identified. The available route of degradation study that used cypermethrin as the test substance was considered insufficient to address the presence of zeta-cypermethrin metabolites at the 5% AR trigger for leaching assessment level as prescribed in agreed EU guidance.        In dark natural sediment water systems zeta-cypermethrin partitioned rapidly from water to sediment where it degraded exhibiting low persistence to the metabolites mPBAcid and DCVA, which were present predominantly in the water phase where they exhibited medium to high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 22 % AR (cyclopropyl label) and 58% AR (phenyl label) at 99 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a significant sink representing 16-27 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for component isomers of the active substance at step 1. Step 3 and 4 calculations are also available (but only for surface water and not sediment), with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. However, these calculations did not adhere to the FOCUS surface water guidance, so a data gap is identified for more appropriate calculations, therefore only relatively crude estimates of surface water exposure are available for the aquatic risk assessment. For the metabolites mPBAcid and DCVA appropriate FOCUS step 1 exposure assessments were agreed by the peer review. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by component isomers of the active substance, mPBAcid and trans-DCVA above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However the groundwater exposure assessment for metabolites cannot be finalised until the data gap identified for a satisfactory soil route of degradation study is filled.        The risk to mammals and the acute and short-term risk to birds were assessed as low but a potential high long-term risk to insectivorous birds cannot be excluded for all representative uses evaluated. A data gap was identified for further refinement of the risk assessment for insectivorous birds. Zeta-cypermethrin is very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The aquatic risk assessment was based on preliminary FOCUS step 4 PECsw values which included a 20m no-spray buffer zone. The acute TERs for fish exceeded the Annex VI trigger of 100 in all scenarios for the use in cereals and in all scenarios except R3 and R4 for the use in peas. However no full scenario resulted in a TER of >100 for the use in maize and the long-term TERs were significantly below the Annex VI trigger of 10 in all scenarios even with a no-spray buffer zone of 20m. A data gap was identified for further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment. Two mesocosm studies with zeta-cypermethrin were submitted by the applicant, however, in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. The risk to aquatic organisms from the metabolites cis-DCVA, trans-DCVA and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (mPBAcid) was assessed as low. Zeta-cypermethrin is very toxic to bees. A potential high risk was indicated in the first-tier risk assessment. The mortality of adult bees was increased in higher tier tests during the first 1-4 days after treatment. No impact on bee brood development was observed but it was noted that no reserves were accumulated in the bee hives. This observation may be explained by the repellent effect of zeta-cypermethrin. The experts considered the risk to bees as low for the use in cereals which are considered as not attractive for bees. Risk mitigation measures such as no application during flowering were proposed for the use in peas. The higher tier studies did not cover the application rate in maize and a data gap was identified to address the risk to bees further. A high in-field risk to non-target arthropods was indicated from the standard laboratory and the extended laboratory tests. The applied doses in the field tests were too low for the representative uses and a data gap was identified to address further the in-field and the off-field risk to non-target arthropods for all representative uses. Although formally not triggered, the experts considered it necessary to address the risk to soil dwelling mites and collembola because of the potential high risk to arthropods. It was suggested that investigation of soil dwelling mites and collembola should be included in a field study with non-target arthropods. The study on effects on respiration of activated sewage sludge was assessed as not valid. A new study was submitted by the applicant but in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review.        The risk to earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants was assessed as low.

rayyan-1227193598,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Sulcotrione,2008,10,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,10,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Sulcotrione is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on sulcotrione in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 9 August 2006. The peer review was initiated on 15 September 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded to by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March April 2008.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a herbicide on maize. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Mikado"", a suspension concentrate (SC).        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. It is noted that the residue definitions for soil and water are not yet finalised. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Data gaps have been identified for the specification, and for a new method of analysis for sulcotrione in air.        In the mammalian metabolism studies, sulcotrione was rapidly and completely absorbed and excreted after oral administration. It was poorly distributed into tissues and organs, and metabolism was limited. The acute toxicity of sulcotrione was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route. It did not present eye or skin irritation properties; however, it was proposed to classify the active substance with risk phrase R43 ""may cause sensitisation by skin contact"" as a high rate of sensitisation was observed in a Magnusson & Kligman test. Sulcotrione is a 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitor, a key enzyme of the tyrosine catabolic pathway, resulting in increased 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate, the proximal tyrosine metabolite and increased blood tyrosine concentration. Male rats were recognised as being more sensitive to sulcotrione and primary effects in short term and long term studies were characterized by corneal lesions and increased liver and kidney weights associated with histopathological findings. Corneal lesions have been shown to be irrelevant for human risk assessment, but liver and mainly kidney effects were considered as sulcotrione-mediated effects (opposed to tyrosinaemia-related effects) and relevant for human risk assessment. The relevant NOAEL for short term exposure was the dose level of 3.3 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat study, while after long term exposure, only a LOAEL could be determined, at 0.04 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study.        Inconsistent results were obtained from genotoxicity studies, some positive in vitro tests were obtained as well as one out of three in vivo micronucleus assays. Higher relevance was given to a negative in vivo UDS assay and it was concluded, based on the weight of evidence, that sulcotrione had no genotoxic potential in vivo. No potential for carcinogenicity was found either.        Reproduction toxicity studies reflected the same effects in parents, but abnormalities of the urinary tract were increased in pups of both generations, not observed in the first parental animals, and on this basis, a classification with Xn, R63 ""possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The relevant NOAEL (parental) was the dose level of 0.06 mg/kg bw/day, while offspring's NOAEL was 0.6 mg/kg bw/day, no effect on the reproduction or fertility was observed. No developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits when sulcotrione was administered by oral gavage and no neurotoxicity was attributed to sulcotrione administration.        A data package of studies was provided on the metabolite CMBA(2), a significant metabolite in plant and the environment, but found only in traces in mammalian metabolism. CMBA was found to be severely irritant to eyes, where it is predominantly formed, at least in the rat, but it did not cause tyrosinaemia and showed to be less toxic than the parent compound. An ADI of 0.2 mg/kg bw/day was set for the metabolite and no relevance was attributed when found in groundwater, even above the threshold value of 0.1 mu g/L.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of sulcotrione was 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure (AOEL) was 0.0006 mg/kg bw/day and no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 0.1 % for the concentrate formulation and 0.5 % for the in-use spray dilution, based on an in vitro dermal penetration study through human epidermis. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation Mikado, at a maximum dose rate of 0.45kg sulcotrione/ha exceeded the AOEL according to the UK POEM, even when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was considered; according to the German model, estimated exposure was below the AOEL if PPE as gloves during mixing/loading and application, and coverall and sturdy footwear during application were worn. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with sulcotrione was below the AOEL, even when no PPE was considered. Bystander's exposure was low compared to the AOEL value.        The metabolism of sulcotrione in maize was investigated after post emergence application reflecting the representative use supported by the applicant. The metabolic degradation of sulcotrione is essentially focused to the cyclohexanedione ring and the formation of CMBA. CMBA was the only significant metabolite formed and only occurs at significant levels in the forage. The meeting of experts PRAPeR 45 agreed that it should be included in the residue definition for risk assessment. However, the animal metabolism study where CMBA was dosed showed that no significant residues will occur. Therefore the risk assessment would not have changed except that the ADI has been lowered. Revised TMDI calculations showed intakes at 31 % of the ADI. As CMBA is a significant but non relevant metabolite in ground water at a level above 0.75 p.g/L a consumer risk assessment is required. The risk assessment for CMBA gives a highest intake of <0.2 % of the ADI for CMBA. An acute risk assessment was not necessary as no ARM has been set.        In soil under aerobic conditions sulcotrione exhibits moderate to medium persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 2.5-73.8 % applied radioactivity (AR) after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting up to 26.5 % AR after 120 days. The major metabolite CMBA was detected in soil at maximum level of 60% AR. Sulcotrione and CMBA exhibit very high mobility in soil. Adsorption of sulcotrione is not only determined by the organic carbon content of the soil but at least also by the pH value, which itself correlated to the organic carbon content. There was no evidence of a correlation of adsorption with soil pH. In dark natural sediment water systems sulcotrione degraded exhibiting moderate persistence in the whole system forming the metabolite CMBA (max. 42.2% AR in water and max. 18.6% AR in sediment). The final products of degradation in water-sediment systems were carbon dioxide and bound residues (max 6 and 9% AR after 100 days). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for sulcotrione at steps 1-3. For the metabolite CMBA appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion.        The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by sulcotrione above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low for geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. CMBA concentrations (80th percentile annual average concentration at 1 m) are in the range of 0.015 1.462 mu g/L. The concentration of 0.1 mu g/L is exceeded in 6 out of 8 European FOCUS scenarios parameterised for maize and for Hamburg and Okehampton scenarios the estimated PECgw are > 0.75 mu g/L. The toxicological assessment was able to conclude that CMBA is not relevant regarding groundwater at the expected concentrations.        As the fate and behaviour of sulcotrione in the environment was investigated using phenyl-labelled sulcotrione only, the peer review process identified a data gap for an aerobic soil degradation study and for a water-sediment study performed with cyclohexanedione-labelled sulcotrione or for evidence to demonstrate that potential metabolites containing the cyclohexanedione ring are labile. Sulcotrione is not expected to be transferred to the atmospheric compartment and potential for long range transport may be considered negligible.        The first tier acute and short-term TERs for birds and the acute TERs for mammals were above the Annex VI trigger of 10. The first-tier long-term TERs were below the trigger of 5 indicating a potential high long-term risk. The refined risk assessment for medium herbivorous birds resulted in TERs >5 based on residue decline. The experts rejected the suggested PT refinements for insectivorous birds since they were not sufficiently supported by data. A data gap was identified in the expert meeting for the applicant to provide a new refined long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds. A new study was submitted by the applicant and a refined risk assessment based on this study was included by the RMS in the not peer-reviewed addendum 3 from May 2008. The long-term risk to mammals was refined by using residue decline data and the new (higher) long-term endpoint agreed in the experts meeting. Based on the agreed refinements (without PT refinement) the long-term TERs were above the trigger of 5 indicating a low long-term risk to mammals. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water and the risk from the major plant metabolite CMBA to birds and mammals were assessed as low.        Sulcotrione is of low acute toxicity to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The lowest endpoint was observed for aquatic plants. The TERs for all groups of aquatic organisms were greater than the Annex VI triggers of 100 and 10 except for Lemna gibba. One (R4 stream) out of seven FOCUS step 3 scenarios resulted in a TER <10 for Lemna gibba. Risk mitigation measures are required under environmental conditions represented by scenario R4. The metabolite CMBA is of low toxicity to aquatic organisms including Lemna gibba. The Annex VI triggers were exceeded with FOCUS step2 PECsw values.        The risk to the standard non-target arthropod indicator species Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri was assessed as low. Additional species were tested and no effects of >50% were observed in tests with Poecilus cupreus and Aleochara bilineata. Effects of >50% were observed in tests with Coccinella septempunctata and Pardosa sp at the suggested application rate of 450g sulcotrione/ha. The risk to C. septempunctata was assessed as low in higher tier (extended laboratory) studies. Several extended laboratory studies were conducted with Pardosa sp. After 42 days of ageing the residues still led to a statistically significantly increased mortality. No increased mortality was observed after 56 days of ageing of residues. Although the effects were <50% it is uncertain if recolonisation would occur in a real field situation due to the long persistence of effects. No further information was made available to demonstrate recovery/recolonisation of spiders in the in-field area. The LR50 for Pardosa sp. was calculated as 10.34g a.s./ha which is below the calculated off-field exposure rate of 12.47g a.s./ha indicating a potential high risk for spiders in the off-field area. It was agreed by the experts that risk mitigation measures comparable to a 5m in-field no-spray buffer zone should be applied to ensure that recolonisation of the in-field area is possible from unaffected off field areas. A potential high risk was identified for non-target plants in the off-field area. Risk mitigation measures comparable to a no-spray buffer zone of 10m is recommended. The risk to bees, earthworms, soil non-target macro- and micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low for the representative use in maize.

In other cases, the membrane itself is the major site of action for AAMPs as in the case of cyclotides, which permeabilize membranes via pore formation, and human β-defensins, which induce the disintegration of membranes via carpet-type mechanisms prior to action against intracellular targets.

Several studies demonstrate that these pollutants may interfere with chemoreception of aquatic animals. Many aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates depend on chemical senses for their survival and reproduction. In fish and crustaceans, olfactory and taste receptors are exposed directly to the pollutants and their function can be disturbed. This can result in behavioral changes or lack of proper behaviors. Anthropogenic compounds can have detrimental effects on reproduction and survival of aquatic organisms. Relatively little is known about the effects of pollutants on crustacean chemoreception and behavior, but studies on fish might help elucidate the problems faced by crustaceans. This chapter gives examples of pollutant effects on pheromone detection in fish in connection with reproductive behavior, shoaling and dominance interactions, fright responses and effects on detection of food odors and foraging. Results from crustacean studies are compared to the examples given from fish studies. Various studies have shown that pesticides of different kinds affect the function of fish olfactory receptor cells. Crustaceans may face similar problems with less sensitive chemo-receptor cells. This will be especially problematic with compounds designed to combat insects and arthropods that are closely related to crustaceans. Many insecticides have direct effects on the nervous system and this will disturb chemoreception and behavior. Heavy metal ions are also problematic as they can be transported by chemosensory neurons into the brain and affect its normal functions. Crustaceans play important roles in aquatic ecosystems as well as in human food industry. Therefore, it is urgent to increase the knowledge about the effects of pollutants on crustacean chemoreception and behavior, especially compounds with direct effects on the nervous system that will affect the normal behavior and signal perception, disturbing social communication and reproduction. Such effects are serious for an individual as its growth and ability to compete and reproduce will be suppressed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

The manipulation was carried out during 2004-2006, with a main effort to remove large cannibal pike (>65 cm), and the cascading impacts on the major fish community were evaluated. The main fish species in Lake Årungen are roach (Rutilus rutilus), perch (Perca fluviatilis), pike, and rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) with some additional fish species in low numbers. The main assumptions behind the removal of large pike were to obtain (i) increased number of small pike and large perch due to reduced cannibalism and predation pressure; (ii) reduced abundance of roach and small perch due to increased number of piscivores, i.e., small pike and large perch, and (iii) reduced levels of pollutants in the remaining fish community by increased growth rates and changes in diet. The recruitment success of pike after removal of large pike was evaluated by the Petersen mark-recapture method. The habitat utilization of the major fish species was studied based on gillnet catch data. The trophic position of different fish species was determined based on both gut content analyses and analyses of stable isotopes of nitrogen ( 15N/14N=δ15N) and carbon ( 13C/12C=δ13C). Important biological factors influencing the dynamics of mercury and organic pollutants through the fish community in the lake were identified as well. The estimated numbers of small pike (45-64.9 cm, mostly age class 3+) significantly increased in 2005-2006, after the experimental removal of the large pike in 2004 and 2005, and thus assumed to be a cannibal-driven response. The dominant prey fish of pike was roach, both in terms of numbers and biomass. The relative abundance of piscivores increased and as a consequence the relative abundance of small roach declined in 2005-2006. A marked shift in habitat utilization of roach and perch was recorded after the manipulation of the pike population. The gut content analysis was in agreement with the food web analysis based on the stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon in 2005-2006. Pike (exclusively piscivores) and perch (feeding mainly on zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish) occupied the top trophic positions in Lake Årungen, with pike at the highest position. Roach and rudd occupied lower trophic positions, with rudd at the lowest. Although there was segregation in diet between roach and perch, the increased importance of zooplankton in their diet during the summer 2006 may indicate an increased abundance of zooplankton. Mercury content in fish muscle increased with size and weight (bioaccumulation), as well as with an increased position in the food web (biomagnification), with pike having the highest concentrations. Growth rate of pike in age classes 1-3 increased in 2005, probably due to the lower predation risk, and thereby a more extensive use of the most favorable pike habitats. The faster growth rate might have played a role for a significant decrease in total mercury concentrations, probably as a result of growth biodilution (~50% reduction between same size groups of pike). None of the fish analyzed in 2005 had a mercury concentration which would have exceeded the FAO/WHO provisional tolerable weekly intake value (1.6 μg kg-1), whereas the mercury concentration in only four analyzed pike in 2003 would have exceeded the recommended limit. The metabolite pp'DDT formed the main part (88%) of the total concentrations of the DDTs (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) in fish liver. Both ΣDDT and ΣPCB (polychlorinated biphenyls) were significantly higher in pike compared to perch and roach, whereas HCB (hexachlorobenzene) and HCE (heptachlor epoxide) were detected mainly in pike. In pike, males had significantly higher concentrations of all organochlorine compounds compared to females. Such a sex-dependent differentiation in the concentrations of organochlorine compounds may be attributed to physiological differences, for example, a higher elimination of the lipophilic pollutants in roe during spawning by female pike and higher growth rate of female pike. The lower levels of organochlorines in pike and perch in 2005 compared to analyses performed in 2004 might be an effect of the biomanipulation of Lake Årungen as well. Therefore, selective exploitation of a large top predator fish, e.g., large pike, may serve as a tool to reduce the concentrations of mercury and organochlorine compounds in the remaining fish community. To obtain a sustained positive effect both on the trophic status of the lake and on the pollutant levels in the fishes, as obtained by the manipulation of the large pike in 2004-2006, a high fishing pressure on the large pike has to be persistent and carried out annually. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: C.M.

Biogenic amine transporters regulate neurotransmission by removing neurotransmitters from synapses and extracellular fluid. Despite evolutionary divergence, teleost fish and mammalian transporter proteins appear similar, particularly at active binding sites. However, it is not clear if the similarities extend to functional responses, reuptake-inhibiting drugs, or involvement in delayed neurotoxic responses to pesticide exposures. Under certain exposure conditions, alterations in expression and function of these transporters may be more sensitive biomarkers of pesticide exposure or neurodegenerative disease risk than acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavioral assays targeting associative responses such as anxiety are useful as pharmacological and toxicological screens, or for studying modulation of behavior by central neurotransmitter systems. In novel environments, zebrafish go to tank bottoms and dark backgrounds, a stereotypical behavior (attributed to predator anxiety) forming the basis of the novel light/dark aquatic plus maze characterized in this chapter. Such behavioral paradigms are an essential component to establish zebrafish as pharmacological and toxicological research models. Herein adult zebrafish are exposed to reuptake inhibitors and representative organochloride, organophosphate, or pyrethroid pesticides at 1 μg day-1 for 21 days, tested for anxious response in the light/dark plus maze, then assayed for dopamine and serotonin transporter density by radioligand binding. Exposures to these compounds variably affect dopamine and serotonin transporter density and alter behavior in the maze as compared to controls. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 4,10.1007/978-1-60761-922-2_8,acetylcholinesterase inhibition;amine transporters;DAT;Dopamine;expression regulation;light-dark plus-maze;mammalian homology;monoamine systems;norepinephrine;Parkinson's disease;pesticide;serotonin;SERT;toxicology;transporter mechanisms;Danio rerio;Mammalia;Teleostei;acetylcholinesterase;chlorpyrifos;dieldrin;dopamine transporter;dopamine uptake inhibitor;permethrin;serotonin transporter;serotonin uptake inhibitor;sertraline;vanoxerine;animal behavior;animal experiment;animal tissue;anxiety;controlled study;drug exposure;environment;female;male;maze test;neurotoxicity;nonhuman;priority journal;review;zebra fish;Pesticides;Amines;Amination,NA,NA,zebrafish biogenic amine transporters and behavior in novel environments targets of reuptake inhibitors and pesticide action as tools for neurotoxicology research

Neurotransmitters are substances that relay, amplify, and modulate electrical signals between neurons and other cells. Neurotransmitter signaling mediates rapid intercellular communication by interacting with cell surface receptors, activating second messenger systems and regulating the activity of ion channels. Changes in the functional balance of neurotransmitters have been implicated in the failure of central nervous system function. In addition, abnormalities in neurotransmitter production or functioning can be induced by several toxicological compounds, many of which are found in the environment. The zebrafish has been increasingly used as an animal model for biomedical research, primarily due to its genetic tractability and ease of maintenance. These features make this species a versatile tool for pre-clinical drug discovery and toxicological investigations. Here, we present a review regarding the role of different excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems in zebrafish, such as dopaminergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic, purinergic, histaminergic, nitrergic, glutamatergic, glycinergic, and GABAergic systems, and emphasizing their features as pharmacological and toxicological targets. The increase in the global knowledge of neurotransmitter systems in zebrafish and the elucidation of their pharmacological and toxicological aspects may lead to new strategies and appropriate research priorities to offer insights for biomedical and environmental research. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 164; Correspondence Address: C.D.

The parasites were observed immediately after adding the drug, at 1 to 3 h, and 17 to 26 h, and video recordings were made. Drug effects were recorded by documenting morbidity (reduced movement, tremors, contracted body, abnormal morphology) and mortality. A. ureteroecetes was strongly affected by the quinoline praziquantel, the imidazothiazide levamisole, and the organophosphates dichlorvos and trichlorfon. The parasites were moderately affected by the macrocyclic lactones ivermectin and emamectin, and generally unaffected by the benzimidazole mebendazole.

It serves as an example of how regulations, developed to protect people and the environment from long-term effects of pesticides, are applied in practice. The risk assessment process for noncancer endpoints involves four steps--hazard identification, dose-response assessments, exposure estimates, and risk characterization. In the dose-response analysis, the lowest dose that does not cause an effect (NOEL) is identified for all endosulfan exposure durations. In the process of pesticide registration, studies submitted by the registrant are required under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) guidelines. DPR is required to rely on FIFRA guideline studies for pesticide toxicity evaluations; however, these studies are rarely published in the open literature and subsequently are not available to the public. An advantage to FIFRA guideline studies is that they provide essential details that are often lacking in open literature studies. There is ample evidence that endosulfan can be acutely poisonous to humans through accidental and intentional exposure as documented in California. Endosulfan is highly toxic to wildlife such as fish, which are killed as a result of endosulfan discharge into rivers, as well as application to wetlands at recommended rates. Endosulfan has been considered by some to be a persistent organic pollutant throughout the world because it has been detected in Europe in lakes in the Alps, Pyrenees, and Caledonian Mountains. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The studies in the last two decades of the 19th century and in the early 1900s focussed on the germicidal action of soaps, which had been used for cleaning by mankind for thousands of years. The first study indicating that soaps are toxic to bacteria was published in 1881 by Robert Koch who observed an inhibiting effect of potassium soap on the growth of anthrax bacilli. His work was followed by a number of studies on the germicidal action of different commercial soaps under a variety of conditions to determine their potential as general disinfectants. The results of these studies were somewhat conflicting, but cholera and diphtheria bacilli were found to be easily killed by most soaps, whereas typhoid bacilli and particularly coli bacteria and staphylococci were resistant. The conflicting results were thought to be caused by a difference in the composition of the commercial soaps used by the various investigators. After 1910, the studies therefore focussed on purified fatty acids and their potassium and sodium salts, i.e. the main components of commercial soaps, in the hope to determine whether or not a soap could be used as a disinfectant for a certain bacterium. These studies confirmed that free alkali were not the active ingredients in soaps but rather the neutral salts of fatty acids. The studies also showed that lipids and proteins, such as serum albumin, inhibited the germicidal action of soaps. This was of practical importance, for example for disinfection of bacteria in bodily fluids. In later studies, mostly after 1930, the diverse actions of fatty acids and their alkali salts were emphasized. These actions ranged from stimulation or inhibition of bacterial growth, depending on the bacterium and the concentration of fatty acids, to killing of the bacterium. Inhibition of sporulation of aerobic bacteria or spore germination of anaerobic bacteria was also observed. The difference between bacteriostatic and bactericidal actions was emphasized and a number of studies were carried out in the period from 1911 to the late 1940s to determine the nature of bacterial killing by fatty acids and soaps. In a number of studies, beginning as early as 1905, lipid extracts from leukocytes and lymphoid tissues, and particularly from inflammatory foci, were found to be bactericidal, suggesting a possible role of lipids in host defense against bacteria and in recovery from infection. This led to studies of a possible application for bactericidal fatty acids and their salts in cleaning of infected wounds and for use in wet dressings for wounds and abscesses. In the 1920s and 1930s there was a considerable interest in the therapeutic treatment of chaulmoogra oil for leprosy and of unsaturated fatty acids from cod liver oil for tuberculosis. With the advent of antibiotics in the 1940s and 1950s the interest in fatty acids and other lipids as antibacterial agents decreased greatly, at least temporarily, whereas there was a new interest in their effect on viruses in the 1960s. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Treatment was continued for 14. days, and at the end of this period, blood and tissue (liver, kidney, and gill) samples were collected. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were determined in blood and tissues for measurement of oxidant-antioxidant status. A significant elevation in the level of MDA, as an index of lipid peroxidation, and reductions in antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px) and low molecular weight antioxidant (GSH) levels were observed in DM-exposed fish. Treatment with lycopene attenuated the DM-induced oxidative stress by significantly decreasing the levels of MDA. In addition, lycopene significantly increased the SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities and the level of GSH.

Box 90 - STN, Canada","According to the FAO, the intensification of the livestock sector contributes to climate change, air pollution, soil and water degradation, and biodiversity depletion. The agricultural sector dependency on fossil fuels and energy intensive fertilizers contributes to the decrease of fuel reserves and additional anthropogenic GHG emissions. These environmental and energy concerns are leading to a renewed interest in environmental biotechnologies that can produce renewable energy, minimize environmental impact and add value to livestock operations' by-products. This paper describes the potential contribution of on-farm biogas production in reducing GHG emissions from livestock operation, either via the production of renewable energy to substitute fossil fuel, via the reduction of fugitive GHG emissions from stored manure and land-applied manures and via the reduction in chemical fertilizer needs for forages and cash crop productions. This paper describes the potential contribution of on-farm biogas production in reducing GHG emissions from livestock operation, either via the production of renewable energy to substitute fossil fuel, via the reduction of fugitive GHG emissions from stored manure and land-applied manures and via the reduction in chemical fertilizer needs for forages and cash crop productions. Anaerobic digestion biotechnologies produce biogas at average rates of 0.3, 0.25 and 0.48 L g-1 VS from swine, bovine and poultry slurries respectively. The biogas produced is of high quality with a methane concentration ranging between 60 and 80%. AD treatments can be an acceptable solution to the management of phosphorous surplus by precipitating up to 25% of the phosphorous in batch or semi-batch operated bioreactors and by additionally precipitating and concentrating up to 70% of the bioreactor effluent's phosphorous at the bottom of the long term storage. These effluents are more balanced to meet the crop needs thus reducing the need for supplementary chemical nitrogen fertilizers. Both the recovery of green energy and the reduced needs for chemical fertilizers will substantially decrease the carbon footprint of livestock food products. On-farm biogas production contributes to achieve more sustainable livestock operations by substantially reducing other environmental impacts related to manure management. It reduces the risk of water pollution associated with animal manure slurries (eutrophication) by removing 80 to 90% of the soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD). In addition, some AD processes are effective in eliminating populations of zoonotic pathogens and parasites present in livestock manures. AD also improves cohabitation in rural regions by reducing odour emissions by 70 to 95%. The reduction in odour allows more frequent and better timing for land applications of manure. Both the timing of application and the improve nutrients balance have the potential to improve nutrients uptake by the crops and minimize nutrient loss to the environment. The reduction in weed seeds during AD process reduces the need for herbicides and makes the bioreactor's effluent more acceptable for organic farming. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Box 90, Lennoxville STN, Canada"", ""Faculty of Agriculture and Agri-Food Sciences, Department of animal sciences, Université Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada""]","Over the last three decades, the potential role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on health and disease has been a worldwide center of attention. In the western typical diet, the omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio is at least 10 to 1, likely due to the high prevalence of vegetable oils (such as soybean oil, corn oil and sunflower oil) rich in omega-6 fatty acid. Since excessive amounts of omega-6 fatty acids contribute to rising incidence of many chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and whereas increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake cause a protective effect, a more balanced omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio is recommended (omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio between 1 to 1 and 3 to 1). A good natural source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid is seafood and particularly fish oil. Fish and marine products contain two major omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids - eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaemoic acid (DHA) - both of which appear to be beneficial for cardiovascular prevention, immune function, inflammatory response, infant development and mental health. Fish oils may also improve female fertility (ovulatory processes, premature birth and lactation). Although there is a large amount of information available on fish oil, omega-3 fatty acid supplement and their pleiotropic beneficial effects on global health, it is sometimes misleading and not always support by scientific findings, in particular in the case of male reproductive health. Therefore, this review considers the role played by fish oils supplement in male fertility, with large references to human and various animal models (pig, horse, cattle, fowl, rabbit and sheep). Many of the male fertility problems can be related to oligospermia (a low sperm count) or a poor sperm quality (cell with abnormal shape or low motility). In the management of male fertility, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids like others nutrients (vitamins, minerals, zinc, etc.) play a key role in reproductive health. Sperm cells require highly polyunsaturated fatty acids, in particular a high proportion of DHA to provide optimal cell membrane fluidity essential to sperm motility and fertilization success (acrosomal reaction and oocyte penetration). Some studies have suggested that subfertility could be related to the low DHA sperm content. As reported in human, in pig, and several others animal models, fish oil diet can alter significantly sperm fatty acid composition by increasing DHA and EPA content and modify omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio. Some studies have underlined the potential benefit of fish oil supplement on sperm count. However this effect is more controversial since a diet rich in energy or in proteins also increase sperm production. In fact, dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can affect male fertility directly by modifying sperm membrane composition but also indirectly through various mechanisms: prostaglandin synthesis, steroid metabolism and gene expression. In parallel to the benefit of consuming fish oil is the concern about potential harmful effects on male reproductive health. Because of his high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, sperm cells have a strong oxidative potential. In normal conditions, there is a balance between the generation of oxidants and antioxidant defense mechanisms. Dietary fish oil can induce an additional oxidative stress to the cell which is detrimental for sperm membrane fluidity and DNA integrity. In fact, it is suggested that any fish oil supplementation should be accompanied by antioxidants like vitamins E and C.There is also evidence that adding omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid to the diet can influence prostaglandin synthesis which could have an effect on testosterone secretion. Because chemicals such as PCB, pesticides, and sex hormones are fat-soluble, fish and fish oil can also be a dietary source of contaminants that may have deleterious effect on male reproduction. In conclusion, dietary fish oil may help to improve male fertility by increasing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in sperm cells and would be most beneficial with sperm of initial poor quality. However, a particular attention must be taken in regard to antioxidant supplementation. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

After normalizing the data to reduce or eliminate the influence of varying illuminance, stepwise forward variable selection was employed to select the proper band sets and fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed to discriminate crop and weeds. For the case of considering each species as a different class, classification accuracy reached 85% with eight selected bands while for the case of considering overall weed species as a class, classification accuracy was higher than 91% with seven selected bands. In order to develop a low-cost device and system in future, all combinations of two and three bands were evaluated to find the best combinations. The result showed that the best three bands can achieve a performance of 89% comparable to the performance achieved by five bands selected using stepwise selection.

G-type lysozyme, interleukin-8 (IL-8), Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD) and glucose transporter-1 and -4 (GLUT-1 and -4) genes were the early responders to the test substances as shown by their increased expression levels at 3-h post-incubation. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and GLUTs 2 and 3 showed significantly high levels of expression at 24-h post-incubation with the test substances and these genes could be the late responders. The expression levels of the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein/lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (BPI-LBP) and catalase were significantly upregulated in cells incubated with β-glucan but not with alginic acid at 24-h after exposure. Most of the genes studied, except Cu, Zn-SOD and GLUT-1 had enhanced transcription levels at 24-h post-incubation with β-glucan. In contrast, the expression of most of the genes in cells incubated with alginic acid, returned to the pre-incubation transcription levels by 24h.

Objectives: To assess the current serum concentrations of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis. p-chlorophenylethylene p,p'-DDE, the main DDT breakdown product, and of PCBs in women from two French administrative areas Ille-et-Vilaine and CÔte dOr. To identify determinants of the current serum levels among individual characteristics related to intake, metabolism, and excretion of organochlorines. Methods: We measured serum p,p'-DDE and PCB levels in 1055 general population women who were recruited in 2005-2007 to serve as controls in a case-control study on breast cancer. Associations between organochlorine levels and age, current body mass index BMI, BMI change during the last 10 years, dietary habits, breastfeeding history, residence area and education were assessed in multivariate analyses. Results: Median concentrations of p,p'-DDE and total PCBs were 85 and 240. ng/g lipid, respectively. Based on multivariate analyses, the main predictors of high p,p'-DDE levels included age and frequent consumption of saltwater fish in women below 50 years, and high BMI in older women. Total PCB levels increased markedly with age. Among older women, other important predictors of high PCB levels included frequent consumption of saltwater fish and low BMI. Our results are also suggestive of an inverse association between PCB levels and BMI gain during the last ten years. Women in CÔte d Or had significantly higher PCB levels than women in Ille-et-Vilaine. Conclusion: The patterns of associations between determinants and serum organochlorine concentrations suggest that human PCB contamination is still ongoing in France.

A series of focus groups comprised of gardeners, fishers, hunters, and boaters was convened in Oregon, USA. Findings indicate six belief barriers to changing leisure behaviors. These are the attitudes that: (1) behaviors, such as using pesticides, may be worse for the environment than invasive species; and (2) the fight against invasive species is a losing battle. Also, the norm beliefs that: (3) invasive species management is a low priority for many institutions; and (4) the general public does not know and does not care about invasive species. Finally, the behavioral control beliefs that: (5) one does not know enough about invasive species preventive behaviors to be effective; and (6) recommended preventive behaviors are too difficult to perform. Understanding the beliefs that inhibit behavior changes can help inform the creation of effective campaigns to engage stakeholders in finding solutions to halt the spread of invasive species, as well as provide a foundation on which to build additional research.

Achieving selfsufficiency in rice production has been considered the priority of successive governments during the past six decades to ensure food security, generate employment, and eliminate poverty. The agro-ecosystems of the country, which include crop cultivation, animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry, collectively provide almost all the food and other needs of the inhabitants. As a result of disintegration owing to structural, technological, and institutional, changes brought about by modem development, the village agroecosystem has become de-stabilized. This has led to over-dependence on external inputs and hence, self-sustainability of the village agro-ecosystem has ceased to exist except in some remote areas. Social, economic, and environmental sustainability are the three pillars of the sustainability framework for agriculture and food production. The current high-input-oriented conventional practice of agriculture lacks principles of sustenance where the nutrient balances have become negative for many systems, more marginal lands being cultivated, communal grazing lands have diminished, livestock become more dependent on crop land forages, etc. The development of new and innovative management strategies is thus a need to harness the maximum benefits of integrated systems. In this regard, the organic methods of food production, while significantly contributing to maintain the equilibrium in the ecosystems, can contribute substantially to feed the current and future human population on the current agricultural land base. Strategic mechanism to promote sustainability management of agricultural systems is required at all levels, with a cognizance from deep-rooted customs and traditions and the time-tested agricultural practices. Development of self-confidence, self-motivation, and empowerment of the farming community would overcome the over-dependence on external suppliers and supplies and would sustain the agricultural development of the country. A new development strategy encouraging pro-poor investments is hence a requirement by review of policies, understanding the suitability and availability of land resources, investing in research, and producing integrated development plans, in order to increase the productivity and profitability of environmentally sustainable practices. © 2012 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as Na +/K +-adenosine triphosphatase (Na +/K +-ATPase) activity, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were evaluated in the livers of the fish Goodea atripinnis after 96 h of exposure to water collected in March and June 2005 from three sites: Y (limnetic zone), L (Lerma tributary), and C (la Cinta tributary). Physical and chemical parameters of the lake water were also analyzed. Increases in CAT activity and LPO levels at all three sites were detected compared with control fish (P < 0.05), while GPx and SOD activities decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Na +/K +-ATPase activities were similar to the control in fish exposed to limnetic water from both March and June but were higher than control at the two tributary sites in March (P < 0.05); fish exposed to water from the Lerma tributary in June exhibited lower Na +/K +-ATPase than the control (P < 0.05). During March, CAT and Na +/K +-ATPase activities were increasing more than in June in Y and L, respectively, while in June, SOD and GPx were depleted more than March in L and Y and L, respectively.

rayyan-1227193650,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance epoxiconazole,2008,7,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,6,7,,[Anonymous],,English,,,"Epoxiconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on epoxiconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 28 April 2005. The peer review was initiated on 7 October 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF as identified by the rapporteur Member State. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in July - September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007 (in all sections) and in May 2007 (only ecotox).        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place in a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on cereals and sugar beet. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Opus"", a suspension concentrate (SC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of epoxiconazole.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. It has been identified that more information is necessary to enable the impact of potential different isomer ratios on the risk assessments to be better characterised        Mammalian toxicology of epoxiconazole was assessed in a row of tests. Epoxiconazole is absorbed rapidly but only to a limited extent (about 50%) after oral administration in rats. It is widely distributed in the body and although epoxiconazole has no potential for accumulation its elimination is slow. The substance is mainly excreted via faeces (about 78%) and urine (about 17%). Metabolism is rapid and extensive. At least 47 different metabolites have been identified in the rat. The active substance is of low acute toxicity by the oral, dermal and inhalation route. It is neither irritant to the skin nor to the eyes and has no skin sensitising potential.        The liver has been identified as the main target of toxicity in repeated dose tests with rats, mice and dogs. Epoxiconazole does not have genotoxic potential in vitro and in vivo. In a 24-months study in rats liver toxicity was observed and additionally ovary- and adrenal gland tumours were seen. In a 18 month carcinogenicity study in mice a treatment related increase in liver tumours has been observed based on which a classification of epoxiconazole as Xn; Care. Cat. 3 R40 ""Harmful; Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" was proposed. Based on the effects on reproduction seen in a two generation study in rats (dystocia, impaired fertility, prolonged gestation and vaginal haemorrhages) it was concluded to propose a classification with Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R62 ""Harmful; Possible risk of impaired fertility"". Based on developmental effects such as increases in number of resorptions, skeletal variations and malformations observed in relevant studies in rats and rabbits also a classification with Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R 63 ""Harmful; Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. Results from new in vitro studies and a new developmental study in rats confirm that epoxiconazole has endocrine disrupting properties but do not merit changing relevant NOAELs or revising the proposed classification according to an evaluation by the rapporteur Member State.        However, these new data have not been peer reviewed.        The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.008 mg/kg bw/d derived from an 18-month carcinogenicity study in mice applying a safety factor of 100. An acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.023 mg/kg bw has been derived based on the effects observed in two generation reproduction study in rats applying a safety factor of 100. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) of 0.008 mg/kg bw/d was derived from a subchronic dog study applying a safety factor of 100. In consideration of a dermal absorption of 50% both for the concentrate and the diluted preparation (the default value agreed upon by the majority of experts at PRAPeR 19, March 2007) the exposure estimates for operators were 39% and 700% of the AOEL when wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) with the German model and the UK POEM respectively. When no PPE is worn the values rise to 991% and 4918% respectively. Exposures for re-entry workers were amounted to 55.8% (without PPE) and 2.8% (with PPE) of the systemic AOEL respectively. Exposure of bystanders was estimated to amount to 3.75% of the systemic AOEL.        The metabolism of epoxiconazole in plants after foliar application is limited. Accordingly the proposed residue definition for monitoring is restricted to the parent compound. Indications are present that the accumulation of triazole metabolites in cereal grains is limited but due to some inadequacies in the design of the wheat metabolism study a firm conclusion on this is not possible.        A sufficient amount of supervised residue trials are available and MRL can be proposed covering the representative uses in cereals and sugar beets in both Northern and Southern European regions. The nature of the residue is not altered by processing. Processing data show that residues are preferably transferred to the bran fraction during the milling process and that no residue above the limit of quantification (LOQ) is expected to be present in beer from the brewing process.        Uptake of soil residues by rotational crops is not expected to lead to epoxiconazole residues above the LOQ. In contrast, a significant uptake of triazole metabolites (triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid) has been demonstrated at least for cereals.        Feed commodities from cereals and sugar beets may represent a significant source of exposure to epoxiconazole residues for animals Livestock metabolism studies in lactating goats and laying hens are available and based on the metabolic pattern in animal tissues the residue definition for monitoring can be restricted to the parent compound. Feeding studies in dairy cows are available and appropriate MRLs for animal products can be proposed.        For the time being the residue definition in plant and animal products for risk assessment is restricted to the parent compound. Inclusion of triazole derivative metabolites in this definition will need to be considered at a later stage.        These compounds (mainly triazole, triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid) which are common metabolites of all triazole fungicides have been recognized as hazards given their impact on reproduction. Toxicological reference values have been agreed by the PRAPeR expert meeting 14 on toxicology in January 2007.        Chronic and acute consumer exposures assessments have been carried out for parent compound only and were found to be well below the respective toxicological trigger values of epoxiconazole. Therefore provisionally no risk for the consumer has been identified under restriction of an uncertainty related to the isomer ratio consumer is actually exposed to. A robust conclusion on the risk will be possible when information on the actual level of triazole derivative metabolites in primary crops, rotational crops, and products of animal origin will be available. It must be noted that this lack of data is a generic issue and concerns all active substances of the triazole chemical class when their degradation pathway in primary crops, soil and livestock involves a cleavage of the triazole ring.        Sufficient data were available to demonstrate that in soil epoxiconazole exhibits medium to very high persistence. The available laboratory studies did not identify any major (> 10% AR) soil metabolites. One metabolite appearing in minor (max. 6.6% AR after 175 days) amounts is 1,2,4-triazole. Other possible degradation products after separation of the aromatic rings are simple monohalogenated acids. Metabolite 1,2,4-triazole is rapidly degraded by soil micro-organisms and it has low persistence, with a reported laboratory mean half-life of 8 days. In anaerobic soils, the first step in degradation is cleavage of the oxirane ring resulting in the formation of the alcohol, which is readilydehydrated to the alkene BF 480 entriazole (max. 8.6% AR after 120 days). Epoxiconazole is quite stable at soil surfaces under the influence of light.        Epoxiconazole is slightly to moderately adsorbed to soil and the leaching potential is low. Lysimeter studies were not triggered and FOCUS PEC groundwater calculations revealed no risk for groundwater contamination for the active substance or 1,2,4-triazole. A plateau concentration in soil of 0.167 mg/kg for epoxiconazole was calculated based on field accumulation studies.        Epoxiconazole and 1,2,4-triazole are hydrolytically stable at pH 5, 7 and 9. They are also stable under the influence of light in aqueous buffer solutions. However, in a sensitized photolysis study with natural water, epoxiconazole degraded with a half life of 52 days.        After a rapid sorption of the parent compound to the sediment, the predominant metabolite in both investigated water/sediment systems was BF 480-entriazole, being almost exclusively detected in the sediment phase (max. 32.3% AR after 59 days). Once in the sediment, BF 480-entriazole degrades with first order DT50 of 32-65 days. Besides CO2, no further degradation products of epoxiconazole were detected in significant amounts in both test systems during the incubation period. The calculated first order half lives of epoxiconazole for the total systems were 68 and 172 days. Some uncertainties were found in the assessment of the accumulation potential of BF 480-entriazole in sediment.        The volatilization experiments showed that epoxiconazole exhibits a very low average volatilization rate from plant and soil surfaces. It is not a relevant pathway for dissipation. If it however reached the troposphere it would be degraded with a half life of 4 days indicating a potential for long range atmospheric transport. After the experts' meeting the rapporteur Member State re-estimated a half-life of 1.83 days, but the calculation is not peer reviewed.        The first tier TER values indicated a potential high long-term risk to birds and mammals Measured residues were accepted in the expert meeting to refine the RUD values for herbivorous birds and mammals and to set the multiple application factor (MAF) to 1 provided that the residue studies were conducted with an application interval equal or lower than the interval of 21 days as suggested GAP. Whether it is sufficiently justified to use a MAF of 1 although intervals between applications were above 21 days for about half of the residues studies needs to be evaluated further at Member State level. The DT50 refinement for residue decline in plants was also discussed and it is suggested to use the geometric mean value of 14.5 days based on the available residue data. The suggested refinements of PT and PD used in the long-term risk assessment for birds were not sufficiently supported by data and therefore rejected in the meeting of experts. A data gap was identified for further refinement of the long-term risk assessment for birds.        The hare (Lepus europaeus), common vole (Microtus arvalis) and wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) were chosen as focal species to refine the long-term risk assessment for herbivorous mammals. The experts agreed to use the hare and the wood mouse as focal species in the refined risk assessment as suggested in addendum 2. The proposed PT value of 0.3 for hare was not accepted by the meeting since it was not based on radio-tracking data. It was considered not appropriate to derive an exact PT value from the submitted information. However the TER is >5 even without PT refinement and hence the risk to medium herbivorous mammals is considered as low. The suggested PT refinement for wood mouse was not agreed. The experts concluded that the submitted information is not sufficient to derive a robust quantitative PT refinement. The use of interception factors for residues on arthropods was also rejected. The suggested PD refinement was accepted. The resulting long-term TER of 3.9 is below the trigger of 5 indicating the need for further refinement of the risk assessment. A new long-term risk assessment for wood mouse was submitted by the applicant and assessed by the rapporteur Member State in addendum 4(not peer-reviewed).The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low as well as the risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water.        Algae and Lemna gibba were the most sensitive tested organisms. In order to detect long-term effects on fish a 28 d prolonged toxicity test, an early life stage test and three full life cycle tests were performed in order to investigate potential endocrine effects. A new test with Lemna gibba was perfumed and evaluated in addendum 2. The experts agreed to the assessment of the rapporteur Member State. The endpoint (7d EbC(50) = 0.0043 mg a.s./L) derived from standard test conditions should be used in the risk assessment. The endpoint derived from the test system with sediment present was considered as not being of direct use in the risk assessment since epoxiconazole partitions rapidly to the sediment and thus reducing the exposure of free floating Lemna fronds. The TERs were above the trigger of 10 in only 2 FOCUS step3 part scenarios (D4 pond, D5 pond) out of 9. No full FOCUS step 3 scenario resulted in TERs above the trigger. The available full life cycle studies with fish were discussed in the expert meeting. It was agreed that the latest study where fish were exposed to a single peak of epoxiconazole could be used in the risk assessment. The experts agreed that a NOEC of 0.03 mg a.s./L can be used in the risk assessment. The effect observed on male vitellogenin levels (NOEC = 0.012 mg a.s./L) was considered as not relevant since it did not affect the reproductive performance of the tested animals The long-term TERs for fish were above the trigger of 10 for all 9 FOCUS part scenarios as well as the TERs calculated with time weighted PECsw and the lower long-term endpoint for fish (NOEC of 0.01 mg a.s./L) which was based on effects on growth in one of the fish full life cycle tests conducted under flow-through conditions. Epoxiconazole was of similar toxicity to algae when formulated but was significantly more toxic to fish. The acute TERs for fish were above the trigger of 100 in the FOCUS step3 part scenarios D4 (pond) and D5 (pond). In the part scenario D4 (stream) a TER of 99 was calculated which is close to the trigger of 100. Taking into consideration that part of the active substance reach the surface water via drainage and run-off and thus not as the intact formulation the rapporteur Member State concludes that the acute risk to fish from the formulation BAS 480 13 F to fish is addressed for the full FOCUS scenario D4 (pond and stream). EFSA agrees to the opinion of the rapporteur Member State. The risk of bioaccumulation (BCF = 70) was assessed as low. The metabolites 1,2,4-triazole and BF480-entriazole were less toxic to aquatic organisms and the risk posed to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for the representative uses in cereals. The TERs for sediment dwellers was calculated as 5.3 and 40.3 (depending on the test system from which the endpoint was derived). Overall it is concluded that the aquatic risk assessment needs further refinement and/or risk mitigation such as no-spray buffer zones.        The acute risk of epoxiconazole to earthworms is low but the first tier long term TER values were below the Annex VI trigger of 5. Field studies were conducted to assess the effects of continued use of epoxiconazole on earthworm populations in treated fields and also a terrestrial model ecosystemstudy. The presented studies had some limitations but the long-term risk to earthworms and soil dwelling arthropods was sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated if all the available information is considered together        The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.

We previously reported an antibacterial protein in the skin secretion of the rockfish, Sebastes schlegeli, which showed selective antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. This study aimed to isolate and structurally and functionally characterize this protein. The antibacterial protein, termed SSAP ( S. schlegeli antibacterial protein), was purified to homogeneity by lectin affinity column chromatography, anion-exchange HPLC and hydroxyapatite HPLC. It was found to be a glycoprotein containing N-linked glycochains and FAD. Its molecular mass was estimated to be 120 kDa by gel filtration HPLC and 53 kDa by SDS/PAGE, suggesting that it is a homodimer. On the basis of the partial amino-acid sequence determined, a full-length cDNA of 2037 bp including an ORF of 1662 bp that encodes 554 amino-acid residues was cloned by 3 ' RACE, 5 ' RACE and RT-PCR.

SSAP was determined to have LAO activity by the H2O2-generation assay and substrate specificity for only L-Lys with a K-m of 0.19 mM. It showed potent antibacterial activity against fish pathogens such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida and Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida. The antibacterial activity was completely lost on the addition of catalase, confirming that H2O2 is responsible for the growth inhibition. This study identifies SSAP as a new member of the LAO family and reveals LAO involvement in the innate immunity of fish skin.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  66     Total Times Cited:  73     Cited Reference Count:  39,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2006.05570.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antibacterial protein;innate immunity;L-amino acid oxidase;rockfish Sebastes schlegeli;skin mucus;APOPTOSIS-INDUCING PROTEIN;ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE;RAINBOW-TROUT;PLATELET-AGGREGATION;SNAKE-VENOM;HISTONE H2A;PURIFICATION;FISH;SECRETIONS;GRAMMISTINS,NA,NA,identification of an antibacterial protein as lamino acid oxidase in the skin mucus of rockfish <i>sebastes schlegeli<i>
rayyan-1227193655,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance benfuracarb finalised: 28 July 2006,2006,9,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,9,,EFSA,,English,,,"Benfuracarb is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on benfuracarb in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 2 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 17 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Otsuka Chemical Co., Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 7 March 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises incorporation into soil (pre-plantation) to control soil and foliar insects, where brassica will be grown. Benfuracarb can be used as insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process only the use as insecticide was evaluated. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Oncol 8.6G"", a granule (GR), registered in France and Spain.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food of plant origin and surface water.        Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Benfuracarb is rapidly and nearly completed absorbed reaching in the rat. The main metabolite of benfuracarb is carbofuran (approximately 30%). The acute inhalatory toxicity is high, whereas the oral toxicity moderate. The toxicity via dermal route was low. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant nor a skin sensitizer, proposed risk phrases are: T, R23 ""Toxic by inhalation"" and R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" The critical effects are cholinesterase inhibition. Effects on reproduction parameters were observed such as, decreased male fertility, number of live pups and pup weight was decreased, even the entire second generation was lost The appropriate classification for reproduction toxicity could not be agreed and the question should be forwarded to ECB, R62 is high lighted. ECB has concluded R62 but not voted.        The main metabolite of benfuracarb is the active ingredient carbofuran which is more toxic than benfuracarb. The relevant impurity 1,2 dichloroethane, is classified as toxic, Carcinogenic Category 2 (T; R45).        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100.        The default value of 100% was agreed on for the granular formulation Oncol 8.6 G as no studies were provided. The estimated operator exposure according to the US PHED model is below (86%) the AOEL only if personal protective equipment as well as respiratory equipment is used.        The metabolism, distribution and residue behaviour of benfuracarb was investigated in various crops with different methods of application and at different timings. Based on studies involving a foliar treatment or stem injection a metabolic pathway of benfuracarb in directly treated plants could be established. Currently, benfuracarb, carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran were considered the relevant residues to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. Whether this will be fully applicable to all crops and regardless the mode of application still needs to be confirmed by further data, since the available data on soil applied uses didnt sufficiently identify potentially relevant metabolites for the supported brassica uses. Moreover a need to address residues of carbofuran in succeeding crops following application of benfuracarb was identified.        Based on the currently proposed residue definition, supervised residue trials in cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage indicated that no residues above the respective LOQ are anticipated, however the validity of the results needs to be confirmed by further data. Moreover the residue trial database for brassicas needs to be completed.        With the current knowledge and limited data available and with the provisionally agreed toxicological reference values for carbofuran it is only possible to asses consumer risk preliminary.        Consumer risk has been separately assessed by the rapporteur Member State for benfuracarb residues and for carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran residues. The estimated chronic dietary intake of benfuracarb and its metabolites carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran was found to be below the ADI of benfuracarb and carbofuran, respectively. A potential acute exposure concern noted for adults and toddlers (up to 370% of carbofuran ARfD) consuming head and flowering brassicas, is primarily caused by the limited sensitivity of the analytical methods applied in the residue trials. In the acute and chronic consumer risk assessment the possible intake of carbofuran through drinking water derived from groundwater was not considered although a significant contribution to the acute and chronic exposure might be expected.        Benfuracarb is rapidly degraded in soil under laboratory dark aerobic conditions yielding carbofuran (maximum 84.6 % AR after 2 d) as major metabolite. This metabolite is low to moderate persistent in soil according the studies presented in the benfuracarb dossier, but may be high persistent according some studies presented by a different applicant in the carbofuran dossier. Relevance of carbofuran data for the assessment of benfuracarb may need further consideration.        Other minor metabolites were detected (maximum sum of them: 34.9 % AR after 0.24 d) that individually did not reached the 10 % AR. Mineralization was high at the end of the study (CO2 = 27.7 % AR - 66.6 % AR). Amount of unextractable residues reached a maximum = 74.1 % at the end of the study in one of the soils.        Experts meeting agreed that 3-ketocarbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran (minor carbofuran metabolites containing the carbamate moiety) need to be addressed, as potential benfuracarb soil metabolites, for ground water contamination.        The applicant was required to address the degradation of benfuracarb in alkaline soils. A position paper and a new study are available but are still neither evaluated nor peer reviewed.        No soil photolysis study has been provided for benfuracarb. Carbofuran is photolytically stable on soil surface, according the data available in carbofuran dossier.        Degradation of carbofuran seems to be very dependent of the temperature. The rapporteur Member State informed that the applicant had submitted a position paper and a new study to address the degradation of carbofuran at low temperatures but these reports have still not been evaluated and peer reviewed.        Worst case laboratory half lives were used to calculate PEC soil of benfuracarb. Data from a different applicant in carbosulfan dossier show that field worst case half life for carbofuran is 71.9 d in EU sites. Therefore, carbofuran PECs soil were calculated by the rapporteur Member State with this half life. According the conclusion for carbofuran, reliability of this value needs to be further assessed and confirmed.        It was estimated, by the HPLC method, that benfuracarb may be classified as immobile in soil (K-oc = 9100 mL / g). Carbofuran may be classified as very high mobile compound (K-oc = 17 - 28 mL / g). No data is available with respect the adsorption desorption properties of minor relevant soil metabolites 3-OH-carbofuran and 3-keto-carbofuran.        A lysimeter study is available where two different lysimeters are investigated. Benfuracarb was found at maximum amounts of 0.25 mu g / L and carbofuran at maximum amounts of 0.16 mu g / L. A new lysimeter study was required by the rapporteur Member State in the DAR. The meeting of MS experts agreed that the new FOCUS GW modelling required can substitute the requirement for a new lysimeter at this stage.        Hydrolysis of benfuracarb is pH dependent with half lives between less than half hour (pH 4) and 26.9 d (pH 9). In the natural water experiment (pH approximate to 7-8) photolysis seems not to contribute significantly to the aqueous degradation of benfuracarb. However, irradiation seems to enhance the degradation of the metabolite carbofuran to carbofuran-7-phenol.        Benfuracarb is not readily biodegradable.        A study with two water sediment systems is available. Both systems are in the alkaline range (pH (water) 7.8-8.4). Main compounds found in the water phase are benfuracarb and carbofuran (maximum = 58.26 % AR after 2d). Main compounds found in the sediment phase are carbofuran (maximum = 25.31 % after 14 d) and carbofuran-7-phenol (maximum = 13.6 %). The cumulative amounts of CO2 at the end of the study accounted for 13.6 % AR and 16.7 % AR. Most of the radioactivity was present as bounded residue to the sediment by the end of the study (73.8 % AR = 75.9 % AR).        Benfuracarb dissipates rapidly in water phase with a half life between 6 h to 15 h. Main dissipation process is transformation to carbofuran. Carbofuran dissipates from water phase with half life between 8.2 d to 27.2 d. Main dissipation process is partitioning into sediment. Whole system and sediment phase half lives had not been calculated. A report with the estimation of the whole system half life is available but not evaluated and peer reviewed. Also the half life in the sediment for carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol needs to be assessed.        In the carbofuran dossier, dissipation of carbofuran in the water sediment was investigated in two studies with a total of three systems. In an acidic system carbofuran degraded in the whole system with a half life of approximately 41 d. In the neutral or alkaline systems carbofuran dissipated from the water phase with half lives of 5.3-6.9 d and degraded in the whole system with half lives of 7.8 - 11.6 d. These experiments seem to indicate that the degradation of carbofuran may be pH dependent in water sediment systems.        PECSW of carbofuran has been calculated for a limited number of FOCUS sw scenarios. Calculation of PECSW, for parent benfuracarb and PECSED for benfuracarb, carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol, need to be performed. Updated FOCUS PECSW / (SED) are available but have still not been evaluated and peer reviewed.        PEC gw have been calculated for benfuracarb and carbofuran. Annual average 80th percentiles of benfuracarb were < 0.001 mu g / L for all calculated scenarios (7 cabbage spring, 5 cabbage summer). Carbofuran exceed the 0.1 mu g / L trigger in 4 of the 7 spring scenarios and in three of the five summer scenarios. In one of the summer scenarios (Hamburg) an 80th percentile annual average of 1.212 mu g / L was reached. The applicant was required to address the potential for ground water contamination by the metabolite 3-keto carbofuran. New calculations to address potential groundwater contamination by metabolites 3-OH-carbofuran, carbofuran-7-phenol and 3-keto-carbofuran are available but neither evaluated nor peer reviewed. However, it is noted that these calculations do not take into consideration the longer half lives observed for carbofuran from the data of the second carbofuran applicant.        Concentrations of benfuracarb in the air compartment are expected to be negligible, due to short persistence in the atmosphere.        An addendum to the fate and behaviour chapter has been provided the 18th of May 2006. The information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability. Studies or reports presumably submitted by the applicant are not adequately referenced.        Substantial data requirements to address the risk to birds and mammals from uptake of granules, ingestion of treated seedlings and contaminated earthworms were identified by the rapporteur Member State. Further studies were submitted by the applicant. The aquatic risk assessment based on PECsw from drainage resulted in a high acute and chronic risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates in 2 out of 3 scenarios. Based on the peer-reviewed data a high risk to aquatic organisms cannot be excluded. However the new data need to be evaluated before drawing a final conclusion on the risk to aquatic organisms. The risk to bees from exposure to residues in cabbage was assessed as low since cabbage has no flower in the production crop. The potential risk to bees from residues in flowering weeds should be assessed at Member State level taking into account the agricultural practice (management of weeds in cabbage fields). Data requirements were identified in the DAR to address the risk to ground dwelling arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and other non-target organisms. New data/information was submitted by the applicant. An addendum to the chapter on ecotoxicology has been provided on the 18th of May 2006. When reported, the information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability.        The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative use.

Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises incorporation into soil (at drilling) to control soil insects, where maize and sugar beet will be grew. The application rate is 0.75 kg carbosulfan per hectare. Carbosulfan can be used as insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process only the use as insecticide was evaluated.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Marshal 10G"", a granule (GR), registered in some Member States of the EU.        It should be noted that the applicant no longer supports the second formulation, presented in the dossier and DAR (""Marshal 25CS""). Consequently the uses on citrus and cotton are no longer supported.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food of plant origin, soil and water.        Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        Carbosulfan is toxic if swallowed and should be classified as T, R25 ""Toxic if swallowed"". It is of low toxicity via dermal route and toxic via inhalation (classification as T, R23 is proposed).        Carbosulfan is not a skin or eye irritant but is a skin sensitiser and should be classified R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". Carbosulfan gave negative results in in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests and did not show any carcinogenic potential. Nevertheless, the level of impurities in batches used for toxicological studies remains a concern. In the three-generation rat study, the relevant maternal and reproductive NOAEL was 1.2 mg/kg bw/day. In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, the relevant maternal and developmental NOAEL was 2 mg/kg bw/d. Carbosulfan displayed no potential for induced delayed neurotoxicity. The provisional reference values are as follows: ADI and ARfD are 0.01 mg/kg bw/day; AOEL is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day. The risk assessment for operators has to be considered as inconclusive until the AOEL is confirmed. However, it can be assumed that bystander and worker exposure is likely to be negligible under the supported conditions of use.        The metabolism, distribution and residue behaviour of carbosulfan was investigated in various crops with different methods of application. Based on these studies the metabolic pathway of carbosulfan in plants can be considered as sufficiently investigated. At the time being, carbosulfan, carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran were considered the relevant residues to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. However, the metabolite dibutylamine is still under discussion concerning its possible genotoxicity and ought to be therefore considered a potential candidate to include in the residue definition, too. Moreover a need to address residues of dibutylamine but also carbofuran and its metabolites in succeeding crops following application of carbosulfan was identified.        Based on the currently proposed residue definition, supervised residue trials in sugar beet and maize indicated that residues were low and mostly below the respective LOQ. However, the available residue trials have to be reconsidered for their validity and sufficiency. With regard to the metabolite dibuytlamine no residue data have been reported. Further residue data in cotton seed and citrus will be needed if foliar uses are reinstated in the future.        Since the assessment of plant residues still needs to be finalized and due to the lack of peer reviewed evaluation of relevant data and information it is not possible to conclude on whether or not significant residues may occur in edible animal matrices.        The consumer risk assessment should be considered as inconclusive due to the uncertainties caused by lacking data identified during the evaluation.        In soil under laboratory aerobic conditions, carbosulfan yields carbofuran (max. 48.7 % - 69.3 % AR after 7 d). Also 3-keto-carbofuran is produced in significant amounts (max. 5.3 % - 6.6 %) and needs to be further assessed as it contains the active carbamate moiety. The mineralization was very limited and bounded residues increased up to maximum of 90 % AR after 100 d. In a study performed with 14C-dibutylamine labelled carbosulfan, dibutylamine was found as a major aerobic soil metabolite.        No valid degradation study of carbosulfan in soil under anaerobic conditions is available. Also photolysis in soil was not investigated. Metabolite carbofuran was considered stable to photolysis in soil in its DAR.        Evaluation meeting agreed that a re-evaluation of the degradation kinetic in degradation studies had to be performed. Reassessment is available but has not been evaluated and peer reviewed. Therefore, end points for laboratory soil degradation of carbosulfan have not been established.        Summaries of some field dissipation studies in EU are available. Half life of carbosulfan in these trials ranges between 0.35 to 31.3 d and half life of carbofuran is between 1.3 to 71.9 d. EFSA notes that, in the context of the carbofuran discussion, the meeting of MS experts was not able to determine the reliability of these studies. A position paper is available (June 2005) but has still not been assessed and peer reviewed. PEC in soil were calculated in the DAR for carbosulfan and carbofuran based on the field worst case half lives and the representative uses in maize, sugar beet, citrus and cotton. Evaluation meeting agreed that half life and PEC soil of dibutylamine need to be determined. A position paper is already available but has not been evaluated and peer reviewed.        The rapporteur Member State concluded that the soil adsorption / desorption study is of limited quality. The meeting of MS experts agreed that the study was not valid and identified a data gap for a valid study for carbosulfan and dibutylamine. For the metabolite carbofuran an additional study (from a different notifier Dianica) is available in its dossier as active substance.        A lysimeter study is available. However, annual average concentrations and detailed characterization of the residue are missing. Evaluation meeting agreed that levels of dibutylamine need to be determined in the leachate samples and that the two new lysimeters performed with carbofuran should be submitted and assessed. These studies and a position paper are already available but have not been evaluated and peer reviewed.        Carbosulfan hydrolyses with half lives lower than 1 d at pH 5 and 7 and of 7 d at pH 9. Main products are carbofuran and dibutylamine. Carbofuran degrades to carbofuran-7-phenol.        Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of carbosulfan in water. Two regions of polar degradation products (66.7 % AR) were found but not characterized. Their environmental relevance is uncertain and was not examined by the meeting of MS experts since the study was still not evaluated. Carbosulfan is not readily biodegradable.        Carbosulfan was low persistent in aerobic water / sediment systems. Main metabolites formed were carbofuran (max. 34.7 % AR in water; max. 20.1 % AR in sediment) and carbofuran-7-phenol (max. 11.6 % AR in water; max. 3.21 % AR in sediment). A non characterized metabolite (Unknown 3) appears at levels above 10 % AR in the sediment of some systems (max. 20.11 % AR after 7 d). This compound has been tentatively identified as a structure that contains the carbamate moiety and may be expected to produce carbofuran when degraded. The amount of bound residues increased steadily up to 30.5 - 43.0 % AR at the end of the experiments (102 d).        No half lives are reported in carbosulfan DAR for metabolites carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol in the water / sediment systems. From water / sediment studies summarized in the carbofuran DAR, carbofuran degraded in the whole system with a first order half life of approximately 41 d. Available water sediment studies under alkaline conditions (from carbofuran applicant Dianica) show a faster degradation of carbofuran and the formation of carbofuran-7-phenol at high levels.        PECSW/SED were calculated by the applicant based on an ad hoc modelling exercise. Evaluation Meeting confirmed the rapporteur Member State data requirement for FOCUS SW PECSW/SED and agreed that PECSW for dibutylamine need to be calculated. FOCUS SW calculations and a position paper for dibutylamine are available but have not been evaluated and peer reviewed.        The applicant presented an estimation of the potential for ground water contamination based on the FOCUS GW scheme (PRZM). The rapporteur Member State considered that half life and Koc employed for carbofuran in the calculation were not justified and proposed a data requirement for new PECGW. This data requirement was confirmed by the Evaluation Meeting that additionally required calculation of PECGW for metabolite dibutylamine. New FOCUS GW calculations for carbofuran and a position paper for dibutylamine are available but have not been evaluated and peer reviewed. Additionally, experts meeting indicated that potential ground water contamination by soil metabolite 3-keto-carbofuran should be addressed.        It is not expected that neither carbosulfan nor its transformation product carbofuran (from data in carbofuran dossier) may contaminate the air compartment or be prone to long range transport through air.        An addendum to the fate and behaviour chapter has been provided on 18 May 2006. When reported, the information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability. Studies or reports presumably submitted by the applicant are not adequately referenced. Therefore studies submitted by the applicant after the DAR was submitted are considered neither evaluated nor peer-reviewed in this conclusion.        The first tier risk assessment based on generic species identified a potential risk to insectivorous birds in citrus and cotton, to medium herbivorous birds in cotton and to small herbivorous mammals in citrus from foliar application of carbosulfan. Only a small number of granules have to be ingested by a small bird to reach the acute LD50 or the LC50, hence the risk of ingestion of granules should be further addressed. The number of granules that have to be ingested by a small mammal to reach the LD50 is relatively high and since granules are not attractive to mammals the acute risk is considered to be low. Few granules are however needed to reach the NOAEL for mammals and the long-term risk needs to be further addressed. Also the risk from ingestion of treated seedlings, contaminated earthworms, fish and drinking water needs to be evaluated.        Carbosulfan and the metabolite carbofuran are classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. For citrus and cotton the risk assessment indicates acute and long-term risk to aquatic organisms even with 50 m buffer zones based on contamination by spray drift only. Based on available data for PECsw, a long-term risk is indicated for all representative uses evaluated from exposure to the metabolite carbofuran via drainage to surface water. The assessment needs to be refined based on FOCUS modelling of PECsw.        Carbosulfan is toxic to bees. For the representative uses in citrus and cotton the risk needs to be further addressed by semi-field or field tests. Since sugar beet crop is not flowering the risk from the use in sugar beet is considered low. The risk to bees from exposure to carbosulfan/carbofuran in nectar and pollen following granular application was not assessed due to non evaluated data on oral toxicity for carbofuran. Laboratory studies confirm that carbosulfan is toxic to arthropods. Further semi-field or field studies are required to evaluate the risk. The risk to earthworms from the use of MARCHAL 25 CS is considered as low. For the granular formulation further clarification is needed on whether the field study with MARCHAL 25 CS can be used for the assessment. No evaluation of the risk to soil micro-organisms and non-target plants is available. For biological methods of sewage treatment the risk is considered to be low.

Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative as insecticide and nematicide comprise the application by spraying or via the drip irrigation system to control a range of soil insects and nematodes in bananas and potatoes at application rates of up to 6 kg cadusafos per hectare. In case of potatoes incorporation into soil takes place after the application. Cadusafos can be used as insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated that only the use in bananas will be supported in the EU review process.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Ruby 200 CS"", a capsule suspension (CS). Preparations containing cadusafos are registered in Cyprus, France, Greece and Spain.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition only for soil, water and air, i.e. cadusafos in soil, water and air. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Insufficient data are available for the determination of cadusafos in the technical material and in the representative formulation to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        The absorption of cadusafos is extensive and rapid, the excretion is mainly via urine, without evidence of body accumulation. The acute oral toxicity is high, and the acute inhalation and dermal toxicity are very high. The proposed classification is T+, R26/27 ""Very toxic by inhalation and in contact with skin""; T, R25 ""Toxic if swallowed"". The main effect after short term oral administration is the decrease of cholinesterase activities in all species. Cadusafos has no genotoxic potential and is not considered to be carcinogenic. In the two-generation rat study, there was no effect on reproductive performance or fertility, and in the rat and rabbit teratology studies, no evidence of teratogenic effects in the absence of maternal toxicity. Supplementary studies were performed due to the introduction of a new impurity in the technical material. The acute and subchronic oral tests revealed no difference in toxicity. The Ames test was negative.        The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.0007 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.003 mg/kg bw/day. The comparison of the oral and dermal LD50 values results in a dermal absorption value of 100%. The operator exposure estimates are based solely on one specific and restricted representative use in bananas, with automatic drip irrigation, work rate of 1 ha/day, application rate of 6 kg a.s./ha, and assuming that the microcapsules in the formulation do not release cadusafos until they are diluted for application. The results are below the AOEL according to the currently used models which do not apply properly to this particular scenario. Worker and bystander exposures are expected to be very low due to the mode of application by drip irrigation.        The metabolism of cadusafos has been investigated on several crops after soil application. The representative use on potatoes can be considered as adequately covered by these data and the residue definition for this use can be cadusafos only, for both monitoring and risk assessment. The available residue trials in potatoes for Southern Europe are however not sufficient to draw a robust conclusion on the residue levels consumers may be exposed to. The available data suggest that residues are below 0.01 mg/kg, but results from trials in Northern Europe indicate that the currently available data may underestimate the actual situation. Further supervised residue trials should be carried out.        For the representative use on bananas, although 2 metabolism studies for this crop were submitted, the data are not sufficient to propose a residue definition. This is due to major deficiencies in the studies, making it impossible to evaluate the possible presence of degradation products still exhibiting the anticholinesterase activity of the parent compound. Therefore a new metabolism study in bananas is needed as well as residue trials carried out according to the representative use pattern. The compounds to be analysed in the residue trials should be determined on the basis of the results of the metabolism study.        The situation for rotational crops has not been addressed by the notifier, although the soil persistence of the compound exceeds the trigger value for conducting uptake and metabolism studies in succeeding crops. Therefore these studies should be requested.        Based on the current knowledge of the residue situation in potatoes, the exposure of livestock is very low and metabolism studies in domestic animals do not need to be carried out. Only preliminary acute and chronic exposure assessments could be conducted for the use on potatoes, but these assessments need to be re-examined on the basis of complete and robust data. No MRLs can be proposed at this stage.        The available data demonstrate that in soil cadusafos degrades to the minor (<10% applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone. Mineralisation of the butyl-2-C-14 radiolabel accounted for 43-71% AR after 90-120 days incubation at 25(circle)C. The values for residues not extracted by acetonitrile / water were 25-32% AR after 90-120 days. In soil cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and methyl-2-butyl sulfone exhibited low persistence.        In guideline batch soil adsorption studies cadusafos exhibited medium mobility. There was no evidence of pH dependant adsorption. Data on the adsorption of methyl-2-butyl sulfone were not available. As this metabolite accounted for > 5% AR at 2 consecutive sampling points in a soil route of degradation study, information on its mobility in soil is required to complete the groundwater exposure assessment for this metabolite.        In sediment water systems cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and produced no major metabolites. It dissipated by partitioning to sediment, volatilising and mineralising to CO2 (butyl-2-C-14 radiolabel accounted for 12-18% AR after 100 days incubation at 20(circle)C). Residues not extracted from sediment by acetonitrile/water accounted for only 6-8% AR at 100 days.        The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on bananas (application via drip irrigation) just in Tenerife indicated that surface water exposure and consequently sediment exposure would be negligible. This conclusion is specific to this use in Tenerife and should not be applied to bananas grown elsewhere. The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on potatoes is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route of entry to surface water for initial PEC in aquatic systems. However MS would need to carry out a surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessments from the runoff and drainage routes of exposure at the national level, as the available EU level assessment does not cover these situations.        The available FOCUS groundwater modelling for potatoes and the specifically parameterised scenario for bananas in Tenerife for parent cadusafos has not been carried out with appropriate soil DT50 or Henry's law parameters. The potential for groundwater contamination is therefore currently unclear. New groundwater modelling is therefore required for cadusafos. A groundwater leaching assessment for the soil metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone is triggered. It is not available.        Cadusafos is moderately volatile and volatilisation will contribute to dissipation from soil and water. However cadusafos is not expected to be subject to long range transport via the upper atmosphere due to a relatively rapid calculated photochemical oxidative degradation rate with hydroxyl radicals.        In the first tier assessment an acute and long-term risk was identified for insectivorous birds. A risk was also identified for earthworm-eating birds and mammals as well as for fish-eating birds and mammals for the use in potatoes. Since the use in potatoes was withdrawn by the applicant the refinements of the risk to birds and mammals from this use was not further considered. For the use in banana plantations a conclusion on the risk to birds and mammals can not be reached at this stage. The risk needs to be further addressed based on species that occur in banana plantations and their associated diets.        Cadusafos is very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The assessment indicates a high risk. However, for the specific use in banana plantations in Tenerife the risk to aquatic organisms is considered low based on negligible contamination of surface water.        The toxicity to bees is high, but since for the proposed uses application will be to bare soil the risk is considered low. No in-field exposure of leaf dwelling non-target arthropods is expected from the evaluated uses. The available test with Poecilius cupreus was conducted at an application rate which is lower than the proposed. An ongoing study with Aleochara bilineata should be submitted for the use in banana due to the perceived low sensitivity of P. cupreus. For the application of cadusafos by drip-irrigation to banana plants no off-field exposure is expected.        A high acute and long-term risk was identified for earthworms. The ongoing field study conducted in United Kingdom should be submitted and the relevance for the proposed uses should be addressed. It should be noted that the application rate in this study is 4.5 kg cadusafos per hectare, which is below the proposed application rate for the intended uses. A study with Collembola and mites is required to address the risk to other soil macro-organisms. The risk to soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment plants is low. For the drip irrigation use in banana no off-crop exposure is expected and hence the risk to non-target plants is considered low.

rayyan-1227193659,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance metconazole finalised: 13 January 2006,2006,2,NA,EFSA JOURNAL,1831-4732     J9  - EFSA J     JI  - EFSA J.,4,2,,EFSA,,English,,,"Metconazole is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.        Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on metconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 27 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 16 April 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April - Mai 2005.        A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.        The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control foliar and ear diseases in cereals and oilseed rape at application rate up to 90 g metconazole per hectare. Metconazole can be used only as fungicide.        The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Caramba 60 SL"", a soluble concentrate (SL), registered in some EU Member States.        Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food and soil can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of metconazole.        Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible.        The acute oral toxicity of metconazole is moderate (a classification Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed). Metconazole is of low acute dermal and inhalatory toxicity. It is not a skin or eye irritant or a skin sensitiser. The relevant NOAEL for short term toxicity is 6.4 mg/kg bw/day. Adrenals, liver and spleen were detected as target organs. Overall, metconazole is not genotoxic. The NOAEL for chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity is 4.4 mg/kg bw/day. It was considered that the compound was unlikely to be classified as a carcinogenic substance. The NOAELs for parental, reproduction and offspring toxicity are 8 mg/kg bw/day; based on the absence of effect on fertility in the rat 2-generation study (only modification of fertility parameters at maternotoxic doses). Both compounds are embryo- and foetotoxic at doses also producing maternal toxicity in rat developmental toxicity studies. Therefore, classification as Repro Cat. 3 (Xn; R63) was agreed on. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Levels (AOEL) are 0.01 mg/kg bw/day based on an overall NOAEL of 4 mg/kg bw/d with a safety factor of 400 (the increased SF is due to teratogenic effects).        Operator exposure is below the AOEL when PPE is worn. The exposure during re-entry activities and for bystanders is negligible.        In the plant metabolism studies conducted in wheat and oilseed rape, metconazole, triazolyl alanine and triazolyl acetic acid were identified as the major components of the total residues in the edible plant parts of the tested crops. Triazolyl alanine is a common metabolite of triazole fungicides, and its toxicological profile was considered as sufficiently investigated. The residue of concern in cereals and oilseed crops is therefore metconazole only. The enrichment of edible plant parts of succeeding crops with metconazole was not sufficient to reach quantifiable levels, when metconazole is used according cGAP. A complete residue trials data base on wheat, rye, triticale and oilseed rape was provided for Northern and Southern Europe and allowed MRL proposals. For barley uses in Southern Europe additional trial data need to be submitted to confirm the compliance with currently proposed MRL based on Northern European trials. Due to low consumer exposure industrial or household processing studies are not required.        Since significant residues occur in potential feed stuff, metabolism studies have been submitted in lactating goats and laying hens. In lactating goats, metconazole undergoes an extensive metabolisation, but was still detected in edible goat matrices bar kidney. All the metabolites found in goat tissues have been recovered in the rat. In a non peer reviewed addendum (December 2005) RMS concluded that representative uses do not give rise to significant residues in animal products and MRLs do not need to be proposed.        In contrast, estimates of possibly occurring residues levels in animal matrices done by EFSA indicated that relevant residue levels might be expected in ruminant liver. According to current guidelines a feeding study with ruminants would be required and MRLs for food of animal origin (i.e. ruminant liver) need to be proposed. In laying hens, the metabolic profile was not further investigated and no such data is currently required since the intake by poultry is not significant with regard to the representative uses.        The dietary risk assessment performed for different consumer groups indicates that there are no chronic and acute concerns related to dietary exposure resulting from the representative uses.        Sufficient data were available to demonstrate that in soil metconazole exhibits medium to high persistence based on northern and southern European field studies where applications were made in May and June. Consequently the available laboratory studies did not identify any major (>10% of applied radioactivity (AR)) soil metabolites. Mineralization of the 3,5-triazole-14C radiolabel accounted for 10.3% AR in dark aerobic laboratory soil studies after 91 days. The formation of unextracted residues in the soil organic carbon was the significant sink (accounting for 12-28% AR at 91-112 days). Metconazole exhibited low mobility in soil (based on evidence from laboratory soil batch adsorption studies) There was no evidence that adsorption changed with variation in soil pH.        In natural sediment water systems (dark laboratory studies) metconazole dissipated from the water relatively rapidly by partitioning to sediment. Once in the sediment degradation was slow with metconazole exhibiting high to very high persistence. The 3,5-triazole-C-14-label, did not mineralize to CO2 at all. Formation of unextracted sediment radioactivity (11-19%AR at 100 days) and the formation of up to 6 resolved minor (<= 9% AR) metabolites (5 identified) accounted for the slow loss of metconazole in these static experimental systems. It is a concern, that from the acceptable standard guideline studies required and provided, in terms of accounting for the route of breakdown and completing the material balance of metconazole, it is only possible to conclude that metconazole is persistent in the sediment of aquatic systems (there was no evidence that the metabolites formed were mineralised, the only sink identified was unextracted sediment radioactivity). Based on the available data, photolysis is not expected to be a significant process in the breakdown of metconazole in natural aquatic systems.        The environmental exposure assessments available are sufficient to complete the necessary EU level estimates of Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) for the representative uses applied for, for annex 1 listing. Because of the persistence of metconazole in soil and aquatic sediment it was necessary for exposure assessments to take into account the potential accumulation of metconazole in these environmental matrices from potential use in consecutive years. Member States must also do this when assessing potential uses of metconazole at the national level. Member States also need to carry out aquatic exposure and risk assessments from the drainage and runoff routes of exposure to surface water as these routes of entry have not been considered in the EU level assessments available.        FOCUS groundwater modelling indicated a low potential for groundwater contamination in vulnerable situations over a wide range of geoclimatic conditions across the EU for the uses assessed in this conclusion. (At all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios annual average leachate concentrations of metconazole leaving the top 1m soil layer were predicted to be below the parametric legal drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L).        The acute and short-term risk to birds and the acute risk to mammals are low from the representative uses. The first tier TER values indicated a high long-term risk for insectivorous and herbivorous birds (TER of 2.3 to 3.1) and a high long-term risk to herbivorous mammals. The EPCO experts meeting identified the requirement for further information to justify the choice of the focal species and data on more species to refine the long term risk to insectivorous birds. The experts meeting agreed to the refinement of long-term exposure based on residue data in cereals. The long-term risk to herbivorous birds was shown to be low for both representative uses. However, further refinement steps are necessary to address the risk to small herbivorous mammals for the representative use in cereals (TER of 2.9). The acute and the long term risk to mammals from the representative use in oilseed rape are considered to be low.        The risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning from uptake of contaminated earthworms was discussed at the experts meeting. It was agreed that the TER calculations should be based on the plateau PECsoil plus one application. The resulting TER values for birds and mammals of 10.5 and 5.3 are above the Annex VI trigger of 5 indicating a low risk from the representative uses. The risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated drinking water was calculated by EFSA according to Sanco/4145/2000 in an addendum. The first tier TER values indicated a high short-term and long term risk to birds and a high long-term risk to mammals. A refined risk assessment for the uptake of contaminated drinking water is required for the intended uses in cereals and oilseed rape.        The acute risk to aquatic organisms is low. The long-term risk to fish and daphnids is high and risk mitigation measures such as buffer zones up to 15 m are required.        The Annex VI trigger values were not met for NTA in a first tier testing. The higher tier tests showed that the risk to non-target arthropods is low.        A field litter bag study has been performed at an application rate equivalent to the supported GAP. No effects were observed in the study after 3 months and after 6 months of exposure. As some drawbacks have been identified in the study, the experts meeting set a data requirement to submit a new litter bag study available to the applicant. The evaluation of this new study would allow completing the risk assessment.        The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants is considered to be low for the representative uses.

In conjunction with refuges of non-Bt host plants, fitness costs can delay the evolution of resistance. Furthermore, fitness costs often vary with ecological conditions, suggesting that agricultural landscapes can be manipulated to magnify fitness costs and thereby prolong the efficacy of Bt crops. In the current study, we tested the effects of four species of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) on the magnitude and dominance of fitness costs of resistance to Bt toxin Cry1Ac in pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). For more than a decade, field populations of pink bollworm in the United States have remained susceptible to Bt cotton Gossypium hirsutum L. producing Cry1Ac; however, we used laboratory strains that had a mixture of susceptible and resistant individuals. In laboratory experiments, dominant fitness costs were imposed by the nematode Steinernema riobrave Cabanillas, Poinar, and Raulston but no fitness costs were imposed by Steinernema carpocapsae Weiser, Steinernema sp. (ML18 strain), or Heterorhabditis sonorensis Stock, Rivera-Orduno, and Flores-Lara. In computer simulations, evolution of resistance to Cry1Ac by pink bollworm was substantially delayed by treating some non-Bt cotton refuge fields with nematodes that imposed a dominant fitness cost, similar to the cost observed in laboratory experiments with S. riobrave. Based on the results here and in related studies, we conclude that entomopathogenic nematodes could bolster insect resistance management, but the success of this approach will depend on selecting the appropriate species of nematode and environment, as fitness costs were magnified by only two of five species evaluated and also depended on environmental factors.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  67,10.1603/EC10087     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ecological negative cross-resistance;Pectinophora gossypiella;resistance management;simulation modeling;Steinernema riobrave;PECTINOPHORA-GOSSYPIELLA SAUNDERS;ENTOMOPATHOGENIC NEMATODES;BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL;INSECT RESISTANCE;TRANSGENIC CROPS;BT RESISTANCE;HOST-PLANT;EVOLUTION;LEPIDOPTERA;GELECHIIDAE,NA,NA,effects of four nematode species on fitness costs of pink bollworm resistance to <i>bacillus thuringiensis<i> toxin cry1ac

The key emphasis was placed on the variants of the swarm intelligence algorithms, namely the artificial bee colony (ABC), genetic algorithm, flower pollination algorithm (FPA), particle swarm, the ant colony, firefly algorithm, artificial fish swarm, and Krill herd algorithm because they had been widely employed in the agricultural sector. There was a broad consensus among scholars that certain BIAs' variants were more effective than others. For example, the Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm and genetic algorithm were best suited for farm machinery path optimization and pest detection, among other applications. On the contrary, the particle swarm algorithm was useful in determining the plant evapotranspiration rates, which predicted the water requirements and optimization of the irrigation process. Despite the promising applications, the adoption of hyper-heuristic algorithms in agriculture remained low. No universal algorithm could perform multiple functions in farms; different algorithms were designed to perform specific functions. Secondary concerns relate to data integrity and cyber security, considering the history of cyber-attacks on smart farms. Despite the concerns, the benefits associated with the BIAs outweighed the risks. On average, farmers can save 647-1866 L on fuel which is equivalent to US$734-851, with the use of GPS-guided systems.

During 3 years of sampling, biomarkers at all levels of biological organisation from the molecular to the ecosystem level were applied and tested on 742 individual fish of body lengths between 18 and 25 cm. At the ecosystem level, the fish were taken as a habitat for the parasite assemblage. The hypothesis was that changes in the environment might lead to changes in the species diversity of parasites and in the infection intensity of single species, as well as between heteroxenic and monoxenic parasite species (H/M ratio). At the molecular level, activity of the CYP1A-dependent monooxygenase ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) was used as a biomarker of exposure. At the subcellular level, the integrity of lysosomal membranes in hepatocytes was taken as an indicator of non-specific acute and chronic toxic effects. Both biomarkers are recommended by the ICES Advisory Committee on the Marine Environment for the application in biological effects monitoring programmes. In addition, neutral lipid content in the liver was used as a marker for pathologically induced fat accumulation. In the same individual fish, a new method for the measurement of macrophage aggregate activity in the liver was tested for its application and reliability in reflecting immunosuppression. Tests were accompanied by chemical analysis of standard organochlorine and heavy metal residues in flounder tissue, A total of 33 parasite species were found. As an indicator species, the mean abundance of Trichodina sp. reflected best the pollution gradient observed with highest infection intensity at the most polluted location. Species diversity was significantly higher in fish caught near the reference site and significantly lower in fish from the polluted Elbe estuary. The use of the heteroxenous/monoxenous species ratio as a marker was not useful at the locations investigated because of the dominance of heteroxenous species at all habitats. Since EROD activity and macrophage aggregate activity were dependent on sex and maturity of female flounder, only male fish were taken into consideration for the integrated evaluation of data. All biochemical and histochemical tests were able to reflect accurately the site-specific differences, as well as an observed pollution event at the end of 1995 as determined by chemical analyses. The correlation analysis revealed a connection not only between the single parasitological and biochemical parameters but also within these groups.

It is a silverfish that may be difficult to eradicate because it utilizes many parts of a building. Heavy use of pesticides is undesirable from a health perspective, and baits with low concentrations of toxins are consequently preferable. To safeguard the indoor environment during management, the present study describes procedures for the efficient control of Ctenolepisma longicaudata with small amounts of bait. This is as efficient, as sprayable pesticides and declines with more than 90% reduction of the pest population can be achieved within 15 to 20 weeks. Successful eradication can be achieved with as little as 0.5 to 1.0 g bait per 100 m(2).        Pest management strives to be an efficient, yet healthy and environmentally safe control method, and the use of poisoned bait often fulfils these criteria. In the present study, we show that bait with indoxacarb as the active ingredient is highly efficient for controlling Ctenolepisma longicaudata (Escherich, 1905) and two of its relatives, Lepisma saccharina (Linnaeus, 1758) and Ctenolepisma calva (Ritter, 1910). Applying small bait droplets (size similar to 10 mg) along the walls of several types of buildings, at no more than 0.5 to 1.0 g bait per 100 m(2), was a cost-efficient and safe strategy for the knockdown and eradication of C. longicaudata. During field experiments, the demography changed from an initial mixture of different stages to total dominance of early instars preceding the population collapse. Poisonous bait outcompeted mass-trapping with sticky-traps and conventional insect spray treatment for the efficient control of C. longicaudata in apartments. Different droplet densities (1 vs. 0.5/m(2)) and active ingredients (indoxacarb vs. clothianidin) did not have different effects in field experiments. These results show that poisoned bait is a highly relevant tool for managing C. longicaudata and potentially against other silverfish infestations.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  42,10.3390/insects11120852     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Ctenolepisma longicaudata;control;demography;efficiency;poisoned bait;population collapse;safe strategy;GERMAN COCKROACHES DICTYOPTERA;FIELD-EVALUATION;INDOXACARB;SECONDARY;ZYGENTOMA;Poisoning;Poisons,NA,NA,development of a poisoned bait strategy against the silverfish <i>ctenolepisma longicaudata<i> escherich 1905

Objectives: This study aimed to assess spray-workers' management of insecticide risk indicators and occupational insecticidal poisoning. Materials and        Methods: An analytical cross-sectional survey was adopted, that involved all of the professional indoor residual spray-workers serving in the Omo-Nada woreda (district), Ethiopia. The survey was conducted between January and April 2011 by administering a pretested questionnaire. All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS v. 19.0. A two-sided Fisher's exact test was performed to determine associations between the variables.        Results: Overall, 52.4% of the study participants had an awareness of the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), whereas 41.9% were unable to read the pesticide labels. About 75.3% of spray-workers never drink or eat or smoke, while spraying. Statistical analysis (two-sided Fisher's exact test) confirmed that there is no statistically significant association between safe insecticide practice with the spray-worker's gender (P = 0.332), whereas, there were strong correlations found with age (P = 0.001), educational status (P = 0.001) and years of work experience (P = 0.001).        Conclusions: Despite adequate awareness of safe insecticide management, most of the spray-workers were observed to be reluctant to put this knowledge into practice, either due to the inadequacy of PPE or negligence. Furthermore, a sizable faction of these workers still had limited knowledge and erroneous risk perceptions, thus increasing their risk of OIP.

The parasitic sea lamprey contributed to the devastating collapse of native fish communities after invading the Great Lakes during the 1800s and early 1900s. Economic tragedy ensued with the loss of the fishery and severe impacts to property values and tourism resulting from sea lamprey-induced ecological changes. To control the sea lamprey and rehabilitate the once vibrant Great Lakes ecosystem and economy, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission (Commission) was formed by treaty between Canada and the United States in 1955. The Commission has developed a sea lamprey control programme based on their physiological vulnerabilities, which includes (i) the application of selective pesticides (lampricides), which successfully kill sedentary sea lamprey larvae in their natal streams; (ii) barriers to spawning migrations and associated traps to prevent infestations of upstream habitats and remove adult sea lamprey before they reproduce; and (iii) the release of sterilized males to reduce the reproductive potential of spawning populations in select streams. Since 1958, the application of the sea lamprey control programme has suppressed sea lamprey populations by similar to 90% from peak abundance. Great Lakes fish populations have rebounded and the economy is now thriving. In hopes of further enhancing the efficacy and selectivity of the sea lamprey control programme, the Commission is exploring the use of (i) sea lamprey chemosensory cues (pheromones and alarm cues) to manipulate behaviours and physiologies, and (ii) genetics to identify and manipulate genes associated with key physiological functions, for control purposes. Overall, the Commission capitalizes on the unique physiology of the sea lamprey and strives to develop a diverse integrated programme to successfully control a once devastating invasive species.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  61     Total Times Cited:  67     Cited Reference Count:  162,10.1093/conphys/cox031     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Conservation physiology;integrated pest management;invasive species;population control;sea lamprey;MALE-RELEASE TECHNIQUE;3-TRIFLUOROMETHYL-4-NITROPHENOL TFM;LAMPRICIDE TFM;PHEROMONE COMMUNICATION;POTENTIAL APPLICATION;ENVIRONMENTAL FATE;ACUTE TOXICITY;CASE-HISTORY;GUIDE USE;LARVAL,NA,NA,use of physiological knowledge to control the invasive sea lamprey <i>petromyzon marinus<i> in the laurentian great lakes

The floodwaters flowing into nearshore areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) were known to contain oils, metals, and a wide range of pathogens and enteric bacteria, and there was also concern about synthetic chemical contaminants from flooded businesses and homes. The Northwest Fisheries Science Center was asked to mount an immediate response, both to collect samples of fish and shrimp from the potentially affected area as well as providing a wide range of chemical and microbiological analyses. Consequently, we conducted several sampling cruises from a variety of research vessels and chartered fishing boats in the GoM over the course of the following 12 months. While we sampled many species, we focused our analyses on Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulalus and white shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus. Sampling began on 13 September 2005, within 1 week after floodwater pumping was intitated, and continued through September 2006. More than 300 seafood, water, and sediment samples were analyzed for a suite of organic chemical contaminants, including organochlorines, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs). The samples were also tested for bacterial contamination, including fecal contaminants such as Escherichia coli and potentially pathogenic Vibrio spp. While a range of both chemical and microbiological substances were detected, none were present in edible tissues at levels that posed any appreciable risk to human consumers of seafood products from the GoM, assuming that normal seafood preparation practices were followed. Petroleum-derived PACs in whites shrimp from both Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound increased over several sampling periods in the fall and early winter (p < 0.001). However, these levels were quite low and had declined considerably by April 2006. Other than the increases in petroleum-derived PACs. our findings suggested little evidence of increased levels of contaminants immediately following the hurricane; however, the lackk of prestorm data hampered that determination. A lack of standard protocols, as well as issues related to risk assessment methodologies, complicated the ability to provide a coordinated multiagency communication of the results.

This RfD is based on retrospective studies of an acute poisoning incident in Iraq in which grain contaminated with a methylmercury fungicide was inadvertently used in the baking of bread.(1) The exposures, which were relatively high but lasted only a few months, were associated with neurological effects in both adults (primarily paresthesia) and infants (late walking, late talking, etc.). It is generally believed that the developing fetus represents a particularly sensitive subpopulation for the neurological effects of methylmercury. The USEPA derived an RfD of 0.1 mug/kg/day based on benchmark dose (BMD) modeling of the combined neurological endpoints reported for children exposed in utero. This RfD included an uncertainty factor of 10 to consider human pharmacokinetic variability and database limitations (lack of data on multigeneration effects or possible long-term sequelae of perinatal exposure). Alcoa signed an Administrative Order of Consent for the conduct of a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) at their Point Comfort Operations and the adjacent Lavaca Bay in Texas to address the effects of historical discharges of mercury-containing wastewater. In cooperation with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and USEPA Region VI, Alcoa conducted a baseline risk assessment to assess potential risk to human health and the environment. As a part of this assessments Alcoa pursued the development of a site-specific RfD for methylmercury to specifically address the potential human health effects associated with the ingestion of contaminated finfish and shellfish from Lavaca Bay. Application of the published USEPA RfD to this site is problematic; while the study underlying the RfD represented acute exposure to relatively high concentrations of methylmercury, the exposures of concern. for the Point Comfort site are from the chronic consumption of relatively low concentrations of methylmercury in fish. Since the publication of the USEPA RfD, several analyses of chronic exposure to methylmercury in fish-eating populations have been reported. The purpose of the analysis reported here was to evaluate the possibility of deriving an RfD for methylmercury, specifically for the case of fish ingestion, on the basis of these new studies. In order to better support the risk-management decisions associated with developing a remediation approach for the site in question, the analysis was designed to provide information on the distribution of acceptable ingestion rates across a population, which could reasonably be expected to be consistent with the results of the epidemiological studies of other fish-eating populations. Based on a review of the available literature on the effects of methylmercury, a study conducted with a population in the Seychelles Islands was selected as the critical study for this analysis. The exposures to methylmercury in this population result from chronic, multigenerational ingestion of contaminated fish. This prospective study was carefully conducted and analyzed, included a large cohort of mother-infant pairs, and was relatively free of confounding factors.        The results of this study are essentially negative, and a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) derived from the estimated exposures has recently been used by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) as the basis for a chronic oral minimal risk level (MRL) for methylmercury. In spite of the fact that no statistically significant effects were observed in this study, the data as reported are suitable for dose-response analysis using the BMD method. Evaluation of the BMD method used in this analysis, as well as in the current USEPA RtD, has demonstrated that the resulting 95% lower bound on the 10% benchmark dose (BMDL) represents a conservative estimate of the traditional NOAEL, and that it is superior to the use of ""average"" or ""grouped"" exposure estimates when dose-response information is available, as is the case for the Seychelles study. A more recent study in the Faroe Islands, which did report statistically significant associations between methylmercury exposure and neurological effects, could not be used for dose-response modeling due to inadequate reporting of the data and confounding from coexposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). BMD modeling over the wide range of neurological endpoints reported in the Seychelles study yielded a lowest BMDL for methylmercury in maternal hair of 21 ppm. This BMDL was then converted to an expected distribution of daily ingestion rates across a population using Monte Carlo analysis with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to evaluate the impact of interindividual variability. The resulting distribution of ingestion rates at the BMDL had a geometric mean of 1.60 mug/kg/day with a geometric standard deviation of 1.33; the 1st, 5th, and 10th percentiles of the distribution were 0.86, 1.04,- and 1.15 mug/kg/day. In place of the use of an uncertainty factor of 3 for pharmacokinetic variability, as is done in the current RfD, one of these lower percentiles of the daily ingestion rate distribution provides a scientifically based, conservative basis for taking into consideration the impact of pharmacokinetic variability across the population. On the other hand, it was felt that an uncertainty factor of 3 for database limitations should be used in the current analysis. Although there can be high confidence in the benchmark-estimated NOAEL of 21 ppm in the Seychelles study, some results in the New Zealand and Faroe Islands studies could be construed to suggest the possibility of effects at maternal hair concentrations below 10 ppm. In addition, while concerns regarding the possibility of chronic sequelae are not supported by the available data, neither can they be absolutely ruled out. The use of an uncertainty factor of 3 is equivalent to using a NOAEL of 7 ppm in. maternal hair, which provides additional protection against the possibility that effects could occur at lower concentrations in some populations. Based on the analysis described above, the distribution of acceptable daily ingestion rates (RfDs) recommended to serve as the basis for site-specific risk-management decisions at Alcoa's Point Comfort Operations ranges from approximately 0.3 to 1.1 mug/kg/day, with a population median (50th percentile) of 0.5 mug/kg/day. By analogy with USEPA guidelines for the use of percentiles in applications of distributions in exposure assessments, the 10th percentile provides a reasonably conservative measure. On this basis, a site-specific RfD of 0.4 mug/kg/day is recommended.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  236,,benchmark dose;exposure assessment;methylmercury;Monte Carlo;reference dose;risk assessment;IN-UTERO EXPOSURE;MACACA-FASCICULARIS INFANTS;COLLABORATIVE BEHAVIORAL TERATOLOGY;METHYL MERCURY NEUROTOXICITY;EVOKED-POTENTIAL ALTERATIONS;SEYCHELLES CHILD-DEVELOPMENT;VISUAL RECOGNITION MEMORY;PERINATAL PCB EXPOSURE;ADVERSE EFFECT LEVELS;PRENATAL METHYLMERCURY;Eating,NA,NA,determination of a sitespecific reference dose for methylmercury for fisheating populations

This presentation was subsequently published (Smrchek and Morcock 1999). Recently, there has been a great increase in harmonization activities between OPPTS and OECD. Many additional activities are currently ongoing in five test method areas: physical chemical properties (e.g., K-ow methods), effects on biotic systems (ecological effects, e.g., Lemna growth inhibition, covered elsewhere), fate (degradation and accumulation, e.g., aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation), health effects, and in special activities such as in method development and testing of endocrine disrupters (e.g., avian reproduction, fish whole life cycle). The goal remains as before: to harmonize OPPTS guidelines (eventually to be published final as parts 810-885 in volume 40 of the U.S, Code of Federal Regulations) and test guidance with OECD so as to avoid unnecessary and duplicative testing of those chemicals marketed on a world wide basis, to increase efficiency, save test animals, and to reduce nontariff barriers to trade. The latest harmonization activities and results achieved, with a specific emphasis on aquatic and sediment methods are presented. ASTM has played and must continue to play an important part in the U.S. role in the development of these OECD tests. Recent activities include revision of OECD Test Guideline No. 202, Daphnia sp., Acute Immobilisation Test; development of a new oligochaete reproduction test; two chironomid sediment tests (spiked water and spiked sediment); an oligochaete bioaccumulation test; and a guidance document on Aquatic Toxicity Testing of Difficult Substances and Mixtures. Challenges and potential problems for effective harmonization continue to be present. These can be categorized into internal within the U.S. EPA and external to the agency. The former include having adequate available resources, redistribution and changes in workloads to accommodate OECD work, continual education to demonstrate the advantages of harmonization, and obtaining continued support in an environment of budget constraints. External aspects include challenges from the public, the problem of incurring continuing harmonization costs by U.S. industry, accommodating voluntary standards organizations such as ASTM, and difficulties in developing a ""U.S. position"" on OECD test guidelines. There also continue to be difficulties (not unexpected) in coordination, communication, and cooperation in expert panels and among participating OECD member countries.

Subsequently, recombinant gcSAA protein (rgcSAA) was prepared from a prokaryotic expression system after codon optimization of its coding sequence. The direct antibacterial activity assay and the plate count assay disclosed that gcSAA inhibited the growth and survival of A. hydrophila but not Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida) which both are common bacterial pathogens in aquaculture. The propidium iodide (PI) uptake assay confirmed the bactericidal property of gcSAA, showing that it is able to enhance the uptake of PI in A. hydrophila but not E. piscicida.

In the present study, we reported the functional characterization of zebrafish nos2a during bacterial infection. We found that zebrafish nos2a promoted bacterial proliferation, accompanied by an increased susceptibility to Edwardsiella piscicida infection. The nagative regulation of zebrafish nos2a during E. piscicida infection was characterized by the impaired ROS levels, the induced NO production and the decreased expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, antibacterial genes and oxidant factors. Furthermore, although both inducing ROS and inhibiting NO production significantly inhibited bacterial proliferation, only inhibiting NO production but not inducing ROS significantly increased resistance to E. piscicida infection. More importantly, ROS supplementation and inhibition of NO completely abolished this detrimental consequence mediated by zebrafish nos2a during E. piscicida infection. All together, these results firstly demonstrate that the innate response mediated by zebrafish nos2a in promoting bacterial proliferation is dependent on the lower ROS level and higher NO production.

Thereby, tambaqui specimens were submitted to two different Trichlorfon concentrations (30% and 50% of LC50-96 h) under experimental conditions. The retrotransposons were analyzed using the FISH technique and the heterochromatin standard with the C-band technique. The retrotransposons studied presented a dispersed distribution profile in the tambaqui karyotype with Rex3 being more prominent than the others, showing the greatest increase in markings. Furthermore, the heterochromatin profile showed that these retrotransposons can be found in the heterochromatic portions of the chromosomes. Thus, it was observed that Trichlorfon has an activation mechanism for these retroelements, especially Rex3. Rex retroelements are the best-known transposable elements class and are broadly distributed through fish and also individual genomes, playing an important role in their evolutionary dynamics. Several agents can stress these elements; among them, there are some parasitic compounds such as the organochlorophosphate Trichlorfon. Consequently, knowing that the organochlorophosphate Trichlorfon is indiscriminately used as an antiparasitic in aquaculture, the current study aimed to analyze the effects of this compound on the activation of the Transposable Elements (TEs) Rex1, Rex3, and Rex6 and the structure of heterochromatin in the mitotic chromosomes of the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum). For this, two concentrations of the pesticide were used: 30% (0.261 mg/L) and 50% (0.435 mg/L) of the recommended LC50-96 h concentration (0.87 mg/L) for this fish species. The results revealed a dispersed distribution for Rex1 and Rex6 retroelements. Rex3 showed an increase in both marking intensity and distribution, as well as enhanced chromosomal heterochromatinization. This probably happened by the mediation of epigenetic adaptive mechanisms, causing the retroelement mobilization to be repressed. However, this behavior was most evident when Trichlorfon concentrations and exposure times were the greatest, reflecting the genetic flexibility necessary for this species to successfully adapt to environmental changes.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  44,10.3390/ani12151945     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FISH;heterochromatinization;organophosphate;repetitive elements;TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS;REPETITIVE DNA;ORGANOPHOSPHORUS PESTICIDES;REX3;CHARACIFORMES;SEQUENCES;CATFISH;GENES;Trichlorfon;Antiparasitic Agents,NA,NA,a perspective of molecular cytogenomics toxicology and epigenetics for the increase of heterochromatic regions and retrotransposable elements in tambaqui <i>colossoma macropomum<i> exposed to the parasiticide trichlorfon

Two radar surveillance stations were installed on Sivuqaq, including at the Northeast Cape. High levels of persistent organic pollutants and toxic metals continue to leach from the Northeast Cape formerly used defense (FUD) site despite remediation efforts. We quantified total mercury (Hg) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations, and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures, in skin and muscle samples from Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), an important subsistence species. We found that Hg and PCB concentrations significantly differed across locations, with the highest concentrations found in fish collected near the FUD site. We found that 89% of fish collected from near the FUD site had Hg concentrations that exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) unlimited Hg-contaminated fish consumption screening level for subsistence fishers (0.049 mu g/g). All fish sampled near the FUD site exceeded the EPA's PCB guidelines for cancer risk for unrestricted human consumption (0.0015 mu g/g ww). Both Hg and PCB concentrations had a significant negative correlation with 813C when sites receiving input from the FUD site were included in the analysis, but these relationships were insignificant when input sites were excluded. 815N had a significant negative correlation with Hg concentration, but not with PCB concentration.

However, there is little information about how culturally specific fish consumption contributes to exposure to toxicants. In this work, we surveyed fish consumption among Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese communities and purchased 103 seafood samples from local markets in Chicago. Each sample was analyzed for mercury (Hg) and 92 organic chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and Dechlorane Plus and related compounds (DPs). The rank order of pollutant concentration in all samples was Hg >> Sigma(66)PCBs > Sigma(17)OCPs > Sigma 8PBDEs > Sigma(8)DPs. Positive correlations were noted among most contaminant groups. Bluefish, pike, tuna steak, and albacore tuna had the highest mean Hg (>300 ng/g). The mean Sigma(66)PCBs was highest in pike and bluefish (>100 ng/g) followed by pollock and mackerel (>40 ng/g). Overall, octopus, shrimp and tilapia were the least contaminated; while pike, bluefish, and pollock were the most contaminated. Omega-3 fatty acids were more strongly affiliated with the organic contaminants than mercury. A risk assessment identified seven types of fish that should have consumption limitations and six that should not be consumed. For these seafoods, consumption advice based on Hg levels would adequately protect health, except for mackerel. In the survey participants, 10.3% of seafood mass consumed is from types of fish that should be limited to 1 or 2 meals/week, while 1.3% of the seafood mass consumed comes from types that should not be consumed at all.

In the present study, we identified and characterized a Ly-6D homologue (named PoLy-6D) from the teleost fish Paralichthys olivaceus and examined its immune function. PoLy-6D possesses a hydrophobic signal peptide, a LU domain including a conserved ""LXCXXC"" motif in N-terminus and a ""CCXXXXCN"" motif in C-terminus. Under normal physiological condition, PoLy-6D expression distributes in all the examined tissues, the highest three tissues are successively spleen, head kidney, and blood. When infected by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and viral pathogen, PoLy-6D expression was induced and the patterns vary with different types of microbial pathogens infection and different immune tissues. In vitro experiment showed recombinant PoLy-6D (rPoLy-6D) inhibited the lysis of rabbit red blood cells by serum and selectively improved bacterial survival in serum. After serum were treated by antibody of rPoLy-6D, bacteriostatic effect of serum was obviously enhanced. These results indicate the importance of PoLy-6D as a complement regulator. rPoLy-6D possessed the binding activity to multiple bacteria but did not exhibit antimicrobial activities. The interaction between rPoLy-6D and bacteria suggests that PoLy-6D is involved in host clearance of pathogens probably by serving as a receptor for pathogens.

T.Norl.) is a significant environmental weed in coastal New South Wales (NSW). Control of extensive infestations of bitou bush within native vegetation can be undertaken using aerial herbicide application. Aerial spraying to control bitou bush proved to be a suitable control option following herbicide studies on native plant species which showed they were tolerant to the aerial application at very low rates during winter months (Toth et al. 1993). This technique was developed following ground based herbicide trials carried out in the late 1980s near Jervis Bay, NSW, in which six herbicides were initially trialled for the control of bitou bush. At the same time, a permit was granted to deliberately apply the same herbicides to seven native plant species, being Acacia longifolia subsp. sophorae (Labill.) Court, Banksia integrifolia L.f., Casuarina glauca Sieber ex Spreng., Leptospermum laevigatum (Gaertn.) F.Muell., Leucopogon parviflorus (Andrews) Lindl., Monotoca elliptica (Sm.) R.Br. and Lomandra longifolia Labill., to determine their response to off-target damage associated with bitou bush control. The results showed that only herbicides containing glyphosate or metsulfuron methyl as the only active ingredient were effective for controlling bitou bush (Toth et al. 1996). In addition, the effect of low rates of glyphosate on the native species produced no measurable damage, and low rates of metsulfuron methyl resulted in only ephemeral damage to L. laevigatum and L. parviflorus. Hence these two herbicides proved sufficiently selective for bitou bush (Toth et al. 1993). A subsequent trial was undertaken to examine the seasonal sensitivity of bitou bush to glyphosate and metsulfuron methyl. These herbicides were also trialled to determine an effective application rate for bitou bush control amongst native species. The two-year trial indicated that bitou bush is at least twice as sensitive to glyphosate in winter than during summer, especially following peak winter flowering (Toth 1997). There was no apparent trend with metsulfuron methyl. Effective bitou bush control during the winter was also achieved with very low rates of both herbicides. Similar seasonal and rate trials were subsequently carried out on five of the native plant species, being A. longifolia subsp. sophorae, B. integrifolia, L. laevigatum, L. parviflorus and L. longifolia to examine if there was also a seasonal and application rate tolerance. The results showed a seasonal tolerance of these native plants to low rates of herbicides applied during winter. However, seedlings of A. longifolia subsp. sophorae showed some sensitivity to glyphosate (Toth et al. 1996). The combined results indicated that low rates of glyphosate and metsulfuron methyl applied during winter not only controlled bitou bush, but were unlikely to result in significant off-target damage to native plant species. Independently, Anderson (1989) trialled aerial boom spraying of bitou bush at 8 L ha-1 of glyphosate [four times the current rate] at South Stradbroke Island which showed control was selective for bitou bush with little damage to native species. However subsequent examination showed that three species may be adversely impacted (see Toth et al. 1996); further analysis of these three species following control at 2 L ha-1 shows that such impacts are likely to be reduced at the lower application rates currently used. A series of herbicide trials were then carried out using aerial boom spraying in NSW in which very low rates of glyphosate (2 L ha-1 of Roundup® (36 g L-1 glyphosate)) and metsulfuron methyl (30g L-1 of Brushoff® (600 g kg-1 metsulfuron methyl)) were applied to bitou bush infestations. These results supported the original ground based trials described above. Penetrants were also trialled during the ground based herbicide applications for glyphosate and metsulfuron methyl. The addition of Pulse® (1020 g L-1 polyether modified polysiloxane) had a negative effect on L. lavigatum in that it lead to a greater degree of leaf burn. Based on this result Pulse® has not been recommended for use in the aerial spraying of bitou bush (Toth et al. 1996). A further trial in 1997 examined the potential use of Roundup Bioactive® (36 g L-1 glyphosate) for aerial spraying of bitou bush, however, the results indicated that Roundup Bioactive is more phytotoxic to the following five native plant species Scaevola calendulacea (Andrews) Druce, Carpobrotus glaucescens (Haw.) Schwantes, Myoporum boninense Koidz. and Correa alba Andrews, than either Roundup® or Brush-off® (Toth unpublished data). As no other herbicide was used in this trial the results do not necessarily translate to other generic brands of glyphosate or metsulfuron methyl. Using aerial boom spraying to control bitou bush in New South Wales Aerial boom spraying (hereafter aerial spraying) to control bitou bush has been undertaken along the NSW coastline between Narooma and Tweed Heads since 1992. However, it was not until 2006 that best practice guidelines were developed (Broese van Groenou and Downey 2006). The guidelines, which are a checklist of events in chronological order, highlight the complexity of aerial spraying for weeds, especially in natural ecosystems, and the degree of coordination and knowledge needed to undertake aerial spraying. These guidelines are now used widely when planning and undertaking aerial spraying of bitou bush in NSW. The outcome of 15 years of aerial spraying to control bitou bush in New South Wales has revealed that while large areas can be treated effectively, follow-up control is essential to managing bitou bush recruitment, as well as secondary weed invasion, after each aerial spraying operation. And, more importantly, that aerial spraying should only be undertaken when resources are available to undertake such follow-up control work. Where areas are being aerially sprayed on a regular basis (i.e. annually), the use of one application of metsulfuron methyl may help to prevent any possibility of herbicide resistance to glyphosate developing in bitou bush. Repetitive use of metsulfuron methyl in annual applications is not recommended at this stage because of the residual effects of metsulfuron methyl and comparatively less information available on its impact to native species. To assist with revegetation, aerial direct seeding during aerial spraying operations has also been employed in some areas. The results of these aerial seeding trials are inconclusive due to the influence from a number of external factors. For example, success when using scarified seeds is dependent on rain within several days of the application. However if rain does not occur, seed viability can decrease dramatically. Aerial spraying has proved to be efficient and cost effective for broad-acre control of bitou bush in NSW compared to ground based herbicide application, especially over large areas and in areas that are otherwise inaccessible (e.g. coastal cliffs). Developing an aerial spot spraying methodology In the past few years, another method of aerial control has been developed for bitou bush. The technique, known as aerial spot spraying, uses ground based spraying equipment mounted onto a helicopter. This spray rig has a modified nozzle within a metal conical casing which is lowered from the helicopter directly over the targeted plants. The herbicide can therefore be applied to individual or isolated bitou bush plants within native vegetation or in inaccessible areas (e.g. cliff faces). This technique has been used widely over the past few years and is now contributing to the aerial management of bitou bush in NSW. It must be noted that this techniques uses ground based application rates of herbicide and not the low herbicide rates used in aerial boom spraying. Assessing the impact of aerial spraying on native species In addition to the seven native species originally tested for herbicide sensitivity (see above), further information has been gathered over the past 15 years on the herbicide sensitivity of other plant species (native and weeds). This observational data has been collected on the response of 220 plant species (weeds and natives) to glyphosate and 83 to metsulfuron methyl to date (see Broese van Groenou and Downey 2006). However information is still needed for many native plant species, particularly in relation to their response to metsulfuron methyl. It should be noted that these data are based on results from basic formulations of glyphosate (i.e. Roundup® - 36 g L-1 glyphosate) and metsulfuron methyl (Brushoff® - 600 g kg-1 metsulfuron methyl) only. Thus, further research is needed into other formulations, as extrapolations to such formulations are not warranted based on the trials with penetrants (see above). The effect of aerial spraying on rare and endangered species is of particular significance, for example research by Matarczyk et al. (2002) found that spray drift from ground-based applications of glyphosate can adversely impact populations of Pimelea spicata R.Br., an endangered species in NSW. It is therefore important to take a precautionary approach and locate rare and threatened species on each site prior to aerial spraying, so that these areas can be appropriately protected from any potential adverse impacts (see Broese van Groenou and Downey 2006). These species can either be excluded from the aerial spraying area with suitable buffers demarcated, or in some instances covered, for example with hessian (see Broese van Groenou and Downey 2006).",Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 7,,Acacia;Acacia longifolia;Banksia integrifolia;Carpobrotus;Casuarina glauca;Chrysanthemoides monilifera;Leptospermum;Leptospermum laevigatum;Leucopogon parviflorus;Lomandra longifolia;Monotoca elliptica;Myoporum;Myoporum boninense;Pimelea spicata;Scaevola calendulacea;New South Wales;Wales;Learning,NA,NA,bitou bush aerial spraying in new south wales what have we learned

It has a widespread, though declining distribution in England and parts of Wales but does not occur naturally in Scotland. The North American signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana), is not native to Europe and was introduced to Britain in the 1970s. The signal crayfish out-competes the native white-clawed crayfish as it is larger and more aggressive. It is also responsible for the introduction and spread of crayfish plague, which has devastated white-clawed crayfish populations in Europe. Signal crayfish populations are causing significant changes to the equilibrium of native flora and fauna through increased grazing and predation pressures; they also contribute to habitat degradation through burrowing. Manual removal of crayfish using traps and pond trials with biocides have met with moderate success in reducing crayfish numbers and containing populations. However, with new populations of signal crayfish being reported each year within the UK, there is now an urgent need to develop a strategy with which to eradicate or contain their spread. Signal crayfish have populated many habitat types in the UK, each of which may require a different control strategy; hence no single strategy or universal solution is likely to be attainable. Signal crayfish are susceptible to various biocides and microbial pathogens but significant scientific research will be required to develop safe biological control methods and integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to control these invasive organisms. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 81; Correspondence Address: M.

Sediment grab sample results were interpolated to produce a map that showed the area to be dominated by mud (1246 km2, 40%) and sand/shell sediments (780 km2, 25%). A total of 201 taxa were recorded and over 5800 individual specimens were processed, revealing that the sediments hold varying community compositions, with annelids being the dominant group (73%) followed by crustaceans (14%). Relationships were evident between community, feeding guilds, and sediment types, which give an indication of communities that can be expected in similar sediments in other areas of the Tropical Eastern Pacific.

Freshwater bodies which chemistry is dominated by dissolved humic substances (HS) seem to be the major type on Earth, due to huge non-calcareous geological formations in the Northern Hemisphere and in the tropics. Based on the paradigm of the inertness of being organic, direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms are mostly neglected. However, dissolved organic carbon, the majority of which being HS, are natural environmental chemicals and should therefore directly interact with organisms. Major results that widened our perspective on humic substance ecology come from experiments with the compost nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, which behaved contradictorily to textbook knowledge and provoked an in-depth re-consideration of some paradigms. Approach. To overcome old paradigms on HS and their potential interactions with organisms, we reviewed recent international literature, as well as 'grey' literature. We also include results from own ongoing studies. Results. This review focuses on direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms and disregards indirect effects, such as under-water light quenching. Instead we show with some macrophyte and algal species that HS adversely interfere with photosynthesis and growth, whereby closely related algal species show different response patterns. In addition to this, HS suppress cyanobacteria more than eukaryotic algae. Quinones in the HS appear to be the effective structure. Furthermore, HS can modulate the offspring numbers in the nematode C. elegans and cause feminization of fish and amphibians - they possess hormone-like properties. The ecological consequences of this potential remain obscure at present. HS also have the potential to act as chemical attractants as shown with C. elegans and exert a mild chemical stress upon aquatic organisms in many ways: induction of molecular chaperons (stress proteins), induction and modulation of biotransformation and anti-oxidant enzymes. Furthermore, they produce an oxidative stress with lipidperoxidation as one clear symptom or even stress defense strategy. Stronger chemical stresses by HS may even lead to teratogenic effects as shown with fish embryos; all physiological responses to HS-mediated stress require energy, which were compensated on the expense of yolk as shown with zebra fish embryos. One Finnish field survey supports the view of a strong chemical stress, as the weight yield in fish species decreases with increasing HS content in the lakes. Discussion. HS exert a variety of stress symptoms in aquatic and compost organisms. According to current paradigms of ecotoxicology, these symptoms have to be considered adverse, because their compensation consumes energy which is deducted from the main metabolism. However, the nematode C. elegans looks actively for such stressful environments, and this behavior is only understandable in the light of new paradigms of aging mechanisms, particularly the Green Theory of Aging. In this respect, we discuss the mild HS-mediated stress to aquatic and compost organisms. New empirical findings with HS themselves and HS building blocks appear to be consistent with this emerging paradigm and show that the individual lifespan may be expanded. At present the ecological consequences of these findings remain obscure. However, a multiple-stress resistance may be acquired which improves the individual fitness in a fluctuating environment. Conclusions. It appears that dissolved HS have to be considered abiotic ecological driving forces, somewhat less obvious than temperature, nutrients, or light. Perspectives. The understanding of the ecological control by dissolved humic substances is still fragmentary and needs to be studied in more details. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 107; Correspondence Address: C.

Taihu Basin is one of the most developed regions of China. Over the past decades, especially since the reforming and opening-up of China in 1980s, the lake has received more and more pressure from a variety of interlinked human activities, including industrial pollution, fertilizer and pesticide application, eutrophication, overfishing, etc. Water quality has been deteriorating sharply in the lake. In this paper, we made a comprehensive assessment of the environmental and socio-economic issues to affect Taihu Lake ecosystem health. Pollution was identified as the most serious environmental concern. The root causes of these environmental problems are recognized to be diverse, including dense population, high urbanization, heavy industrialization, fast economic development, insufficient sewage treatment, weak public awareness of environment conservation, and lack of institutional capacity and insufficient enforcement through regulations and legislation. On the policy part, past and current policies and measures are reviewed, especially the ""Zero"" discharge action and phosphate ban in detergents in Taihu Basin. In order to mitigate environmental problems, some further policy options have been proposed, including: improving the fishery management; strengthening cross- provincial collaboration; making efforts to reduce flood disaster and increasing investment to new environmental protection technologies.

Catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels in the gills, white muscle and liver were evaluated in fish fed on diets containing 0 or 1.5 mg Se kg- 1 for 8 weeks. In fish treated with a Se-free diet, the MPc exposure increased SOD and CAT activities in all tissues. However, the GPx activity decreased in white muscle and gills whereas no alterations were observed in the liver. MPc also increased GST activity in all tissues with a concurrent decrease in GSH levels. LPO values increased in white muscle and gills and did not change in liver after MPc exposure. A Se-supplemented diet reversed these findings, preventing increases in LPO levels and concurrent decreases in GPx activity in gills and white muscle. Similarly, GSH levels were maintained in all tissue after MPc exposure. These results suggest that dietary Se supplementation protects cells against MPc-induced oxidative stress. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We analysed eggs from African darter, cattle egret, reed cormorant, African sacred ibis, as well as single eggs from some other species, and found HCB, DDTs, HCHs, chlordanes and PCBs at detectable levels. The presence of mirex in all species was unexpected, since this compound was never registered in South Africa. It also seemed as if terrestrial feeding birds had higher DDE:PCB ratios when compared with aquatic feeding birds. Except for chlordane, the African darter eggs had the highest levels of all other compounds (mean 370 and 300 ng g-1 ww Σpesticides and ΣPCBs, respectively). Multivariate analysis clearly distinguished the aquatic and terrestrially feeding birds on pollution profile. The African darter (aquatic feeding) and the cattle egret (terrestrial feeding) would be good indicator candidates. Eggshell thinning was detected in the African darter, and was associated with most of the compounds, including DDE and PCBs. We raise a concern that generally longer living birds in warmer climates, laying fewer eggs per clutch, might be at increased risk when compared with trophically similar birds exposed to equivalent levels of pollution in colder climates. Given the scarcity of water and the high biodiversity in Southern Africa, climate change will exert strong pressure, and any additional anthropogenic contamination at levels that can cause subtle behavioural, developmental and reproductive changes, can have serious effects. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Human exposure to toxaphene is mainly through consumption of contaminated fish, therefore fish-borne residues of toxaphene (cod liver extract, CLE) were prepared by exposing cod to technical toxaphene (TT) for 63 days. UV-irradiated toxaphene (uvT) was included to represent a physico-chemical weathered toxaphene mixture. In vitro, TT, uvT and CLE all showed a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) with a relative potency of CLE > TT = uvT. Tumour promoting potency was further studied in vivo in a medium term two-stage initiation/promotion bioassay in female Sprague-Dawley rats, using an increase in altered hepatic foci positive for glutathione-S-transferase-P (AHF-GST-P) as read out. No increase in AHF-GST-P occurred following exposure to either TT, uvT, or CLE, except for the positive control group (2,3,7,8-TCDD). Based on this study the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for tumour promoting potency is at least 12.5 mg/kg/week, or higher for CLE. Considering current human exposure levels in Europe it is doubtful that consumption of fish at current levels of toxaphene contamination give rise to human health risk. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover direct sunlight irradiation in this area caused pronounced photodegradation. These conditions bring about the distinct fate and distribution of hazardous pollutant transported by surface water into the estuarine. This study elucidates the influence of tropical climate to the behavior of agrochemicals and heavy metals transported into, in and out of Segara Anakan. Segara Anakan is an extremely productive tropical lagoon estuary ecosystem, that plays a critical role in the productivity of the coastal waters and as supporting rich fisheries resource within its boundaries. The study was carried out from July 2003 to March 2004. Diurnal water characteristics showed that water temperature was relatively constant, salinity was influenced by tidal wave inlet from Indian Ocean, but in wet season, the salinity was dominated by fresh water inflow at high velocity from rivers surrounding Segara Anakan estuary. The most dominating characteristic in this ecosystem was the amount of rainfall. Based on the observed rainfall data, the condition was differentiated in: dry season from July to September 2003, changing period from dry season to wet season considered as early wet season, from October to November2003, wet season from December 2003 to March 2004, and changing period from wet season to dry season considered as late wet season, from April to May 2004. The texture of newly sediment deposited in Segara Anakan, i.e. the upper (5 cm) layer, changes with season, indicating of different sediment origin. During the dry season, the salinity was high, causing nutrients, micropollutants such as organochlorine pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and heavy metals bonded or sorbed into the sediments. Sorption-desorption processes between upper layer sedimen and water was clearly showed in heavy metals capable in chlorocomplex forming i.e. Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg.. In dry season their bioavailability increases, therefore they could be determined in Geloina spp and Mugil spp. Due to its lipophylicity, in saline water organochlorines are bioaccumulated in lipid rich tissues, causing higher level in Mugil spp. than in Geloina spp. In case of PAH, due to the limited capability to metabolize PAHs, higher bio-accumulation factor of the carcinogenic benzo(a)pyrene were observed in Geloina spp. During the wet season fresh water inflow at high velocity bringing run-off material into the estuary and decreases its salinity, increases the total suspended solids, similarly the turbidity, causing plankton diversity and density to decrease. Further, the washing out of micro pollutant by suspended solid transportation was established. The trace metals, Cu, Ni, Zn, Cr in sediment were determined at lower level than in 1994. Compared to the measurements of OCs in Mugil sp. at 1994, the level of OCs in this study are lower. Owing to the complex interaction of ecological and physicochemical parameters, socialeconomic level and food habit of local people, it is difficult to draw a general policy for food safety concerning heavy metal level in seafood of Segara Anakan, however, concerning the organochlorine level, the seafood of Segara Anakan are safe to consume. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In recent years, a widespread concern about the increasing number of poisoning incidents that have occurred in pets, birds, and wild animals are registered. Poisoning cases have also been encountered in large animals. This chapter describes the toxicity of metaldehyde and its metabolites in mammalian and avian species. Metaldehyde is toxic to all animals. Secondary poisoning is also not uncommon. It is highly toxic by inhalation, moderately toxic by ingestion, and slightly toxic by dermal absorption. Ingestion is the most common route of poisoning. Most of the time, metaldehyde poisoning is acute in nature and results from accidental or malicious activity. The poisoning is characterized by neurological signs such as violent convulsions and seizures. Without timely and aggressive treatment, death ensues due to respiratory failure. Because no specific antidote is available, treatment relies upon supportive and symptomatic therapies. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet little attention has been directed at the messages people are receiving from fish consumption advisories. This study examines knowledge about the benefits and risks of fish in relation to ethnicity and the degree of knowledge in a general university population in New Jersey. Subjects were asked open-ended questions about risks and benefits and responses were grouped into categories. A far greater percent of people had heard something about the risks and benefits of eating fish than could report specific information about the risks or benefits. While only 16% of subjects did not know what the benefits of eating fish were, 62% did not have any specific information about why there were warnings. However, for people who had some specific information, a higher proportion (57%) could identify the chemicals (PCBs, mercury) causing the risks, than could identify omega-3 fatty acids as contributing to benefits (40%). Much of the knowledge was very general, such as eating fish is ""good for the heart"", ""good for you"", or ""brain food"". Less than half of the subjects could name species of fish that were either high or low in contaminants. There were ethnic disparities in knowledge about both the benefits and the risks from fish consumption. A higher percentage of whites knew about both the benefits and risks of fish consumption than others; Asians knew the least about the risks, and blacks and hispanics knew the least about the benefits. There were also ethnic differences in ability to name fish that are low in contaminants, or high in contaminants. Minorities, particularly hispanics, were unable to list species that are high in contaminants. We identified three levels of knowledge about fish consumption: 1) whether people are aware of the risks or benefits of fish consumption, 2) whether they have any specific knowledge about the benefits or risks from fish consumption, and 3) whether that knowledge is correct. We suggest that for people to make informed decisions about whether to eat fish, and what fish to eat (amount, fish size, species), they must have knowledge at all three levels about both the risks and benefits. Although agencies such as FDA are concerned that the public will be confused by advisory details, we find that the lack of details is a major component of ineffective communication. To provide the public with sufficient information to make sound risk decisions, public agencies and the media have to provide clearer, more directed messages dealing with the basis for making risk decisions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Several good laboratory practice (GLP) inspections were conducted during the Tier 1 atrazine amphibian study entitled ""Response of larval Xenopus laevis to atrazine exposure: assessment of metamorphosis and gonadal morphology"". These inspections were conducted on each of the in-life (Phase 1) test facilities (TF), i.e., Wildlife International (WLI) Ltd. (Easton, Md, USA) and the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) (Berlin, Germany). All of the inspections were conducted in conjunction with the EPA GLP monitoring authority (MA), the Office of Enforcement, Compliance and Assurance (OECA) as well as auditors from the regulatory authority (RA) Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP). The inspection of the German facility also included representatives of the German equivalent of OECA. In Phase II of the Tier 1 study, tissue samples collected by both IGB and WLI during Phase I were prepared for histology and reviewed by a veterinary pathologist at the Experimental Pathology Laboratory (Vienna, Virginia, USA). The cooperation between the MA, RA and the TF allowed OPP to ensure the GLP principles were being followed as well as allowing everyone involved to bring up some higher level science issues associated with the study execution.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: B.

In this pursuit, India has recently embarked upon a highly innovative programme for disseminating the portfolio of services emanating from the space systems, as well as other Information Technology (IT) tools, directly down-the-line to the rural communities, through a 'single window', - the Village Resource Centres (VRCs). The VRCs, at their minimal, are characterized by: (i) digital connectivity for videoconferencing and information transfer, linking them with knowledge centers and specialty hospitals, enabled through the INSAT satellite; (ii) repository of spatial information on natural resources generated using the 1RS data; (iii) host of information pertaining to management of natural resources and socio-economic relevance; and (iv) limited facilities for primary healthcare services and distance learning. With the participation of stakeholders, the VRCs are also catalyzing rural entrepreneurship, and facilitating e-Governance and other services of social relevance. The VRCs, essentially being a 'Community Resource', are being implemented in partnership with Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) working at the grassroots. The portfolio of services delivered by the VRCs include: tele-education - focusing on vocational training in support of alternate livelihood, supplementary teaching to rural children, non-formal and adult education; tele-healthcare - focusing on preventive and curative healthcare at primary level; information on land and water resources derived from high-resolution 1RS images - for better management of the land resources; interactive advisories to villagers - wherein experts at knowledge centers discuss with them on cropping systems, optimization of agricultural inputs (seeds, water, fertilizer, insecticides, pesticides, etc.), producer-oriented marketing opportunities, crop insurance, etc; tele-fishery - providing satellite derived information and advisories on Potential Fishing Zones (PFZ) in those VRCs located in coastal tracts; e-Governance -information and guidance to local people on village-oriented governmental schemes on agriculture, poverty alleviation, rural employment, social safety nets and other basic entitlements, animal husbandry and livestock related, micro-finance related, etc; and local weather and agro-meteorology advisory. Over 200 VRCs set up across different regions of the country are already benefiting over a million people on a dayto-day basis. The VRCs are also being populated across all the rural/ semi-urban tracts in India. The VRCs are found to be a unique means of integrating the Satellite Communication and Earth Observation technologies in reaching out to the grassroots in a timely and cost effective manner. Further, the leanings from this effort would also be useful in refining the space systems themselves and development of newer applications for the benefit of the society. The paper while highlighting the programmatic focus of VRCs also places emphasis on sustainability of such efforts in the long run, their ownerships from intermediary to stakeholders themselves and their increasing roles in globalized world for the access and outreach to community needs and aspirations.

Algae are considered less dangerous than cyanobacteria, because even if they can proliferate quite intensively in eutrophic fresh waters, they rarely accumulate to form dense surface blooms like blue-green algae do. Thus the toxins they produce do no accumulate to levels high enough to become hazardous to human and animals health. Cyanobacteria: both planktonic and benthic species, can instead form huge agglomeration close to the shore, which can become very dense and concentrated. This material can take a long time to disperse and so become a risk for human health and mainly for animals, which can easely enter in contact with poisoned water. Lots of blue-green algae species have been found to produce toxins, and some authors assume that it could be prudent to assume that any cyanobacterial population can have a toxic potential. At present known toxins are classified as neurotoxins (anatoxin-a, anatoxina(s) and saxitoxin), cytotoxin or cylindrospermopsin and microcystins or nodularins. Anyway, starting from existing studies, it seems likely that other unidentified toxins exists. Neurotoxins: act by blocking neuronal signal transmission with two main mechanisms: anatoxins act as acetylcholine mimic (anatoxin-a) or as cholinesterase inhibitor (anatoxin-a (s)), causing an organophosphate like syndrome, while saxitoxin acts by blocking the sodium channel, thus disrupting sodium balance into nerve cells. Despite their high toxicity, their only occasionally are responsible of human intoxication, while neurotoxicity may be experienced by livestock and pets, that can drink polluted water or ingest scum material. Cytotoxin: is an alkaloid that blocks protein synthesis by binding to DNA or RNA. It's responsible for cytogenetic damages via DNA strand breaks and loss of whole chromosomes (aneuploidy) and has proved to be potentially carcinogenetic. Finally, it was found that cylindrospermopsin toxicity is associated with significant losses of glutathione and depletion of glutathione results in cell death. The fall in glutathione levels is due to an inhibition of the final common pathway of glutathione synthesis, and this in turn contributes to cylindrospermopsin cytotoxicity, as lower cell glutathione levels predispose to cylindrospermopsin toxicity. Numerous reports involving the poisoning of farm and wild animals following drinking water from lakes and ponds containing surface scum from cyanobacterial blooms exist, most have been documented in Australia. Australia was also interested by human poisoning episodes via drinking water, with patients escaping death only through skilled and intensive hospital care. Microcystins: are the most frequently occurring and widespread of the cyanotoxins; they act by blocking protein phosphatases 1 and 2a, causing toxicity at the hepatic level, as they use bile carrier to pass through cell membranes. Microcystins toxicity is greater after intraperitoneal injection, but also intranasal exposure showed high toxicity, being this uptake route relevant for water sports activities (i.e. waterskiing). Nodularins toxicity has shown to be cumulative, as a single oral dose resulted in no hepatic damage, while the same dose applied daily over several days caused hepatic injury. Microcystins have also shown to be tumor-promoting agents, as they can increase the incidence of hepatic tumors in human too. Concerning Fresh Water Algae: their toxicity is considerably lower than that of cyanobacteria, because algae do not have effective mechanism of accumulation and the toxic potency of their toxins is several order of magnitude lower than that of cyanotoxins. Available data reports about dinoflagellates within or related to the Peridinium genus as potential producers of toxins (ichtyotoxins). Ichtyotoxins caused fish kills and have shown to have an algicidal effect on the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa. It is possible that toxic blooms of dinoflagellates in freshwater occur more frequently than reported and that they affect the biota in those habitats. Toxins production is considered as a defensive strategy for dinoflagellates from fish larvae preying. In human some allergic reaction has been reported after Uroglena spp. and Gonyostomum semen exposure, but clear toxic episode was reported. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: A.

This level of reduction appears to be economically unsatisfactory. However, the infestation data collected over the 4-year period indicated a parallel and significant decrease in bud infestation in the conventional field also, suggesting that the pheromone puffers affected APM populations beyond the borders of the intended field.

Scott Center for Neuroscience, Mind and Behavior, Department of Biological Sciences, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH 43403, United States","Previous research suggests that agricultural herbicides interfere with olfactory-mediated behavior, such as responses to alarm signals and the ability to locate food, in aquatic organisms. In crayfish, aggressive interactions are also mediated by chemical signals. These social signals are important in establishing dominance, which in turn has an impact on an individual's ability to find and use mates, food, and habitat space. In this study, we investigated the impact of exposure to sublethal levels of the herbicide metolachlor on the ability of crayfish to respond to olfactory signals used in agonistic behaviors. Crayfish were exposed to three different environmentally relevant concentrations (60 ppb, 70 ppb, and 80 ppb) of metolachlor for 96 hours. Each exposed crayfish was then placed in a fight arena and was allowed to interact with a naïve, untreated crayfish for 15 minutes. We analyzed several characteristics of fighting behavior, including initial aggressiveness, time to fight, intensity levels, duration, number of encounters, and the winner and loser of each fight. Crayfish exposed to 80 ppb metolachlor were less likely to initiate and win encounters against naïve conspecifics than any other treatment group. Analysis of fight dynamics shows that metolachlor does not alter the temporal fighting dynamics within crayfish aggression. We conclude that high sublethal concentrations of metolachlor may be interfering with the ability of crayfish to receive or respond to social signals and thus affect certain agonistic behaviors. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Export Date: 01 March 2024; Cited By: 53; Correspondence Address: P.

The effects of biofouling include increased drag and fuel consumption, delayed transports times, higher cleaning costs, more frequent dry docking cycles and the translocation of invasive marine species. The effective control of fouling is therefore crucial to minimise the costs to the shipping industry and to mitigate the spread of invasive species. Previously the control of fouling was predominately based on heavy metals and pesticides. There is now a wide recognition that non-toxic alternatives are required to minimise the impact to non-target marine species. In this study natural antifouling systems are investigated. The surface of the blue mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, is used as a model to determine what characterises a fouling resistant surface. Microtextured ripples (1-2 μm) were discovered on the surface of the blue mussel, which correlated to low fouling cover. The surface features of 36 other species of shellfish were characterised and a variety of microtopographies were discovered. The surface roughness properties of these shell surfaces correlated to fouling resistance and removal. When the microtopographies of selected shell surfaces were mimicked, those surfaces that provided fewer attachment points reduced the settlement of a wide range of fouling organisms. Extracts derived from the surface of the blue mussel have also been successful in deterring the attachment of certain microfoulers. Other novel non-toxic solutions to control biofouling are presented including extreme wettabilities and foul-release surfaces.

We found a similar, but not as significant, trend between treatment (r = -0.45) and control (r = -0.82) male fish. Measures of fish condition showed no significant differences between male or female fish housed in effluent or clean water. Inter-sex condition did not occur and testicular and ovarian cells appeared normal for the respective developmental stage and we observed no morphological alteration in fish.
